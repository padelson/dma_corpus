ARTICLE IV 

   

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 

   

 4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of any capital stock of the Company or Merger Sub: 

  

 (a) _Company Share Merger Consideration_. Each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than (i) Company Shares that are owned by Parent or Merger Sub or by the Company or its Subsidiaries and in each case not held on behalf of third parties and (ii) Company Shares that are owned by stockholders (A) who have not voted such Company Shares in favor of the Merger or consented to the Merger in writing pursuant to Section 1073 of the OGCA and (B) who have otherwise taken all of the actions required by Section 1091 of the OGCA to properly exercise and perfect such stockholders appraisal rights with respect to such Company Shares (" _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") (each Company Share referred to in the foregoing clause (i) or (ii) being an " _Excluded Company Share_ " and, collectively, " _Excluded Company Shares_ "), shall be converted into the right to receive $13.00 in cash per Company Share (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and (i) each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly representing any of such Company Shares (other than Excluded Company Shares) and (ii) each uncertificated Company Share (an " _Uncertificated Company Share_ ") registered to a holder on the stock transfer books of the Company (other than Excluded Company Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, and each certificate formerly representing Company Shares owned by Dissenting Stockholders shall thereafter only represent the right to receive the payment to which reference is made in Section 4.2(g). 

  

 (b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Company Share (other than such Excluded Company Shares that are owned by the Subsidiaries of the Company or of Parent which such Excluded Company Shares shall remain outstanding and unaffected by the Merger) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, no longer be outstanding, shall be automatically cancelled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to any rights the holder thereof may have under Section 4.2(g). 

  

 (c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (d) _Series F Preferred_. Each share of Series F Preferred issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, shall remain outstanding as one share of Series F Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Surviving Corporation having the same powers, preferences and relative participating rights, optional or other special rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereon, as such share of Series F Preferred has immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the terms of the Series F Preferred. 

   ##### 

  

  

 4.2. _Exchange of Certificates for Shares_. 

  

 (a) _Paying Agent_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Company Shares (other than Excluded Company Shares), a cash amount approximately equal to the amount necessary for the Paying Agent to pay the Merger Consideration in respect of Company Shares, other than Excluded Company Shares (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). 

  

 (b) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail transmittal materials (to be reasonably agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to the Effective Time) to each holder of record as of the Effective Time of Company Shares (other than Excluded Company Shares) represented by Certificates. Such transmittal materials shall advise the holders of such Company Shares of the effectiveness of the Merger and the procedure for surrendering the Certificates to the Paying Agent. Upon the surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of the transmittal materials, the holder of the Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange, and in respect of, such Certificate a cash amount (after giving effect to any Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(h)) equal to (x) the number of Company Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued and/or paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Company Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. 

  

 For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or nature. 

  

 (c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of Company Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered, at Parents option, to Parent. Any stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(h)) upon due surrender of their Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any 

   ##### 

  

    

other Person shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly delivered
to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws. 

  

 (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting by such Person of a bond in the form customarily required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount (after giving effect to any Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(h)) equal to the number of Company Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (f) _Uncertificated Company Shares_. Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to (i) issue to each holder of Uncertificated Company Shares a check in the amount equal to (after giving effect to any Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(h)) (x) the number of Uncertificated Company Shares held by such holder multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration and (ii) mail to each such holder materials (to be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company prior to the Effective Time) advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and the conversion of their Company Shares into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (g) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Company Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a stockholder who has not voted such shares in favor of the Merger or consented to the Merger in writing pursuant to Section 1073 of the OGCA and who has otherwise taken all of the actions required by Section 1091 of the OGCA to properly exercise and perfect such stockholders appraisal rights (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall be deemed to have ceased to represent any interest in the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time and shall be entitled to those rights and remedies set forth in Section 1091 of the OGCA; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in the event that a stockholder of the Company fails to perfect, waives, withdraws or otherwise loses any such right or remedy granted by the OGCA, the Dissenting Shares held by such stockholder shall be converted into and represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration specified in this Agreement without interest. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for payment for the Dissenting Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company with respect to stockholders appraisal rights and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle any such demands. Merger Sub (or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) shall be responsible for all payments with respect to the Dissenting Shares, including all reasonable expenses associated with any negotiations and proceedings with respect to any demands for appraisal under the OGCA. 

  

 (h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or 

   ##### 

  

    

Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to the applicable
Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case
may be. 

  

 (i) _No Further Dividends_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate. 

  

 4.3. _Adjustment to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that prior to the Effective Time there is a change in the number of Company Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Company Shares issued and outstanding as a result of a distribution, reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer or other similar transactions, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to eliminate the effects of such event on the Merger Consideration. 

  

 4.4. _Company Stock Based Plans_. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Company Shares (a " _Company Option_ ") under the Company Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder thereof to receive, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to (i) the product of (x) the total number of Company Shares subject to the Company Option (whether vested or unvested) immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share under such Company Option, less (ii) the amount of any applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. 

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, each restricted Company Share reserved for issuance under the Company Stock Plans (the " _Company Restricted Share_ "), shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder thereof to receive, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to (i) the product of (x) the number of Company Shares subject to such Company Restricted Share immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Merger Consideration, less (ii) the amount of any applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. 

  

 (c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company and the compensation committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, as applicable, shall take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 4.4, including causing the Company to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the acknowledgements of all holders of Company Options (provided that the Company shall obtain acknowledgements from all directors of the Company) to the treatment under this Section 4.4. Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver Company Shares or other capital stock of the Company to 

   ##### 

  

    

any Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company Options or Company
Restricted Shares after the Effective Time.

The Company maintains internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes policies and procedures that (A) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, (B) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company, and (C) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.

Each Company Compensation and Benefit Plan which is subject to ERISA (an " _ERISA Plan_ ") that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a " _Pension Plan_ ") intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") covering all Tax Law changes prior to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 or has applied to the IRS for such favorable determination letter within the applicable remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code, and the Companys executive officers are not aware of any circumstances that could reasonably be expected to result in the loss of the qualification of such plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any ERISA Plan that would subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to a Tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or reasonably expects to incur a Tax or penalty imposed by Section 4980F of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or any liability under Section 4071 of ERISA. 

   

 (iii) Neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any entity which is considered one employer with the Company under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an " _ERISA Affiliate_ ") (x) maintains or contributes to or has within the past six years maintained or contributed to a Pension Plan that is subject to Subtitles C or D of Title IV of ERISA or (y) maintains or has an obligation to contribute to or has within the past six years maintained or had an obligation to contribute to a multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA. No notices have been required to be sent to participants and beneficiaries or the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation under Section 302 or 4011 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. 

   

 (iv) All contributions required to be made under each Company Compensation and Benefit Plan as of the date of this Agreement have been timely made and all obligations in respect of each Company Compensation and Benefit Plan have been properly accrued and reflected on the most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the Company Reports prior to the date of this Agreement to the extent required by GAAP. Neither any Pension Plans nor any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding funding waiver. Neither any Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate has been required to file information 

   ##### 

  

    

pursuant to Section 4010 of ERISA for the current or most recently completed
plan year. The Companys executive officers do not reasonably expect that
required minimum contributions to any Pension Plan under Section 412 of the
Code will be materially increased by application of Section 412(l) of the
Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is
required to provide, security to any Pension Plan or to any single-employer
plan of any ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code. 

   

 (v) There is no material pending or, to the knowledge of the Companys executive officers threatened, litigation relating to the Company Compensation and Benefit Plans. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries have any obligations for retiree health and life benefits under any ERISA Plan or collective bargaining agreement. The Company or its Subsidiaries may amend or terminate any such plan at any time without incurring any liability thereunder other than in respect of claims incurred prior to such amendment or termination. 

   

 (vi) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage under, any Company Compensation and Benefit Plan that would increase materially the expense of maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for the most recent fiscal year. Neither the execution of this Agreement, stockholder adoption of this Agreement, receipt of approval or clearance from any one or more Governmental Entities of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (A) entitle any employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date of this Agreement; (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or result in any other material obligation pursuant to, any of the Company Compensation and Benefit Plans; (C) limit or restrict the right of the Company, or, after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent, to merge, amend or terminate any of the Company Compensation and Benefit Plans, or (D) result in payments under any of the Company Compensation and Benefit Plans which would not be deductible under Section 162(m). 

   

 (vii) All Company Compensation and Benefit Plans that are "nonqualified deferred compensation plans" (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) have been operated in good faith compliance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and any regulations or other guidance issued thereunder. 

   

 (viii) Each Company Option (A) was granted in compliance with all applicable Laws and all of the terms and conditions of the Stock Plans pursuant to which it was issued, (B) has an exercise price per Company Share equal to or greater than the fair market value of a Company Share at the close of business on the date of such grant, (C) has a grant date identical to the date on which the Companys Board of Directors or compensation committee actually awarded such Company Option, and (D) qualifies for

the tax and accounting treatment afforded to such Company Option in the
Companys tax returns and the Companys financial statements, respectively.

To the knowledge of the Companys executive officers, no investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct the same, except for those the outcome of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Companys executive officers, no change is required in the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries processes, properties or procedures in connection with any such Laws, and the Company has not received any written notice or communication from any Governmental Entity of any noncompliance with any such Laws that has not been cured as of the date of this Agreement, except for such changes and noncompliance that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has obtained and is in substantial compliance with all permits, licenses, certifications, approvals, registrations, consents, authorizations, franchises, concessions, variances, exemptions and orders issued or granted by a Governmental Entity (collectively, " _Licenses_ "), required to be issued to or held by the Company and its Subsidiaries in order to allow them to conduct their respective businesses as currently conducted and all such Licenses are in full force and effect, except where the failure to possess any such License or the failure of any such License to be in full force and effect or failure to be in compliance with any such License, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The representations and warranties set forth in this Section 5.1(i)(i) do not address, and shall not be deemed to address, any employee benefits, environmental or Tax matters, including compliance with ERISA, Environmental Laws or Tax Laws. 

   

 (ii) Section 5.1(i)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and complete list, as of the date of this Agreement, of (A) all Licenses issued or granted to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by the FCC (" _FCC Licenses_ "), and all Licenses issued or granted to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by public utility commissions regulating telecommunications businesses (" _State Licenses_ " and collectively with the FCC Licenses, the " _Communications Licenses_ "); (B) all pending applications for Licenses that would be Licenses if issued or granted; and (C) all pending applications by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for modification, extension or renewal of any License. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with its obligations under each of the FCC Licenses and the rules and regulations of the FCC, and with its obligations under each of the State Licenses, except for such failures to be in compliance with Communications Licenses as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Companys executive officers, there is not pending or threatened before the FCC, the

the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. 

   

 (iii) All of the currently operating cell sites and microwave paths of the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of which a filing with the FCC was required have been constructed and are currently operated in all respects as represented to the FCC in currently effective filings, and modifications to such cell sites and microwave paths have been preceded by the submission to the FCC of all required filings, in each case, except for such failures as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

that the Board of Directors of the Company

its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action is reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under Oklahoma
Law. 

   

 (b) _Definition_. For purposes of this Agreement: 

   

 " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal or offer with respect to a merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, spin-off, extraordinary dividend, share exchange, business combination or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than any such transaction that is permitted by Sections 6.1(a)(ii) or 6.1(a)(viii)) or (ii) any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, 25% or more of any class of the Companys equity securities or those of any of its Subsidiaries or 25% or more of the consolidated total assets (including equity securities of its Subsidiaries) of the Company, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 " _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal involving all or substantially all of the assets (on a consolidated basis) of the Company and its Subsidiaries or the total voting power of the equity securities of the Company that the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in its good faith judgment, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, and taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal, would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into account any revisions to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent in accordance with Section 6.2(f)).

confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf
of it or any of its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (e) _Notice_. The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) notify Parent if any inquiries, proposals or offers which would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal are received by the Company or its Representatives or if any inquiry or request for non-public information is made to, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of the Person making such inquiries, proposals, offers or request and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements). 

   

 (f) _Acceptance of Superior Proposal_. If the Company receives a Superior Proposal and the Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that accepting such Superior Proposal and terminating this Agreement is required in order to comply with the Companys directors fiduciary duties under Oklahoma Law, the Companys Board of Directors may, in response to such a Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(b), _provided_ that the Companys Board of Directors shall not terminate this Agreement unless and until (i) the Company has given Parent five calendar days prior written notice of its intention to terminate this Agreement to enter into a transaction contemplated by a Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal and shall contemporaneously provide Parent with a copy of the most current written draft agreements and ancillary documents with the Person making such Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any material revision to such Superior Proposal shall require a new five calendar days prior written notice to Parent from the Company) and (ii) the Company shall, and shall cause its financial advisors and legal counsel to, negotiate with Parent and its representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to attempt to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal and the Companys Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith any proposed changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent.

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) The Company and Parent each agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it or its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Information Statement will, at the time the Information Statement is mailed to the stockholders of the Company, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company and Parent will cause the Information Statement to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. 

  

 6.4. _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_. 

  

 (a) Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each other and use, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and any Persons of which it is a Subsidiary to use, their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable (it being understood that nothing contained in this Agreement shall require Parent to obtain any consents, approvals, permits or authorizations prior to the Termination Date), including (i) preparing and filing as promptly as reasonably practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings (including by filing no later than 30 days after the date hereof, all applications required to be filed with the FCC and the notification and required form under the HSR Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to file within such 30 day period will not constitute a breach of this Agreement so long as the filing is made as promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter); (ii) subject to the foregoing, obtaining as promptly as reasonably practicable all consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii) defending any lawsuits or other judicial proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger, including seeking to avoid the entry of, or to have reversed, terminated or vacated, any stay or other injunctive relief entered by any court or other Governmental Entity.

   ##### 

  

    

expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse
effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries at or following the Effective Time (it
being understood that, for this purpose, materiality shall be considered by
reference to the financial condition, properties, assets, liabilities,
business or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, rather than that of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole) (a " _Regulatory Material Adverse Effect_ "). For purposes of
determining whether a Regulatory Material Adverse Effect would reasonably be
expected to occur, (A) both positive and negative effects of any
such actions, restrictions and conditions, including any sale, divestiture,
licensing, lease or disposition, shall be taken into account and (B) any loss
of synergies anticipated from the Merger as a result of such actions,
restrictions or conditions, including any sale, divestiture, licensing, lease

to obtaining any consents, registrations, approvals, permits or
authorizations in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the prior written consent of Parent, which, with respect
to the Company and its Subsidiaries, shall not be unreasonably (taking into
account the other provisions of this Section 6.4(a)) withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable each will consult the other on, all of the
information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including the Information Statement). To the extent
permitted by Law, each party shall provide the other with copies of all
correspondence between it (or its advisors) and any Governmental Entity
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, to the
extent reasonably practicable, all telephone calls and meetings with a
Governmental Entity regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall include representatives of Parent and the Company. In exercising the
foregoing rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable.

 (d) The Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notice or other written communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any

Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Upon reasonable notice, and except as may otherwise be prohibited by applicable Law, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parents representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its properties, books, contracts and records and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Parent and Parents representative, all information concerning its or any of its Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request, _provided_ that no investigation pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company hereunder; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall not require the Company to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if the Company shall have used reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure. All requests for information made pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall be directed to an executive officer of the Company or such Person as may be designated by any such executive officer, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to afford Parent or its representatives any access to any properties, books contracts, commitments, personnel or records relating to, or in respect of, any forward product plans, product specific cost information, pricing information, customer specific information, merchandising information or other similar competitively sensitive information.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to any participant under the Companys 2007 executive incentive bonus plan whose employment is terminated without cause as of or after the Effective Time a pro rata bonus payment thereunder which (i) assumes that all subjective and individual performance criteria of such participant have been 100% satisfied and (ii) with respect to any objective Company performance criteria applicable to such participant compares the actual performance of the Company for 2007 through the end of the month prior to the employment termination date against the Company budget targets for those applicable objective Company criteria levels for such periods.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, service and other amounts shall not be credited to Company Employees or their eligible dependents to the extent the crediting of such service or other amounts would result in the duplication of benefits. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 6.8 shall (A) be treated as an amendment of any particular Company Compensation and Benefit Plan, (B) give any third party any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 6.8 or (C) obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to (x) maintain any particular Company Compensation and Benefit Plan or (y) retain the employment of any particular employee.

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and each Person who served at the request of the Company as a director, officer, trustee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or other enterprise (when acting in such capacity) determined as of the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or amounts paid in settlement (collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, provided the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification). The indemnification rights hereunder shall be in addition to any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or under the Laws of the jurisdiction of organization of the Surviving Corporation. The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor, provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those set forth in the Companys certificate of incorporation and by-laws as of the date of this Agreement, which (subject to Section 6.10(d)) shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any of the Indemnified Parties. 

  

 (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 6.10(a), upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent and the Surviving Corporation thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent that such failure does not actually prejudice Parent or the Surviving Corporation. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall jointly and severally pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (b) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all 

    ##### 

 

  

Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction, (ii) the Indemnified Parties shall
cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and (iii) Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
their prior written consent. 

   

 (c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, maintain a policy of officers and directors liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") for acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time with coverage in amount and scope at least as favorable as the Companys DandO Policies; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the existing DandO Policies expire, are terminated or cancelled, or if the annual premium therefor is increased to an amount in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (such amount, as stated in Section 6.10(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the " _Current Premium_ "), in each case during such six year period, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain DandO Insurance in an amount and scope as great as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for a premium not in excess (on an annualized basis) of 300% of the Current Premium; and _provided_ , _further_ , that in lieu of such coverage, Parent may substitute a prepaid "tail" policy for such coverage, which it may cause the Company to obtain effective immediately prior to the Closing. 

  

 (d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.10. 

  

 (e) The provisions of this Section 6.10 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their representatives. No release executed by an Indemnified Party in connection with his or her departure from the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a release or waiver of any of the indemnity or other rights provided such Indemnified Party in this Section 6.10, unless the release or waiver of the provisions of this Section 6.10 is expressly provided in such release. 

  

 6.11. _Regulatory Compliance_. 

  

 (a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cure no later than the Effective Time any violations and defaults by any of them under any applicable rules and regulations of the FCC (" _FCC Rules_ ") and the FAA Rules, (ii) substantially comply with the terms of the FCC Licenses and the FAA Rules, (iii) file or cause to be filed with the FCC and the FAA all reports and other filings required to be filed under applicable FCC Rules and FAA Rules and (iv) take all reasonable actions requested in writing by Parent on or before the Closing Date (provided that no such action shall be required if it would require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take or refrain from taking any action or to agree to any restriction or condition with respect to any of their respective assets or operations, in each case that would take effect prior to the Effective Time) for each of them to be in compliance upon the consummation of the Closing with the provisions of Sections 271 and 

   ##### 

  

 

272 of the Communications Act (including any orders issued by the FCC
interpreting or implementing such provisions). Parent agrees that if this
Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3, it shall
promptly thereafter reimburse the Company for any reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Company following incurrence and delivery of
reasonable documents by the Company at the direction of Parent pursuant to
clause (iv) of this Section 6.11(a). 

   

 (b) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts to (i) take all actions reasonably necessary to maintain and preserve the Licenses and (ii) refrain from taking any action that would give the FCC or any other Governmental Entities with jurisdiction over the Company or any of its Subsidiaries reasonable grounds to institute proceedings for the suspension, revocation or adverse modification of any Licenses, except in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) where the failure to take such action, or the taking of such action, as the case may be, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 6.12. _Takeover Statute_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and its Board of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise use reasonable best efforts to act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions. 

  

 6.13. _700 MHz Auction_. The Company shall concurrently with the execution of this Agreement enter into a bidding agreement with Parent in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A.

 6.16. _Treatment of Certain Notes_. 

  

 (a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their respective reasonable best efforts to commence, promptly after the receipt of a written request from Parent to do so and the receipt of the Offer Documents from Parent, offers to purchase, and any related consent solicitations with respect to, any indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indebtedness_ ") on the terms and conditions specified by Parent (collectively, 

   ##### 

  

    

the " _Debt Offers_ "), and Parent shall assist the Company in connection
therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the closing of the Debt Offers
shall be conditioned on the completion of the Merger and otherwise in
compliance with applicable Laws and SEC rules and regulations. The Company
shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause their respective representatives to,
provide cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the
Debt Offers. With respect to any series of Indebtedness, if requested by
Parent in writing, in lieu of commencing a Debt Offer for such series (or in
addition thereto), the Company shall, to the extent permitted by the indenture
and officers certificates or supplemental indenture governing such series of
Indebtedness (i) issue a notice of optional redemption for all of the
outstanding principal amount of Indebtedness of such series pursuant to the
requisite provisions of the indenture and officers certificate governing
such series of Indebtedness or (ii) take actions reasonably requested by
Parent that are reasonably necessary for the satisfaction and/or discharge
and/or defeasance of such series pursuant to the applicable provisions of the
indenture and officers certificate or supplemental indenture governing such
series of Indebtedness, and shall redeem or satisfy and/or discharge
and/or defeasance, as applicable, such series in accordance with the terms of
the indenture and officers certificate or supplemental indenture governing
such series of Indebtedness at the Effective Time,  _provided_ that to the
extent that any action described in clause (i) or (ii) can be conditioned on
the occurrence of the Effective Time, it will be so conditioned, and 
_provided_ , _further_ , that prior to the Company being required to take any
of the actions described in clause (i) or (ii) above that cannot be
conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective Time, prior to the Closing,
Parent shall irrevocably deposit, or shall cause to be irrevocably deposited
with the trustee under the relevant indenture governing such series
of Indebtedness sufficient funds to effect such redemption or satisfaction or
discharge. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, waive any
of the conditions to the Debt Offers (other than that the Merger shall have
been consummated and that there shall be no Law prohibiting consummation of
the Debt Offers) as may be reasonably requested by Parent and shall not,
without the written consent of Parent, waive any condition to the Debt Offers
or make any changes to the Debt Offers other than as agreed between Parent
and the Company. 

  

 (b) The Company covenants and agrees that, promptly following any consent solicitation expiration date, assuming the requisite consents are received, each of the Company and its applicable Subsidiaries as is necessary shall (and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the applicable trustee to) execute supplemental indentures to the indentures governing each series of Indebtedness for which the requisite consent has been received, which supplemental indentures shall implement the amendments described in the offer to purchase, related letter of transmittal, and other related documents (collectively, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and shall become operative only concurrently with the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the conditions to the Debt Offers). Concurrent with the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to accept for payment and thereafter promptly pay for any Indebtedness that has been properly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Debt Offers and in accordance with the Debt Offers using funds provided by or at the direction of Parent. 

  

 (c) Parent shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in connection with the Debt Offers, including the Offer Documents. Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with each other in the preparation of 

   ##### 

  

    

the Offer Documents. The Offer Documents (including all amendments or
supplements) and all mailings to the holders of Indebtedness in connection
with the Debt Offers shall be subject to the prior review of, and comment by,
the Company and its legal counsel. If at any time prior to the completion of
the Debt Offers any information in the Offer Documents should be discovered by
the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other,
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer
Documents, so that the Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly
notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement prepared
by Parent describing such information shall be disseminated by or on behalf
of the Company or its Subsidiaries to the holders of the applicable
Indebtedness (which supplement or amendment and dissemination may, at the
reasonable direction of Parent, take the form of a filing of a Current Report
on Form 8-K). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
6.16(c), the Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to comply with
the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
applicable Law to the extent such laws are applicable in connection with the
Debt Offers and such compliance will not be deemed a breach hereof. 

  

 (d) In connection with the Debt Offers, Parent may select one or more dealer managers, information agents, depositaries and other agents, in each case as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, to provide assistance in connection therewith and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enter into customary agreements (including indemnities) with such parties so selected. Parent shall pay the fees and out-of pocket expenses of any dealer manager, information agent, depositary or other agent retained in connection with the Debt Offers upon the incurrence of such fees and out-of-pocket expenses, and Parent further agrees to reimburse the Company and their Subsidiaries for all of their reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with the Debt Offers. 

  

 6.17. _Series F Preferred_. At least fifty days prior to the Effective Time, but not prior to August 20, 2007, the Company shall mail a notice of redemption to each holder of shares of the Series F Preferred in accordance with the terms of the certificate of designation of the Series F Preferred (the " _Redemption Notice_ "). The Redemption Notice shall specify that all shares of the Series F Preferred shall be redeemed at the applicable price in cash only determined in accordance with the Companys certificate of incorporation on the date specified in the Redemption Notice, which date shall be the 45th day after the Redemption Notice is mailed (the " _Redemption Date_ "). The Company shall take all steps necessary under the certificate of incorporation of the Company and the certificate of designations of the Series F Preferred to cause all shares of Series F Preferred to no longer be deemed outstanding from and after the Redemption Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to take any of the actions contemplated by this Section 6.17 if the Company determines in its reasonable discretion that such actions, individually or in the aggregate, would constitute or result in a breach or violation of, or a default or termination (or right of termination) under, the acceleration of any obligations or the creation of a Lien (other than an immaterial Lien) on the Companys assets or the assets of any of its Subsidiaries (with or without notice, lapse of time or both), under any Contract in effect as of the date of this Agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound. 

   ##### 

  

  

 6.18. _Notice to Stockholders_. Promptly following the adoption of this Agreement by the Company Requisite Vote, the Company shall mail notice of such adoption to all of the holders of record of Company Shares as of the time of such adoption in accordance with applicable Law. 

  

 6.19. _Potential Sale of Interests_. Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, to the extent reasonably requested by Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cooperate with Parent to facilitate the disposition immediately prior to, at or after the Effective Time of those assets or ownership interests held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are identified on Section 6.19 of the Parent Disclosure Letter (such assets or interests being " _Potential Sale Interest_ "). To the extent reasonably requested by Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to (a) permit Persons whom Parent identifies to the Company as potential purchasers of a Potential Sale Interest to conduct (and cooperate with such Persons) reasonable investigations with respect to such Potential Sale Interest ( _provided_ that any such Person executes and delivers to the Company a confidentiality agreement containing customary terms), (b) comply with any applicable right of first refusal, right of first offer, right of approval or similar provisions that may be applicable to a proposed transfer of a Potential Sale Interest, and (c) deliver such notices, make such filings and execute such Contracts relating to the disposition of Potential Sale Interests as maybe reasonably requested by Parent; _provided_ that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to execute any such Contract under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may be required to dispose of any Potential Sale Interest other than immediately prior to, at or after the Effective Time, or to agree to restrictions on their businesses or operations prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall be permitted to identify potential purchasers of Potential Sale Interests and negotiate any Contracts with respect to dispositions of Potential Sale Interests; _provided_ that the Company may (and, to the extent reasonably requested by Parent, shall) participate in such negotiations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Parent shall reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket costs in complying with this Section 6.19 promptly following incurrence and delivery of reasonable documentation of such costs, and (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to breach the terms of any Contract with respect to such Potential Sale Interest.

This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time by action of the Board of Directors of Parent if (a) there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company in this Agreement, or any such representation and warranty shall have become untrue after the date of this Agreement, such that Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) would not be satisfied and such breach or failure to be true is not curable or, if curable, is not cured by the earlier of (i) the 90th day after notice of such breach is given by Parent to the Company and (ii) the Termination Date (as the same may be extended) or (b) the Company Requisite Vote shall not have been obtained by July 1, 2007 or (c) at any time on or prior to August 31, 2007, if the Company or any of its executive officers or directors shall have materially breached the provisions of Section 6.2. 

  

 8.5. _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_. 

  

 (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article VIII, this Agreement (other than as set forth in this Section 8.5 and Section 9.1) shall become void and of no effect with no liability on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its representatives); _provided_ , _however_ , that no such termination shall relieve any party hereto from any liability for damages to any other party resulting from any willful breach of this Agreement or from any obligation to pay, if applicable, any amount payable pursuant to this Section 8.5. 

  

 (b) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(b), then the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than two business days after the date of such termination, pay Parent a fee equal to $100 million, payable by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent. 

  

 (c) If this Agreement is (i) terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(b), then the Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to $85 million (the " _Termination Fee_ ") at the time set forth in Section 8.3(b), payable by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent (it being understood and agreed that Parent shall provide the Company with wire transfer instructions for the payment of the Termination Fee within one calendar day after receipt of the notice contemplated by Section 8.3(b)(ii)), or (ii) terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(c), then the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than two business days after the date of such termination, pay Parent the Termination Fee, payable by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent. 

  

 (d) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be required to pay both the Termination Fee and the fee contemplated by Section 8.5(b) or to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.5 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay promptly any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.5, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company, the Company shall pay to Parent and Merger Sub their costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred in connection with such suit, together

with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in
effect on the date such payment should have been made.

 9.10. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not, subject to clause (a), be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, except as a result of such substitution, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction. 

  

 9.11. _Interpretation_. 

  

 (a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." 

  

 (b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. 

  

 (c) Each of the Company and Parent has or may have set forth information in its respective disclosure letter in a section thereof that corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. A matter set forth in one section of a disclosure letter need not be set forth in any other section of the disclosure letter so long as its relevance to the latter section of the disclosure letter or section of this Agreement is reasonably apparent. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in a disclosure letter shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement. Such information and the dollar thresholds set forth herein shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material," "Company Material Adverse Effect" or "Regulatory Material Adverse Effect."

This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of law or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may designate prior to the Effective Time, by written notice to the Company, another wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent to be a party to the Merger in lieu of Merger Sub (unless doing so would reasonably be expected to prevent or delay other than in an immaterial respect consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby), in which event all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other Subsidiary (except with respect to representations and warranties made 

   ##### 

  

    

herein with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement) and all
representations and warranties made herein with respect to Merger Sub as of
the date of this Agreement shall also be made with respect to such other
Subsidiary as of the date of such designation. Any assignment in
contravention of the preceding sentence shall be null and void.
