materials shall advise the holders of such Company Shares of the effectiveness of the Merger and

shall be entitled to receive in exchange, and in respect of, such Certificate a cash amount (after

not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be paid upon due
surrender of the Certificate may be issued and/or paid to such a transferee if the Certificate
formerly representing such Company Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
