articles of incorporation and bylaws of Parent; provided further, that one of
the Company Designees must: (i) meet the definition of "independent director"
set forth in the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ for companies 



listed on the NASDAQ and applicable regulations promulgated by the SEC and
(ii) meet the independence standards previously published by Parent, and
neither of the Company Designees shall have been party to or involved in an
event that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 401(f) of
Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act; provided
further, that each of the Company Designees shall be placed in the class of
directors whose terms of office shall expire at the annual meeting of Parent
shareholders to be held in 2015 and the Nominating Committee of the Parent
Board shall consider in good faith the nomination for reelection of each of
the Company Designees for a full three-year term at the 2015 annual meeting of
Parent's shareholders. The officers of Parent immediately prior to the Second
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Parent Company from and
after the Second Effective Time, until the earlier of their resignation or
removal, or otherwise ceasing to be an officer or until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.



1.6 Tax Consequences. It is intended that the Mergers shall qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that
this Agreement shall constitute, and is hereby adopted as, a "plan of
reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. From and
after the date of this Agreement and until the Closing Date, each party hereto
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Mergers to qualify, and
will not knowingly take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take
any action or cause any action not to be taken, which action or failure to act
could reasonably be expected to prevent the Mergers from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.



1.7 Effects of the Mergers. At and after the Effective Time, the First Merger
shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the relevant
provisions of the MGCL. At and after the Second Effective Time, the Second
Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the relevant
provisions of the TBOC and the MGCL.



1.8 Bank Merger. Immediately following the Second Effective Time, OmniAmerican
Bank, a federal savings association and, prior to the Second Effective Time,
wholly owned subsidiary of Company (the "Company Bank Subsidiary"), will merge
(the "Bank Merger") with and into Southside Bank, a Texas banking corporation
and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Parent Bank"). Parent Bank shall be
the surviving entity in the Bank Merger and shall continue its corporate
existence under the name "Southside Bank", and, following the Bank Merger, the
separate corporate existence of the Company Bank Subsidiary shall cease. The
liquidation account established by Company Bank Subsidiary pursuant to 12
C.F.R. part 192 shall be assumed by Parent Bank following the Bank Merger. The
parties agree that the Bank Merger shall become effective immediately after
the Second Effective Time. The Bank Merger shall be implemented pursuant to a
subsidiary plan of merger, in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit B
hereto (the "Subsidiary Plan of Merger"). In order to obtain the necessary
Regulatory Approvals for the Bank Merger, the parties hereto shall cause the
following to be accomplished prior to the filing of applications for such
Regulatory Approvals: (a) Company shall cause the Company Bank Subsidiary to
approve the Subsidiary Plan of Merger; Company, as the sole stockholder of the
Company Bank Subsidiary, shall approve the Subsidiary Plan of Merger; and
Company shall cause the Subsidiary Plan of Merger to be duly executed by the
Company Bank Subsidiary and delivered to Parent and (b) Parent shall cause
Parent Bank to approve the Subsidiary Plan of Merger; Parent, as the sole
stockholder of Parent Bank, shall approve the Subsidiary Plan of Merger; and
Parent shall cause Parent Bank to duly execute and deliver the Subsidiary Plan
of Merger to Company. Prior to the Second Effective Time, the Surviving Parent
Company shall cause the Company Bank Subsidiary and Parent Bank to execute
such certificates of merger and articles of combination and such other
documents and certificates as are necessary to make the Bank Merger effective
("Bank Merger Certificates") immediately after the Second Effective Time.

of the First Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
Company or the holder of any of the following securities:

(a)Conversion of Shares of Merger Sub Stock. Each share of common stock of

shall automatically be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Company
("Company Common Stock").



(b)Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any
Cancelled Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive: (i) 0.4459
shares (the "Exchange Ratio"), subject to adjustment in accordance with
Section 2.1(d), of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of
common stock, par value $1.25 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock")
(together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to

(c)Cancellation of Certain Shares of Company Common Stock. All shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that are owned directly by Parent or Company or a Subsidiary of Company

or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially
owned by third parties and (ii) shares held, directly or indirectly, by Parent
or Company in respect of a debt previously contracted) shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist and no Merger Consideration or other consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor (such cancelled shares, the "Cancelled
Shares").



(d)Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. If at any time during the period between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the
outstanding shares of capital stock of Parent or Company, respectively, shall
occur (or for which the relevant record date will occur) as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split) or subdivision or combination or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, an
appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Stock
Consideration, the Exchange Ratio and other dependent items, as applicable.



(e)No Dissenter's or Appraisal Rights. No holder of Company Common Stock is
entitled, with respect to the First Merger, to exercise any rights of an
objecting stockholder provided for under Title 3 Subtitle 2 of the MGCL or any
successor statute, or any similar dissenter's or appraisal rights.



(f)No Effect on Parent Common Stock. Each share of Parent Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued
and outstanding immediately after the Effective Time.



2.2 Conversion of Shares in the Second Merger. At the Second Effective Time,
by virtue of the Second Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the holder of any of the following securities: 



(a)Cancellation of Shares of Surviving Corporation Stock. Each share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Second Effective Time shall automatically be retired and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be paid, nor shall any other payment be made
or right inure with respect thereto in connection with or as a consequence of
the Second Merger.

(b)No Effect on Parent Common Stock. Each share of Parent Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall remain
issued and outstanding and shall not be affected by the Second Merger.

2.3 Deposit of Merger Consideration and Option Consideration. Promptly after
the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) to
Computershare Trust Company or another bank or trust company selected by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to Company (the "Exchange and Paying Agent")
pursuant to an agreement, the terms of which shall be reasonably acceptable to
Company, entered into prior to the Closing (the "Exchange and Paying Agent
Agreement"), for exchange in accordance with this Article II: (a) the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to deliver the aggregate Stock
Consideration; (b) to the extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu
of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.4(f); (c) cash in an amount equal
to the Cash Consideration; and (d) cash in the amount equal to the Option
Consideration (with such deposits collectively referred to herein as the
"Exchange and Payment Fund"), and Parent shall instruct the Exchange and
Paying Agent to timely deliver the Merger Consideration and the Option
Consideration in accordance with this Agreement.



2.4 Delivery of Merger Consideration.



(a)As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange
and Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record immediately prior to the
Effective Time (collectively, the "Holders") of certificates representing
shares of Company Common Stock ("Certificates") that were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1 (i) a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon delivery of
Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificate(s))) to the
Exchange and Paying Agent and shall be substantially in such form and have
such other provisions as shall be prescribed by the Exchange and Paying Agent
and Parent), the terms of which shall be reasonably acceptable to Company,
(the "Letter of Transmittal") and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering
Certificate(s) in exchange for the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such
Certificate(s) and any dividends or other distributions to which such Holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(c).



(b)Upon surrender to the Exchange and Paying Agent of its Certificate(s),
accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a Holder of Company
Common Stock shall receive, promptly after the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by
its Certificate(s). Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall
represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to
receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with, and any dividends or other distributions to
which such Holder is entitled pursuant to, this Article II.



No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock shall
be paid to the Holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, in each case unless and
until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this Article II.
Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate in accordance with this
Article II, the Holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest,
(i) the amount 

of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of Parent Common
Stock represented by such Certificate and not paid and/or (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to whole shares of Parent Common Stock represented by
such Certificate with a record date after the Effective Time (but before such
surrender date) and with a payment date subsequent to the issuance of the
Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate.



(a)After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer
books of Company of any shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle
transfers of Company Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are
presented for transfer to the Exchange and Paying Agent, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration in accordance with
Section 2.1 and the procedures set forth in this Article II.



(b)In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of
Company, the Merger Consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered if the Certificate formerly representing such Company Common Stock
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the
Person requesting such payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or other
similar Taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance to a Person other
than the registered Holder of the Certificate or establish to the satisfaction
of Parent that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable.



(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange, no dividend
or other distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on
or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
stockholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share,
Parent shall pay to each former stockholder of Company who otherwise would be
entitled to receive such fractional share, an amount in cash (rounded to the
nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying (i) the Parent Share Value by
(ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of Company
Common Stock held by such Holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the
nearest one ten-thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common
Stock to which such Holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 2.1. The parties acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in
lieu of issuing fractional shares was not separately bargained-for
consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of
avoiding the expense and inconvenience that would otherwise be caused by the
issuance of fractional shares.



(d)The Exchange and Paying Agent (or, subsequent to the first anniversary of
the Effective Time, Parent) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
portion of the Merger Consideration such amounts as the Exchange and Paying
Agent or Parent, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under
the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to
the making of such payment. To the extent that the amounts are so withheld by
the Exchange and Paying Agent or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Holder of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange and Paying Agent or Parent,
as the case may be.



(e)Any portion of the Exchange and Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of Company as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time
shall be paid to Parent. Any former 

stockholders of Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article II
shall thereafter look only to Parent with respect to the Merger Consideration
and any unpaid dividends and other distributions on the Parent Common Stock
deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such stockholder
holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any
interest thereon, subject to the requirements of abandoned property, escheat
or similar Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Company, the
Exchange and Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former
holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good
faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Laws.



(f)The Exchange and Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the
Exchange and Payment Fund as directed by Parent, on a daily basis; provided
that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to
holders of Certificates pursuant to this Article II. Any interest or other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent, upon demand.



(g)In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required
by Parent or the Exchange and Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a
bond in such amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange and Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.



(h)Subject to the terms of the Exchange and Paying Agent Agreement, Parent, in
the exercise of its reasonable discretion, shall have the right to make all
determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing
(i) the validity of any Letter of Transmittal and compliance by any Company
stockholder with the procedures and instructions set forth herein and therein,
(ii) the issuance and delivery of the whole number of shares of Parent Common
Stock into which shares of Company Common Stock are converted in the First
Merger and (iii) the method of payment of the cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock.



(i)In the case of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock that are not
represented by Certificates, the parties shall make such adjustments to this
Article II as are necessary or appropriate to implement the same purpose and
effect that this Article II has with respect to shares of Company Common Stock
that are represented by Certificates.



2.5 Company Options.



(a)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Company Stock Plan or in
any individual award agreement, no more than fifteen (15) days prior to the
Effective Time, the board of directors of Company (or, if appropriate, any
committee administering the Company Stock Plan) shall (i) take all necessary
actions to cause the conditional vesting of any unvested shares of Company
Common Stock (conditioned on the consummation of the First Merger) granted
pursuant to the Company Stock Plan and (ii) take all necessary actions,
including the conditional vesting of unvested outstanding stock options
(conditioned on the consummation of the First Merger) granted pursuant to the
Company Stock Plan (the "Company Options"), to direct that all, but not less
than all, outstanding Company Options be canceled as of the Effective Time in
exchange for the right to receive a cash payment per share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Option equal to the excess (if any) of (a) the
sum of (i) the Cash Consideration payable with respect to one share of Company
Common Stock and (ii) the value of the Stock Consideration payable with
respect to one share of Company Common Stock (with such value determined based
on the 

closing price of the Parent Common Stock on the last Trading Day immediately
preceding the Effective Time) over (b) the exercise price per share of the
Company Option being canceled (the "Option Consideration"). Parent shall cause
the Exchange and Paying Agent to deliver the Option Consideration to the
holders of Company Options entitled to receive such payments promptly after
the Effective Time.



(b)Prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of Company (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt
such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to effect the
transactions described in this Section 2.5.





ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY



Except as (a) disclosed in writing in the correspondingly enumerated section
or subsection of the disclosure schedule of Company delivered herewith (the
"Disclosure Schedule") (provided that each exception set forth in the
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to qualify any other representation and
warranty to the extent that the relevance of such exception to such other
representation and warranty is reasonably apparent on the face of the
disclosure (without the need to examine underlying documentation referenced
in, but not attached to, the Disclosure Schedule)) or (b) disclosed in any
report, schedule, form or other document filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC") by Company prior to the date hereof and on or
after the date on which Company filed with the SEC its Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 (but excluding any risk
factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk Factors," any disclosure
of risks included in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other
statements that are similarly non-specific or predictive or forward-looking in
nature), Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as
follows:

3.1 Corporate Organization.



(a)Company and each of its Subsidiaries is an entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize
such concept) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. The
deposit accounts of the Company Bank Subsidiary are insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") through the Bank Insurance Fund to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, and all premiums and assessments required
in connection therewith have been paid by Company Bank Subsidiary when due.
The Company Bank Subsidiary is a member in good standing of the Federal Home
Loan Bank of Dallas and owns the requisite amount of stock therein. Company
and each of its Subsidiaries has the requisite corporate power and authority
to own or lease and operate all of its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted. Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or
location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such
licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified has not had and is not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Company. True
and complete copies of Company's charter (the "Company Charter"), and bylaws
(the "Company Bylaws"), and the articles or certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of each Company Subsidiary, in
each case as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been
furnished or made available to Parent. Neither Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in violation of any of the provisions of the Company Charter
or Company Bylaws or such articles or certificate of incorporation and bylaws
(or comparable organizational documents) of such Company Subsidiary, as
applicable.



(b) Section 3.1(b) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and
correct list of all the 

Subsidiaries of Company (each a "Company Subsidiary" and collectively the
"Company Subsidiaries"). Section 3.1(b) of the Disclosure Schedule also sets
forth the number and owner of all outstanding capital stock or other equity
securities of each such Subsidiary, options, warrants, stock appreciation
rights, scrip, rights to subscribe to, calls or commitments of any character
whatsoever relating to, or securities or rights convertible into, shares of
any capital stock or other equity securities of such Subsidiary, or contracts,
commitments, understandings or arrangements by which such Subsidiary may
become bound to issue additional shares of its capital stock or other equity
securities, or options, warrants, scrip, rights to subscribe to, calls or
commitments for any shares of its capital stock or other equity securities and
the identity of the parties to any such agreements or arrangements. All of the
outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities evidencing ownership
of Company Subsidiaries are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and
such shares or other securities are owned by Company or another of its
Subsidiaries free and clear of any lien, claim, charge, option, encumbrance,
mortgage, pledge or security interest or other restriction of any kind
("Lien") with respect thereto. Except for its interests in Company
Subsidiaries, its ownership of marketable securities and as set forth on
Section 3.1(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, Company does not as of the date of
this Agreement own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock, membership
interest, partnership interest or other equity interest in any Person.



3.2 Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of Company consists of
100,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, par value $0.01 per share. As of the date of this Agreement, there are
(a) 11,551,732 shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding, (b)
812,796 shares of Company Common Stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise
of Company Options and (c) no other shares of capital stock or other voting
securities of Company issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. All of the
issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock have been duly
authorized and validly issued, are fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding
bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness having the right to vote on any
matters on which stockholders may vote ("Voting Debt") of Company. No trust
preferred or subordinated debt securities of Company are issued or
outstanding. Except as set forth on Section 3.2 of the Disclosure Schedule,
there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls,
rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or other commitments or
agreements of any character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock
or other securities of Company, or otherwise obligating Company to issue,
transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, or to register under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the
SEC thereunder (the "Securities Act"), any such securities. Company is not a
party to any voting trusts, stockholder agreements, proxies or other
agreements in effect with respect to the voting or transfer of the Company
Common Stock or other equity interests of Company, and, to the Knowledge of
Company, except for the Voting and Support Agreements, the ESOP and proxies
for Company's 2014 annual meeting of stockholders, there are no such
agreements to which any director, executive officer or holder of more than 5%
of Company Common Stock is a party. Section 3.2 of the Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a true, correct and complete list of the aggregate number of shares
of Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of each Company Option
outstanding as of the date of this Agreement and the holder and exercise price
for each such Company Option. Other than the Company Options and the
outstanding restricted shares of Company Common Stock, no equity-based awards
(including any cash awards where the amount of payment is determined in whole
or in part based on the price of any capital stock of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) are outstanding.

execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and

directors of Company has resolved to recommend to Company's stockholders the
approval of the First Merger and all necessary corporate action in respect

affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (the "Requisite Stockholder Approval") and the filing of

Lien upon any of the respective properties or assets of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement, contract
or other instrument or obligation to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party, or by which they or any of their respective properties, assets or
business activities may be bound or affected, except, in the case of clause
(ii) above, for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults or the loss of
benefits which, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Company.

(a)Company has timely filed with or furnished to, as applicable, the SEC all
registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements
and other documents (including exhibits and all other information incorporated
by reference) required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC since
January 1, 2012 (the "Company SEC Documents"). As of their respective filing
dates (or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing, as of the date of
the last such amendment or superseding filing prior to the date hereof), each
of the Company SEC Documents complied as to form in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and Exchange Act applicable
to such Company SEC Documents. None of the Company SEC Documents, including
any financial statements, schedules or exhibits included or incorporated by
reference therein at the time they were filed (or, if amended or superseded by
a subsequent filing, as of the date of the last such amendment or superseding
filing prior to the date hereof), contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of Company's
Subsidiaries is required to file or furnish any forms, reports or other
documents with the SEC.



3.6 Financial Statements.



(a)Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, any
related notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Documents (the "Company
Financial Statements"): (i) complied as to form in all material respects with
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto as of
their respective dates; (ii) was prepared in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP ") applied on a consistent
basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto and, in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, as may be
permitted by the SEC and GAAP for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q); and (iii)
fairly presented in all material respects the consolidated financial position
of Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective dates
thereof and the consolidated results of Company's operations and cash flows
for the periods indicated therein, subject, in the case of unaudited interim
financial statements, to normal and year-end audit adjustments and the absence
of footnotes as permitted by GAAP and the applicable rules and regulations of
the SEC.



(b)Company and each of its Subsidiaries has established and maintains a system
of "internal controls over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)

assurance (i) regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP, (ii) that receipts and expenditures of Company and its Subsidiaries are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the board
of directors of Company, and (iii) regarding prevention or timely detection of
the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Company's and its
Subsidiaries' assets that could have a material effect on Company's financial
statements.



(c)Company's "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that all
information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to Company's management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Company required
under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. Company has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures
prior to the date of this Agreement, to Company's auditors and the audit
committee of the board of directors of Company (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting that could adversely affect in any material
respect Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Company's
internal controls over financial reporting. For purposes of this Agreement,
the terms "significant deficiency" and "material weakness" shall have the
meaning assigned to them in Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing
Standard 2, as in effect on the date of this Agreement.



(d)Each of the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer
of Company (or each former principal executive officer and each former
principal financial officer of Company, as applicable) has made all
certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (including the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") with respect
to the Company SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such
certifications are true and accurate in all material respects. For purposes of
this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial
officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding (nor has
arranged or modified since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) any
"extensions of credit" (within the meaning of 

Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) to directors or executive officers (as
defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Company is otherwise in compliance with all applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, except for any non-compliance that has
not had and is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Company.



(e)The books and records kept by Company and its Subsidiaries are in all
material respects complete and accurate and have been maintained in accordance
with applicable Laws and accounting requirements. The Company Financial
Statements have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books and
records of Company and its Subsidiaries.



(f)Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract or arrangement (including any contract or
arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between or among
Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangement"), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such contract
or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving,
or material liabilities of, Company or any of its Subsidiaries in Company's or
such Subsidiary's financial statements.





3.7 Undisclosed Liabilities. The consolidated balance sheet of Company dated
as of December 31, 2013 (the "Balance Sheet Date"), contained in the Company
SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof is hereinafter referred to as the
"Balance Sheet." Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liabilities of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise and whether due or to become due) other than liabilities that (i)
are reflected or reserved against on the Balance Sheet (including in the notes
thereto), (ii) were incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (iii) have not had, and are not
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Company.



3.8 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as set forth on Section 3.8
of the Disclosure Schedule, from the Balance Sheet Date to the date of this
Agreement, (a) Company and its Subsidiaries have, in all material respects,
carried on their respective businesses in the ordinary course consistent with
their past practice, (b) Company has not taken any of the actions that Company
has agreed not to take or permit its Subsidiaries to take from the date hereof
through the Effective Time pursuant to Section 5.2(b), (f), (h), (i), (j), (n)
or (t), and (c) there has not been any Material Adverse Effect on Company.

3.9 Legal Proceedings. Except as set forth on Section 3.9 of the Disclosure
Schedule, neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or the
subject of any, and there are no outstanding or pending or, to the Knowledge
of Company, threatened, material legal, administrative, arbitral or other
proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory investigations of
any nature against Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There is no material
outstanding injunction, order, judgment, decree or regulatory restriction
(other than regulatory restrictions of general application that apply to
similarly situated companies) imposed upon Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
the assets of Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 





3.10 Taxes and Tax Returns.

each of its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed or caused to be filed
(including all applicable extensions) all federal, state, foreign and local
Tax Returns required to be filed by it or with respect to it (all such Tax
Returns being accurate and complete in all material respects) and has duly and
timely paid or caused to be paid on its behalf all material Taxes due and
required to be paid by it prior to the date hereof (whether or not shown to be
due on such Tax Returns). Through the Balance Sheet Date, Company and its
Subsidiaries do not have any material liability for Taxes in excess of the
amount reserved or provided for on the Company Financial Statements. The
unpaid Taxes of Company and its Subsidiaries did not, as of the Balance Sheet
Date, exceed the reserve for Tax Liability set forth on the face of the
Balance Sheet (rather than in any notes thereto), and do not exceed that
reserve as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in
accordance with the past custom and practice of Company and its Subsidiaries.

has ever made a claim in writing that any of Company and its Subsidiaries is

assets of Company and its Subsidiaries, other than Permitted Encumbrances.

with respect to Company and each of its Subsidiaries, with respect to any
employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder, or other party, have

extent required by applicable Law, have been paid to the relevant Governmental
Entity. Company and each of its Subsidiaries have complied in all material
respects with all information reporting and backup withholding provisions of

withholding certificates or comparable documents (including with respect to
deposits) and any notice received pursuant to Section 3406(a)(1)(B) or (C) of

the Taxes, taxable income or taxable losses of any other Person.



(h)Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has been a member of an

"controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the
Code) in a distribution of stock intending to qualify for Tax-free treatment
under Section 355 of the Code.



(j)Since January 1, 2011, neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been
required (or has applied) to include in income any material adjustment
pursuant to Section 481 of the Code by reason of a voluntary change in
accounting method initiated by Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and the
Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has not initiated or proposed any such
material adjustment or change in accounting method (including any method for

or 162(m) of the Code or any comparable provision of state Tax Law.



3.11 Employee Benefit Plans.

(a)Section 3.11(a) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete
list of all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")), whether or not
subject to ERISA, and all bonus, stock option, stock purchase, restricted
stock, incentive, deferred compensation, retiree medical or life insurance,
welfare, retirement, severance, change-in-control or other compensatory or
benefit plans, programs, policies or arrangements and all retention, bonus,
employment, termination, severance or other contracts or agreements to which
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates
(as hereinafter defined) is a 

party, with respect to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective ERISA Affiliates has any current or future obligation,
contingent or otherwise, or that are maintained, contributed to or sponsored
by Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates for the benefit of any current or former employee, officer,
director or independent contractor of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective ERISA Affiliates (all such plans, programs, policies,
arrangements, contracts or agreements, whether or not listed in Section
3.11(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, collectively, the "Company Benefit
Plans").



(b)Company has delivered or made available to Parent true, correct and
complete copies of the following (as applicable): (i) the written document
evidencing each Company Benefit Plan or, with respect to any such plan that is
not in writing, a written description of the material terms thereof, (ii) the
annual report (Form 5500), if any, filed with the IRS for the last three (3)
plan years, (iii) the most recently received IRS determination letter, if any,
relating to a Company Benefit Plan, (iv) the most recently prepared actuarial
report or financial statement, if any, relating to a Company Benefit Plan, (v)
the most recent summary plan description, if any, for such Company Benefit
Plan (or other descriptions of such Company Benefit Plan provided to
employees) and all modifications thereto, (vi) all material correspondence
with the U.S. Department of Labor or the IRS, (vii) all amendments,
modifications or material supplements to any Company Benefit Plan, and (viii)
any related trust agreements, insurance contracts or documents of any other
funding arrangements that are currently in effect (or for which there is any
Liability) relating to a Company Benefit Plan. Except as specifically provided
in the foregoing documents delivered or made available to Parent, there are no
amendments to any Company Benefit Plans that have been adopted or approved nor
has Company or any of its Subsidiaries undertaken to make any such amendments
or to adopt or approve any new Company Benefit Plans.



(c)Each Company Benefit Plan has been established, operated and administered
in all material respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of
all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code (including all applicable
aspects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended) as well
as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended
("HIPAA"). Each Company Benefit Plan that constitutes a group health plan
subject to Code § 4980H is, or will be, prepared to determine and offer
coverage to full-time employees as required to avoid the excise taxes under
Code § 4980H. Except as set forth on Section 3.11(c) of the Disclosure
Schedule, neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action to
take corrective action or make a filing under any voluntary correction program
of the IRS, the U.S. Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan, and to the Knowledge of Company and its
Subsidiaries, there are no material plan defects that would qualify for
correction under any such program.



(d)All contributions required to be made to any Company Benefit Plan by
applicable Law or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and
all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any
Company Benefit Plan, for any period through the date hereof, have been timely
made or paid in full or, to the extent not required to be made or paid on or
before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the books and records of
Company.



(e)Each Company Benefit Plan that is in any part a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" subject to Section 409A of the Code (A) complies and, at
all times after December 31, 2008 has complied, both in form and operation, in
all material respects with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and
the final regulations and other applicable guidance thereunder and (B) between
January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2008 was operated in good faith compliance
with Section 409A of the Code, as determined under applicable guidance of the
U.S. Department of the Treasury and the IRS. No compensation payable by
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been reportable as nonqualified
deferred compensation in the 

gross income of any individual or entity, and subject to an additional tax, as
a result of the operation of Section 409A of the Code. No assets set aside for
the payment of benefits under any "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
are held outside of the United States, except to the extent that substantially
all of the services to which such benefits are attributable have been
performed in the jurisdiction in which such assets are held.



(f)Section 3.11(f) of the Disclosure Schedule identifies each Company Benefit
Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (the
"Qualified Plans"). The IRS has issued a favorable determination letter with
respect to each Qualified Plan and the related trust that has not been
revoked, and, to the Knowledge of Company, there are no existing circumstances
and no events have occurred that could adversely affect the qualified status
of any Qualified Plan or the related trust. Each trust created under any
Qualified Plan has been determined to be exempt from Tax under Section 501(a)
of the Code and neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is aware of any
circumstances that could result in the revocation of the exemption. No trust
funding any Company Benefit Plan is intended to meet the requirements of
Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.



(g)Each Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of
ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code (a "Pension Plan") had, as of the
date of its most recent actuarial valuation, assets measured at fair market
value at least equal to its "funding target" as that term is defined in
Section 430 of the Code. Since the date of the most recent actuarial
valuation, no event has occurred that would be reasonably expected to
adversely change any such funded status in a material way. Any Company Benefit
Plan that is a Pension Plan has satisfied its "minimum funding standard"
within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 or ERISA. All
required contributions with respect to any Pension Plan have been timely made
and there is no Lien, nor is there expected to be a Lien, under Section 430(k)
of the Code or ERISA Section 303(k) or Tax under Section 4971 of the Code.
Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to
provide, security to any of its Pension Plans pursuant to Section 412 of the
Code. All premiums required to be paid under ERISA Section 4007 have been
timely paid by Company and its Subsidiaries. No Liability under Title IV of
ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to any Pension Plan currently or formerly maintained
by any of them or by any of their ERISA Affiliates that has not been satisfied
in full (other than Liability for Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
premiums, which have been paid when due).



(h)(i) No Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "Multiemployer Plan") or a plan that has two or
more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control,
within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a "Multiple Employer Plan"); (ii)
none of Company and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has, at any time during the last six (6) years, contributed to or
been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer
Plan; and (iii) none of Company and its Subsidiaries nor any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred any liability to a Multiemployer Plan
as a result of a complete or partial withdrawal from such Multiemployer Plan,
as those terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA.



(i)Except as set forth on Section 3.11(i) of the Disclosure Schedule, neither
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors, has sponsored or has any
obligation with respect to any employee benefit plan that provides for any
post-employment or post-retirement health or medical or life insurance
benefits for retired, former or current employees or beneficiaries or
dependents thereof, except as required by Section 4980B of the Code. Company
and each of its Subsidiaries have reserved the right to amend, terminate or
modify at any time all plans or arrangements providing for health (including
retiree health) or life insurance 

coverage, and no representations or commitments, whether or not written, have
been made that would limit Company's or such Subsidiary's right to amend,
terminate or modify any such benefits.



(j)Except as set forth on Section 3.11(j) of the Disclosure Schedule, neither
the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction with any
other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or delivery of, or
increase in the amount or value of, any payment, right or other benefit to any
employee, officer, director or other service provider (including early
termination rights or penalties) of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
result in any limitation on the right of Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Company
Benefit Plan or related trust. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the
form of benefits) by Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a
result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. No
Company Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under
Section 4999 or 409A of the Code.



(k)Except as otherwise identified on Section 3.11(k) of the Disclosure
Schedule, there does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that could
result in, any Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of
Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates following the
Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither Company nor
any of its ERISA Affiliates has engaged in any transaction described in
Section 4069, 4204 or 4212 of ERISA.



(l)Except as set forth on Section 3.11(l) of the Disclosure Schedule, there
are no pending claims (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course),
lawsuits or arbitrations that have been asserted or instituted, and, to the
Knowledge of Company, no threatened claims (other than claims for benefits in
the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations and no set of circumstances
exists that may reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the
Company Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to
the Company Benefits Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the
Company Benefit Plans that could reasonably be expected to result in any
material Liability of Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the U.S.
Department of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan, any Multiple Employer Plan, any
participant in a Company Benefit Plan, or any other party. No Company Benefit
Plan is under audit or the subject of an investigation by the IRS, the U.S.
Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the SEC or any
other Governmental Entity, nor is any such audit or investigation pending or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened.



(m)Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction
with respect to any Company Benefit Plan that would subject Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to a Tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the
Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA. Neither Company nor, to the Knowledge of
Company, any administrator or fiduciary of a Company Benefit Plan (or any
agent of any of the foregoing) has engaged in any transaction, or acted or
failed to act in any manner with respect to such Company Benefit Plan that
could subject Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any direct or indirect
Liability (by indemnity or otherwise) for breach of any fiduciary, co-
fiduciary or any other duty under ERISA.



(n)Except as otherwise identified on section 3.11(n) of the Disclosure
Schedule, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not (or will not upon termination of employment within a fixed period of
time following such consummation) (A) entitle any employee, director or
consultant to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment,
or (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or increase the amount of
payment with respect to any compensation due to any employee director or
consultant. 



(o)No written, nor to the Knowledge of Company, oral representation or
communication with respect to any aspect of a Company Benefit Plan has been
made to any employee that is not in accordance with the written or otherwise
pre-existing terms and provisions of such plans.



(p)Any Company Benefit Plan can be terminated without resulting in any
liability to the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company for any additional
contributions, penalties, premiums, fees, fines, excise taxes, or any other
charges or liabilities.



3.12 Labor Matters. There are no agreements with, or pending petitions for
recognition of, a labor union or association as the exclusive bargaining agent
for any of the employees of Company or any of its Subsidiaries and there are
no representation or certification proceedings or petitions seeking a
representation proceeding presently pending or, to the Knowledge of Company,
threatened to be brought or filed with the National Labor Relations Board or
any other comparable foreign, state or local labor relations tribunal or
authority. There are no labor strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, lockouts,
material arbitrations or material grievances or other material labor disputes,
other than routine grievance matters, now pending or, to the Knowledge of
Company, threatened against or involving Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
to the Knowledge of Company, there are no organizing activities pending or
threatened against or involving Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and, since
January 1, 2009, there have not been any such labor strikes, work stoppages or
other labor troubles with respect to Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Company is not a party to, or otherwise bound by, any consent decree with, or
citation by, any Governmental Entity relating to employees or employment
practices; and, to the Knowledge of Company, there are no complaints or
charges of discrimination, which have been asserted against Company or that
are now pending before any Governmental Entity, including but not limited to
the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and U.S. Department of Labor,
relating to employees or employment practices that would result in liability
to Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Company and each of its Subsidiaries is
in compliance with all applicable Laws in respect of employment and employment
practices, including terms and conditions of employment, wages and hours,
employment discrimination, employee classification, workers' compensation,
unemployment compensation, family and medical leave, the Immigration Reform
and Control Act, and occupational safety and health requirements. Each
individual who renders services to Company or any of its Subsidiaries who is
classified by Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, as having the status
of an independent contractor, consultant or other non-employee status for any
purpose (including for purposes of taxation and tax reporting and under
Company Benefit Plans) is properly so characterized.



3.13 Compliance with Applicable Law.



(a)Company and each of its Subsidiaries and each of their employees, in their
capacities as such (i) hold all licenses, registrations, franchises,
certificates, variances, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful
conduct of their respective businesses and properties and (ii) are and have
been in compliance with all, and are not and have not been in violation of
any, applicable Law and neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
Knowledge of, or to the Knowledge of Company, has since January 1, 2012,
received notice of, any violations of any of the above, except in each case
where the failure to hold such license, registration, franchise, certificate,
variance, permit or authorization or such noncompliance or violation has not
had and is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Company.



(b)Except as has not had and is not reasonably likely to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Company, Company and each of
its Subsidiaries have properly 

administered all accounts for which Company or any of its Subsidiaries acts as
a fiduciary, including accounts for which Company or any of its Subsidiaries
serves as a trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian,

material effect on Parent's financial statements.



(c)Parent's "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed to ensure
that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to Parent's management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Parent required
under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. Parent has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures
prior to the date of this Agreement, to Parent's auditors and the audit
committee of the board of directors of Parent (i) any significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting that could adversely affect in any material respect
Parent's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Parent's internal

of Parent (or each former principal executive officer and each former
principal financial officer of Company, as applicable) has made all

Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to the Parent SEC
Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications are true and

Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) to directors or executive officers (as
defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries. Parent is otherwise in compliance with all applicable provisions
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, except for any non-compliance that has not had and
is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent.

material respects complete and accurate and have been maintained in accordance

commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract or arrangement (including any contract or
arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between or among
Parent and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangement"), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such contract
or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving,
or material liabilities of, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in Parent's or
such Subsidiary's financial statements.

Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to all securities held by it

or agency capacity) free and clear of any Lien, except to the extent that such
securities are pledged in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices to secure obligations of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries and except for such defects in title or Liens that
would not be material to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Such securities are valued on the books of
Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP.

before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the books and records of
Parent.



(c)The IRS has issued a favorable determination letter with respect to each
Parent Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code (the "Parent Qualified Plans") and the related trust that
has not been revoked, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, there are no existing
circumstances and no events have occurred that could adversely affect the
qualified status of any Parent Qualified Plan or the related trust. Each trust

Liability under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries with respect to any
Parent Pension Plan currently or formerly maintained by any of them or by any
of their ERISA Affiliates that has not been satisfied in full (other than
Liability for Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums, which have been
paid when due).



(e)There are no pending claims (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary
course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been asserted or instituted, and,
to the Knowledge of Parent, no threatened claims (other than claims for
benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations and no set of
circumstances exists that may reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit,
against the Parent Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to
their duties to the Parent Benefits Plans or the assets of any of the trusts
under any of the Parent Benefit Plans that could reasonably be expected to
result in any material Liability of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the U.S.
Department of the Treasury, the U.S. Department of Labor, any Multiemployer
Plan, any Multiple Employer Plan, any participant in a Parent Benefit Plan, or
any other party. No Parent Benefit Plan is under audit or the subject of an
investigation by the IRS, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation, the SEC or any other Governmental Entity, nor is any
such audit or investigation pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent and Merger
Sub, threatened.



(f)Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their respective Subsidiaries has
engaged in a transaction with respect to any Parent Benefit Plan that would
subject Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to a Tax or penalty imposed by
either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA. Neither Parent nor
Merger Sub, to the Knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, any administrator or
fiduciary of a Parent Benefit Plan (or any agent of any of the foregoing) has
engaged in any transaction, or acted or failed to act in any manner with
respect to such Parent Benefit Plan that could subject Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to any direct or indirect Liability (by indemnity or otherwise)
for breach of any fiduciary, co-fiduciary or any other duty under ERISA.

National Labor Relations Board or any other comparable foreign, state or local
labor relations tribunal or authority. There are no labor strikes, work
stoppages, slowdowns, lockouts, material arbitrations or material grievances
or other material labor disputes, other than routine grievance matters, now

transactions contemplated hereby.

Representatives, directors, officers and employees to comply with, all of
their respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall

6.5 Employee Benefit Matters.



(a)(i) If the Closing Date occurs on or before October 15, 2014, from the
Closing Date through December 31, 2014 (the "Continuation Period"), Parent
shall maintain or cause to be maintained life insurance, accidental death and
dismemberment ("ADandD"), short and long term disability, long-term care,
medical, vision and dental benefit plans for the benefit of employees (as a
group) who are actively employed by Company and its Subsidiaries on the
Closing Date and continue to be actively employed after the Effective Time,
for so long as they continue to be so actively employed ("Covered Employees")
that provide life insurance, ADandD, short and long term disability, medical,
vision and dental benefits (while a Covered Employee is employed during the
Continuation Period) that, in the aggregate, provide benefits that are no less
favorable than the short and long term disability, long-term care, life
insurance, ADandD, medical, vision and dental benefits that are generally made
available to similarly situated employees of Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Closing Date.

(ii) If the Closing Date occurs after October 15, 2014, Parent shall maintain
benefits during the Continuation Period, as set forth in (i) above and, in
addition, for the period from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015,
Parent shall maintain or cause to be maintained medical and dental benefit
plans for the benefit of Covered Employees during this subsequent period that
are substantially similar to the medical and dental plans generally made
available to similarly situated employees of Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Closing Date. Parent shall provide all other
benefits, at its discretion, under plans offered to employees of Parent and
its Subsidiaries (other than Company). With respect to any health care plan of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Company and its Subsidiaries) in
which any Covered Employee is eligible to participate for the plan year in
which such Covered Employee is first eligible to participate, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any preexisting condition limitations
or eligibility waiting periods (applicable prior to January 1, 2016) under
such Parent or Subsidiary plan to be waived with respect to such Covered
Employee to the extent that such limitation would have been waived or
satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b)During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on December 31,
2015, each Covered Employee shall, subject to meeting the applicable
eligibility requirements, be eligible to receive benefits upon qualifying
terminations of employment that are consistent with the terms of the
OmniAmerican Bank Severance Pay Plan and Summary Plan Description (the
"Severance Plan"), as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date;
provided, however, that any Covered Employees who are eligible to receive
severance benefits, change in control benefits or any enhanced payments
pursuant to an individual employment arrangement, change in control
arrangement or deferred compensation plan shall not be eligible to receive
severance benefits under Severance Plan.



(c)Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate, effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the OmniAmerican Employee Stock
Ownership Plan (the "ESOP"). Following receipt of a favorable determination
letter from the IRS confirming that the termination of the ESOP did not
adversely affect the ESOP's qualification for federal tax purposes, the
Covered Employees shall be permitted to roll any eligible rollover
distributions from the ESOP into another cash or deferred arrangement within
the meaning of Section 401(k) sponsored by Parent or its Subsidiaries and in
which the Covered Employees are eligible (the "Parent 401(k) Plan"), provided
that shares of Parent Common Stock shall only be permitted to be rolled over
in kind into the Parent 401(k) Plan if such plan maintains a Parent Common
Stock fund.



(d)Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate, effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the OmniAmerican 401(k) Profit
Sharing Plan (the "OmniAmerican 401(k) Plan"). As soon as administratively
feasible after the Closing Date, the Covered Employees shall be eligible to
participate in the Parent 401(k) Plan on the same terms and conditions
applicable to employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Following
receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS confirming that the
termination of the OmniAmerican 401(k) Plan did not adversely affect such
plan's qualification for federal tax purposes, Covered Employees shall be
permitted to roll any eligible rollover distributions from the OmniAmerican
401(k) Plan into the Parent 401(k) Plan. In addition, Parent shall take any
and all necessary action, to the extent allowable by Law to permit a Covered
Employee with an outstanding loan under the OmniAmerican 401(k)Plan, to
rollover such outstanding loan balance to the Parent 401(k) Plan, provided,
however, that the Covered Employee may transfer such loan only if such loan is
acceptable to the Parent 401(k) Plan and such Covered Employee elects to
rollover his or her entire account balance under the OmniAmerican 401(k) Plan
to the Parent 401(k) Plan.



(e)In the event that the Closing Date occurs prior to the payment of the
Covered Employees' bonuses in respect of the 2014 year, Parent agrees that the
Covered Employees shall be eligible to be awarded bonuses with respect to the
2014 year, taking into account Company's performance for the 2014 performance
year, the terms of Company's applicable bonus plan, and Company's bonus
allocation practice in the ordinary course of business; provided that the
Company shall have accrued for any bonuses earned prior to the Effective Time.
During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on December 31,
2015, Parent agrees to maintain or cause to be maintained the incentive plans
identified on Section 6.5(e) of the Disclosure Schedule for the benefit of the
Covered Employees participating in such plans as of the Closing Date.



(f)Prior to the Closing Date, Company shall (i) amend its Absences from Work
Policy to provide that time accumulated in an employee's medical reserve
account shall be frozen as of the Closing Date and no additional time may be
banked after the Closing Date ("Banked MRA Time"); provided, however, that if
the Closing Date is expected to occur after December 31, 2014, the Company
will take all such actions prior to December 31, 2014 such that no additional
time is banked after such date, and (ii) notify its employees that (A) Parent
will permit Covered Employees to use Banked MRA Time, pursuant to the terms of
the Absences from Work Policy, for the period that begins on the Closing Date
and ends six (6) months after the Closing Date and (B) any Banked MRA Time
will be forfeited six months after the Closing Date. For the calendar year in
which the Closing Date occurs, Parent shall continue to maintain or cause to
be maintained Company's Absences from Work Policy (as amended in the manner
described in the preceding sentence) that was in effect on the Closing Date.
During the Continuation Period, pursuant to the terms of the Absences from
Work Policy, Parent shall permit the Covered Employees to continue to accrue
paid time off and to use any unused paid-time off granted during the calendar
year. Following the Continuation Period, any accrued and unused paid time off
will be forfeited.

(g)Parent shall cause any employee benefit plans of Parent and its
Subsidiaries in which any Covered Employee is eligible to participate for the
plan year in which such Covered Employee is first eligible to participate to
recognize the service of such Covered Employee with Company or its
Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility, participation and vesting under such
employee benefit plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, to the same extent
that such service was recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under
a corresponding Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was
eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that
such recognition of service shall not (i) operate to duplicate any benefits of
a Covered Employee with respect to the same period of service, (ii) apply for
purposes of any retiree medical plans (iii) apply for purposes of any plan,
program or arrangement (A) under 

which similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not
receive credit for prior service or (B) that is grandfathered or frozen,
either with respect to level of benefits or participation.

(h)With respect to the OmniAmerican Defined Benefit Plan (the "DB Plan"),
Parent reserves the right to terminate the DB Plan at a time determined by
Parent, in it its sole discretion, following the Closing Date.



(i)Without limiting the generality of Section 6.5, the provisions of this
Section 6.5 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and
no current or former employee or any other individual associated therewith
shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this
Agreement. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i)
establish, amend or modify any Company Benefit Plan or any "employee benefit
plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent, Company or any of
their respective Affiliates; (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, Company and its
Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan,
employment agreement or any other benefit or employment plan, program,
agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date; or (iii) confer upon any
current or former employee, officer, director or consultant any right to
employment or continued employment or continued service with the Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, Company and its
Subsidiaries), or constitute or create an employment agreement with any
employee.



6.6 Additional Agreements. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of Company and Parent shall cooperate fully with each other
and to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, at the time and in the manner contemplated by
this Agreement, the Merger. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of Parent, on the one
hand, and a Subsidiary of Company, on the other) or to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals,
immunities and franchises of either party to the Merger, the proper officers
and directors of each party and their respective Subsidiaries shall, at
Parent's sole expense, take all such necessary action as may be reasonably
requested by Parent.



6.7 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.



(a)From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless
each person who is now, or who has been at any time before the date of this
Agreement, or who becomes at or before the Effective Time, a director or
officer of Company, or any persons who are or were serving at the request of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, trustee, fiduciary,
employee or agent of another entity (including any Company Employee Benefit
Plan) (each, a "Company Indemnified Party") against all judgments, penalties,
fines, settlements (which settlement shall require the prior written consent
of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), and reasonable
expenses actually incurred (including attorneys' fees), in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding, investigation or other legal proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (each, a "Claim")
arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time which were committed by such Company Indemnified Party (including the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby) or in connection with
any appearance as a witness, regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or
claimed before, or after, the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
under the Company Charter, Company Bylaws, and any agreement between the
Company and such Company Indemnified Party, each as in effect on the date
hereof. Any 

Company Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
6.7(a), upon learning of any Claim, shall promptly after the Effective Time
notify Parent thereof.

(b)Parent shall maintain in effect for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary
insurance policy (provided that Parent may substitute therefor (i) policies of
at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which
are substantially no less advantageous or (ii) with the consent of Company
given prior to the Effective Time, any other policy) with respect to claims
arising from facts, events or actions which occurred prior to the Effective
Time and covering persons who are currently covered by such insurance;
provided that Parent shall not be obligated to make aggregate annual premium
payments for such six (6)-year period in respect of such policy (or coverage
replacing such policy) which exceed 250% of the annual premium payments on
Company's current policy in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the
"Maximum Amount"). If the amount of the premiums necessary to maintain or
procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to maintain the most advantageous policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance obtainable for a premium equal to
the Maximum Amount. In lieu of the foregoing, Parent may obtain on or prior to
the Effective Time, a six (6)-year "tail" prepaid policy providing equivalent
coverage to that described in this Section 6.7(b).



(c)The provisions of this Section 6.7 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Party and their
respective heirs and representatives.



6.8 Exchange Listing. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to list,
prior to the Effective Time, on the NASDAQ, subject to official notice of
issuance, the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the First
Merger, and Parent shall give all notices and make all filings with the NASDAQ
required in connection with the transactions contemplated herein.



6.9 No Solicitation.



(a)Except as specifically permitted in this Section 6.9, Company shall not,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, investment bankers, financial
advisors, attorneys, accountants and other retained representatives (each, a
"Representative ") not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate,
assist or knowingly take any other action to facilitate or encourage
(including by way of furnishing non-public information), the submission of any
Acquisition Proposal or the making of any proposal that could reasonably be
expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any
Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) approve, recommend, declare advisable or enter
into any acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement, letter of intent, term sheet or
other similar agreement regarding any Acquisition Proposal or requiring
Company to abandon, terminate or breach its obligations hereunder or fail to
consummate the Mergers (a "Company Acquisition Agreement").



(b)Subject to Section 6.9(f), the board of directors of Company shall not fail
to make at any time required by this Agreement, withdraw, amend, modify or
materially qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company
Board Recommendation, or adopt, approve or publicly recommend an Acquisition
Proposal, or make any public statement inconsistent with the Company Board
Recommendation, or resolve or agree to take any of the foregoing actions (any
of the foregoing, a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change").

(c)As used in this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means a proposal or offer
from, or indication of interest in making a proposal or offer by, any Person
(or group of Persons) other than Parent 

or its Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, relating to, or that is reasonably
likely to lead to, any (i) direct or indirect acquisition of assets of Company
or its Subsidiaries (including any voting equity interests of Subsidiaries,
but excluding sales of assets in the ordinary course of business) equal to
twenty percent (20%) or more of the fair market value of Company\'s
consolidated assets or to which twenty percent (20%) or more of Company\'s net
revenues or net income on a consolidated basis are attributable, (ii) direct
or indirect acquisition of twenty percent (20%) or more of the voting equity
interests of Company, (iii) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated
would result in any Person beneficially owning (within the meaning of Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act) twenty percent (20%) or more of the voting equity
interests of Company, (iv) merger, consolidation, other business combination
or similar transaction involving Company or any of its Subsidiaries, pursuant
to which such Person would own twenty percent (20%) or more of the
consolidated assets, net revenues or net income of Company, taken as a whole,
or (v) liquidation or dissolution (or the adoption of a plan of liquidation or
dissolution) of Company or the declaration or payment of an extraordinary
dividend (whether in cash or other property) by Company. As used in this
Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal that the board of directors of Company reasonably determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and Company financial
advisor), taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of the proposal and the Person or Persons making the proposal, (x) is
more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of Company Common
Stock than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (taking into
account any adjustment to the terms and conditions thereof proposed in writing
by Parent in response to any such Acquisition Proposal), and (y) is reasonably
likely to be completed on the terms proposed on a timely basis; provided that
for purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal," references in the term
"Acquisition Proposal" to "20%" shall be deemed to be references to "a
majority."



(d)Notwithstanding Section 6.9(a), prior to the receipt of the Requisite
Stockholder Approval, the board of directors of Company, directly or
indirectly through any Representative, may participate in negotiations or
discussions with any third party that has made (and not withdrawn) a bona
fide, unsolicited Acquisition Proposal in writing and furnish to such third
party information relating to Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to
an executed confidentiality agreement on terms no more favorable than those in
the Confidentiality Agreement (which confidentiality agreement shall not
constitute a Company Acquisition Agreement and a copy of which confidentiality
agreement shall be promptly provided for informational purposes only to
Parent) if (i) the board of directors of Company determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel and Company's financial advisor,
that the Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a Superior
Proposal, (ii) the board of directors of Company determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to cause the board of directors of Company
to be in breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (iii) the
Company has notified Parent of the receipt of such Acquisition Proposal as
provided in Section 6.9(e).



(e)Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than forty-
eight (48) hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any material
modification of or material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, or any
request for nonpublic information relating to Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of Company or
any of its Subsidiaries by any Person that has made, or to the Knowledge of
Company, may be considering making, an Acquisition Proposal (including any
request from a third party to release or to waive the confidentiality or the
standstill provisions of any agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party). Such notice to Parent shall be made orally and in
writing, and shall indicate the identity of the Person making the Acquisition
Proposal or intending to make or considering making an Acquisition Proposal or
requesting non-public information or access to the books and records of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and the material terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal or modification or amendment to an Acquisition Proposal;
provided that any non-public 

information provided to any Person given such access shall have previously
been provided to Parent or shall be provided to Parent prior to or
concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person. Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed, on a current basis, of any material changes in the
status and any material changes or modifications in the terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request.



(f)Except as set forth in this Section 6.9(f), and subject to Company's
compliance in all material respects with the provisions of this Section 6.9,
the board of directors of Company shall not make any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or enter into (or permit any Subsidiary to enter into)
any Company Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
prior to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, if (i) the board
of directors of Company determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal and financial advisors) that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes
a Superior Proposal and (ii) the board of directors of Company determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, the board of directors of Company may (x) effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to the Superior Proposal and/or (y)
terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(h)(iii) in order to
enter into a definitive Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal.



(g)Prior to effecting any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or entering
into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, (i)
Company shall notify Parent in writing, at least three Business Days prior to
effecting such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or entering into a
Company Acquisition Agreement (the "Notice Period "), of its intention to
effect such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or enter into a Company
Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, which notice shall
include the material terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal and the
identity of the Person making such proposal (it being understood and agreed
that any material amendment to the terms of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new Notice Period of at least two Business Days), (ii) during the
applicable Notice Period, Company shall negotiate with Parent in good faith
(to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement such that the Superior Proposal ceases
to be a Superior Proposal, and (iii) at the end of the Notice Period,
Company's board of directors shall determine in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that such Superior Proposal
has not been withdrawn and continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (taking
into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent).



(h)Company and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other
than Parent and its Representatives) conducted heretofore with respect to any
of the foregoing, and shall direct all Persons (other than Parent and its
Representatives) who have been furnished confidential information regarding
Company in connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding an
Acquisition Proposal within the twelve (12) months prior to the date hereof
promptly to return or destroy such information. Company agrees not to, and to
cause its Subsidiaries not to, release any third party from, and agrees to
enforce, the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any agreement to
which Company or its Subsidiaries is a party that remains in effect as of the
date hereof, and shall immediately take all steps necessary to terminate any
approval that may have been heretofore given under any such provisions
authorizing any Person to make an Acquisition Proposal; provided that the
Company shall not be required to take, or be prohibited from taking, any
action otherwise prohibited by this sentence if the board of directors of
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that taking such action or failing to take such action, as the case
may be, would reasonably be expected to cause the board of directors of
Company to be in breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.



(i)Nothing contained herein shall prevent the board of directors of Company
from disclosing to Company\'s stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal, if Company determines, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that failure to disclose such position would constitute a
violation of applicable Law. Any such disclosure (other than solely a "stop,
look and listen" communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under
the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change unless the board of directors of Company expressly and concurrently
reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation.



6.10 Notification of Certain Actions. Company and Parent shall give prompt
notice to the other of any fact, change, event or circumstance known to it
that (a) is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Company or Parent, respectively, or (b) would cause
or constitute a breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained herein.



6.11 Takeover Provisions. No party shall take any action that would cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to requirements
imposed by any Takeover Provision, and each party shall take all necessary
steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of)
those transactions from, or if necessary challenge the validity or
applicability of, any applicable Takeover Provision, as now or hereafter in
effect.



6.12 Stockholder Litigation. Company shall control, and Company shall give
Parent prompt notice of and the opportunity to participate in the defense of,
any litigation brought by stockholders of Company against Company and/or its
officers or directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided that Company shall not settle or offer to settle any
claim, action, suit, charge, investigation or proceeding against Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors or officers by any
stockholder of Company arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent
of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

6.13 Merger Sub; Parent Subsidiaries; Company Subsidiaries. Parent shall cause
each of Merger Sub and any other applicable Parent Subsidiary to comply with
and perform all of its obligations under or relating to this Agreement,
including in the case of Merger Sub to consummate the First Merger on the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Company shall cause each of
the Company Subsidiaries to comply with and perform all of its obligations
under or relating to this Agreement.



6.14 Tax Representation Letters.



(a)Parent shall (i) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the opinion of
counsel referred to in Section 7.2(d), and (ii) deliver to Alston and Bird LLP,
counsel to Parent, and Haynes and Boone, LLP, counsel to Company, tax
representation letters, dated as of the effective date of the Form S-4 and the
Closing Date, respectively, and signed by an officer of Parent, in form and

Closing Date and such breach is not cured prior to the earlier of (i) the End
Date and (ii) the thirtieth (30th) Business Day after written notice thereof

material breach of any provision of this Agreement. 





8.3 Termination Fee.



(a)In the event that this Agreement is terminated



i.by Parent or Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(e) and, after the date hereof but prior to termination of this

to Section 8.1(e), prior to the breach giving rise to such right of
termination, an Acquisition Proposal has been announced, disclosed, or
otherwise communicated or made known (whether or not publicly) to Company's
board of directors or made known generally to Company\'s stockholders, or any
Person shall have announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make
such an Acquisition Proposal, or



ii.by Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f)(i), and prior to the
Company Stockholder Meeting, an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly
announced, publicly disclosed or otherwise made known generally to Company's
stockholders, or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention
(whether or not conditional) to make such an Acquisition Proposal, and prior
to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination
Company consummates an Acquisition Proposal or enters into a Company
Acquisition Agreement, then Company shall on the earlier of the date an
Acquisition is consummated or any such Company Acquisition Agreement is
executed or agreement entered into, as applicable, pay Parent a fee equal to
$10,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") by wire transfer of immediately available
funds; provided that for purposes of this Section 8.3, each reference to 20%
in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference
to "a majority."



(b)In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
8.1(g) or by Company pursuant to Section 8.1(h)(iii), Company shall pay Parent
the Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
accounts designated by Parent within two (2) Business Days after notice of the
termination of this Agreement.



(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties
hereby acknowledge that in the event that the Termination Fee becomes payable
and is paid by Company pursuant to this Section 8.3, the Termination Fee shall
be Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s sole and exclusive remedy for monetary damages
under this Agreement, and under no circumstances shall Company be obligated to
pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(d)Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if Company fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this
Section 8.3, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit
which results in a judgment against Company for the fee set forth in this
Section 8.3 Company shall pay to Parent its fees and expenses (including
attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount of the fee at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate
published in The Wall Street Journal on the date such payment was required to
be made.

be amended by Parent and Company; provided however, after any approval of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the stockholders of Company,
there may not be, without further approval of such stockholders, 

any amendment of this Agreement that requires such further approval under
applicable Law; provided further, that this Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of Parent and Company.

hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party, but such extension or waiver or failure to exercise any right or to
insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other matter.

FORM OF

STOCKHOLDER VOTING AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT

This Stockholder Voting AND SUPPORT Agreement (this "Agreement") is made and
entered into as of __________ ___, 2014, by and between SOUTHSIDE BANCSHARES,
INC., a Texas corporation ("Parent"), and the undersigned stockholder
("Stockholder") of OmniAmerican Bancorp, Inc., a Maryland corporation
("Company").

RECITALS

A. Concurrently with the execution and delivery hereof, Parent, Omega Merger
Sub, Inc., a Maryland corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Company are entering into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger of even date herewith (as it may be amended or supplemented from time
to time pursuant to the terms thereof, the "Merger Agreement"), which provides
for, among other things, the merger of Merger Sub with and into Company (the
"First Merger"), with Company as the surviving corporation resulting from the
First Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"), and then immediately after the
First Merger and as part of an integrated plan, the merger of the Surviving
Corporation with and into Parent (the "Second Merger" and together with the
First Merger, the "Mergers").

B. Stockholder is the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of such number of shares of each
class of capital stock of Company as is indicated on the signature page of
this Agreement and a director of Company.

C. As a material inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to
enter into the Merger Agreement, Parent has required that Stockholder enter
into this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound, the parties hereby agree as
follows:

1.Certain Definitions. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement. For all
purposes of and under this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
following respective meanings:



"Constructive Sale" means with respect to any security, a short sale with
respect to such security, entering into or acquiring a derivative contract
with respect to such security, entering into or acquiring a futures or forward
contract to deliver such security, or entering into any other hedging or other
derivative transaction that has the effect of either directly or indirectly
materially changing the economic benefits or risks of ownership of such
security.

"Shares" means (i) all shares of capital stock of Company owned, beneficially
or of record, and which Stockholder has the sole right to vote and dispose of,
by Stockholder as of the date hereof, and (ii) all additional shares of
capital stock of Company acquired by Stockholder, beneficially or of record,
and which Stockholder has the sole right to vote and dispose of, during the
period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
expiring on the Expiration Date (as such term is defined in Section 10 below). 

"Transfer" means, with respect to any security, the direct or indirect
assignment, sale, transfer, tender, exchange, pledge, hypothecation, or the
grant, creation, or suffrage of a lien, security interest, or encumbrance in
or upon, or the gift, grant, or placement in trust, or the Constructive Sale
or other disposition of such security (including transfers by testamentary or
intestate succession, by domestic relations order or other court order, or
otherwise by operation of law) or any right, title, or interest therein
(including any right or power to vote to which the holder thereof may be
entitled, whether such right or power is granted by proxy or otherwise), or
the record or beneficial ownership thereof, the offer to make such a sale,
transfer, Constructive Sale, or other disposition, and each agreement,
arrangement, or understanding, whether or not in writing, to effect any of the
foregoing; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit
Stockholder from disposing of or surrendering Shares in connection with the
vesting, settlement or exercise of Company Options or restricted stock of
Company for the payment of taxes thereon or, in the case of Company Options,
the exercise price.

2.Transfer and Voting Restrictions.



(a)At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and expiring on the Expiration Date, Stockholder shall not,
except in connection with the Mergers, Transfer or suffer a Transfer of any of
the Shares.



(b)Except as otherwise permitted by this Agreement or by order of a court of
competent jurisdiction, Stockholder will not commit any act that could
restrict or affect Stockholder's legal power, authority, and right to vote all
of the Shares then owned of record or beneficially by Stockholder or otherwise
prevent or disable Stockholder from performing any of his obligations under
this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except for
this Agreement and as otherwise permitted by this Agreement, Stockholder shall
not enter into any voting agreement with any person or entity with respect to
any of the Shares, grant any person or entity any proxy (revocable or
irrevocable) or power of attorney with respect to any of the Shares, deposit
any of the Shares in a voting trust, or otherwise enter into any agreement or
arrangement with any person or entity limiting or affecting Stockholder's
legal power, authority, or right to vote the Shares in favor of the approval
of the Proposed Transaction (as defined in Section 3(a) herein).



3.Agreement to Vote Shares.



(a)Prior to the Expiration Date, at every meeting of the stockholders of
Company called, and at every adjournment or postponement thereof, and on every
action or approval by written consent of the stockholders of Company (except
for Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on May 27, 2014),
Stockholder (in Stockholder's capacity as such) shall appear at the meeting or
otherwise cause the Shares to be present thereat for purposes of establishing
a quorum and, to the extent not voted by the persons appointed as proxies
pursuant to this Agreement, vote (i) in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement and the approval of the First Merger and the other transactions
contemplated thereby (collectively, the "Proposed Transaction"), (ii) against
the approval or adoption of any proposal made in opposition to, or in
competition with, the Proposed Transaction, and (iii) against any of the
following (to the extent unrelated to the Proposed Transaction): (A) any
merger, consolidation, or business combination involving Company or any of its
subsidiaries other than the Proposed Transaction; (B) any sale, lease, or
transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of Company or any of its
subsidiaries; (C) any reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution,
liquidation, or winding up of Company or any of its subsidiaries; or (D) any
other action that is intended, or could reasonably be expected, to result in a
breach of any covenant, representation, or warranty or any other obligation or
agreement of Company under the Merger Agreement or of Stockholder under this
Agreement or otherwise impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage, or
adversely affect the consummation of the Proposed Transaction. 



(b)If Stockholder is the beneficial owner, but not the record holder, of the
Shares, Stockholder agrees to take all actions necessary to cause the record
holder and any nominees to vote all of the Shares in accordance with Section
3(a).



4.Grant of Irrevocable Proxy.



(a)Stockholder hereby irrevocably appoints Parent and each of its executive
officers or other designees (the "Proxyholders"), as Stockholder's proxy and
attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution and resubstitution), and
grants to the Proxyholders full authority, for and in the name, place, and
stead of Stockholder, to vote the Shares, to instruct nominees or record
holders to vote the Shares, or grant a consent or approval in respect of such
Shares in accordance with Section 3 hereof and, in the discretion of the
Proxyholders, with respect to any proposed adjournments or postponements of
any meeting of Stockholders at which any of the matters described in Section 3
hereof are to be considered.



(b)Stockholder hereby revokes any proxies heretofore given by Stockholder in
respect of the Shares.



(c)Stockholder hereby affirms that the irrevocable proxy set forth in this
Section 4 is given in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement,
and that such irrevocable proxy is given to secure the performance of the
duties of Stockholder under this Agreement. Stockholder hereby further affirms
that the irrevocable proxy is coupled with an interest, is intended to be
irrevocable in accordance with the provisions of Section 2-507 of the Maryland
General Corporation Law, and may under no circumstances be revoked. The
irrevocable proxy granted by Stockholder herein is a durable power of attorney
and shall survive the dissolution, bankruptcy, or incapacity of Stockholder.



(d)The Proxyholders may not exercise this irrevocable proxy on any matter
except as provided in Section 3 above. Stockholder may vote the Shares on all
other matters.



(e)Parent may terminate this proxy at any time by written notice to
Stockholder.



5.No Solicitation. In his, her or its capacity as a stockholder of Company,
and not in his or her capacity as a director or officer of Company, as
applicable (in which capacity Stockholder may act in accordance with Section
6.9 of the Merger Agreement), Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly,
(a) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage, induce, or facilitate the making,
submission, or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal or take any action
that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (b)
furnish any nonpublic information regarding Company or any of its subsidiaries
to any Person in connection with or in response to an Acquisition Proposal or
an inquiry or indication of interest that could reasonably be expected to lead
to an Acquisition Proposal, (c) engage in discussions or negotiations with any
Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (d) approve, endorse, or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (e) enter into any letter of intent or
similar document or any agreement or contract contemplating or otherwise
relating to any Acquisition Proposal.



6.Action in Stockholder Capacity Only. Stockholder is entering into this
Agreement solely in Stockholder's capacity as a record holder and beneficial
owner, as applicable, of Shares and, except as provided in Section 9, not in
Stockholder's capacity as a director or officer of Company. Nothing herein
shall limit or affect Stockholder's ability to act as an officer or director
of Company.

of general applicability as may be provided under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, and the "blue sky" laws of the various States of the United States
and except as would not impair Stockholder's ability to perform his, her or
its obligations under this Agreement, Stockholder is the beneficial or record

interests, mortgages, claims, charges, restrictions, options, title defects,
or encumbrances; and (ii) Stockholder does not beneficially own any securities
of Company other than the shares of capital stock and rights to purchase
shares of capital stock of Company set forth on the signature page of this
Agreement.

(b)As of the date hereof and for so long as this Agreement remains in effect

authority to (i) make, enter into, and carry out the terms of this Agreement

similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and
except that the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance
or injunctive relief is subject to the discretion of the court before which
any proceeding may be brought). The execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the performance by Stockholder of the agreements and obligations hereunder
will not result in any breach or violation of or be in conflict with or
constitute a default under any term of any contract to or by which Stockholder
is a party or bound, or any Law to which Stockholder (or the Shares or any of
Stockholder's other assets) is subject or bound, except for any such breach,
violation, conflict, or default which, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to impair or adversely affect Stockholder's ability
to perform Stockholder's obligations under this Agreement or render inaccurate

entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon Stockholder's execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the representations and warranties of

affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and except that the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive
relief is subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding
may be brought). The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
performance by Parent of the agreements and obligations hereunder will not
result in any breach or violation of or be in conflict with or constitute a
default under any term of any contract to or by which Parent is a party or
bound, or any Law to which Parent is subject or bound, except for any such
breach, violation, conflict, or default which, individually or in the
