   **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION**

 

  This Agreement and Plan of Reorganization ("Agreement") dated as
of December 1, 2006 is by and among Franklin Bank Corp., a Delaware
corporation ("FBC"), FBC Interim Bank, S.S.B., an interim Texas state savings
bank to be formed ("Interim Bank"), and The First National Bank of Bryan, a
national banking association (the "Bank").

 

  WHEREAS, FBC and the Bank believe that the acquisition of the
Bank by FBC in the manner provided by, and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in, this Agreement and all exhibits, schedules and
amendments hereto is desirable and in the best interests of their respective
institutions and shareholders;

 

  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and
the payments and other good and valuable consideration herein provided for,
the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as set
forth below:

 

   **INTRODUCTION**

 

  The Bank is a national banking association chartered under the
National Bank Act of the United States of America (the "NBA"). FBC owns
indirectly all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of
Franklin Bank, S.S.B. ("Franklin"), has elected to be regulated as a savings
and loan holding company under the Home Owners Loan Act, as amended
(the "HOLA"), and is registered with the Texas Savings and Loan Department
(the "Department") as a holding company under Chapter 97 of the Texas Savings
Bank Act (the "TSBA"). Interim Bank will be an interim Texas state savings
bank formed under the TSBA for the purpose of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and will be added as a party to this Agreement prior to the
Effective Time (as hereinafter defined) by means of the Accession Agreement
attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the "Accession Agreement"). This Agreement
provides for the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding common
stock, $1.00 par value, of the Bank (the "Bank Stock"), by FBC through the
consolidation of Interim Bank and the Bank, with the Bank surviving pursuant
to Section 215 of the NBA (the "Consolidation"). Immediately after the
Consolidation, the Bank will be merged with and into Franklin pursuant to
Subchapter H of the TSBA and Section 214a of the NBA (the "Bank Merger"), and
Franklin will continue its existing operations as a state savings bank under
the laws of the State of Texas.

  

  **ARTICLE I. 

THE CONSOLIDATION**

 

  Section 1.1 _The Consolidation_. (a) Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as hereinafter
defined) Interim Bank shall consolidate with the Bank pursuant to Subchapter
H of the TSBA and Section 215 of the NBA, with the Bank surviving. Upon
consummation of the Consolidation, the separate existence of Interim Bank
shall cease. The Bank shall be the surviving bank (the "Consolidated Bank")
in the Consolidation and shall continue its existence as a national banking
association under the laws of the United States of America.    
  

  (b) FBC and the Bank may at any time, by
amendment of this Agreement in accordance with Section 13.6 hereof, change
the method of effecting the combination of Interim Bank and the Bank
(including without limitation the provisions of this Article I) if and to the
extent they deem such change to be desirable.

 

  Section 1.2 _Effective Date and Time of the
Consolidation_. The terms "Effective Date" and "Effective Time" shall be the
date and time, respectively, when the Consolidation becomes effective. The
Effective Time shall be the later of (i) the time and date designated by the
Bank to the OCC as the time and date on which the Consolidation shall be
effective and (ii) the time and date on which the OCC orders this Agreement
to be effective.

 

  Section 1.3 _Effects of the Consolidation_. (a) At the
Effective Time, the separate existence of Interim Bank and the Bank shall
cease and the corporate existence of Interim Bank and the Bank shall continue
as the Consolidated Bank unaffected and unimpaired by the Consolidation; and
the Consolidated Bank shall be deemed to be the same business and corporate
entity as each of Interim Bank and the Bank. At the Effective Time, all
corporate acts, plans, policies, contracts, approvals and authorizations of
the Bank and Interim Bank and their respective shareholders, boards of
directors, committees elected or appointed thereby, officers and agents,
which were valid and effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
be taken for all purposes as the acts, plans, policies, contracts, approvals
and authorizations of the Consolidated Bank and shall be as effective and
binding thereon as the same were with respect to the Bank and Interim Bank,
respectively, as of the Effective Time.

  

  (b) At the Effective Time, all rights,
franchises and interests of the Bank and Interim Bank, respectively, in and
to any type of property and choses in action shall be vested in the
Consolidated Bank by virtue of the Consolidation without any deed or other
transfer. The Consolidated Bank, without any order or other action on the
part of any court or otherwise, shall hold and enjoy all rights of property,
franchises and interests, including appointments, designations
and nominations, and all other rights and interests as trustee,
executor, administrator, transfer agent or registrar of stocks and bonds,
guardian, assignee, receiver and in every other fiduciary capacity, in the
same manner and to the same extent as such rights, franchises and interests
were held or enjoyed by the Bank and Interim Bank, respectively, as of the
Effective Time.

 

  (c) At the Effective Time, the Consolidated
Bank shall be liable for all liabilities of the Bank and Interim Bank. All
debts, liabilities and obligations of the Bank and of Interim Bank,
respectively, accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, and whether or not
reflected or reserved against on balance sheets, books of account or records
of the Bank or Interim Bank, as the case may be, shall be those of the
Consolidated Bank and shall not be released or impaired by the Consolidation.
All rights of creditors and other obligees and all liens on property of
either the Bank or Interim Bank shall be preserved unimpaired.

 

  Section 1.4 _Articles of Association; Bylaws_. At the
Effective Time, the Articles of Association and Bylaws of the Bank shall be
the Articles of Association and Bylaws of the Consolidated Bank until
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.

     
  

  Section 1.5 _Officers and Directors_. At the Effective
Time, the officers of Interim Bank immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the officers of the Consolidated Bank, and the directors of Interim
Bank immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Consolidated Bank, in each case to hold office until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in the manner provided
by the Articles of Association and Bylaws of the Consolidated Bank.

 

  Section 1.6 _Approvals and Notices._ FBC and the Bank
shall proceed expeditiously and cooperate fully in obtaining any consents and
approvals and the taking of any other actions in satisfaction of all other
requirements prescribed by law or otherwise necessary for consummation of the
Consolidation on the terms provided herein, including, without limitation,
the preparation and submission of all necessary filings, certificates and
notices to the Office of Thrift Supervision (the "OTS"), the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"), the Federal Reserve Board (the "FRB"),
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC") and
the Department. This Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of
the Bank for their approval in accordance with applicable provisions of law
and the Articles of Association and Bylaws of the Bank.

 

   **ARTICLE II. 

THE BANK MERGER**

 

  Section 2.1 _The Bank Merger_. Subject to the terms
and conditions of the Plan of Merger attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the
"Bank Merger Agreement") and in accordance with Subchapter H of the TSBA and
Section 214a of the NBA, immediately after the Consolidation the Consolidated
Bank shall be merged with and into Franklin and the separate existence of the
Consolidated Bank shall cease. Franklin shall be the surviving entity in the
Bank Merger and shall continue its existence as a state savings bank under
the laws of the State of Texas (Franklin after the Bank Merger is referred to
herein as both the "Surviving Bank" and "Franklin," as the
context requires).

  

  Section 2.2 _Advisory Board of Directors_. FBC agrees,
promptly after the Effective Time of the Bank Merger, to take all actions
necessary to appoint to the Advisory Board of Directors of Franklin (the
"Advisory Board") each of L.D. Bailey, William D. Barkley, Ron Blatchley,
Timothy N. Bryan, Travis B. Bryan, Jr., Travis B. Bryan, III, Homer R.
Callaway, Steven A. Carr, Ronnie L. Craig, John David Crow, Charles A.
Ellison, Michael H. Gentry, Samuel H. Harrison, David W. Hickson, Michael A.
Holmgreen, Deborah H. Kovacevich, Thomas B. McDade, Hank McQuaide, Ivan M.
Olson, William L. Rayburn, Charles A. Sippial, Sr., Jack M. Threadgill and
Herbert L. Wade (the "Bank Advisory Board Nominees") and, for a 24-month
period thereafter (the "Subject Period"), to cause the Bank Advisory Board
Nominees to continue to be appointed to serve thereon;  _provided_ , that if
during the Subject Period any Bank Advisory Board Nominee shall be subject to
a Disqualification Event (as hereinafter defined), FBCs obligations under
this section to cause such nominee to continue to be appointed to the
Advisory Board during the Subject Period shall terminate, and such nominees
service on the Advisory Board may be terminated.  As used herein, the term
"Disqualification Event" means, as to any Bank Advisory Board Nominee, the
occurrence of any of the following events: (i) such nominee shall be
prohibited by law, order, injunction, decree or otherwise from serving as a

     
  

 director of FBC or Franklin; (ii) such nominee shall have been convicted of
any felony or crime of moral turpitude; (iii) such nominee shall file (or any
entity indebted to Franklin of which such nominee shall have been an
executive officer or controlling person within the two years prior to filing
shall file) a voluntary petition under any federal or state bankruptcy or
insolvency law, or such nominee shall become (or any entity indebted to the
Consolidated Bank of which such nominee shall have been an executive officer
or controlling person within the two years prior to filing shall become) the
subject of an involuntary petition filed under any such law that is not
dismissed within 30 days; (iv) such nominee shall be involved in any of the
events or circumstances enumerated in Item 401(f)(1)-(6) of Regulation S-K
(or any successor or substitute provision of similar import) promulgated by
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), or similar provisions of
state "blue sky" laws; or (v) the occurrence of a default or an event which,
with notice or lapse of time, would constitute a default has occurred and
is continuing under any document related to any indebtedness of such nominee
or any entity of which such nominee shall have been an executive officer
within two years prior to such event or (vi) such nominee shall violate any
covenant or agreement contained in an Officer Non-competition Agreement or a
Director Non-competition Agreement (each as hereinafter defined),
if applicable.

  

  **ARTICLE III. 

CONVERSION AND EXCHANGE OF SHARES **

 

  Section 3.1 _Conversion of Bank Stock_. (a) Subject to
the provisions of this Article III, the aggregate consideration to be paid by
FBC to the Shareholders in the Consolidation shall be $134,000,000 in cash
(the "Aggregate Consolidation Consideration"). The Aggregate Consolidation
Consideration shall be subject to reduction under the circumstances described
in Section 3.1(b).  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Consolidation and
without any action on the part of the Bank, FBC or the holder of any of the
securities thereof.

 

  (b) Subject to the provisions of this Article
III, each share of the Bank Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, except for (i) shares of Bank Stock owned by the Bank as
treasury stock or owned, directly or indirectly, by the Bank, FBC or any of
their respective wholly owned subsidiaries (other than shares of Bank Stock
held, directly or indirectly, in trust accounts, managed accounts or
otherwise held in a fiduciary capacity, that are beneficially owned by third
parties (any such shares, whether held directly or indirectly by the Bank or
FBC or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries, as the case may be,
being referred to herein as "Trust Account Shares") and other than any shares
of Bank Stock held by the Bank or FBC or any of their respective subsidiaries
in respect of a debt previously contracted (any such shares of Bank Stock,
whether held directly or indirectly by the Bank or FBC or any of their
respective wholly owned subsidiaries, being referred to herein as "DPC
Shares")), and (ii) shares of Bank Stock as to which the holders have
perfected their rights as dissenting shareholders in accordance with the
exact procedure required by the NBA (the "Dissenting Shares"), shall be
converted into and represent the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
the Aggregate Consolidation Consideration, as such amount may be reduced
pursuant to Section 3.1(b) hereof, divided by the number of shares of Bank
Stock outstanding at the Effective Time (the "Per Share Consideration").

      
  

  (c) In the event that the Banks shareholders
equity as of the Closing Date shall be less than $36,500,000 as calculated
under Section 11.6 of this Agreement and FBC elects to waive satisfaction of
such condition and consummate the Consolidation, the Aggregate Consolidation
Consideration shall be redetermined by reducing the Aggregate Consolidation
Consideration by the product of (i) the difference between $36,500,000 and
the amount of the Banks actual shareholders equity calculated and certified
in the manner required by Section 11.6 of this Agreement, multiplied by (ii)
3.67 (the "Capital Deficiency Amount"). The Aggregate
Consolidation Consideration, as so redetermined and reduced by the Capital
Deficiency Amount, is referred to herein as the "Adjusted Aggregate
Consolidation Consideration."

 

  (d) All shares of Bank Stock that are owned,
directly or indirectly, by FBC or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries (other
than Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares) shall be canceled and shall cease
to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

  (e) Each share of Bank Stock converted into
the right to receive the Consolidation Consideration pursuant to this Article
III shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, as of the Effective Time, and each certificate
previously representing any such shares of Bank Stock (each a "Certificate")
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Consolidation
Consideration.

 

  Section 3.2 _Interim Bank Capital Stock_. At and after
the Effective Time, each share of common stock of Interim Bank issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into a
like number of shares of common stock of the Consolidated Bank, and shall
represent 100% of the capital stock of the Consolidated Bank.

  

  Section 3.3 _Exchange Procedure_. (a) On or
immediately prior to the Effective Date, FBC shall deposit in trust with, or
otherwise make available to, The Bank of New York, as exchange agent (the
"Exchange Agent"), for exchange in accordance with this Agreement, cash
sufficient to pay the Aggregate Consolidation Consideration (excluding any
Dissenting Shares).

 

  (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Bank Stock a
letter of transmittal in substantially the form attached to this Agreement as
_Exhibit C_ and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
certificates representing Bank Stock in exchange for the Per Share
Consideration (the "Letter of Transmittal").

 

  (c) Each holder of Bank Stock, upon surrender
of the certificates therefor to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by duly
executed Letters of Transmittal, shall be entitled to receive a check
representing the amount of Per Share Consideration which such holder has the
right to receive hereunder. Each certificate representing shares of Bank
Stock so surrendered shall be cancelled. Until so surrendered, each
certificate representing Bank Stock will be deemed for all corporate purposes
after the Effective Time to represent and evidence solely the right to
receive the Per Share Consideration to be paid therefor pursuant to this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any
other party hereto shall be liable to any holder of certificates representing
Bank Stock for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Except as
required by law, no interest shall be payable with respect to the Per Share
Consideration or the

     
  

 cash payable for Dissenting Shares. If any shareholder of record of
the Bank is unable to locate any certificate evidencing shares of Bank Stock
to be surrendered for exchange, the Exchange Agent shall deliver the
applicable amount of the Per Share Consideration to the registered
shareholder upon receipt of a lost certificate affidavit and an indemnity
agreement in a form acceptable to FBC.

 

  (d) FBC shall use its best efforts to cause
the Exchange Agent to deliver the Per Share Consideration within five
business days following the receipt by the Exchange Agent of the certificates
and the duly executed Letters of Transmittal.

 

  Section 3.4 _Dissenting Shares_. Each share of Bank
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
holder of which has not voted in favor of the Consolidation and who has
properly perfected his dissenters rights of appraisal by following the exact
procedure required by the NBA, is referred to herein as a "Dissenting Share."
Each Dissenting Share owned by each holder thereof who has not exchanged his
certificates representing shares of Bank Stock for the Consolidation
Consideration or otherwise has not effectively withdrawn or lost his
dissenters rights, shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive the Consolidation Consideration pursuant to this Article III and
shall be entitled only to such rights as are available to such holder
pursuant to the applicable provisions of the NBA. Each holder of Dissenting
Shares shall be entitled to receive the value of such Dissenting Shares held
by him in accordance with the applicable provisions of the NBA; _provided_ ,
such holder complies with the procedures contemplated by and set forth in the
applicable provisions of the NBA. If any holder of any Dissenting Shares
shall effectively withdraw or lose his dissenters rights under the
applicable provisions of the NBA, each such Dissenting Share shall
be converted into the right to receive the Consolidation Consideration
in accordance with the provisions of this Article III.

All securities in the Securities Portfolio are owned by the Bank, of record
and beneficially, free and clear of all mortgages, liens, pledges, security
interests and encumbrances, except as disclosed in _Schedule 4.4_. The list

  Section 4.5 _Financial Statements_. (a) _Schedule

sheets and related statements of income, changes in shareholders equity and
cash flows, as of and for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
accompanied by the report thereon of McGladrey and Pullen, LLP dated January
19, 2006 (the "Annual Financial Statements"), and (ii) unaudited balance

are collectively referred to herein as the "Bank Financial Statements." The
Annual Financial Statements fairly present the financial position of the Bank
and the results of its operations at the dates and for the periods indicated
therein in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")
applied consistently during the periods covered thereby. The Interim
Financial Statements fairly present the financial position of the Bank and
the results of its operations at the dates and for the periods indicated in
conformity with GAAP consistently applied during the periods covered thereby,
except that the Interim Financial Statements are subject to normal year end
adjustments required by GAAP, which will not be material. As of their
respective dates, the Call Reports complied with the rules and regulations of
applicable federal and state banking authorities and did not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

 

  (b) As of the dates of the Bank Financial
Statements and as of the date of this Agreement, the Bank did not have any
liabilities, fixed or contingent, which are material and are not fully
reflected or provided for in the Bank Financial Statements or otherwise

  (c) Since September 30, 2006, (i) the business

prior practices, and (ii) no event, condition or circumstance has occurred
which, individually or in the aggregate, has had or could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Bank.

 

  Section 4.6 _Real Property_. (a) _Schedule 4.6_
contains a true, correct and complete list of all real property owned or
leased by the Bank, including non-residential other real estate (the "Bank
Real Property").  Within five business days following the date of this

of all deeds, surveys, title insurance policies and leases for each of the
properties listed on  _Schedule 4.6_, and (ii) true, correct and complete
copies of all mortgages, deeds of trust or security agreements to which such
property is subject.

 

  (b) No lease or deed with respect to any Bank
Real Property contains any restrictive covenant that materially restricts the
use, transferability or value of such Bank Real Property. Each of such leases
is a legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable in accordance with its
terms (except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally
and the availability of equitable remedies), and is in full force and effect;
there are no existing material defaults by the Bank or, to the knowledge of
the Bank, the other party thereunder, and, to the knowledge of the Bank,
there are no allegations or assertions of such by any party under such
agreement or any events, acts or omissions that with notice or lapse of time
or the happening or occurrence, or failure to occur, of any other event would
constitute a material default thereunder.

  

  (c) To the knowledge of the Bank, none of the
buildings and structures located on any Bank Real Property, nor any
appurtenances thereto or equipment therein, nor the operation or maintenance
thereof, violates in any material manner any restrictive covenants or
encroaches on any property owned by others, nor does any building or
structure of third parties encroach upon any Bank Real Property, except for
those violations and encroachments which in the aggregate could
not reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Effect on the Bank.
No condemnation proceeding is pending or, to the Banks knowledge,
threatened, which would preclude or materially impair the use of any Bank
Real Property in the manner in which it is currently being used.

 

  (d) The Bank has good and indefeasible title
to, or a valid and enforceable leasehold interest in, all Bank Real Property
and all improvements thereon, and all personal and intangible properties
reflected in the Banks unaudited statement of condition dated as of
September 30, 2006 (as included in the Interim Financial Statements) or
acquired subsequent thereto, subject to no liens, mortgages, security
interests, encumbrances or charges of any kind except (i) as noted in the
Interim Financial Statements, (ii) statutory liens not yet delinquent, (iii)
minor defects and irregularities in title and encumbrances which do not
materially impair the use thereof for the purposes for which they are held,
and (iv) those assets and properties disposed of for fair market value in the
ordinary course of business since the date of the Interim
Financial Statements.

 

  (e) All buildings and other facilities used in
the business of the Bank are in adequate condition (ordinary wear and tear
excepted) and, are free from defects which could materially interfere with
the current or, to the Banks knowledge, future use of such facilities
consistent with past practices.

      
  

  Section 4.7 _Environmental Laws_. Except as set forth
in _Schedule 4.7_ , the Bank is and has been in compliance with all terms and
conditions of all applicable federal and state Environmental Laws (as
hereinafter defined) and permits thereunder except for such noncompliance as
would not reasonably be expected to give rise, individually or in the
aggregate, to a Material Adverse Effect on the Bank. Except as set forth in
_Schedule 4.7_ , the Bank (i) has not received any written notice or
allegation of any violation of any Environmental Laws or Occupational HandS
Laws (as hereinafter defined) by the Bank, which has not been resolved, (ii)
has not generated, stored, or disposed of any materials designated as
Hazardous Materials (as hereinafter defined) under applicable Environmental
Laws, except in material compliance with Environmental Laws, and (iii) has
not been served in writing with any claim or lien asserted against the Bank
under any Environmental Laws or Occupational HandS Laws or relating to
Hazardous Materials. Except as disclosed in _Schedule 4.7_ , no release (as

42 U.S.C. 9601(22)(A) and (C)) of Hazardous Materials has occurred at or from
any real estate during the term of the ownership, lease or operation thereof
by the Bank for which applicable Environmental Laws required or require
notice to any third party, further investigation, or response action of any
material nature by the Bank, and no condition exists at any real
estate currently owned, leased or operated by the Bank for which the
applicable Environmental Laws required or require notice to any third party,
further investigation, or response action of any material nature by the Bank.
The Bank has not directed, controlled or overseen the management of
environmental matters of any borrower or any real estate in which the Bank
holds or has held a security interest so as to cause the Bank to act outside
the exclusion under 42 U.S.C. § 9601(20)(E) or any other analogous provisions
under applicable Environmental Law. To the knowledge of the Bank, no asbestos
is now or has been contained in any facility owned, leased or operated by the
Bank. No real property currently owned, leased or operated by the Bank is, or
has been, used as a gas station or a landfill during the tenure of the Bank
or, to the knowledge of the Bank, prior to such tenure. Within five business
days following the date of this Agreement, the Bank will furnish FBC true
and complete copies of all environmental assessments, reports, studies and
other similar documents or information in its possession or control relating
to each real property presently owned, sold within the last five years,
leased or operated by the Bank ("Existing Environmental Reports"). The Bank

pending, or which could be brought against the Bank, could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Bank or could question the
validity of any action taken or to be taken in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby. The Bank is not in default with

on the Bank Financial Statements as of and for the period ended September 30,
2006 is, and the reserve for possible loan losses shown on the Bank Financial
Statements as of any date subsequent to the execution of this Agreement will

there are no loans of the Bank that have been classified by bank examiners on
the Banks most recent examination report as "Other Assets Specially
Mentioned," "Substandard," "Doubtful" or "Loss."

 

  Section 4.16 _Employment Relations_. The relations of
the Bank with its employees are satisfactory. The Bank has not received any
notice of any controversies with, or organizational efforts or other pending
actions by, representatives of its employees, nor is there any indication of
the foregoing occurring. The Bank has complied with all laws relating to the
employment of labor with respect to its employees, including any provisions
thereof relating to wages, hours, collective bargaining and the payment of
workers compensation insurance and social security and similar taxes and no

employees, or former employees, consultants or former consultants, officers
or former officers, directors or former directors of it, which are now in

"Compensation and Benefit Plans"). The Bank does not have any commitment to
create any additional Compensation and Benefit Plan, to terminate, modify or
change (other than as required by law or this Agreement) or not to terminate,
modify or change any existing Compensation and Benefit Plan.

 

  (b) Each Compensation and Benefit Plan is in
compliance in all material respects, in form and in administration, with the

Act, and any regulations or rules promulgated thereunder, and all material
filings, disclosures and notices required by ERISA, the Code, the federal
securities laws, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and any other

Compensation and Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Pension Plan") and is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
qualified determination letter from the IRS or, in the case of a "prototype
plan," may rely on a favorable opinion letter from the IRS, and the Bank
knows of no reason why such determination letter would be revoked, nor knows
of any events which could affect the tax-qualified status of such Pension
Plan and that could not be remedied pursuant to the Employee Plans Compliance
Resolution System maintained by the IRS. There is no pending or, to the
knowledge of the Bank, threatened legal action, suit or claim relating to any
of the Compensation and Benefit Plans (other than routine claims for
benefits). No transaction or omission with respect to any Compensation and
Benefit Plan has occurred or exists that would be a violation of Section 4975
of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA that is not exempt under Code Section
4975 or ERISA Section 502(i).

  

  (c) There is no pending investigation or
enforcement action by the Department of Labor or the IRS or any other
governmental authority with respect to any Compensation and Benefit Plan, nor
does the Bank have knowledge of, or any indication of, any such investigation
or enforcement action occurring.

 

  (d) All contributions or insurance premiums
required to be made under the terms of any Compensation and Benefit Plan
whether or not established under any collective bargaining agreement to which
the Bank or any entity, trade or business that is a member of a controlled
group described in Section 414(b), (c), (n) or (o) of the Code or Section
4001(b)(l) of ERISA that includes the Bank ("ERISA Affiliate") is a party
have been timely made or will be timely made prior to the Effective Time. No
event has occurred or circumstances exists that could result in an increase
in premium cost of Compensation and Benefit Plans that are insured, or an
increase in benefit costs of Compensation and Benefit Plans that are self-
funded.

 

  (e) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.17(e)_
and any actions taken to comply with Section 11.8 of this Agreement, with

Plan"): (i) the Bank and each ERISA Affiliate have satisfied the minimum

     
  

 funding standard, and has made all contributions required, under
ERISA Section 302 and Section 412 of the Code; (ii) the Bank and each
ERISA Affiliate have paid all amounts due to the PBGC pursuant to
ERISA Section 4007; (iii) neither the Bank nor any ERISA Affiliate has filed
a notice of intent to terminate any Title IV Plan or has adopted any
amendment to treat a Title IV Plan as terminated, and the PBGC has not
instituted proceedings to treat any Title IV Plan as terminated; (iv) no
event has occurred or circumstance exists that may constitute grounds under
ERISA Section 4042 for the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to
administer, any Title IV Plan; (v) no accumulated funding deficiency, whether
or not waived, exists with respect to any Title IV Plan, and no event has
occurred or circumstance exists that may result in an accumulated funding
deficiency as of the last day of the current plan year of any such Title IV
Plan; (vi) the actuarial report for each Title IV Plan of the Bank and each
ERISA Affiliate fairly presents the financial condition and the results of
operations of each such Title IV Plan in accordance with GAAP; (vii) since
the last valuation date for each Title IV Plan of the Bank and each ERISA
Affiliate, no event has occurred or circumstance exists that would increase
the amount of benefits under any such Title IV Plan or that would cause the
excess of Title IV Plan assets over benefit liabilities (as defined in ERISA
Section 4001) to decrease, or the amount by which benefit liabilities exceed
assets to increase; (viii) no reportable event (as defined in ERISA Section
4043 and in regulations issued thereunder) has occurred; and (ix) there are
no facts or circumstances that may give rise to any liability of the Bank,
any ERISA Affiliate, FBC, Interim Bank or their affiliates to the PBGC under
Title IV of ERISA.

  

  (f) There is no "employee benefit plan" within
the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA sponsored, maintained or contributed to
by an ERISA Affiliate which could reasonably be expected to cause any
liability for the Bank, FBC, Interim Bank or their affiliates.

 

  (g) The Bank does not have any obligation to
provide retiree health or life insurance or other retiree death benefits
under any Compensation and Benefit Plan, other than benefits mandated by
Section 4980B of the Code and Sections 601-609 of ERISA. There has been no
written or oral communication to employees or former employees by the Bank
that promises or guarantees such employees or former employees retiree health
or life insurance or other retiree death benefits on a permanent basis. The
Bank may terminate or amend any Compensation and Benefit Plan in which the
Banks or its affiliates employees or former employees participate at any
time without incurring any liability thereunder. The plan administrator of
each Compensation and Benefit Plan in which such employees or former
employees participate has the sole discretion to construe and interpret the
terms of such plan.

 

  (h) The Bank does not maintain any
Compensation and Benefit Plans covering foreign employees.

thereto, (ii) trust instruments and insurance contracts, (iii) Forms 5500
filed with the IRS for the last three plan years and accompanying schedules,
if any, (iv) the most recent summary plan description and any other
communication to employees regarding such benefits, including employee

consummation of the Consolidation as contemplated by this Agreement will not,

termination of employment prior to or following the Effective Time) (i)
result in the vesting or acceleration of the payment of any benefits under
any Compensation and Benefit Plan, (ii) result in any increase in benefits
payable or compensation payable to a participant or service provider under
any Compensation and Benefit Plan, (iii) result in the payment of any
severance separation benefit, or (iv) result in a breach or violation of any
Compensation and Benefit Plan.

 

  (k) As a result, directly or indirectly, of
the Consolidation as contemplated by this Agreement (including, without
limitation, as a result of any termination of employment prior to or
following the Effective Time), none of FBC, Franklin or the Bank will be
obligated to make a payment that would be characterized as a "parachute
payment" to an individual who is a "disqualified individual" (as such terms
are defined in Section 280G of the Code), without regard to whether such
payment is reasonable compensation for personal services performed or to be
performed in the future with respect to any benefit plan or agreement of the
Bank.

 

  (l) Neither the Bank nor any ERISA Affiliate
is a party to, nor has it ever made any contribution to or otherwise incurred
or could incur any obligation under, any "multiemployer plan," as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA.

  

  (m) There are no voluntary employee benefit
associations related to any Compensation and Benefit Plan under Section
501(c)(9) of the Code.

any insurance company that are held by a Compensation and Benefit Plan of the
Bank.

Loan, were solicited, originated and currently exist in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable requirements of federal and state law
and regulations promulgated thereunder. The Loans are adequately documented
in the opinion of management of the Bank and each note evidencing a Loan or
credit agreement or security instrument related to a Loan to the Banks
knowledge constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the obligor

the failure thereof, individually or in the aggregate, would not have
a Material Adverse Effect on the

      
  

 Bank; _provided_ that the Bank makes no representation regarding the
collectibility of such Loans. The Bank has not entered into any oral
modifications or amendments or additional agreements related to the Loans that
are not reflected in the Banks records. No claim or defense as to the
enforcement of any Loan has been asserted, and the Bank is not aware of any
acts or omissions that would give rise to any claim or right of rescission,

comments. The Bank has a rating of "outstanding" as of its most recent CRA
compliance examination and the Bank knows of no reason why it would not
receive a rating of "satisfactory" or better pursuant to its next CRA

result of any act or omission of the Bank under the CRA.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) the Bank agrees that
its obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Bank
Shareholder Meeting, as required by this Section 6.1, shall not be affected

the Bank of any Acquisition Transaction (as hereinafter defined).

 

  Section 6.2 _Best Efforts; Information for
Applications; Consents_. (a) The Bank will take all reasonable action to aid
and assist in the consummation of the Consolidation and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and will use its best efforts to take or cause to be

  (b) To the extent permitted by law, the Bank

been reviewed by McGladrey and Pullen, LLP in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards and the Bank will furnish FBC with a copy of such
review report. All information concerning the Bank and the Banks
shareholders contained in the FBC applications and filings shall, to the
knowledge of the Bank, at the time such information is furnished, be true and
correct and will not omit any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,

deemed to modify information as of an earlier date.

 

  (c) The Bank will indemnify and hold harmless

regulations or otherwise, including expenses incurred in enforcing the rights
granted under this Section 6.2 against the Bank, and will reimburse FBC for
any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with
investigating, defending or prosecuting any actions whether or not resulting
in liability, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, expenses, liabilities
or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in any of the FBC Applications
or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary in order
to make the statements therein not misleading, but only insofar as
such statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity
with information furnished in writing by the Bank for use therein.

The Bank shall not, before or after the consummation or termination of this

information for its own purposes or for the benefit of any person, firm,

FBC Representative with notice of such proposed action and the FBC
Representative shall not object to such proposed action within two business

opportunity to make such reasonable investigation as it shall desire to make
of the affairs of the Bank; _provided_ , that such investigations shall be
conducted in a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with the operations
of the Bank, and the officers of the Bank will furnish FBC with such
additional financial and operating data and other information as to the
business and properties of the Bank as FBC shall, from time to time, request;
_and provided further_ , that no such investigation or the knowledge obtained
as a result of such investigation shall affect in any way the representations
and warranties of the Bank contained in this Agreement or limit in any way
the right of FBC to make any claim under this Agreement. As soon as
practicable after they become available, the Bank will deliver or make
available to FBC all unaudited financial statements prepared for the internal
use of the Board of Directors of the Bank and all Call Reports filed by the
Bank with the OCC or the FDIC after the date of this Agreement. All such

as the case may be) applied on a basis consistent with previous accounting
periods. In the event of the termination of this Agreement, FBC will return
to the Bank all documents and other information obtained pursuant hereto,
including all copies thereof, and will keep any information obtained pursuant
to this Agreement confidential in accordance with Section 7.3 of this
Agreement.

  Section 6.7 _Standstill Provision_. Neither the Bank
nor any of its directors, officers, agents or representatives shall directly
or indirectly take any action to solicit, initiate, encourage or facilitate
the making of any inquiries with respect to, or provide any information to,

any proposal which could reasonably be expected to lead to, (i) a merger,
consolidation, acquisition, statutory share exchange or similar transaction
involving the Bank, (ii) the disposition, by sale, lease, exchange or
otherwise, of assets or deposits of the Bank representing ten percent or more

exchange or otherwise) of securities representing ten percent or more of the
voting power of the Bank. The Bank agrees to notify FBC orally immediately,
and in writing within one (1) business day, after receipt of any unsolicited
inquiries or proposals for any of the foregoing transactions and provide
reasonable detail as to the identity of the person making such proposal and
the nature of such proposal. The Bank will immediately cease and cause to be

with those followed by Franklin, including appropriate increases in its
allowance for loan losses; provided that the effect of any action

Bank may request in writing. FBC shall keep confidential and not disclose all
or any part, and shall cause its contractors, consultants, agents and
representatives to keep confidential and not disclose all or any part, of all

  (e) FBC shall reimburse the Bank for all
losses, expenses, damages, fines, reasonable attorney fees, expert witness
fees or other legal costs to the extent they arise from the negligence of FBC

of any pre-existing environmental conditions.

coverage) for each of the directors and officers of the Bank currently
covered under comparable policies held by the Bank; _provided_ , that the
cost of such coverage shall be included as a Transaction Expense and will
reduce the Banks shareholders equity as set forth in Section 11.6. FBC may
not cancel, modify or take any action to limit or terminate the coverage
obtained pursuant to this section, unless it replaces such coverage with
coverage provided by insurers having the same or better rating, coverage and
aggregate limits.

  

  Section 6.13 _Audited Bank Financial Statements_. The

  (b) Any disclosure schedules of the Bank (the
"Bank Disclosure Schedules") or other information and documents required to
be delivered by the Bank pursuant to this Agreement that are not delivered to
FBC contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement must be prepared
containing information as of the date of this Agreement, dated and signed by
the Bank and delivered to FBC no later than the close of business on the
fifth business day following the date of this Agreement.

 

  (c) From time to time prior to the Effective
Date, the Bank shall promptly supplement and amend the Bank Disclosure
Schedules to reflect any matter hereafter arising that would make any
representation or warranty set forth in Article IV inaccurate. For purposes
of determining (i) the fulfillment of the condition set forth in Section 11.1
as of the Closing Date and (ii) the accuracy of the representations and
warranties contained in Article IV if the Consolidation is not consummated,
the Bank Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to include only the information
contained therein on the date of this Agreement and shall be deemed to
exclude any information contained in any subsequent supplement or amendment
thereto; _provided_ that any Bank Disclosure Schedule delivered within five
business days following the date of this Agreement pursuant to Section
6.16(b) shall be deemed to be delivered on and as of the date of this
Agreement and shall not be deemed to be a supplement or amendment. If the
Consolidation is not consummated, delivery of any supplemental disclosure
schedules pursuant to this section will not affect the rights and remedies of
the parties hereunder. For purposes of determining the accuracy of the
representations and warranties contained in Article IV if the Consolidation
is consummated, the Bank Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to include all
information contained in any supplement or amendment thereto made before the
Closing Date. If any supplement to any Bank Disclosure Schedule shall be
delivered within five days of the Closing Date, at the option of FBC the
Closing Date may be delayed to permit FBC to have a period of at least
five days to consider such supplement.

  

  Section 6.17 _Equity Deduction Amount_. In the event
that prior to the Effective Date, (i) the case identified on Schedule 4.8
(the "Identified Litigation") has not been finally disposed of (either by
settlement and dismissal with prejudice or by entry of a judgment that
subsequently becomes final and unappealable) ("Final Disposition") and any
potential disputes with the Banks insurer with respect to such matter have
not been finally resolved ("Insurance Resolution") or (ii) a Final
Disposition of the Identified Litigation has been obtained but an Insurance
Resolution has not been obtained, the Bank will accrue for or expense, as
required by GAAP, and deduct as an expense from its shareholders equity for
the purpose of the calculation set forth in Section 11.6, an amount (the
"Equity Litigation Deduction Amount") equal to the greater of (A) the sum of
the

     
  

 amount set forth on Schedule 6.17 and $150,000 or (B) the sum of the amount
paid for the Final Disposition of the Identified Litigation and $150,000.
FBC will establish an interest accrual account in respect of the Equity
Litigation Deduction Amount and will accrue interest on the Equity Litigation
Deduction Amount at the target federal funds rate (the "Interest
Component"). 

 

  Section 6.18 _Notice of Certain Events_. The Bank will
promptly give notice to FBC of the occurrence of any event or the failure of
any event to occur that results in a breach of any representation or warranty
by the Bank contained herein or a failure by the Bank to comply with any
covenant, condition or agreement contained herein.

 

  Section 6.19 _Additional Covenants_. The Bank will
not, without the prior written consent of FBC, take any action that would
result in any of its representations and warranties contained in Article IV
of this Agreement not being true and correct at the Effective Time.

  

  **ARTICLE VII. 

COVENANTS OF FBC**

 

  From the date hereof through the Effective Time, or as otherwise
provided, FBC covenants and agrees with the Bank as follows:

 

  Section 7.1 _Best Efforts_. As promptly as practicable
after the date hereof, FBC will prepare and file all necessary applications
with the Department, the OTS, the FDIC and the OCC. FBC will take all
reasonable action to aid and assist in the consummation of the Consolidation
and the transactions contemplated hereby, and will use its best efforts to
take or cause to be taken all other actions necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the matters contemplated by this Agreement, including such actions
which are necessary, proper or advisable in connection with filing
applications or notices with, or obtaining approvals from, all regulatory
authorities having jurisdiction over the matters contemplated by this
Agreement and the Consolidation, including any applications or notices
required to be filed with the OCC. FBC and Interim Bank will deliver to the
Bank, prior to filing, drafts of such governmental applications and notices
and will promptly deliver, after such filing, a complete copy of such
filings. FBC and Interim Bank shall use their respective best efforts to
obtain or cause to be obtained consents of all third parties necessary
to permit FBC to consummate the transactions contemplated herein.
All documents that FBC or Interim Bank are responsible for filing with
any regulatory or governmental agency in connection with the Consolidation
will comply in all material respects with the provisions of applicable law.
FBC will promptly notify the Bank of any oral or written notice or action of
any regulatory agency and provide the Bank with a copy of any written
communication sent by any regulatory agency concerning or affecting the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

  Section 7.2 _Information for Applications and Proxy
Solicitation_. To the extent permitted by law, FBC will furnish the Bank with
all information concerning FBC and its directors and officers required for
inclusion in (i) any application, statement or document to be made or filed
by the Bank with any federal or state regulatory or supervisory authority in
connection with the matters contemplated by this Agreement (the "Bank
Applications") and (ii) any proxy materials to be furnished to the
shareholders of the Bank in connection with their

      
  

 consideration of the Consolidation, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All information so furnished
shall, to the knowledge of FBC, at the time such information is furnished, be
true and correct in all material respects and will not omit any material fact
necessary in order to make its statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ , that
information as of a later date shall be deemed to modify information as of an
earlier date. FBC will indemnify and hold harmless the Bank from and against
any and all losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities to which the
Bank may become subject under applicable laws, rules and regulations or
otherwise, including expenses incurred in enforcing the rights granted under
this Section 7.2, and will reimburse the Bank for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating, defending or
prosecuting any actions whether or not resulting in liability, insofar as
such losses, claims, damages, expenses, liabilities or actions arise out of
or are based on any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact contained in any of the Bank Applications or any proxy
materials or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission
to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, but only insofar as such statement or
omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with
information furnished by FBC in writing for use therein.

 

  Section 7.3 _Confidentiality; Nonsolicitation_. (a)
FBC shall not before or after the consummation or termination of this
Agreement, directly or indirectly (i) disclose any confidential information
acquired from the Bank, either before or after the date of this Agreement, to
any person, firm, corporation, association or other entity for any reason or
purpose whatsoever, other than in connection with the regulatory notice and
application process or (ii) after termination of this Agreement, use such
information for its own purposes or for the benefit of any person, firm,
corporation, association, or other entity under any circumstances. All
information furnished previously or currently by the Bank in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or pursuant hereto shall
be treated as the sole property of the Bank until consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and, if such transactions shall not occur,
FBC shall either destroy or return to the Bank all documents or other
materials containing, reflecting or referring to such information, shall use
its best efforts to keep confidential all such information, and shall not
directly or indirectly use such information for any competitive or other
commercial purposes. The obligations contained in this Section 7.3(a) shall
survive any termination of this Agreement until the second anniversary of the
termination of this Agreement.

  

  (b) In the event that this Agreement is
terminated and the Consolidation is not consummated, for a period of two
years from the date the Agreement is terminated, FBC agrees that it will not,
without the prior approval of the Bank, directly or indirectly solicit for
employment or hire any current officer or manager of the Bank on the date the
Agreement is terminated; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the foregoing shall
not apply to (i) the use of an independent employment agency (so long as the
agency was not directed to solicit a particular individual or class of
individuals that could only be satisfied by employees of the Bank as of the
date the Agreement is terminated), or (ii) the use of a general solicitation
(such as an advertisement) not specifically directed to employees of the
Bank.

     
  

  Section 7.4 _Press Releases_. FBC agrees that it will
not, directly or indirectly, without the prior approval of the Bank, issue
any press release or written statement for public release relating to the
Agreement or the Consolidation, except as otherwise required by applicable
law or regulation, and then only after making reasonable efforts to notify
the Bank in advance.

 

  Section 7.5 _Director and Officer Indemnification_.

 

  (a) For six years after the Effective Date,
and subject to the limitations contained in applicable OTS and FDIC
regulations and to any limitations contained in the Banks Articles of
Association on the Effective Date, FBC shall cause Franklin to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the present and former officers, directors,
employees and agents of the Bank (each, an "Indemnified Party") against all
losses, expenses, claims, damages, judgments, fines or liabilities arising
out of actions or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Date
(including, without limitation, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) to the full extent then permitted under applicable law and by the
Banks Articles of Association and Bylaws in effect on the date of
this Agreement, including provisions relating to the advancement of
expenses;  _provided_ , that no such Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to indemnification under this Section 7.5 in respect of any event which
constitutes a breach of this Agreement or in respect of which such
Indemnified Party has received or is entitled to receive an improper personal
benefit.  

  

  (b) This Section 7.5 shall survive the closing
of the transactions contemplated hereby for a period of six years, is
intended to benefit each Indemnified Party (each of whom shall be entitled to
enforce this Section 7.5 against the Bank or FBC, as the case may be) and
shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Bank and FBC. In the
event FBC or the Bank or any of their successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of FBC or the Bank assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 7.5.

 

  Section 7.6 _Supplements to Disclosure Schedules_.
From time to time prior to the Effective Date, FBC shall create, supplement
and amend one or more schedules to this Agreement for the purpose of
reflecting any matter hereafter arising that would make any representation or
warranty set forth in Article V inaccurate (the "FBC Disclosure Schedules").
For purposes of determining (i) the fulfillment of the condition set forth in
Section 10.1 as of the Closing Date and (ii) the accuracy of the
representations and warranties contained in Article V if the Consolidation is
not consummated, the FBC Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to include only
the information contained therein on the date of this Agreement and shall be
deemed to exclude any information contained in any subsequent supplement or
amendment thereto. If the Consolidation is not consummated, delivery of any
supplemental disclosure schedules pursuant to this section will not affect
the rights and remedies of the parties hereunder.  For purposes of
determining the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in
Article V if the Consolidation is consummated, the FBC Disclosure Schedules
shall be deemed to include all information contained in any supplement or
amendment thereto made before the Closing Date. If any supplement to any FBC
Disclosure Schedule shall be delivered within five days of the Closing Date,
at the option of the Bank the Closing Date may be delayed to permit the Bank
to have a period of at least ten days to consider such supplement.

      
  

  Section 7.7 _Identified Litigation Disposition;
Shareholder Payment_.

 

  (a) In the event that there is not a Final
Disposition of the Identified Litigation as provided in Section 6.17 or an
Insurance Resolution as of the Effective Date, after the Effective Date FBC
shall, in consultation with, and with the agreement of, the Shareholder
Representative (as defined below), use its commercially reasonable best
efforts to (i) obtain a Final Disposition of the Identified Litigation and/or
(ii) obtain an Insurance Resolution, as the case may be; provided, that FBC
shall not be required to spend more than $150,000 in its efforts to obtain a
Final Disposition and/or an Insurance Resolution. In the event that after the
Effective Time there is both a Final Disposition of the Identified Litigation
and an Insurance Resolution, then an amount (the "Shareholder Payment
Amount") equal to (i) the Equity Litigation Deduction Amount, plus any
recoveries related to the Insurance Resolution, and plus the Interest
Component, less (ii) all costs, expenses, expenditures, assessments, charges,
claims judgments obligations and liabilities, including reasonable attorneys
fees and costs, court costs and expenses of investigation, defense and
prosecution related to such Final Disposition and Insurance Resolution, shall
be paid to the former holders of Bank Stock as set forth in Section 7.7(c).

 

  (b) In the event FBC has spent more than
$150,000 and both a Final Disposition of the Identified Litigation and an
Insurance Resolution has not been obtained, FBC shall make a good faith
determination in its sole discretion as to whether to proceed in its efforts
to obtain such a Final Disposition and/or an Insurance Resolution, as the
case may be. If FBC elects to proceed in such efforts, any additional
expenses incurred by FBC shall be deducted from the Shareholder Payment
Amount, if any.

  

  (c) If at the Effective Time there has not
been both a Final Disposition and an Insurance Resolution, FBC shall
establish a register containing the names, addresses and number of shares
held by each Bank shareholder. The interests of the Banks shareholders in
the right to receive their respective portions of the Shareholder Payment
Amount, if any, shall not be transferable except by will, intestate
succession or operation of law, and FBC shall be entitled to rely on the
register for all purposes in making any payments to the Bank shareholders. If
the Shareholder Payment Amount shall become payable to the Bank shareholders,
FBC and the Shareholder Representative will determine each shareholders pro
rata portion of the Shareholder Payment Amount. Each Bank shareholders pro
rata share of the Shareholder Payment Amount shall be determined by
multiplying the Shareholder Payment Amount by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of shares of Bank Stock held by that shareholder
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the denominator of which is the
total number of shares of Bank Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. FBC shall send notice to such shareholders at the addresses
on the register of their right to receive such payment and, upon receipt of
such documentation as FBC shall reasonably require, FBC shall, within five
(5) business days, pay to each Bank shareholder its pro rata portion of
the Shareholder Payment Amount, plus accrued interest on such pro rata
portion at the target federal funds rate from the date of determination by
FBC and the Shareholder Representative of the Shareholder Payment Amount
through the day immediately prior to payment ("Shareholder Interest"). FBC
shall not be liable to any Bank shareholder for any portion of the
Shareholder Payment Amount and Shareholder Interest that is paid late or
unpaid as the result of a change of address for such Bank shareholder of
which no notice was given to FBC nor shall FBC be liable to any Bank
shareholder for any portion of the Shareholder Payment Amount and Shareholder
Interest paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

      
  

  (d) For purposes of this Section 7.7 the
initial Shareholder Representative shall be Timothy N. Bryan ("Bryan");
_provided_ he is an employee of FBC or Franklin immediately following the
Effective Time. In the event Bryan is unable or unwilling to serve as the
Shareholder Representative, a successor Shareholder Representative shall be
determined by Bryan and Michael A. Holmgreen, subject to the requirement that
any successor Shareholder Representative shall be an employee of FBC or
Franklin and shall have been both an officer and a shareholder of the Bank
immediately prior to the Effective Time. FBC will take such actions as shall
be necessary to preserve insurance coverage of the claims forming the basis
of the Identified Litigation until the Insurance Resolution; including
without limitation providing permission to the Shareholder Representative to
pursue the insurance carrier in the name of, and in consultation with, and
with the agreement of, Franklin or FBC as the case may be for the benefit of
the Banks shareholders.

 

  Section 7.8 _Notice of Certain Events_. FBC will
promptly give notice to the Bank of the occurrence of any event or the
failure of any event to occur that results in a breach of any representation
or warranty by FBC contained herein or a failure by FBC to comply with any
covenant, condition or agreement contained herein.

 

  Section 7.9 _Additional Covenants_. FBC will not,
without the prior written consent of the Bank, take any action that would
result in any of its representations and warranties contained in Article V of
this Agreement not being true and correct at the Effective Time.

 

   **ARTICLE VIII. 

CLOSING**

  

  Section 8.1 _Closing_.  (a) Subject to the other
provisions of this Agreement, the closing of the Consolidation (the
"Closing") will take place at a mutually acceptable time, on a mutually
acceptable date ("Closing Date") as soon as practicable within a ten business
day period or such other date as shall have been agreed upon by the parties
hereto commencing with the latest of the following dates:

 

  (i) the receipt of the
approval of the shareholders of the Bank required by the NBA; 

 

  (ii) the receipt of the last
approval from any requisite regulatory or supervisory authority and the
expiration of any statutory or regulatory waiting period which is necessary
to effect the Consolidation; or

 

  (iii) if the matters
contemplated by this Agreement are being contested in any legal proceeding
and FBC has elected to contest the same, then the date that such proceeding
has been brought to a conclusion favorable, in the judgment of FBC, to the
consummation of the Consolidation, or such prior date as FBC shall
elect whether or not such proceeding has been brought to a conclusion.

     
  

 At the Closing, the parties to this Agreement will exchange
certificates, opinions, and the other documents provided for under this
Agreement in order to effect the Consolidation and to determine whether any
condition exists which would permit the parties hereto to terminate this
Agreement. If no such condition then exists or if no party elects to
exercise any right it may have to terminate this Agreement, then and
thereupon the appropriate parties shall execute such documents and
instruments as may be necessary or appropriate to effect the Consolidation
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  (b) The Closing shall take place at the
offices of Bracewell and Giuliani LLP in Houston, Texas, or at such other place
to which the parties hereto may mutually agree.

 

  Section 8.2 _Effective Date of the Consolidation_.
Subject to the terms and upon satisfaction of all requirements of law and the
conditions specified in this Agreement including, among other conditions, the
receipt of requisite approval of the shareholders of the Bank required by the
NBA and the regulatory approvals (or waivers thereof) of the OTS, the FDIC,
the OCC, the Department, and any other federal or state regulatory agency
whose approval must be received in order to consummate the Consolidation, the
Consolidation shall become effective, and the Effective Date of the
Consolidation shall occur, at the date and time specified in Section 1.2
hereof. It is anticipated by FBC and the Bank that the Closing and the
Effective Date will occur on the same day.

 

   **ARTICLE IX.

to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has
been the cause of, or has resulted in, the failure of the Effective Date to
occur on or before such date;

 

  (iii) any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are disapproved by any regulatory authority or
other person whose approval is required to consummate the Consolidation; or

third party by formal proceeding, and FBC shall not elect to contest any such
proceeding.

 

  (c) This Agreement may be terminated at any

or if any of the representations or warranties of FBC contained herein shall
be untrue in any material respect, or (ii) there shall have occurred after
September 30, 2006 any event, condition or circumstance which individually or
in the aggregate has a Material Adverse Effect on FBCs ability to consummate
the Consolidation or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
In the event that the Board of Directors of the Bank desires to terminate
this Agreement as provided in Section 9.1(c)(i) above, the Board of Directors
of the Bank must notify FBC in writing of their intent to terminate stating
the reason therefor. FBC shall have fifteen days from the receipt of such
notice to cure the alleged breach, inaccuracy or change, subject to the
approval of the Bank (which approval shall not be unreasonably delayed,
conditioned or withheld).

  

  (d) This Agreement may be terminated at any

of the Bank that own Bank Stock of their respective Voting Agreements. In the
event FBC desires to terminate this Agreement because of an alleged breach or
change as provided in Section 9.1(d)(i)(A) above, FBC must notify the Bank in
writing of its intent to terminate stating the cause therefor. The Bank shall
have fifteen days from the receipt of such notice to cure the alleged breach,

termination under this Section 9.1(e) shall be made without any liability on
the part of FBC or Franklin or any of their respective directors, officers,
agents, representatives or shareholders, including, without limitation,
pursuant to Section 9.2(iii) hereof.

 

  Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of

  **ARTICLE X.

respect to FBCs ability to consummate the Consolidation or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Bank shall have received a
certificate to the foregoing effect executed by an appropriate officer of FBC
and dated as of the Closing Date.

  

  **ARTICLE XI. 

CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS OF FBC**

 

  The obligations of FBC under this Agreement are subject to the

respect to the Bank, including with respect to the amount, pricing and mix of

reasonably likely to cause or create any Material Adverse Effect with respect

(excluding any reductions attributable to any accruals required by Section
6.8 and the expenses permitted to be incurred by Section 16.1) on the Closing
Date from the amount of such items on September 30, 2006 shall each
conclusively be deemed to constitute a Material Adverse Effect under this

environmental reports required under Section 6.11 of this Agreement and

equity, McGladrey and Pullen, LLP, certified public accountants, or such
other accounting firm as FBC and the Bank shall mutually select (the
"Accounting Firm"), shall on the Closing Date resolve disputes relating to
the application of GAAP and such resolution shall be final and binding on the
Bank and FBC. In the event of a dispute, FBC shall have received from
the Accounting Firm a report, dated the Closing Date and based upon
procedures stated in such report and approved by FBC and the Bank, approval
of such procedures not to be unreasonably withheld, detailing such procedures
and providing written findings as to the amount of the Banks shareholders
equity and that the amount of the Banks shareholders equity has been
determined in accordance with the requirements of this Section 11.6.

any of the assets of the Bank shall have been obtained, and FBC shall have
received evidence thereof in form and substance satisfactory to FBC.

 

  Section 11.8 _Termination of and Payments Under
Certain Benefit Plans_. The Bank shall have terminated each of the
Compensation and Benefit Plans (other than the Officer Non-Competition

and made all filings with respect to the termination of a Compensation and
Benefit Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA, including but not limited
to any filings required with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and any
filings with the IRS to insure that such Compensation and Benefit Plan is a

  Section 12.1 _Government Approvals_. FBC and the Bank

Agreement (or the waiver thereof) from all necessary governmental agencies
and authorities, including the OTS, the Department, the FDIC, the OCC and any

this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have

   **MISCELLANEOUS**

 

 Section 13.1 _Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties_. The

by the laws of the United States.

 

  Section 13.5 _Headings_.  The table of contents,
headings and titles to the sections of this Agreement are inserted for
convenience only and shall not be deemed a part hereof or affect the
construction or interpretation of any provision hereof.

 

  Section 13.6 _Amendment_.  This Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with the Consolidation by the shareholders of
the Bank; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any approval of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the shareholders of the Bank,
there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any

the consideration to be delivered hereunder to the holders of the Bank Stock.
 This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

  

  Section 13.7 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to

their respective Boards of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the

_provided_ , _however_ , that after any approval of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the shareholders of the Bank,
there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any
extension or waiver of this Agreement or any portion thereof which reduces
the amount or changes the form of the consideration to be delivered to the
holders of the Bank Stock hereunder, other than as contemplated by this
Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on
strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall
not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or
other failure.

 

  Section 13.8 _Severability_.  Any provision hereof
prohibited by or unlawful or unenforceable under any applicable law or any
jurisdiction shall as to such jurisdiction be ineffective, without affecting
any other provision of this Agreement, or shall be deemed to be severed or
modified to conform with such law, and the remaining provisions of this
Agreement shall remain in force; _provided_ that the purpose of the Agreement
can be effected. To the full extent, however, that the provisions of such
applicable law may be waived, they are hereby waived, to the end that this
Agreement be deemed to be a valid and binding agreement enforceable in
accordance with its terms.

  

  Section 13.9 _Entire Agreement_. All understandings
and agreements heretofore made between the parties hereto are merged in this
Agreement, including the exhibits and schedules delivered pursuant hereto,
which (together with any agreements executed by the parties hereto
contemporaneously with or, if contemplated hereby, subsequent to the
execution of this Agreement) shall be the sole expression of the agreement of
the parties respecting the Consolidation, other than the Confidentiality and
Nonsolicitation Agreement dated October 30, 2006 between FBC and the Bank
which shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement. Each party
to this Agreement acknowledges that, in executing and delivering this
Agreement, it has relied only on the written representations, warranties and
promises of the other parties hereto that are contained herein or in the
other agreements executed by the parties contemporaneously with or, if
contemplated hereby, subsequent to the execution of this Agreement, and has
not relied on the oral statements of any other party or its representatives.

executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original

and shall inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective
heirs, executors, trustees, administrators, guardians, successors and

written consent of the other parties.

  Section 13.13 _Publicity_.  Subject to written advice
of counsel with respect to legal requirements relating to public disclosure
of matters related to the matters contemplated by this Agreement, the timing

occur upon, and be determined by, the mutual consent of FBC and the Bank.

 

  Section 13.14 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except

implied, is intended to confer upon any persons, other than the parties
hereto or their respective successors, any rights, remedies, obligations, or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

  Section 13.15 _Interpretation; Effect_. When a
reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such
reference shall be to a Section of, or Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed

law), rule or regulation.

 

  Section 13.16 _Certain Definitions_. The following
terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them for all purposes of this

serving in the capacities specified in the preceding clause (i) could be

industries, (C) expenses incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, which expenses will be deducted from Banks
