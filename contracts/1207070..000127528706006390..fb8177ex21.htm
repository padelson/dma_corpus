&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This  Agreement  and
Plan of Reorganization  (&#147;Agreement&#148;)  dated as of December 1, 2006 is
by and among Franklin Bank Corp., a Delaware corporation (&#147;FBC&#148;),  FBC
Interim  Bank,  S.S.B.,  an  interim  Texas  state  savings  bank  to be  formed
(&#147;Interim  Bank&#148;),  and The First  National Bank of Bryan,  a national

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, FBC and the
Bank believe that the  acquisition of the Bank by FBC in the manner provided by,
and subject to the terms and  conditions  set forth in, this  Agreement  and all
exhibits, schedules and amendments hereto is desirable and in the best interests
of their respective institutions and shareholders;</font></p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The    Bank   is   a
national banking association chartered under the National Bank Act of the United
States of America (the  &#147;NBA&#148;).&#160;  FBC owns  indirectly all of the
issued  and  outstanding  shares  of  capital  stock of  Franklin  Bank,  S.S.B.
(&#147;Franklin&#148;),  has  elected  to be  regulated  as a  savings  and loan
holding  company  under  the  Home  Owners&#146;   Loan  Act,  as  amended  (the
&#147;HOLA&#148;),   and  is  registered  with  the  Texas  Savings  &amp;  Loan
Department (the &#147;Department&#148;) as a holding company under Chapter 97 of
the Texas Savings Bank Act (the &#147;TSBA&#148;).&#160; Interim Bank will be an
interim  Texas state  savings  bank formed under the TSBA for the purpose of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will be added as a party to this
Agreement prior to the Effective Time (as  hereinafter  defined) by means of the
Accession  Agreement  attached hereto as <u>Exhibit  A</u> (the  &#147;Accession
Agreement&#148;).&#160;  This Agreement  provides for the  acquisition of all of
the issued and outstanding common stock,  $1.00&nbsp;par value, of the Bank (the
&#147;Bank  Stock&#148;),  by FBC through the  consolidation of Interim Bank and
the  Bank,  with the Bank  surviving  pursuant  to  Section  215 of the NBA (the
&#147;Consolidation&#148;).&#160;  Immediately after the Consolidation, the Bank
will be merged with and into  Franklin  pursuant to Subchapter H of the TSBA and
Section  214a  of the NBA  (the  &#147;Bank  Merger&#148;),  and  Franklin  will
continue its existing  operations  as a state savings bank under the laws of the
State of Texas.&#160; </font></p>
