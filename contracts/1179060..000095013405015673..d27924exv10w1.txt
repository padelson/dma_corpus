excluding such files, books, records, information and data constituting
Retained Assets. Without limiting the foregoing, the Seller agrees to
continue to make the information and data in the electronic data room
available to the Buyer. All investigations and due diligence conducted by the
Buyer or any of its representatives shall be conducted at the Buyer\'s sole
cost, risk and expense. To the extent they have the Legal Right, the

the Buyer Diligence Representatives, the right to make, a reasonable
examination and inspection of the Acquired Company Assets, together with any

payee" or "additional insured" (as applicable), (y) waive subrogation against
the Seller and (z) provide for thirty (30) days prior notice to the Seller in

coverage. The Buyer and the Buyer Diligence Representatives shall provide
evidence of such insurance to the Seller prior to exercising their Access
Rights.    34     (D) The Diligence Activities shall occur
at reasonable times, in a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with

Representative is not continuing to perform with reasonable diligence any
Diligence Activities on the Acquired Company Assets, (x) the date on which
the Buyer materially breaches or violates any of the covenants or agreements
contained in this Section 5(f)(ii); provided that such Access Rights will

violation will not occur again and any continuing breach or violation is
cured, (y) the date this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10 or
(z) the Closing Date.   (g) HSR Act. The Parties shall prepare, as soon as

shall be appropriately reflected in the calculation of Working Capital.  
(i) Notices and Effect of Supplements to Schedules. Each Party will, promptly
upon becoming aware of any fact, matter, circumstance or event, which fact,
matter, circumstance or event arose either (x) on or prior to the date hereof
or (y) after the date hereof but prior to the Closing, in any case,
(i) causing or that reasonably could cause either Party to be in breach or
violation of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
under this Agreement, give notice to such other Party with respect to such
fact, matter, circumstance or event, or (ii) requiring supplementation or
amendment of the schedules provided by the Parties attached hereto,
supplement or amend such schedules to this Agreement to reflect any fact,
matter, circumstance or event, which, if existing, occurring or known on the
date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described
in such schedules which were or have been rendered inaccurate thereby. Each
Party will notify the other Party promptly after the discovery by such Party
that any representation or warranty of the other Party contained in this
Agreement is, becomes or will be untrue in any material respect on or before

Agreement or the Schedules in any way for any purpose.   (j) Eligible
Employees.   (i) Eligible Employees; Access. Schedule 5(j) contains a
list of each employee of the Seller or its Affiliates to whom the Buyer may
offer employment (collectively, the "ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES"), which list also
indicates the Eligible Employees whom the Seller may need to retain or employ
for a limited time (not to exceed 90 days) after the Closing to address
transitional matters (collectively, the "POTENTIAL DELAYED HIRE ELIGIBLE
EMPLOYEES"). Schedule 5(j) lists each current employee of the Seller and its
Affiliates that are primarily involved in the businesses of the Acquired
Companies. Schedule 5(j) also sets forth for each such employee, together
with the years of service with the Seller or its Affiliates and any
predecessors that are currently credited for the purpose of determining
benefits for such employee. The Buyer shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to enter into an employment   36   agreement with each
Eligible Employee. In order that the Buyer may evaluate the possible
employment of the Eligible Employees, two business days after the date of
this Agreement for those applicable locations in Houston, Texas (and as
soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable in all other applicable
locations), the Buyer, shall be entitled (x) to access employee information
relating to each Eligible Employee, to the extent permissible under
applicable Laws (including any limitations applicable to medical or any other
records), and (y) during normal business hours, to consult with the Eligible
Employees; such consultation which will be scheduled to reasonably
accommodate the schedules of both the Eligible Employee and the Seller. At
any time on or before Closing, the Seller may add or delete individuals from
the list of Eligible Employees as a result of the hiring or the voluntary or
involuntary termination of Eligible Employees or similar circumstances
involving Eligible Employees or to maintain the safe and efficient operation
of the assets and may reclassify any Eligible Employee within the possible
sub-classifications.   (ii) Offers of Employment. The Buyer shall have no
obligation to offer employment to any Eligible Employee. If the Buyer chooses
to offer employment to any Eligible Employee, the Buyer shall extend such
offer within the thirty (30) day period immediately following the date of
this Agreement. Any such offer shall include the following terms: the
employment shall be (v) effective as of the relevant Transferred Employee
Start Date, (w) on a full-time, if the relevant Eligible Employee had full-
time status as of the date of this Agreement, or a part-time, if the relevant
Eligible Employee had part-time status as of the date of this Agreement,
basis, (x) at base salaries and wages to each such Eligible Employees no less
favorable than the base salaries and wages of such Eligible Employees as of
the date of this Agreement, (y) with employee benefits that are no less
favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of the Buyer
and its Affiliates immediately prior to Closing, and (z) at a location that
does not require relocation by any of the Eligible Employees. Any offer to a
Potential Delayed Hire Eligible Employee may be conditioned upon the
Transferred Employee Start Date occurring no later than six months after the
Closing Date. The Buyer will give each Eligible Employee to whom an offer of
employment is made no less than seven (7) days from the date the offer is
made to accept or reject the employment offer. The Buyer shall notify the
Seller of each Eligible Employee that has accepted the offer of employment as
promptly as possible after such indication, but in no event later than three
(3) days prior to the Closing Date. The Buyer will, and will cause its
applicable Affiliates to, evaluate and make hiring decisions with respect
to the Eligible Employees in accordance with applicable Law. Nothing in
this paragraph shall be construed to require the Buyer to provide post
retirement medical benefits to the Eligible Employees.   (iii) Timing of
Transfer. All Transferred Employees shall become employees of the Buyer or
its Affiliates as of 12:00:01 a.m. of the respective local time where the
Transferred Employees are located on the relevant Transferred Employee Start
Date; provided, that if any Transferred Employee is on a leave of absence
approved by the Seller or any of its Affiliates on what would otherwise be
such employee\'s Transferred Employee Start Date, such employee shall not
become an employee of the Buyer or its Affiliates on that date. Such
employee\'s Transferred Employee Start Date shall be postponed until the
first day of the month following the expiration of such leave, provided such
employee is otherwise able to commence active employment and the Buyer\'s
offer of employment remains in effect at that time. At such time, the Buyer
and its Affiliates shall become responsible for payment of all
salaries, wages and benefits and all other claims, costs, expenses,
liabilities and other obligations relating to the employment of the
Transferred Employees incurred from and after such time. The Seller or its
Affiliate, as the case may be, shall be responsible for all salaries, wages,
and    37   benefits and all other claims, costs, expenses, liabilities
and other obligations related to the employment or termination the
Transferred Employees incurred prior to such time. For purposes of medical,
dental, vision, disability and other similar benefits, a claim will be deemed
to have been incurred upon the incurrence of a qualified expense for which
reimbursement or payment is sought.   (iv) Participation in Plans. All
Transferred Employees shall cease active participation in all plans, programs
and arrangements of the Seller and its Affiliates relating to compensation
and employee benefits as of 11:59 p.m. on the day immediately prior to the
relevant Transferred Employee Start Date, and shall, from and after such
time, be permitted to participate in the Buyer Plans. No liability arising
under any Seller plan, program or benefit is assumed by the Buyer or any
Buyer Plan, and any such liabilities of the Acquired Companies will be the
responsibility of the Seller. Each of the Acquired Companies shall be deemed
to have withdrawn from any such plan, program or benefit and each such plan,
program or benefit shall be deemed terminated with respect to the Acquired
Companies effective at such time and date.   (v) Credit for Service. To the
extent that any Transferred Employees become eligible to participate in any
Buyer Plan, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate and
vesting, service with the Seller or its Affiliates shall be treated as
service under such Buyer Plan other than Buyer\'s bonus program. Such
credited service shall also be recognized for purposes of satisfying any pre-
existing conditions, actively at work exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation by and coverage of the Transferred Employees and
their eligible dependents in the Buyer Plans. In addition, with respect to
the Transferred Employees, the Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause all Persons administering or underwriting any Buyer Plans
that are group health plans, at no out-of-pocket cost to the Buyer or the
Acquired Companies, to (y) waive any pre-existing conditions, unless such
conditions are excluded under the Seller\'s or the Buyer\'s group health
plan, and so long as there is not a gap in creditable coverage of sixty-three
(63) days or more, any waiting periods with respect to the Transferred
Employees and their eligible dependents, and (z) waive any actively-at-work
exclusions.   (vi) Termination.   (A) If the employment of any Transferred
Employee is terminated by the Buyer or its Affiliates within one year
following the relevant Transferred Employee Start Date (other than for
termination due to violation of generally applicable policies of such Persons
or other circumstances reasonably constituting cause), then the Buyer shall,
or shall cause such Affiliate to, provide such Transferred Employee with
severance pay as set forth on Schedule 5(j)(vi) hereto.   (B) The Seller
shall retain liability and responsibility for the payment of severance
benefits (if any), incurred on or prior to the Closing Date as a result of
any Adverse Consequences, including the termination or transfer of employment
of any current or past employee from the Seller or its Affiliates on or prior
to the Closing Date; provided that, if the employment of any Retained
Employee is terminated by the Seller or its Affiliates as a result of   
38   the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and the Buyer hires
such terminated Retained Employee within one year following the Closing Date,
the Buyer shall reimburse the Seller for the Prorated Retained Employee
Severance Amount applicable to such Retained Employee.   (vii) Paid Time
Off. With regard to vacation allowances, Transferred Employees shall be
eligible to begin accruing vacation benefits as of the Transferred Employee
Start Date, and the Buyer shall provide, or shall cause the Acquired
Companies to provide, credit for each Transferred Employee\'s service with
the Seller, the Acquired Companies and their respective Affiliates to the
same extent as such service was recognized by each of them immediately prior
to the Transferred Employee Start Date, provided that (i) the number
of vacation days to which each Transferred Employee will be entitled
following the Transferred Employee Start Date shall be determined exclusively
under the Buyer\'s vacation policies; (ii) the number of vacation days
available to any Transferred Employee under the Buyer\'s policies for its
fiscal year that includes the Transferred Employee Start Date shall be pro-

other paid time off, it is understood that the Buyer does not currently have
a program of sick days or paid time off allowances and nothing in this
Agreement shall be construed to require the Buyer to adopt any such program.
Any liability for vacation days, hours or other vacation allowances, sick
days or other paid time off accrued by Transferred Employees prior to the
Transferred Employee Start Date shall be the responsibility of the Seller and
the Seller agrees to pay each Transferred Employee for all accrued but not
taken paid time off accrued under the Seller Plans through the Transferred
Employee Start Date within thirty (30) days after the Transferred Employee
Start Date. With regard to any other employee benefit plans of the Buyer or

same basis as other similarly situated employees of the Buyer or its
Affiliates.   (viii) WARN Act. The Buyer will not engage within sixty

Affiliates to) solicit, offer employment to or employ any Retained Employee
without the prior written consent of the Seller; provided that, the foregoing
shall not prohibit general solicitations of employment not specifically
directed toward such employees of the Seller or its Affiliates or the hiring
of such employees in response thereto, nor the hiring, employment
or engagement of any such employee of the Seller or its Affiliates who
presents himself or herself for employment without direct or indirect
solicitation by the Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer. The Seller and its
Affiliates may retain the services of any Retained Employee or terminate any
such Retained Employee\'s employment at any time. The Seller and its
Affiliates shall retain liability and be responsible for the Retained

2005, the Buyer shall reimburse each Transferred Employee for any and all
amounts paid by such Transferred Employee that exceed the maximum deductible
identified for such Transferred Employee on the Deductible Notice; provided,
that the Transferred Employee provides to the Buyer the explanation of
benefits sent to them by their insurance provider as proof of such payment.
The Parties acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Section 5(j)(xi)
obligates the Buyer to reimburse a Transferred Employee for coinsurance or
maximum out-of-pocket amounts.   (k) Reorganization Transactions. To the
extent not completed prior to the date of this Agreement, the Seller (1)
shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliates to, perform those

furnish any    40   information with respect to, assist or participate

order to determine if NOx emissions rates for all applicable engines comply
with applicable Environmental Laws. The Seller shall provide the Buyer with
reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to witness the tests. Such
tests shall be conducted by an accredited Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality stack-testing contractor. To the extent any such
generator does not achieve such emission rates necessary to comply with
applicable Environmental Laws, the Seller shall retrofit such generator with
a catalytic converter or other control as required to meet applicable
Environmental Laws (including replacing the engine, if required); provided,
however, that the Seller shall not be responsible for any such costs in
excess of $1,500,000 plus any associated fines and penalties as provided

not result in a material degradation of the operating capability of the

such Laws. The Seller shall reimburse the Buyer for up to five hundred
thousand dollars ($500,000) of the cost necessary to bring the flare into

deliver to each other (i) Annex I and Annex II to the Transition Services
Agreement and (ii) Exhibits A, B and C to the Pelican Land Assignment, in
each case, that contain terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to each

services thereunder, (y) costs for third party goods and services shall be
based on the amounts paid by the applicable service provider for such goods

action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each Party
shall take such further action (including the execution and delivery of such
further instruments and documents) as the other Party reasonably may request,
all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting Party (unless the
requesting Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under Section
8).   (b) Litigation Support. In the event and for so long as either
Party actively is pursuing, contesting or defending against any third party
action, suit, proceeding, hearing, investigation, charge, complaint, claim,
or demand in connection with (i) any transaction contemplated under this
Agreement, (ii) any Retained Assets or (iii) any fact, situation,
circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event,
incident, action, failure to act, or transaction on or before the Closing
Date relating to the Acquired Companies, the other Party shall cooperate with
the pursuing, contesting or defending Party and its counsel in such pursuit,
defense or contest, make available its personnel, and provide such testimony
and access to its books and records (other than books and records which are
subject to privilege or to confidentiality restrictions) as shall be
necessary in connection with such pursuit, defense or contest, all at the
sole cost and expense of the pursuing, contesting or defending Party (unless
the pursuing, contesting or defending Party is entitled to indemnification
therefor under Section 8).   (c) Delivery and Retention of Records. Within
forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date, the Seller shall (with respect

books, records, information and data relating to the Acquired Companies,
including the Electronic Data and a CD containing all the information and
data contained in the electronic data room (other than Tax Records) that are
in the possession or control of the Seller or any of its Affiliates

such offer, the Buyer may take such action and (ii) following the Closing
Date to afford the Seller, its accountants, and counsel, during normal
business hours, upon reasonable request, full access to the Records and to
the Buyer\'s employees to the extent that such access may be requested for
any legitimate purpose at no cost to the Seller (other than for reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses); provided that such access shall not be construed to
require the disclosure of Records that would cause the waiver of any
attorney-client, work product, or like privilege or cause the breach of any
confidentiality agreement; provided, further that in the event of any
litigation nothing herein shall limit either Party\'s rights of discovery
under applicable Law. All post-Closing access to the Records and to the
Buyer\'s employees will be subject to confidentiality obligations under
Section 11(a).   (d) Pipeline Markers and El Paso Marks. The Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, title, interest, license or

successor thereto as the Lessee (as defined in the Eunice Lease Documents)

any of its Affiliates under any Eunice Transaction Document, including
issuing Additional Notes (as defined in the Eunice Participation Agreement)
or effecting any Refinancing (as defined in the Eunice Participation
Agreement);   (v) give the Seller, prior to the fifth (5) business
day preceding the end of any Notice Period (as defined in the Eunice

(vi) immediately upon demand by the Seller or any of its Affiliates,
reimburse such Person for any amounts paid by them after the Closing Date

interest permitted by applicable Law) from (and including) the date of
payment thereof by such Person to (but excluding) the date of repayment
by the Buyer; and   (vii) cooperate with the Seller and its Affiliates and
use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist such Persons in obtaining a
release of their obligations and liabilities under the Eunice Transaction

thereof, pay, or cause the Acquired Companies to pay, to the Seller any
amounts received by the Buyer and its Affiliates after Closing that should
have been paid to the Seller or its Affiliates.   (h) Accounts Receivable.
To the extent any Acquired Company receives cash payments with respect to its
accounts receivable that were excluded from Working Capital, the Buyer shall,
or shall cause the applicable Acquired Company to, promptly remit such
payments to the Seller. Towards this end, the Seller shall have the right for
two (2) years after the Closing Date to inspect and examine the Records of

the Acquired Companies. The Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the Buyer, in connection with such reports,
filings, or certifications to be made by the Buyer.   (j) Mutual Mistake. If
the Parties determine that the Seller and its Affiliates did not transfer to
one of the Acquired Companies any material asset that the Parties mutually
agree they both intended to be included as an Acquired Company Asset, the
Parties will cooperate to effect such transfer as promptly as practical.  
(k) Post-Closing Financial Statements. Unless provided at or before Closing,

related thereto shall not exceed one million five hundred thousand dollars
($1,500,000) (after which, the Buyer shall be responsible for all such
costs); (C) fines or penalties assessed with respect to notices of violation
received during the 12 month period after the Closing by any Governmental

related backup documentation; (D) Adverse Consequences relating to any
Obligations directly related to the Retained Assets described in Section

relating to any real property interest owned as of the Effective Time by any
Acquired Company to the extent such real property interest is not generally
associated with the Facilities described on Exhibit A; and (G) reimbursement
of costs, if any, required to bring the Eunice flare into compliance with
applicable Environmental Laws as contemplated by Section 5(n)(ii); provided,
however, that the Seller\'s indemnification obligations under this Section

against the entirety of any Adverse Consequences that are suffered by the
Buyer Indemnitees to the extent relating to any business (including any plant
or other substantial tangible asset) that both was owned and divested or
otherwise disposed of by any Acquired Company at any time prior to the
Closing Date.   (xi) Seller and Affiliate Claims. The Seller shall
RELEASE, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS the Buyer Indemnitees from and against
the entirety of any Adverse Consequences that are suffered by the Buyer
Indemnitees for claims by the Seller and its Affiliates against the Acquired
Companies and attributable to the period prior to the Closing, except for
claims arising out of this Agreement or any Transaction Agreement, and claims
with respect to any intercompany arrangements that will not be terminated as
of the Closing in accordance with Section 5(h).   (xii) Limitations.
Notwithstanding any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement
contained in this Agreement, including the rights of indemnification provided
in this Section 8, the Seller shall have no obligation to release, indemnify
and hold harmless any Buyer Indemnitee with respect to any Adverse
Consequence (A) associated with, attributable to or resulting from the start-
up costs relating to the Cow Island or Rayne Facilities, or (B) associated
with, attributable to or resulting from any environmental condition or
circumstance (including the non-compliance with any Environmental Law and the
presence of any Hazardous Substance) except to the extent the relevant
condition or circumstance constitutes a breach of the representation and
warranty set forth in Section 4(i) or is subject to indemnity in accordance
with Sections 8(b)(ix)-(xi). In lieu of performing all or any portion of its
Obligations under Section 8(b)(i) to the extent relating to
the representation and warranty set forth in Section 4(i), or that are
subject to indemnity in accordance with Section 8(b)(ix)-(xi), the Seller

written claim for indemnification against the Buyer pursuant to Section 11(h)
within the applicable survival period specified in Section 8(a), then the
Buyer agrees to RELEASE, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS the Seller Indemnitees
from and against the entirety of any Adverse Consequences that are
individually in excess of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) and suffered
by the Seller Indemnitees by reason of such breaches.   (ii) General.
Except to the extent the Seller is obligated to indemnify the Buyer pursuant
to Section 8(b), the Buyer agrees to RELEASE, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS the
Seller Indemnitees from and against the entirety of any Adverse Consequences
relating in any way to the Acquired Companies, Acquired Company Equity
Interests, the Acquired Company Assets or the ownership, operation or
Obligations of any of them, in each such case, whether or not arising during,
related to or otherwise attributable to the period prior   50   to, on or
after the Closing Date. Except as otherwise expressly provided for in this
Agreement, the Buyer\'s Obligations under this Section 8(c)(ii) include
and cover matters whether or not they are set forth in the Schedules to
this Agreement, including such Obligations relating to litigation to which
the Seller or any of its Affiliates is a party.   (iii) Certain
Environmental Reports. Except to the extent the Seller is indemnifying the
Buyer Indemnities pursuant to Section 8(b)(ix)(E), the Buyer agrees to
RELEASE, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS the Seller Indemnitees from and against
the entirety of any Adverse Consequences relating in any way to bringing into
compliance any violations identified in the reports filed by the Seller
pursuant to Section 5(d)(iv).   (iv) Eligible Employees. The Buyer agrees to
RELEASE, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS the Seller Indemnitees from and against

Acquired Company Claims. The Buyer shall RELEASE, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS
the Seller Indemnitees from and against the entirety of any Adverse
Consequences that are suffered by the Seller Indemnitees for claims by the

or any Transaction Agreement, and claims with respect to any intercompany
arrangements that will not be terminated as of the Closing in accordance with
Section 5(h).   (vi) Site Access. The Buyer agrees to RELEASE, INDEMNIFY
AND HOLD HARMLESS the Seller Indemnitees from and against the entirety of
any Adverse Consequences that are suffered by the Seller Indemnitees arising
out of, resulting from or relating to any field visit or other due diligence
activities relating to any performance of the Diligence Activities to the
extent caused by acts or omissions of any Buyer Party or Buyer Diligence
Representative, even if such Adverse Consequences arise out of or result
from, solely or in part, the sole, active, passive, concurrent or comparative
negligence, strict liability or other fault or violation of Law of or by the
Seller Indemnitees, except Adverse Consequences to the extent resulting from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Seller Indemnitees.   (d)
Matters Involving Third Parties.   (i) If any third party shall notify
either Party (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") with respect to any matter (a "THIRD
PARTY CLAIM") that is reasonably expected to give rise to a claim for
indemnification against the other Party (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") under this
Section 8, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in any event within
the later of five (5) business days after receiving notice of the Third Party
Claim) notify the Indemnifying Party thereof in writing. Failure to notify
the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent the
defense of such claim is materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Party\'s
failure to give such notice, including having the effect of tolling or
suspending the statute of limitations applicable to such claim.   51   
(ii) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume and thereafter
conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including
any compromise or settlement thereof; provided, however, that the
Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim which provides for
or results in any payment by or Obligation of the Indemnified Party of or for
any damages or other amount, any Encumbrance on any property of the
Indemnified Party, any finding of responsibility or liability on the part of
the Indemnified Party or any sanction or injunction of, restriction upon the
conduct of any business by, or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified
Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be
withheld unreasonably).   (iii) Unless and until the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of the Third Party Claim as provided in Section 8(d)(ii),
the Indemnified Party may defend against the Third Party Claim in any manner
it reasonably may deem appropriate.   (iv) In no event shall the
Indemnified Party consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party which consent shall not be withheld
unreasonably.   (e) Determination of Amount of Adverse Consequences. The
Adverse Consequences giving rise to any indemnification obligation hereunder
shall be limited to the actual loss suffered by the Indemnified Party (i.e.
reduced by any insurance proceeds or other payment or recoupment received,
realized or retained by the Indemnified Party as a result of the events
giving rise to the claim for indemnification net of any expenses related to
the receipt of such proceeds, payment or recoupment, including retrospective
premium adjustments, if any), but not any reduction in Taxes of the
Indemnified Party (or the affiliated group of which it is a member)
occasioned by such loss or damage. The amount of the actual loss and the
amount of the indemnity payment shall be computed by taking into account the
timing of the loss or payment, as applicable, using a Prime Rate plus two
percent interest or discount rate, as appropriate (not to exceed the maximum
rate permitted by applicable Law). Upon the request of the Indemnifying
Party, the Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party with
information sufficient to allow the Indemnifying Party to calculate
the amount of the indemnity payment in accordance with this Section 8(e).
An Indemnified Party shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate damages in
respect of any claim for which it is seeking indemnification and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to avoid any costs or expenses associated
with such claim and, if such costs and expenses cannot be avoided, to
minimize the amount thereof. Nothing in this Section 8 is intended to allow
an indemnified Person to receive duplicative payments in connection with a
Party\'s Obligations to release, indemnify and hold harmless. Without in any
way limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, although an
indemnified Person may seek recovery for an Adverse Consequence under any
Section under which such Adverse Consequence may be recoverable, to the
extent an indemnified Person has been paid for an Adverse Consequence under
one Section of this Agreement, that Person shall not be permitted to seek
payment for that Adverse Consequence under another Section of this Agreement,
even though that Adverse Consequence is of a type which would be covered by
each such Section.   52    (f) Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. All
indemnification payments made under this Agreement, including any payment
made under Section 9, shall be made in cash and treated as purchase price
adjustments for Tax purposes.   (g) Exclusive Remedy. The indemnities
provided for in this Section 8 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Indemnified Party against the Indemnifying Party by contract, statute or
otherwise, at law or equity, for any claim, cause of action or other matter
arising from any breach by the Buyer or the Seller, as applicable, of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements under this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Party acknowledges
that the payment of money, as limited by the terms of this Agreement, shall
be adequate compensation for breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained herein or for any other claim arising in connection
with or with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As
the payment of money shall be adequate compensation, each Party hereby waives
any right to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby.   (h) Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties. The
Buyer acknowledges that (i) it has had and pursuant to this Agreement shall
have before Closing access to the Acquired Companies and the Acquired Company
Assets and the officers of the Seller and (ii) in making the decision to
enter into this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, the Buyer has relied solely on the basis of its own independent
investigation, including environmental and other inspections, and upon the
express representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements set forth in
this Agreement, and the Seller expressly disclaims all liability and
responsibility for any representation, warranty, statement or communication
made or communicated (orally or in writing) to the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, employees, agents, consultants or representatives other than as
expressly set forth in this Agreement or any Transaction Agreement
(including, without limitation, any opinion, information, projection or
advice that may have been provided to the Buyer by any officer, director,
employee, agent, consultant, representative or advisor of the Seller or any
of its Affiliates). Toward this end, except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement, no Seller Indemnitee shall have liability to the Buyer or any
other Person resulting from the distribution to the Buyer, or the Buyer\'s
use of, any such information relating to any Seller Indemnitee, or prepared
by or on behalf of any Seller Indemnitee, and supplied to the Buyer before
the date of this Agreement, or any information, documents or materials made
available to the Buyer in any data rooms, any presentation or in any
other form relating to the business of the Acquired Companies in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby. Accordingly, the Buyer
acknowledges that, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the
Seller has not made, and THE SELLER MAKES NO AND DISCLAIMS ANY,
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND WHETHER BY
COMMON LAW, STATUTE, OR OTHERWISE, REGARDING (i) TITLE TO ANY OF THE ACQUIRED
COMPANY ASSETS (INCLUDING ANY RIGHTS OF WAY) (WHETHER RELATING TO DEFECTIVE
TITLE OR GAPS IN TITLE), (ii) THE QUALITY, CONDITION, OR OPERABILITY OF ANY
REAL OR PERSONAL PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT, OR FIXTURES, INCLUDING FREEDOM FROM
LATENT OR PATENT VICES OR DEFECTS, (iii) THEIR MERCHANTABILITY, (iv) THEIR
FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, (v) THEIR CONFORMITY TO MODELS, SAMPLES
OF MATERIALS OR MANUFACTURER DESIGN, (vi) THE CONTENTS, CHARACTER OR NATURE
OF ANY REPORT OF ANY PETROLEUM   53   ENGINEERING CONSULTANTS, OR ANY
ENGINEERING, GEOLOGICAL OR SEISMIC DATA OR INTERPRETATION RELATING TO ANY
ACQUIRED COMPANY ASSETS, (vii) THE QUANTITY, QUALITY, PRODUCTION OR
RECOVERABILITY OF HYDROCARBONS, (viii) ANY ESTIMATES OF THE VALUE OF THE
ACQUIRED COMPANY EQUITY INTERESTS OR RELATED ACQUIRED COMPANY ASSETS OR
FUTURE REVENUES GENERATED THEREFROM, (ix) THE MAINTENANCE, REPAIR, CONDITION,
QUALITY SUITABILITY, DESIGN OR MARKETABILITY OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANY ASSETS,
(x) THE CONTENT, CHARACTER OR NATURE OF ANY INFORMATION MEMORANDUM, REPORTS,
BROCHURES, CHARTS OR STATEMENTS PREPARED BY ANY PERSON WITH RESPECT TO THE
ACQUIRED COMPANY EQUITY INTERESTS OR ACQUIRED COMPANY ASSETS, (xi) ANY
OTHER MATERIALS OR INFORMATION MADE AVAILABLE TO THE BUYER OR ITS AFFILIATES,
OR ITS OR THEIR EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, CONSULTANTS, REPRESENTATIVES OR ADVISORS
IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, OR
ANY DISCUSSION OR PRESENTATION RELATED THERETO, (xii) ANY EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FREEDOM FROM INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT, (xiii)
ANY RIGHTS OF A PURCHASER UNDER APPROPRIATE STATUTES TO CLAIM DIMINUTION OF
CONSIDERATION OR RETURN OF THE PURCHASE PRICE, (xiv) ANY MATTER OR
CIRCUMSTANCE RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, THE RELEASE OF MATERIALS INTO
THE ENVIRONMENT OR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN HEALTH, SAFETY, NATURAL RESOURCES
OR THE ENVIRONMENT, OR ANY OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION OF THE ACQUIRED
COMPANY ASSETS, AND, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL OF
THE ACQUIRED COMPANY ASSETS ARE DELIVERED IN THEIR PRESENT STATUS, CONDITION
AND STATE OF REPAIR, "AS IS, WHERE IS" WITH ALL FAULTS OR DEFECTS (KNOWN OR
UNKNOWN, LATENT, DISCOVERABLE OR UNDISCOVERABLE), INCLUDING FOR PURPOSES OF
THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION. THE INCLUSION BY ANY SELLER PARTY OF ANY OF
THE REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT
DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN ADMISSION OR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, OF
FAULT, RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY OF ANY KIND BY ANY SELLER PARTY UNDER ANY
LAW (INCLUDING ANY ENVIRONMENTAL LAW) FOR ACTS, OMISSIONS, OBLIGATIONS OR
EVENTS INVOLVING THE PRESENCE, IF ANY, OF ANY POLLUTANTS, CONTAMINANTS, TOXIN
OR HAZARDOUS OR EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES, MATERIALS, WASTES,
CONSTITUENTS, COMPOUNDS OR CHEMICALS THAT ARE REGULATED BY, OR MAY FORM THE
BASIS OF LIABILITY UNDER, ANY ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS ON OR ADJACENT TO THE
ACQUIRED COMPANY ASSETS. The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Seller
cannot and does not covenant or warrant that the Buyer shall become successor
operator of the Blue Water Plant since such assets and properties may be
subject to operating or other agreements that document the procedure
relating to the appointment of a successor operator. The Parties agree that,
to the extent required by Law to be effective, the disclosures contained in
this Section 8(h) are "conspicuous" for purposes of any such Laws.  
54   9. Tax Matters.   (a) Post-Closing Tax Returns. The Buyer shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed any Post-
Closing Tax Returns with respect to the Acquired Company Assets or the
Acquired Companies. The Buyer shall pay (or cause to be paid) any Taxes due
with respect to such Tax Returns.   (b) Pre-Closing Tax Returns. The Seller
shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Pre-
Closing Tax Returns with respect to the Acquired Company Assets or Acquired
Companies. The Seller shall pay or cause to be paid any Taxes due with
respect to such Tax Returns.   (c) Straddle Periods. The Buyer shall be
responsible for Taxes of the Acquired Company Assets and the Acquired
Companies related to the portion of any Straddle Period occurring on or after
the Effective Time. The Seller shall be responsible for Taxes of the Acquired
Company Assets and the Acquired Companies relating to the portion of any
Straddle Period occurring before and on the Effective Time. With respect to
any Straddle Period, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Seller or
the Buyer shall elect to treat the close of the day ending immediately prior
to the Effective Time as the last day of the Tax period. If applicable Law
shall not permit such date to be the last day of a period, then (i) real or
personal property Taxes with respect to the Acquired Company Assets and the
Acquired Companies shall be allocated based on the number of days in the
partial period before and after such date, (ii) in the case of all other
Taxes based on or in respect of income, the Tax computed on the basis of the
taxable income or loss attributable to the Acquired Company Assets and the
Acquired Companies for each partial period as determined from their books and
records, and (iii) in the case of all other Taxes, on the basis of the actual
activities or attributes of the Acquired Company Assets and the
Acquired Companies for each partial period as determined from their books and
records.   (d) Straddle Returns. The Buyer shall prepare any Straddle
Returns. The Buyer shall deliver, at least forty-five (45) days prior to the
due date for filing such Straddle Return (including any extension) to the
Seller a statement setting forth the amount of Tax that the Seller owes,
including the allocation of taxable income and Taxes under Section 9(c), and
copies of such Straddle Return. The Seller shall have the right to review
such Straddle Returns and the allocation of taxable income and liability for
Taxes and to suggest to the Buyer any reasonable changes to such Straddle
Returns no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the date for the filing of
such Straddle Returns. The Seller and the Buyer agree to consult and to
attempt to resolve in good faith any issue arising as a result of the review
of such Straddle Returns and allocation of taxable income and liability for
Taxes and mutually to consent to the filing as promptly as possible of such
Straddle Returns. Not later than five (5) days before the due date for the
payment of Taxes with respect to such Straddle Returns, the Seller shall pay
or cause to be paid to the Buyer an amount equal to the Taxes as agreed to by
the Buyer and the Seller as being owed by the Seller. If the Buyer and the
Seller cannot agree on the amount of Taxes owed by the Seller with respect to
a Straddle Return, the Seller shall pay or cause to be paid to the Buyer the
amount of Taxes reasonably determined by the Seller to be owed by the Seller.
Within ten (10) days after such payment, the Seller and the Buyer shall refer
the matter to an independent nationally recognized accounting firm agreed to
by the Buyer and the Seller to arbitrate the   55   dispute. The Seller
and the Buyer shall equally share the fees and expenses of such accounting
firm and its determination as to the amount owing by the Seller with respect
to a Straddle Return shall be binding on the Seller and the Buyer. Within
five (5) days after the determination by such accounting firm, if necessary,
the appropriate Party shall pay the other Party any amount which
is determined by such accounting firm to be owed. The Seller shall be
entitled to reduce its obligation to pay Taxes with respect to a Straddle
Return by the amount of any estimated Taxes paid with respect to such Taxes
on or before the Effective Time.   (e) Claims for Refund. The Buyer shall
not, and, to the extent the Buyer has the Legal Right, shall cause the
Acquired Companies and any of their Affiliates not to, file any claim for
refund of Taxes with respect to the Acquired Company Assets and the Acquired
Companies for whole or partial taxable periods on or before the Effective
Time.   (f) Indemnification. The Buyer agrees to indemnify the Seller
against all Taxes of or with respect to the Acquired Company Assets and the
Acquired Companies for any Post-Closing Tax Period and the portion of any
Straddle Period occurring after the Effective Time. The Seller agrees to
indemnify the Buyer against all Taxes of or with respect to the Acquired
Company Assets and the Acquired Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and
the portion of any Straddle Period occurring on or before the Effective Time
(including any Tax liability associated with any matter listed on Schedules
4(f) and 4(h)), and the Buyer Parties against all Taxes of or with respect to
the Retained Assets.   (g) Cooperation on Tax Matters.   (i) The Buyer and
the Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested
by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to
this Section 9(g) and any audit, litigation or other proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Buyer and
the Seller shall (A) retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to each Acquired Company relating to any whole or partial taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute
of limitations (and, to the extent notified by the Buyer or the Seller, any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (B)
give the other Party reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the
other Party so requests, the Buyer or the Seller, as the case may be, shall
allow the other Party to take possession of such books and records.   (ii)
The Buyer and the Seller further agree, upon request, to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby).   (iii) The Buyer and the Seller
agree, upon request, to provide the other Parties with all information that
such other Parties may be required to report pursuant to Section 6043 of the
Code and all Treasury Department Regulations promulgated thereunder.  
56    (h) Certain Taxes. The Seller shall file all necessary Tax Returns
and other documentation with respect to all transfer, documentary, sales,
use, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes and fees, pay the related
Tax, and, if required by applicable Law, the Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation. Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Buyer shall pay to the Seller, on or before the date such
payments are due from the Seller, any transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.   (i) Confidentiality.
Any information shared in connection with Taxes shall be kept confidential,
except as may otherwise be necessary in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns or reports, refund claims, tax audits, tax claims and tax litigation,
or as required by Law.   (j) Audits. The Seller or the Buyer, as applicable,
shall provide prompt written notice to the other Parties of any pending or
threatened tax audit, assessment or proceeding that it becomes aware of
related to the Acquired Company Assets or the Acquired Companies for whole or
partial periods for which it is indemnified by the other Party hereunder.
Such notice shall contain factual information (to the extent known)
describing the asserted tax liability in reasonable detail and shall be
accompanied by copies of any notice or other document received from or with
any tax authority in respect of any such matters. If an Indemnified Party has
knowledge of an asserted tax liability with respect to a matter for which it
is to be indemnified hereunder and such Party fails to give the Indemnifying
Party prompt notice of such asserted tax liability, then (I) if the
Indemnifying Party is precluded by the failure to give prompt notice from
contesting the asserted tax liability in any forum, the Indemnifying
Party shall have no obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party for any
Taxes arising out of such asserted tax liability, and (II) if the
Indemnifying Party is not so precluded from contesting, but such failure to
give prompt notice results in a detriment to the Indemnifying Party, then any
amount which the Indemnifying Party is otherwise required to pay the
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 9(j) shall be reduced by the
amount of such detriment, provided, the Indemnified Party shall nevertheless
be entitled to full indemnification hereunder to the extent, and only to the
extent, that such Party can establish that the Indemnifying Party was not
prejudiced by such failure. This Section 9(j) shall control the procedure for
Tax indemnification matters to the extent it is inconsistent with any other
provision of this Agreement.   (k) Control of Proceedings. The Party
responsible for the Tax under this Agreement shall control audits and
disputes related to such Taxes (including action taken to pay, compromise or
settle such Taxes). The Seller and the Buyer shall jointly control, in good
faith with each other, audits and disputes relating to Straddle Periods.
Reasonable out-of-pocket expenses with respect to such contests shall be
borne by the Seller and the Buyer in proportion to their responsibility for
such Taxes as set forth in this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided by
this Agreement, the noncontrolling Party shall be afforded a reasonable
opportunity to participate in such proceedings at its own expense.   (l)
Powers of Attorney. To the extent the Buyer has the Legal Right, the Buyer,
the Acquired Companies and their respective Affiliates shall provide the
Seller and its Affiliates with such powers of attorney or other
authorizing documentation as are reasonably necessary to empower them to
execute and file returns they are responsible for hereunder, file refund
and   57   equivalent claims for Taxes they are responsible for, and
contest, settle, and resolve any audits and disputes that they have control
over under Section 9(k) (including any refund claims which turn into audits
or disputes).   (m) Remittance of Refunds. If the Buyer or any Affiliate of
the Buyer receives a refund of any Taxes that the Seller is responsible for
hereunder, or if the Seller or any Affiliate of the Seller receives a refund
of any Taxes that the Buyer is responsible for hereunder, the Party receiving
such refund shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of such refund,
remit it to the Party who has responsibility for such Taxes hereunder. For
the purpose of this Section 9(m), the term "refund" shall include a reduction
in Tax and the use of an overpayment as a credit or other Tax offset, and
receipt of a refund shall occur upon the filing of a Tax Return or an
adjustment thereto using such reduction, overpayment or offset or upon the
receipt of cash. CFS is entitled to refunds of ad valorem taxes pursuant to
an agreement with the Parish of Cameron in the State of Louisiana in the
amount of $25,077.89 at the end of 2005 and $25,077.89 at the end of 2006
against those years\' taxes, which amounts the Buyer shall remit to the
Seller promptly upon any receipt or other realization thereof.   (n)
Purchase Price Allocation. The Seller and the Buyer agree that the actual
Purchase Price allocable to the Acquired Company Assets shall be allocated to
the Acquired Company Assets for all purposes (including Tax and financial
accounting purposes) as jointly agreed between the Buyer and the Seller
within 90 days after the Closing Date. The Seller and the Buyer agree (i) to
report the federal, state and local income and other Tax consequences of
the transactions contemplated herein, and in particular to report the
information required by Section 1060(b) of the Code, and to jointly prepare
Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition Statement under Section 1060) in a manner
consistent with such allocation and (ii) without the consent of the other
Party, not to take any position inconsistent therewith upon examination of
any Tax return, in any refund claim, in any litigation, investigation or
otherwise. The Seller and the Buyer agree that each will furnish the other a
copy of Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition Statement under Section 1060) proposed
to be filed with the Internal Revenue Service by such Party or any Affiliate
thereof within ten days prior to the filing of such form with the Internal
Revenue Service. The Buyer, the Seller and their applicable Affiliates will
file all Tax Returns (including amended Tax Returns and claims for refund)
and information reports in a manner consistent with such allocation.   (o)
Closing Tax Certificate. At the Closing, the Seller shall deliver to the
Buyer a certificate, in the form of Exhibit I, signed under penalties
of perjury (i) stating it is not a foreign corporation, foreign
partnership, foreign trust or foreign estate, (ii) providing it\'s U.S.
Employer Identification Number, and (iii) providing its address, all pursuant
to Section 1445 of the Code.   (p) Reporting of Post-Closing Transactions.
The Buyer and the Seller agree to report all transactions not in the Ordinary
Course of Business occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing on the
Buyer\'s federal income Tax Return to the extent permitted by Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B).   (q) Settlements.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Seller shall not be entitled to settle or concede, either administratively or
after the commencement of litigation, any proceeding related to Taxes in a
manner that could increase   58   the amount of Taxes of the Buyer or any
of the Acquired Companies for any Post-Closing Tax Periods, unless (i) the
Buyer consents to such settlement or concession or (ii) the Seller agrees to
indemnify the Buyer for any such increase in the amount of Taxes of the Buyer
or any of the Acquired Companies for Post-Closing Tax Periods.   (r)
Section 754 Elections. The Seller shall take or cause to be taken such
actions as are requested by the Buyer in order to cause any Acquired Company
that is treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes to make a timely
election under Section 754 of the Code with respect to the Seller\'s sale of
interests in any such entity to the Buyer hereunder.  10. Termination.  
(a) Termination of Agreement. The Parties may terminate this Agreement, as
provided below:   (i) the Parties may terminate this Agreement by mutual
written consent at any time before the Closing;   (ii) by either Party in
writing, without liability to the other Party on account of such termination
(provided the terminating Party is not in default or breach of any of
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement), if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before 5:00 p.m.
Houston, Texas time on December 1, 2005; provided that, at any time on or
prior to December 1, 2005, the Buyer shall have the right to extend such
December 1, 2005 date to January 1, 2006, and then at any time on or prior to
January 1, 2006, the Buyer shall have the right to extend such January 1,
2006 date to February 1, 2006 (provided the Buyer is not in default or
breach of any of representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement at the time of either such extension);   (iii)
the Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the Seller
at any time before Closing in the event the Seller has materially breached
any representation or warranty set forth in Section 3(a) or Section 4 or any
covenant contained in this Agreement, the Buyer has notified the Seller of
the breach, the breach is not curable, or, if curable, has continued without
cure for a period of twenty-five (25) days after the written notice of breach
and such breach would result in a failure to satisfy a condition to the
Buyer\'s obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
10(a)(iii) shall not be available to the Buyer if, at such time, the Buyer is
in breach of any representation or warranty set forth in Section 3(b) or any
covenant contained in this Agreement and such breach would result in
a failure to satisfy a condition to the Seller\'s obligation to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby;   (iv) the Seller may terminate this
Agreement by giving written notice to the Buyer at any time before the
Closing in the event the Buyer has materially breached any representation or
warranties set forth in Section 3(b) or any covenant contained in this
Agreement, the Seller has notified the Buyer of the breach, the breach is not
curable, or, if curable, has continued without cure for a period of twenty-
five (25) days after the written notice of breach and such breach would
result in a failure to satisfy a condition to the Seller\'s obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that the right to
terminate this   59   Agreement pursuant to this Section 10(a)(iv) shall
not be available to the Seller if, at such time, the Seller is in breach of
any representation or warranties set forth in Section 3(a) or Section 4 or
any covenant contained in this Agreement and such breach would result in a
failure to satisfy a condition to the Buyer\'s obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby; and   (v) the Parties may terminate this
Agreement if any Governmental Authority shall have issued an order, decree or
ruling or shall have taken any other action permanently enjoining,
restraining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated hereby and
such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and
nonappealable; provided that the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 10(a)(v) shall have complied with Section 5(a),
Section 5(b) and Section 5(g), it being agreed that the Parties shall
promptly appeal any adverse determination that is not nonappealable (and
pursue such appeal with reasonable diligence).   (b) Effect of Termination.
Except for the obligations under Sections 5(f)(ii)(C), 5(f)(ii)(G), 8, 10 and
11, if either Party terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10(a), all
rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder shall terminate without any
liability of either Party to the other Party (except for any liability of
either such Party then in breach); provided, that the provisions contained in
Sections 5(f)(ii)(C), 5(f)(ii)(G) and 8(c)(vi) and the confidentiality
provisions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive
termination.  11. Miscellaneous.   (a) Confidentiality. The Parties have
previously executed and delivered the Confidentiality Agreement. The Parties
agree that, subject to Section 11(b) below, the Confidentiality Agreement
shall be in full force and effect until the Closing Date. If the Closing
occurs, the Buyer shall not be limited by the terms thereof with respect to
information, assets and operations of the Acquired Companies. The Seller
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, not make disclosure of any
confidential or proprietary information relating to any Acquired Company to
any Person other than (i) to its owners, directors, officers, employees,
consultants or other representatives to whom such disclosure is necessary or
convenient for the completion of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (ii) as required to convey title to any of the Acquired Company
Assets; (iii) as required by Law or any securities exchange or market rule;
(iv) as may be requested or required by any Governmental Authority (provided
that the Seller first notifies the Buyer and gives the Buyer the opportunity
to contest such request or requirement), or (v) except with prior notice of
such request for disclosure to, and consent of, the Buyer (which consent may
be withheld in the Buyer\'s sole discretion). On or after the Closing, the
Seller agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide, on an as
needed basis, rights to enforce the confidentiality agreements between the
Seller and those Persons who where bidders for the Acquired
Company Assets.   (b) Public Announcements. Neither Party shall issue any
press release or make any public announcement or otherwise publicly
disseminate information relating to the subject matter of this Agreement
before or after the Closing without the prior written approval of the other
Party (which approval will not be withheld or delayed unreasonably); provided
that either Party may make any public disclosure it believes in good faith is
required by applicable Law or any listing or trading agreement concerning its
publicly traded securities (in which case the   60   disclosing Party
will advise the other Party before making the disclosure and will provide the
other Party, to the extent practicable, with a reasonable opportunity to
comment on such proposed disclosures).   (c) Insurance. The Seller shall
cause any insurance policies covering the Acquired Company Assets to remain
in full force and effect or to be renewed and maintained in full force and
effect through (but not after) the Closing Date; provided, however, that the
Seller shall maintain the Acquired Companies or the Acquired Company Assets
(as applicable) as divested entities or assets on such insurance policies and
any subsequent renewal thereof. The Seller shall not take any action to
release any insurer with respect to any claim made under any such insurance
policy before the Closing Date; provided, however, that the Seller may
release any such insurer that is an Affiliate of the Seller. The Seller will
file all insured claims (both before and after Closing) that may be filed
under any insurance policy covering the Acquired Company Assets for
any Adverse Consequences occurring before Closing and will thereafter
coordinate with the Buyer to resolve all such claims after Closing; provided,
however, that (x) the Seller will not be required to file such claims to the
extent the insurer of such claims is an Affiliate of the Seller and (y)
neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be obligated or otherwise
liable for any deductible, self insured retention amount or reimbursable
amount payable by any of them with respect to any such claim. The Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that, following the Closing, any insurance policies
maintained by the Seller and its Affiliates (including the applicable
Acquired Companies) shall be terminated or modified to exclude coverage of
all or any portion of the assets, facilities and/or operations of the
Acquired Companies, and, as a result, the Buyer shall be obligated at or
before Closing to obtain at its sole cost and expense replacement insurance,
including insurance required by any Person to be maintained for or by the
Acquired Companies. The Buyer further acknowledges and agrees that the Buyer
may need to provide to certain Governmental Authorities and other Persons
evidence of such replacement or substitute insurance coverage for the
continued operations or businesses of the Acquired Companies.   (d) No Third
Party Beneficiaries. Except for the indemnification provisions, this
Agreement shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.   (e)
Succession and Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Neither Party may assign, alienate, delegate or
otherwise transfer all or any portion of its rights, interests or obligations
under this Agreement without the prior written approval of the other Party
(which approval may not be unreasonably withheld); provided, however, without
the prior approval of the Seller, the Buyer and its permitted successors and
assigns may transfer any or all of its rights or interests under this
Agreement to a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer for so long as such
Person remains a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer, including designating
one or more such Persons to be the assignee of some or any portion of the
Acquired Company Equity Interests; and provided further that no transfer
shall result in the release of the requesting Party from any of its
obligations under this Agreement, and such Party shall remain a primary
obligor (as opposed to a surety) thereof; and provided further that no such
transfer shall be made in violation of any such Eunice Transaction
Document.   61    (f) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but which together
shall constitute one and the same instrument.   (g) Headings. The Section
headings contained in this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.   (h) Notices. All notices, requests, demands, claims, and

ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF TEXAS. VENUE FOR ANY ACTION ARISING
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL LIE EXCLUSIVELY IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT IN

this Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed

participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In
the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this

presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring either
Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
unless the   63   context requires otherwise. The word "including" shall
mean including without limitation. All personal pronouns used in this
Agreement, whether used in the masculine, feminine or neuter gender, shall

Exhibits and Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters required by the
