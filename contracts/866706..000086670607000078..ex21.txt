PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT    This STOCK PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT (this
"Agreement") is dated as of November 6, 2007 by and among Doble Engineering
Company, a Massachusetts corporation (the "Company"), ESCO Technologies
Holding, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Buyer"), ESCO Technologies Inc., a
Missouri corporation and parent of the Buyer ("Buyer Parent") solely for the
purposes of Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 10.2 and the stockholders of the Company
listed on the signature pages hereto (each, a "Stockholder" and collectively,
the "Stockholders").   WHEREAS, the Stockholders own beneficially and of
record all the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company, as set
forth on Schedule 1.1(b)-1 attached hereto (collectively, the "Company
Shares"); and   WHEREAS, each Stockholder desires to sell to Buyer, and
Buyer desires to purchase from each Stockholder, all of the issued and
outstanding Company Shares owned by such Stockholder on the terms and
conditions set forth herein.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the
mutual agreements and covenants herein contained, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:    Article I - PURCHASE
AND SALE OF COMPANY SHARES; CLOSING  Section 1.1. Purchase and Sale of
Company Shares.   Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement and in  reliance on the representations and warranties contained
herein, at the  Closing (as defined in Section 1.4), each Stockholder
severally agrees to  sell to Buyer, and Buyer agrees to purchase from each
such Stockholder, all  of the Company Shares owned by such Stockholder as set
forth opposite such  Stockholder\'s name on Schedule 1.1(b)-1 hereto for the
purchase price set  forth in Section 1.2 below.  Section 1.2. Purchase
Price and Payment.  (a) The aggregate purchase price for the Company Shares
shall be an amount in  cash equal to (i) three hundred nineteen million
dollars ($319,000,000)  (the "Cash Amount"), minus Indebtedness, minus
Transaction Expenses, plus  the Initial Tax Benefit Amount (each as defined
in Section 10.4) (the "Cash  Consideration"), plus or minus (ii) the
Estimated Closing Adjustment (as  defined and determined in accordance with
Section 1.3(a)), plus or minus  (iii) the Working Capital Adjustment Amount
(as defined and determined in  accordance with Section 1.3(c)), plus (iv) the
Deferred Tax Benefit Amount  (as defined and determined in accordance with
Section 1.3(f)), if any, plus  (v) the Indemnification Tax Benefit Amount (as
defined and determined in  accordance with Section 1.3(c)), if any, plus (vi)
the Working Capital Tax  Benefit Amount (as defined and determined in
accordance with Section  1.3(g)), if any (collectively, the "Purchase
Price").  (b) At the Closing, Buyer shall pay the Cash Consideration by
delivering to  each Stockholder (i) such Stockholder\'s pro rata share (as
set forth  opposite such Stockholder\'s name on Schedule 1.1(b)-1) (the "Pro
Rata  Share") of the Cash Consideration, (ii) plus or minus an amount equal
to  such Stockholder\'s Pro Rata Share of the Estimated Closing Adjustment
(as  defined in Section 1.3(a)), (iii) minus such Stockholder\'s Pro Rata
Share  of the Escrow Amount and (iv) minus such Stockholder\'s Pro Rata Share
of  the Stockholder Representative Payment (the "Closing Payments"). An
example  of the calculation of the Closing Payments to be paid to each
Stockholder  is attached hereto as Schedule 1.1(b)-2. At the Closing, the
Stockholder  Representative (as defined below) shall revise Schedule 1.1(b)-1
to reflect  the Closing Payments to be paid to each Stockholder at the
Closing, and  shall deliver such updated Schedule 1.1(b)-1 to Buyer with wire
transfer  instructions for each Stockholder. Buyer is entitled to rely on the
payment  instructions in Schedule 1.1(b)-1 and the Stockholders shall hold
Buyer  harmless for the allocation among Stockholders with respect to any
payments  made at Closing in accordance with such instructions.  (c) At the
Closing, Buyer will deposit a portion of the Cash Consideration  otherwise
payable to the Stockholders with Mellon Trust of New England,  N.A., a
national banking association with its principal place of business  at Mellon
Financial Center, Boston, MA 02108 (the "Escrow Agent"), in an  amount equal
to $22,500,000 in cash (the "Escrow Amount"), such deposit to  constitute an
escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund"). The Escrow Fund shall be  governed by the
terms hereof and the terms of an escrow agreement to be  entered into by and
among Buyer, the Stockholder Representative and the  Escrow Agent, in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the  "Indemnification
Escrow Agreement"). The Escrow Fund and the earnings  thereon shall be held
in escrow and shall be available to settle certain  contingencies as provided
in Section 1.3 and Article VIII of this Agreement  and such amounts will be
distributed in accordance with the Indemnification  Escrow Agreement. Buyer,
the Company, and the Stockholders agree that each  Stockholder shall (i)
include in its gross income such Stockholder\'s Pro  Rata Share of the income
earned on the Escrow Fund and (ii) receive from  the Escrow Fund, no later
than thirty (30) days after the end of each  calendar year, a distribution in
an amount equal to forty percent (40%) of  such Stockholder\'s Pro Rata Share
of the income earned on the Escrow Fund  for such calendar year. Pursuant to
the Indemnification Escrow Agreement,  the Company may receive payments from
the Escrow Fund to which Mr. Robert  Smith ("Mr. Smith") is entitled to
receive a portion under the Transaction  Bonus Agreement (as defined below).
Within five (5) business days following  the receipt of any such payment by
the Company from the Escrow Fund, (A)  the Company will promptly pay such
payment to Mr. Smith, subject to  withholding any Taxes imposed on or with
respect to such payment, and the  Company shall pay the amounts withheld to
the appropriate Governmental  Authorities and (B) the Buyer shall separately
pay by wire transfer of  immediately available funds (1) to the Stockholders
96% of the product of  (a) 37%, multiplied by (b) the sum of the entire
amount released to the  Company for payment to Mr. Smith (including amount
for Tax withholding)  (such product, the "Indemnification Tax Benefit
Amount"), by payment to  each Stockholder of such Stockholders Pro Rata Share
of the Indemnification  Tax Benefit Amount and (2) to Mr. Smith, 4% of the
Indemnification Tax  Benefit Amount net of withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the  payments to the Stockholders and the payments to Mr.
Smith shall be  proportionally reduced by Associated Payments made in
connection with  payments to Mr. Smith under this subsection (c).  (d) At
the Closing, Buyer will deposit $500,000 of the Cash Consideration  otherwise
payable to the Stockholders upon the Closing into an account  designated by
the Stockholder Representative, as a fund for the fees and  expenses
(including legal fees and expenses) of the Stockholder  Representative
incurred in connection with this Agreement (the "Stockholder  Representative
Payment").  (e) At the Closing, Buyer also will deposit an amount with the
Escrow Agent,  such deposit to constitute an escrow amount equal to the
twenty-five  percent (25%) deferred payment (the "Deferred Payment") which
Mr. Smith is  entitled to receive under the Transaction Bonus Agreement
between the  Company and Mr. Smith dated as of April 24, 2007, as amended to
date (the  "Transaction Bonus Agreement") plus the maximum potential
estimated  Associated Payments with respect to such Deferred Payment (the
Deferred  Payment, together with such Associated Payments and interest and
earnings  thereon, the "Deferred Escrow"). The Deferred Escrow will be
deposited into  an account maintained by the Escrow Agent pursuant to an
escrow agreement  to be entered into by and among Mr. Smith, the Stockholder
Representative,  Company and the Escrow Agent, such escrow agreement to be in
substantially  the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Holdback Escrow
Agreement").  (f) At the Closing, the Buyer will pay all (i) Transaction
Expenses other than  the amount which is being paid into the Deferred Escrow
pursuant to Section  1.2(e) and the amount that may become payable to Mr.
Smith pursuant to the  Transaction Bonus Agreement that is being paid into
the Escrow Fund, and  (ii) the cost of the Title Policy (in an amount not to
exceed $13,000) as  directed by the Company. To the extent such Transaction
Expenses represent  compensatory payments, the Company shall withhold and pay
Taxes imposed on  or with respect to such compensatory payments and pay such
amounts over to  the appropriate Governmental Authorities.  (g) Each
Stockholder acknowledges and agrees that the number of Company Shares  set
forth opposite such Stockholder\'s name on Schedule 1.1(b)-1 is true and 
correct. Each Stockholder further agrees to be bound by the Stockholder 
Representative\'s calculation of the amount of the Purchase Price to be 
received by such Stockholder hereunder (as determined in accordance with 
this Section 1.2), and that such amount represents the full amount to which 
such Stockholder is entitled under the Articles of Incorporation, as 
amended, (the "Charter") in respect of such Stockholder\'s Company
Shares.  Section 1.3. Adjustment to Purchase Price.   (a) Prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall prepare an estimate of the  Working Capital
of the Company as of the time immediately prior to Closing  consistent with
the methodology used to prepare the Working Capital of the  Company as of
September 29, 2007 as set forth on Schedule 1.3 (the  "Estimated Working
Capital"). Not later than two (2) business days prior to  the Closing Date,
the Company shall deliver to Buyer the calculation of the  Estimated Working
Capital, together with worksheets and data that support  the Estimated
Working Capital. The Cash Consideration shall be adjusted  upward, dollar for
dollar, to the extent that the Estimated Working Capital  exceeds $8,700,000
(which shall be treated as a positive number) (the  "Maximum Working
Capital"). The Cash Consideration shall be adjusted  downward, dollar for
dollar, to the extent that the Estimated Working  Capital is less than
$6,700,000 (which shall be treated as a negative  number) (the "Minimum
Working Capital"). The adjustment to the Cash  Consideration (whether an
increase or decrease) pursuant to this Section  1.3(a) is the "Estimated
Closing Adjustment."  (b) Within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall (i) prepare a  calculation of the Working Capital of the Company
as of the time  immediately prior to Closing in accordance with GAAP and
consistent with  the Company\'s past practices and procedures and the
methodology used to  prepare the Working Capital of the Company as of
September 29, 2007,  subject to ordinary year-end adjustments consistently
applied, all as set  forth as Schedule 1.3 attached hereto, (the "Closing
Working Capital") and  deliver to the Stockholder Representative the
calculation of the Closing  Working Capital, together with worksheets and
data that support the Closing  Working Capital. Following the Closing, the
Company shall give the  Stockholder Representative and his advisors access
(including the right to  make copies) to the books and records of the Company
in order to resolve  any disputes regarding the calculation of Closing
Working Capital. Unless  the Stockholder Representative delivers the Dispute
Notice (as defined  below) within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the
calculation of Closing  Working Capital, the Closing Working Capital shall be
deemed the "Final  Working Capital," shall be binding upon all parties and
shall not be  subject to dispute or review. If the Stockholder Representative
disagrees  with calculation of Closing Working Capital, the Stockholder
Representative  may, within fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof, notify
the Buyer in  writing (the "Dispute Notice"), which Dispute Notice shall
provide  reasonable detail of the nature of each disputed item in the
calculation of  Closing Working Capital. The Stockholder Representative and
the Buyer shall  first use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such
dispute between  themselves and, if the parties are able to resolve such
dispute, the  Closing Working Capital shall be revised to the extent
necessary to reflect  such resolution, shall be deemed the "Final Working
Capital" and shall be  conclusive and binding upon all parties and shall not
be subject to dispute  or review. If the Buyer and the Stockholder
Representative cannot mutually  agree on the same, then within the later of
(i) sixty (60) days after the  Closing Date and (ii) fifteen (15) days
following delivery by the  Stockholder Representative of the Dispute Notice,
Buyer and the Stockholder  Representative shall select a nationally
recognized independent accounting  firm mutually satisfactory to Buyer and
the Stockholder Representative to  resolve such dispute (the "Neutral
Auditor"). The Neutral Auditor shall  review the Closing Working Capital,
and, within ten (10) days of its  appointment, shall make any adjustments
necessary thereto, and, upon  completion of such review, such Closing Working
Capital as determined by  the Neutral Auditor shall be deemed the "Final
Working Capital" and shall  be conclusive and binding upon all parties and
shall not be subject to  dispute or review. If such a review is conducted,
then the party (i.e.,  Buyer, on the one hand, or the Stockholders, on the
other hand) whose last  proposed offer for the settlement of the items in
dispute, taken as a  whole, was farther away from the final determination by
the Neutral Auditor  pursuant to the preceding sentence, shall pay all fees
and expenses  associated with such review.  (c) Within three (3) business
days following the determination of the Final  Working Capital, either the
Buyer or the Stockholders, as applicable, shall  effect the payment in
accordance with the provisions below, if any (the  "Working Capital
Adjustment Amount"):  (i) if the Estimated Closing Adjustment is greater
than the Final Closing  Adjustment, then the Stockholders shall pay to Buyer
the amount of such  difference by the Buyer and the Stockholder
Representative providing joint  written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
pay the appropriate amount to  Buyer out of the Escrow Fund; and  (ii) if
the Estimated Closing Adjustment is less than the Final Closing  Adjustment,
then the Buyer shall pay by wire transfer of immediately  available funds (A)
to the Stockholders an amount equal to 96% of such  difference, by payment to
each Stockholder of such Stockholder\'s Pro Rata  Share of the amount so
owed, (B) to Mr. Smith an amount equal to 3% of such  difference, subject to
withholding any Taxes imposed on or with respect to  such amount and pay the
amounts withheld to the Company to be paid to the  appropriate Governmental
Authorities and (C) to the Escrow Agent to be held  under the Holdback Escrow
Agreement as part of the Deferred Escrow an  amount equal to 1% of such
difference; provided that if the Deferred  Payment has already been paid to
Mr. Smith, such amount shall be paid to  Mr. Smith, subject to withholding
any Taxes imposed on or with respect to  such amount and the amounts withheld
shall be paid to the Company to be  paid to the appropriate Governmental
Authorities. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, the payments to the Stockholders
and the payments to Mr. Smith  shall be proportionally reduced by Associated
Payments made in connection  with payments to Mr. Smith under this subsection
(c)(ii).  (d) For purposes of this Section 1.3, the "Final Closing
Adjustment" shall be  either (i) the amount by which the Closing Working
Capital exceeds the  Maximum Working Capital (which shall be treated as a
positive number), (ii)  the amount by which the Closing Working Capital is
less than the Minimum  Working Capital (which shall be treated as a negative
number) or (iii) an  amount equal to zero if the Closing Working Capital is
both equal to or  more than the Minimum Working Capital and equal to or less
than the Maximum  Working Capital.  (e) As used in this Section 1.3
"Working Capital" means Current Assets minus  Current Liabilities of the
Company on a consolidated basis, without  duplication; "Current Assets" means
and includes all cash, cash  equivalents, short-term investments, Accounts
Receivable, inventory,  prepaid expenses and other current assets of the
Company (other than  deferred tax assets that solely reflect timing
differences between book  income and taxable income), and, whether or not
current assets, all  marketable securities (including municipal bonds that
have maturities  greater than one year at the value as of the Closing Date),
in each case  determined in accordance with GAAP and the Company\'s past
practices and  procedures and the methodology used to prepare the Working
Capital of the  Company as of September 29, 2007, subject to ordinary year-
end adjustments  consistently applied, all as set forth as Schedule 1.3
attached hereto; and  "Current Liabilities" means and includes all accounts
payable, accrued  expenses, deferred revenue, Transaction Expenses to the
extent not deducted  from the Cash Amount pursuant to Section 1.2(a)(i), the
aggregate premiums  to be paid for the extended reporting period endorsement
purchased pursuant  to Section 5.10 and other current liabilities of the
Company (other than  deferred tax liabilities that solely reflect timing
differences between  book income and taxable income), in each case determined
in accordance with  GAAP and the Company\'s past practices and procedures and
the methodology  used to prepare the working capital statement of the Company
as of  September 29, 2007, subject to ordinary year-end adjustments
consistently  applied, all as set forth as Schedule 1.3 attached hereto.
Notwithstanding  the foregoing, (i) Working Capital shall exclude all amounts
included in  the Company\'s Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses and the Tax
Benefit  Amount, to the extent reflected in the adjustments described in
Section  1.2(a)(i) and (ii) Current Assets and Current Liabilities will not
include  any assets or liabilities relating to the Company\'s Supplemental
Executive  Retirement Plan for Elected Officers and the Company\'s Retirement
Income  Plan, including but not limited to any prepaid asset or accrued
pension  liability.  (f) At such time as the Deferred Payment is determined
to be payable to Mr.  Smith in accordance with the Transaction Bonus
Agreement, the Stockholder  Representative and Buyer shall deliver joint
written instructions to the  Escrow Agent to pay (i) on behalf of the Company
to Mr. Smith the entire  amount of the Deferred Escrow net of withholding
Taxes and Associated  Payments imposed on or with respect to such amounts and
(ii) to the Company  the balance of the Deferred Escrow following the payment
to Mr. Smith  pursuant to clause (i), and the Company shall timely pay such
Taxes and  Associated Payments to the appropriate Governmental Authorities.
Upon  delivery of such joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent,
Buyer  shall separately pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds
(x) to  the Stockholders 96% of the product of (A) 37%, multiplied by (B) the
sum  of the entire amount of the Deferred Escrow (immediately prior to the 
payments made under clauses (i) and (ii)) (such product, the "Deferred Tax 
Benefit Amount"), by payment to each Stockholder of such Stockholders Pro 
Rata Share of the Deferred Tax Benefit Amount and (y) to Mr. Smith 4% of  the
Deferred Tax Benefit Amount net of withholding Taxes. At such time as  the
Deferred Payment is determined not to be payable to Mr. Smith in  accordance
with the terms of the Transaction Bonus Agreement, the  Stockholder
Representative and Buyer shall deliver joint written  instructions to the
Escrow Agent to pay all amounts held in the Deferred  Escrow to the
Stockholders in accordance with each Stockholder\'s Pro Rata  Share.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the payments to the Stockholders and  the
payments to Mr. Smith shall be proportionally reduced by Associated  Payments
made in connection with payments to Mr. Smith under subsection (y)  of this
section.  (g) Upon any payments to Mr. Smith pursuant to Section
1.3(c)(ii)(B), Buyer  shall concurrently pay by wire transfer of immediately
available funds (x)  to the Stockholders 96% of the product of (A) 37%,
multiplied by (B) the  sum of the entire amount paid pursuant to Section
1.3(c)(ii)(B) (such  product, the "Working Capital Tax Benefit Amount"), by
payment to each  Stockholder of such Stockholders Pro Rata Share of the
Working Capital Tax  Benefit Amount and (y) to Mr. Smith an amount equal to
3% of the Working  Capital Tax Benefit Amount, subject to withholding any
Taxes imposed on or  with respect to such amount and pay the amounts withheld
to the Company to  be paid to the appropriate Governmental Authorities and
(z) to the Escrow  Agent to be held under the Holdback Escrow Agreement an
amount equal to 1%  of Working Capital Tax Benefit Amount; provided that if
the Deferred  Payment has already been paid to Mr. Smith, such amount shall
be paid to  Mr. Smith, subject to withholding any Taxes imposed on or with
respect to  such amount and the amounts withheld shall be paid to the Company
to be  paid to the appropriate Governmental Authorities. Notwithstanding
the  foregoing, the payments to the Stockholders and the payments to Mr.
Smith  shall be proportionally reduced by Associated Payments made in
connection  with payments to Mr. Smith under this subsection
(g).   Section 1.4. Time and Place of Closing.   The closing (the
"Closing") of the purchase and sale of the Company Shares  and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be held at  the offices of
Goodwin Procter LLP, Exchange Place, Boston, Massachusetts,  on the date that
is three (3) business days following the date on which the  conditions to
Closing set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of this Agreement  have been
satisfied or waived in writing, or at such other time or such  other place as
Buyer and the Stockholder Representative may mutually  determine; however, in
no event shall the Closing to occur earlier than  November 30, 2007. The date
on which the Closing actually occurs is  referred to herein as the "Closing

Stockholders or the Company, as applicable, will  deliver or cause to be
delivered to Buyer the following:  (i) stock certificates evidencing all of
the Company Shares, in each case duly  endorsed in blank or accompanied by

involving this Agreement, and to do or refrain from doing all such further 
acts and things, and execute all such documents as the Stockholder 
Representative shall deem necessary or appropriate in connection with the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, 
the power:  (i) to waive any condition to the obligations of such
Stockholder to consummate  the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;  (ii) to execute and deliver all ancillary agreements,
certificates and  documents, and to make representations and warranties
therein, on behalf of  such Stockholder which the Stockholder Representative

an interest and shall be irrevocable, and Buyer and the Company, each  of
their Affiliates and any other Person may conclusively and absolutely  rely,
without inquiry, upon any action of the Stockholder Representative on  behalf
of the Stockholders in all matters referred to herein. All notices  delivered
by Buyer or the Company (following the Closing) to the  Stockholder
Representative (whether pursuant hereto or otherwise) for the  benefit of the
Stockholders shall constitute notice to the Stockholders.  The Stockholder
Representative shall act for the Stockholders on all of the  matters set

believes to be in the best interest of the Stockholders and  consistent with
its obligations under this Agreement, but the Stockholder  Representative

they may suffer by reason of the performance by the  Stockholder
Representative of its duties under this Agreement, other than  loss or damage
arising from willful violation of the law.  (c) Each Stockholder agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholder  Representative from any loss,
damage or expense arising from the  performance of its duties as the
Stockholder Representative hereunder,  including, without limitation, the

violation of the law.  (d) All actions, decisions and instructions of the
Stockholder Representative  taken, made or given pursuant to the authority
granted to the Stockholder  Representative pursuant to this Section 1.6 shall
be conclusive and binding  upon each Stockholder, and no Stockholder shall
have the right to object,  dissent, protest or otherwise contest the
same.  (e) The provisions of this Section 1.6 are independent and severable,
shall  constitute an irrevocable power of attorney, coupled with an interest
and  surviving death or dissolutions, granted by the Stockholders to the 
Stockholder Representative and shall be binding upon the executors, heirs, 
legal representatives, successors and assigns of each such
Stockholder.  Article II - REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

encumber its properties and carry on its business as currently  conducted.
The Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business as a  foreign
corporation under the laws of each other jurisdiction in which the  character
of its properties or in which the transaction of its business  makes such

liability to the Company. The copies of the Charter and the  Company\'s by-
laws, each as amended to date and made available to Buyer\'s  counsel, are
complete and correct, and no amendments thereto are pending.  (b) The
Company has the corporate power and authority to execute and deliver  this
Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution and 
delivery of this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its 
obligations hereunder and the consummation of the transactions contemplated 
hereby have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the 
part of the Company. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by 
the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of 
this Agreement by Buyer, this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and 
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in

2.2. Capitalization.   As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized,
issued and outstanding  capital stock of the Company is set forth on Schedule
2.2. All of the  issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Company are duly  authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
As of the date of  this Agreement, there are no outstanding options, warrants
or other rights  of any kind to acquire any additional shares of capital
stock of the  Company or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, or
which  otherwise confer on the holder thereof any right to acquire, any
such  additional shares, nor is the Company committed to issue any such
option,  warrant, right or security. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.2,
there are  no agreements or understandings to which the Company is a party
with  respect to the voting of any shares of capital stock of the Company
or  which restrict the transfer of any such shares. Except as set forth on 
Schedule 2.2, there are no outstanding contractual obligations of the 
Company to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital 
stock, other equity interests or any other securities of the Company. The 
Company is not under any obligation by reason of any agreement to register 
the offer and sale or resale of any of its securities under the Securities 
Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated 
thereunder (the "Securities Act").  Section 2.3. Subsidiaries.  (a) The

the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interest of each of 
the Subsidiaries free and clear of any and all Encumbrances. There are no 
outstanding options, warrants or other rights of any kind to acquire any 
additional shares of capital stock of any Subsidiary or securities

holder thereof any right to acquire, any such additional shares, nor is any 
Subsidiary committed to issue any such option, warrant, right or security. 
Except as set forth on Schedule 2.3, there are no agreements or 
understandings to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party with 
respect to the voting of any shares of capital stock of any Subsidiary or 
which restrict the transfer of any such shares. Except as set forth on 
Schedule 2.3, there are no outstanding contractual obligations of any 
Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital 
stock, other equity interests or any other securities of any Subsidiary.

owns directly or indirectly any interest or investment (whether equity or 
debt) in any Person.  (b) Each of the Subsidiaries is a corporation or
limited company duly  incorporated or organized and validly existing under
the laws of its  jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and has all
requisite  corporate or proprietary limited, as applicable, power and
authority to  own, operate, lease and encumber its properties and carry on
its business  as currently conducted, except as would not, individually or in
the  aggregate, be material to such Subsidiary. Each such Subsidiary is
duly  licensed or qualified to do business as a foreign corporation or
limited  company, as applicable, in each other jurisdiction in which the
character  of its properties or in which the transaction of its business
makes such  qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or  qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in
material  liability to such Subsidiary.  Section 2.4. No Conflict.  
Neither the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and the 
other agreements, documents and instruments contemplated hereby, nor the 
consummation by the Company of the transactions in accordance with the  terms
hereof and thereof, conflicts with or results in a breach of any  provisions
of the Charter or by-laws of the Company or the organizational  documents of
any Subsidiary. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.4, and  assuming the
consents, approvals and authorizations contemplated by Section  2.8. are
obtained, the execution and delivery by the Company of this  Agreement and
the other agreements, documents and instruments contemplated  hereby and the
consummation by the Company and the Stockholders of the  transactions in
accordance with the terms hereof and thereof will not  (i) violate any laws
applicable to the Company or to any of its  Subsidiaries; (ii) violate, or
conflict with, or result in a breach of any  provision of, or constitute a
default (or an event which, with notice or  lapse of time or both, would

authorizations or actions under any of the  terms, conditions or provisions
of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,  deed of trust, lease, contract or
other agreement to which the Company or  any of its Subsidiaries is a party
or by which the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties is bound, except, in  each case (A) as would not result
in material liability to the Company or  any Subsidiary, individually or in
the aggregate, (B) as would become  applicable as a result of the business or
activities in which Buyer  proposes to engage in that differ from the
activities previously or  currently conducted or proposed to be conducted by
the Company or (C) as a  result of any acts or omissions by, or the status of
any facts pertaining  to, Buyer that differ from the acts or omissions
previously or currently  undertaken or proposed to be undertaken by, or
status of any facts  pertaining to, the Company; or (iii) result in the
creation of any  mortgage, pledge, lien, conditional sale agreement, security
title,  encumbrance or other charge (collectively, "Encumbrances") against

consent, approval,  authorization or other action by, or filing with or
notification to, any  federal, state, local, whether U.S. or non-U.S.
government, governmental,  regulatory or administrative authority, agency or
commission or any court,  tribunal, or judicial or arbitral body (a
"Governmental Authority") or (ii)  any consent, approval, authorization or

other  litigation, actions, suits, proceedings, claims, arbitrations or 
investigations, would have a Material Adverse Effect.  Section 2.10.

Company or any  Subsidiary:  (i) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries
have timely filed all Tax Returns  required by Law to be filed by them,
taking into account any extension of  time to file granted to or obtained on
behalf of the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries. All such Tax Returns filed
by or with respect to the Company  and each of its Subsidiaries are true,
correct and complete and were  prepared in compliance with all applicable
laws and regulations. All Taxes  have been correctly accounted for by the
Company and its Subsidiaries. The  Company and each of its Subsidiaries have
paid (or caused to be paid on  their behalf) all Taxes due and owing, whether
or not shown on their Tax  Returns. Neither the Company nor any of its

Authority is asserting, or has asserted in the last six (6)  years, as of the
date of this Agreement, any deficiency or claim for any  amount of additional
Taxes against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.  The IRS audit of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for the taxable year  ended December 31, 2004
resulted in cumulative adjustments of less than  $150,000 and all matters in
connection therewith have been resolved.  (iv) Within the last six (6)
years, no claim has ever been made by any  Governmental Authority in a
jurisdiction where the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries does not file Tax
Returns that the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries is or may be subject to
taxation in that jurisdiction.  (v) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries

are pending as of the date of this Agreement with regard to any  Taxes or Tax
Returns of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.  (vii) Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received from any  federal, state,
local, or foreign Taxing authority (including jurisdictions  where the
Company or its Subsidiaries have not filed Tax Returns) any (A)  notice
indicating an intent to open an audit or other review, (B) request  for
information related to Tax matters, or (C) notice of deficiency or  proposed
adjustment for any amount of Tax proposed, asserted, or assessed  by any
taxing authority against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.  (viii)

delivered to Buyer.  (ix) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
a party to any  agreement, contract, arrangement, or plan that has resulted

"excess parachute  payment" within the meaning of Code 280G (or any
corresponding provision  of state, local, or foreign Tax law).  (x) Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have been part of a  consolidated
group for Tax purposes with any Person. Neither the Company  nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any Tax allocation or  sharing
agreement. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any  liability
for the Taxes of any Person as a transferee or successor, by  contract, or
otherwise (other than the Company or any such Subsidiary).  (xi) Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to  included any item of
income in, or exclude any item of deduction from,  taxable income for any
taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the  Closing as a result of
any: (A) change in method of accounting for a  taxable period ending on or
prior to the Closing Date (or any corresponding  or similar provision of
state, local, or foreign law); (B) agreement with  any Governmental Authority
with regard to the Tax liability of the Company  or any of its Subsidiaries ,
executed on or prior to the Closing Date; (C)  installment sale or open
transaction disposition made on or prior to the  Closing Date; or (D) prepaid
amount received on or prior to the Closing  Date. Neither the Company nor any

adjustment or change in accounting method.  (xii) Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any joint  venture, partnership, or
other arrangement or contract that could be  treated as a partnership for
federal income tax purposes.  (xiii) Neither the Company nor any of the
Subsidiaries have constituted a  "distributing corporation" or a "controlled
corporation" within the meaning  of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code in a
distribution of stock intended to  qualify for tax-free treatment under
Section 355 of the Code.  (xiv) The Company has not taken into account any
Tax benefit related to the  Transaction Expenses in conjunction with the
filing of any Tax Return,  payment of any Taxes, or the preparation of the
Base Balance Sheet (except  for an accrual for legal fees for the period
through September 30, 2007).  (b) For the purposes of this Agreement:  (i)
"Taxes" shall mean any and all taxes, charges, fees, levies or other 
assessments, or impositions of any kind payable to the IRS or any taxing 
authority, including all interest and penalties thereon, and additions to 
tax or additional amounts attributable to, imposed upon, or with respect to 
such tax, charges, fees, levies, assessments or impositions, and including 
an liability for the Taxes of any Person under Treasury Regulation  1.1502-6
(or any similar provision of U.S. or non-U.S. law), as transferee  or
successor, by contract or otherwise. The term "Income Tax" means any tax 
measured by net income or gross income.  (ii) "Tax Returns" shall mean any
report, return, document, declaration, report,  claim for refund, information
return or statement, or other filing relating  to Taxes, including any
schedule or attachment thereto, and including any  amendment
thereof.  Section 2.11. Employee Benefit Plans.  (a) All benefit and
compensation plans, employment agreements, contracts,  policies or
arrangements covering current or former employees of the  Company and its
Subsidiaries (the "Employees") and current or former  directors of the
Company, including, but not limited to, "employee benefit  plans" within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income  Security Act of
1974, as amended ("ERISA"), deferred compensation,  severance, stock option,
stock-based, change in control, incentive and  bonus plans, health care
reimbursement, dependent care assistance and  cafeteria plans and other
fringe benefit plans (the "Benefit Plans"),  including Benefit Plans
maintained outside of the United States primarily  for the benefit of
Employees working outside of the United States (such  plans hereinafter being
referred to as "Non-U.S. Benefit Plans"), are  listed on Schedule 2.11(a) and
complete copies of all Benefit Plans listed  on Schedule 2.11(a), including,
but not limited to, any trust instruments,  insurance contracts, and all
amendments thereto have been provided, or made  available in the electronic
data room, to Buyer.  (b) All Benefit Plans, other than Non-U.S. Benefit
Plans, (collectively, "U.S.  Benefit Plans") have been administered, operated
and maintained in  compliance in all material respects (provided that any
failure to comply  would not result in material liability to the Company or
any Subsidiary)  with ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code")  including without limitation, the in-service distribution rules
and  nondiscrimination rules of ERISA and the Code, with and other
applicable  Laws and with the terms and provisions thereof. Each U.S. Benefit
Plan  which is subject to ERISA that is an "employee pension benefit plan"
within  the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Pension Plan") intended to
be  qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable 
determination or opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service (the 
"IRS"), and the Company is not aware of any circumstances that would 
reasonably be expected to result in the loss of the qualification of such 
Benefit Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code or the imposition of any 
sanctions against the Company due to the failure of such Plan to satisfy  any
requirements thereunder.  (c) No material liability under Subtitle C or D of
Title IV of ERISA has been  incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to any  ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-
employer plan," within the meaning of  Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA,
currently or formerly maintained by any of  them, or the single-employer plan
of any entity which is considered one  employer with the Company under
Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the  Code (an "ERISA Affiliate")
other than payment of premiums in the ordinary  course. No notice of a
"reportable event," within the meaning of Section  4043 of ERISA for which
the reporting requirement has not been waived or  extended, has been required
to be filed for any Pension Plan or by any  ERISA Affiliate within the
36-month period ending on the date hereof. No  notices have been required to
be sent to participants and beneficiaries or  the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation under Section 302 or 4011 of ERISA  or Section 412 of the Code
(including Section 412(m)).  (d) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate
contributes to, or in the six  years prior to the date hereof has contributed
to, any multiemployer plan,  as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.  (e) All
contributions required to be made under each Benefit Plan, as of the  date
hereof, have been timely made and all obligations in respect of each  Benefit
Plan have been properly accrued and reflected in the most recent  balance
sheet of the Company to the extent required by GAAP. No Pension  Plan has an
"accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within  the meaning
of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA. The Company  has not
provided, and is not required to provide, security to any Pension  Plan
pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.  (f) As of the date hereof,
there is no pending or, to the knowledge of the  Company, threatened
litigation or administrative action or liability other  than for routine plan
sponsorship and administration relating to the  Benefit Plans, nor, to the
knowledge of the Company, are there any  circumstances providing a basis for
any such litigation or administrative  action. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any obligations  for retiree health or life benefits
under any Benefit Plan.  (g) Except as set forth in Schedule 2.11(g),
neither the execution of this  Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein will  (i) entitle any Employees to severance
pay or any increase in severance pay  upon any termination of employment
after the date hereof or (ii) accelerate  the time of payment or vesting or
result in any payment or funding (through  a grantor trust or otherwise) of
compensation or benefits under, increase  the amount payable or result in any
other material obligation pursuant to,  any of the Benefit Plans or (iii)
result in aggregate payments to any  Employee under the Benefit Plans (as in
effect on the date hereof and as of  the Closing) in excess of $1,000,000 in
any calendar year ending after the  Closing.  (h) All Non-U.S. Benefit
Plans comply in all material respects (provided that  any failure to comply
would not result in material liability to the Company  or any Subsidiary)

provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, lease,

investigation pending or, to Buyer\'s  knowledge, threatened, against Buyer,
as to which there is a reasonable  likelihood of an adverse determination and

documents, subpoena, civil or criminal investigative  demands, or similar
process) or is required by a regulatory body to make  any disclosure with
respect to the Company\'s business that is prohibited by  this Section 5.3,

appropriate filing of a Pre-Merger  Notification and Report Form with respect
to the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement within two (2) business
days after the date hereof and to  supply promptly any additional information
and documentary material that  may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act. The
parties hereto shall at the  time of filing request early termination of the

respect  to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without
the prior  written consent of the other parties hereto which consent shall
not be  unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that a party may, without
the  prior consent of the other parties hereto, issue or cause publication
of  any such press release, public announcement or regulatory filing to the 
extent that such party reasonably determines, after consultation with 
outside legal counsel, such action to be required by law or by the rules of 
any applicable self-regulatory organization, in which event such party will 
use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other parties hereto 
reasonable time to comment on such press release, public announcement or 
regulatory filing in advance of its issuance.  Section 5.7. No
Solicitation.  (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, unless and until
this Agreement shall  have been terminated in accordance with its terms, the

offer with  respect to a merger, acquisition, or similar transaction

hand shall not, and shall ensure that its directors, officers,  employees,
partners, agents, Affiliates, advisors or representatives shall  not,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit for employment or employ any  officer,
employee or consultant of the other party, (ii) encourage, induce  or attempt
to induce any officer, employee or consultant of the other party  to
terminate his or her employment or consulting relationship with the  other
party, (iii) interfere with the business or operations of the other  party,
or (iv) take or fail to take any actions which could reasonably be  expected

customers and suppliers or goodwill.  Section 5.8. Conveyance Taxes;
Costs.   All transfer, value added, excise, stock transfer, stamp,
recording,  registration and any similar duties or Taxes that become payable

by the  Stockholders, and the Stockholder Representative shall, file all
necessary  Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
Taxes  described in this Section 5.8.  Section 5.9. Books and Records;
Insurance.   Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and each Subsidiary
to, until the  seventh anniversary of the Closing Date, retain all Tax

the same  available for inspection and copying by the Stockholders or any 
representative of the Stockholders at the expense of the Stockholders  during
the normal business hours of Buyer, the Company or such Subsidiary,  as
applicable, upon reasonable request and upon reasonable notice.  Section
5.10. Officers\' and Directors\' Indemnification.   The Company, the
Stockholders and Buyer agree that all rights to  exculpation and
indemnification existing in favor of, and all limitations  on the personal
liability of, the directors, officers, employees of the  Company and its
Subsidiaries ("Indemnified Persons") provided for in its  Charter and by-laws
and the organizational documents of its Subsidiaries,  as applicable, as in
effect as of the date hereof with respect to matters  occurring prior to and
through the Closing, and specifically including the  transactions
contemplated hereby, shall continue in full force and effect  for a period of
six (6) years from the Closing; provided, however, that all  rights to
indemnification in respect of any claims asserted or made within  such period
shall continue until the disposition of such claim. Following  the Closing,
Buyer shall not, and shall not permit the Company or any  Subsidiary to,
amend or modify its Charter or by-laws or other  organizational documents, as
applicable, except as required by applicable  law, if the effect of such
amendment or modification would be to lessen or  otherwise adversely affect
the indemnification rights of such Indemnified  Persons as provided therein,
and Buyer shall cause the Company or any  Subsidiary to advance expenses to
each such Indemnified Person in  connection with any proceeding involving
such Indemnified Person to the  fullest extent so permitted upon receipt of
any undertaking required by law  or in the Charter or by-laws of the Company
or the organizational documents  of such Subsidiary, as applicable. In the
event that the Company or any  Subsidiary transfers all or substantially all
of its properties and assets  to any Person, then and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made  so that the transferee of such properties or
assets shall assume the  obligations of the Company or such Subsidiary, as
applicable, under this  Section 5.10. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
purchase an extended  reporting period endorsement under the Company\'s
existing directors\' and  officers\' liability insurance coverage for the
Company\'s and its  Subsidiaries\' directors and officers in a form
acceptable to the Company  which shall provide such directors and officers
with coverage for six (6)  years following the Closing of not less than the
existing coverage under,  and have other terms not materially less favorable
to, the insured Persons  than the directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance coverage presently  maintained by the Company. This Section 5.10 is
intended to benefit each of  the Indemnified Persons and their respective
heirs and personal  representatives, each whom shall be entitled to enforce
the provisions  hereof. Nothing in this Section 5.10 shall be deemed to
extend to  Stockholders (other than trustees, officers or directors of
Stockholders  that are officers or directors of the Company) any rights of
directors,  officers or employees provided for herein.  Section 5.11.

for directors and officers as provided in Section 5.10. Each Stockholder 
further agrees to execute a release substantially similar to the release 
contained in this Section 5.11 upon the Closing. Each Stockholder hereby 
represents and warrants that he, she or it has adequate information 
regarding the terms of this Agreement, the scope and effect of the releases

any defined benefit pension plan) following the Closing Date  for the benefit
of Company Employees, such plan, program or arrangement  shall credit such
Company Employees for service on or prior to the Closing  Date that was
recognized by the Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case  may be, for
purposes of employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements  maintained by

of satisfying applicable deductible  coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket

discretion whether to renew such plan or  to provide the Company Employees
with coverage under welfare benefit plans  otherwise maintained by

not a  party to this Agreement. This Section 6.1 shall be binding on all 
successors and assigns of Buyer and the Company. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, (i) nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted or construed 
to confer upon the Company Employees any right with respect to continuance 
of employment by the Company, such Subsidiaries or Buyer, nor shall this 
Agreement interfere in any way with the right of the Company, such 
Subsidiaries or Buyer to terminate any employee\'s employment at any time 
and (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall interfere in any way with the  right

obligated to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified  Party pursuant to Section
8.2(a)(ii), Section 8.2(a)(iii), Section  8.2(a)(v) and Section 8.2(a)(vi)
for any amount of Losses in excess of the  Escrow Fund and the Escrow Fund

obligations under Section 8.2(a)(ii),  Section 8.2(a)(iii), Section 8.2(a)(v)
and Section 8.2(a)(vi); and  (iii) no indemnification shall be payable to a

Date.  (c) The indemnification obligations of the Stockholders pursuant to

Claims) and  Section 8.2(a)(iv) shall be limited as set forth in this Section

Stockholder\'s Pro Rata Share of such Loss (which  limitation shall not apply
to breaches of representations and warranties by  such Stockholder of any
representations and warranties made by such  Stockholder);  (ii)
attributable to a breach of this Agreement by any other Stockholder;  (iii)
in excess of such Stockholder\'s Pro Rata Share of the Purchase Price 
received by such Stockholder; and/or  (iv) asserted after the expiration of
the statute of limitations applicable to  such claim.  (d) A Buyer
Indemnified Party must proceed first against and exhaust the Escrow  Fund in
respect of all indemnification claims under this Section 8.2 before 
proceeding against any Stockholder; provided that a Buyer Indemnified Party 
may proceed directly against the Stockholders in respect of any Excluded 
Claim once the aggregate of all Excluded Claims exceeds $1,000,000.  (e) The
amount of Losses otherwise recoverable under this Section 8.2 shall be 
reduced to the extent of any insurance proceeds and any indemnity, 
contribution or other similar payment actually received by Buyer  Indemnified
Parties from any third party with respect thereto and of any  Federal, state,
local or foreign tax benefits when and as realized (net of  any Tax cost) by
the Buyer Indemnified Parties by reason of any Loss or  indemnity payment
hereunder.  (f) No Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification hereunder  for any Loss (including, but not limited to, a
breach of any representation  contained in Sections 2.5, 2.15(a), 2.22 and
2.24) and the amount of any  Loss shall not be included in the calculation of
the Deductible Amount or  any other limitations on indemnification set forth
herein, to the extent  that such Loss is included in a Current Liability
included in the  calculation of Final Working Capital up to the amount so
included.  (g) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no breach of
any  representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein shall
give  rise to any right on the part of a Buyer Indemnified Party, after the 
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, to rescind this 
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.  (h) Neither the
Company nor the Stockholders shall have any liability under any  provision of
this Agreement or otherwise for any exemplary or punitive  damages or any
multiple of damages.  (i) Any liability for indemnification under this
Section 8.2 shall be  determined without duplication of recovery by reason of
the state of facts  giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of
more than one  representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.  (j) Any
liability for indemnification under this Section 8.2 which is based on  a
breach of any representation or warranty contained in Sections 2.10,  2.11(b)
or (h), 2.13(a) or 2.19 shall be determined without regard to any 
qualification of materiality contained in such Sections.  (k) A Buyer
Indemnified Party shall give the Stockholder Representative written  notice
of any claim, assertion, event or proceeding by or in respect of a  third
party as to which such Buyer Indemnified Party may request  indemnification
hereunder or as to which the Deductible Amount may be  applied as soon as is
practicable and in any event within thirty (30) days  of the time that such
Buyer Indemnified Party learns of such claim,  assertion, event or
proceeding; provided, however, that the failure to so  notify the Stockholder
Representative shall not affect rights to  indemnification hereunder except
to the extent that the Stockholders\' are  prejudiced by such failure. Except
as set forth in Section 8.2(l), the  Stockholder Representative shall have
the right to direct, through counsel  of its own choosing, the defense or
settlement of any such claim or  proceeding at its own expense. If the
Stockholder Representative elects to  assume the defense of any such claim or
proceeding, the Stockholder  Representative shall consult with the Buyer
Indemnified Party for the  purpose of allowing the Buyer Indemnified Party to
participate in such  defense, but in such case the expenses of the Buyer
Indemnified Party shall  be paid by the Buyer Indemnified Party. A Buyer
Indemnified Party shall  provide and shall cause the Company to provide, as
applicable, the  Stockholder Representative and counsel with access to its
records and  personnel relating to any such claim, assertion, event or
proceeding during  normal business hours and shall otherwise cooperate with
the Stockholder  Representative in the defense or settlement thereof, and the
Stockholders  shall reimburse Buyer Indemnified Party for all its
reasonable  out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith. If the
Stockholder  Representative elects to direct the defense of any such claim
or  proceeding, Buyer Indemnified Party shall not pay, or permit to be
paid,  any part of any claim or demand arising from such asserted liability
unless  the Stockholder Representative consents in writing to such payment
or  unless the Stockholder Representative, subject to the last sentence of
this  Section 8.2(k), withdraws from the defense of such asserted liability
or  unless a final judgment from which no appeal may be taken by or on
behalf  of the Stockholders is entered against Buyer Indemnified Party for
such  liability. If the Stockholder Representative fails to defend or if,
after  commencing or undertaking any such defense, the Stockholder
Representative  fails to prosecute or withdraws from such defense, Buyer
Indemnified Party  shall have the right to undertake the defense or
settlement thereof, at the  Stockholders\' expense. If the Buyer Indemnified
Party assumes the defense  of any such claim or proceeding pursuant to this
Section 8.2(k) and  proposes to settle such claim or proceeding prior to a
final judgment  thereon or to forego any appeal with respect thereto, then
the Buyer  Indemnified Party shall give the Stockholder Representative prompt
written  notice thereof, and the Stockholder Representative shall have the
right to  participate in the settlement or assume or reassume the defense of
such  claim or proceeding.  (l) Notwithstanding Section 8.2(k), if (i) at
the time a claim is made the  aggregate amount payable with respect to all
pending claims is reasonably  expected to exceed the remaining amount in the
Escrow Fund by more than the  amount remaining in the Escrow Fund, (ii) at
the time a claim is made the  aggregate amount payable with respect to all
pending claims is reasonably  expected to be less than the Deductible Amount
or to exceed the Deductible  Amount by less than $1,500,000 or (iii) the
outcome of a claim would  reasonably be expected to have a material impact on
the Company\'s business,  operations, reputation or prospects, then, in each
such case, the Buyer  Indemnified Party shall have the right to direct,
through counsel of its  own choosing, the defense or settlement of any such
claim or proceeding and  shall consult with the Stockholder Representative
for the purpose of  allowing the Stockholder Representative to participate in
such defense, but  in such case the expenses of the Stockholder
Representative shall be paid  by the Stockholder Representative; provided,
however, that any claim,  assertion, event or proceeding by or in respect of
a third party as to  which a Buyer Indemnified Party may request
indemnification under Section  8.2(a)(v) or Section 8.2(a)(vi) shall be
governed by Section 8.2(k) above.  A Buyer Indemnified Party shall provide
and shall cause the Company to  provide, as applicable, the Stockholder
Representative and counsel with  access to its records and personnel relating
to any such claim, assertion,  event or proceeding during normal business
hours and shall otherwise  cooperate with the Stockholder Representative in
the defense or settlement  thereof, and the Stockholders shall reimburse
Buyer Indemnified Party for  all its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in
connection therewith. Buyer  Indemnified Party shall not consent to the entry
of judgment with respect  to the matter or enter into any settlement with
respect to the matter  without consulting with the Stockholder Representative
in advance. If the  Buyer Indemnified Party fails to defend or if, after
commencing or  undertaking any such defense, the Buyer Indemnified Party
fails to  prosecute or withdraws from such defense, Stockholder
Representative shall  have the right to undertake the defense or settlement
thereof, at the  Stockholders\' expense provided that the Stockholder
Representative notified  the Buyer Indemnified Party in writing of its
election to indemnify the  Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to such claim
or proceeding by or in  respect of a third party. If the Stockholder
Representative assumes the  defense of any such claim or proceeding pursuant
to this Section 8.2(l) and  proposes to settle such claim or proceeding prior
to a final judgment  thereon or to forego any appeal with respect thereto,
then the Stockholder  Representative shall give the Buyer Indemnified Party
prompt written notice  thereof, and the Buyer Indemnified Party shall have
the right to  participate in the settlement.  (m) The Stockholders shall
not be obligated to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified  Party pursuant to
Section 8.2(a)(vi) for the amount of the respective  Losses unless (A) the
Company deducts on its federal, and state income tax  returns for the period
ending on the Closing Date $6,140,000 related to  Change in Control Payment
made at Closing, (B) the Company deducts on its  federal, and state income
tax returns the full amount of the Deferred  Escrow (other than amounts paid
to Stockholders), (C) the Company deducts  on its federal, and state income
tax return any amount paid pursuant to the  third to last sentence of Section
1.2(c), (D) the Company deducts on its  federal, and state income tax return
any amount paid pursuant to Section  1.3(c)(ii)(B) and (E) the Buyer, the
Company, and its Subsidiaries refrain  from (x) disclosing on any Tax Return
if it is not more likely than not  that such deduction is allowable, or
otherwise providing notice to the IRS  or any other Governmental Authority,
any information with respect to such  deductions, except to the extent such
disclosure is otherwise required to  avoid the imposition of penalties on the
Company or the income tax return  preparer or is otherwise required by law
and (y) seeking a private letter  ruling or a pre-filing agreement (or the
equivalent thereof) from the IRS  or any other Governmental Authority with
respect to such deductions, except  to the extent otherwise required by law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the  Company shall not be required to claim a
deduction under (A) through (D) of  the preceding sentence to the extent an
income tax return preparer is not  permitted to claim such a deduction under
Section 10.34 of Circular 230.  Because any claim or claims under Section
8.2(a)(vi) are not subject to the  Deductible Amount, the Stockholder
Representative shall have the right to  control any contest (including any
administrative appeals or audits) which  could result in an indemnification
obligation pursuant to Section  8.2(a)(vi), subject, however, to the
remaining provisions of Section 8.2(k)  and Section 8.2(l) other than with
respect to the Deductible Amount.  Subject to compliance with this Section
8.2(m), after the 23-month  anniversary of the Closing Date and prior to the
24-month anniversary of  the Closing Date, a Buyer Indemnified Party will
have the right to make a  claim for indemnification under Section 8.2(a)(vi)
with respect to any  Indemnified Deductions for which an indemnity claim has
not previously been  made, whether or not any claim by the IRS or any other
Governmental  Authority has been made with respect to such Indemnified
Deductions and  whether or not such Buyer Indemnified Party has incurred any
Loss with  respect thereto. Such claim (1) shall be made against the Escrow
Fund by  delivering a Claim Notice as provided in Section 5(f) of the 
Indemnification Escrow Agreement, and (2) shall constitute an Open Claim  (as
defined in the Indemnification Escrow Agreement) under the  Indemnification
Escrow Agreement. If no claim is made by the IRS or any  other Governmental
Authority with respect to an Indemnified Deduction  included in such Open
Claim prior to the expiration of the statute of  limitations applicable to
such Indemnified Deduction, then, no later than  five (5) days following the
expiration of such statute of limitations, the  Buyer and the Stockholder
Representative shall provide joint written  instructions to the Escrow Agent
to distribute the amount of such  Indemnified Deduction to the
Stockholders.  Section 8.3. Treatment of Indemnity Payments.   All
payments made by the Stockholders or Buyer, as the case may be, to or  for
the benefit of the other parties pursuant to this Article VIII shall be 
treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for tax purposes, and such 
agreed treatment shall govern for purposes of this Agreement.  Section 8.4.
Remedies Exclusive  (a) Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that prior to

their respective  representations or warranties contained herein or a
material failure to  comply with any of their covenants, conditions or

covenants  of the Company, the Stockholders or the Stockholder Representative

the Stockholder Representative, if the Company and the  Stockholders are not
then in material breach of any term of this Agreement,  upon written notice
to Buyer, upon a material breach of any representation,  warranty or covenant
of Buyer contained in this Agreement, provided that  such breach is not
capable of being cured or has not been cured within  thirty (30) days after
the giving of notice thereof by the Company or the  Stockholder
Representative to Buyer;  (c) by Buyer, if Buyer is not then in material
breach of any term of this  Agreement, upon written notice to Company and the

not been  cured within thirty (30) days after the giving of notice thereof by
Buyer  to the Company and the Stockholder Representative;  (d) by Buyer,
the Company or the Stockholder Representative at any time after  January7,
2008, if the Closing has not occurred as of such date and the  party seeking
termination is not then in material breach of any of the  terms of this

in this Agreement, if January 7, 2008 the conditions to  Closing set forth in
Section 7.1(c) and Section 7.2(c) with respect to the  receipt of regulatory
approvals or consents from Governmental Authorities  have not been satisfied,
then each of Buyer and the Stockholder  Representative shall have the right
to extend to a specified date that is  within five (5) business days
following the expected receipt of such  approvals or consents by providing

entered any statute, rule, regulation, injunction  or other order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in  effect and has the effect of
making the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement for the Closing
illegal or otherwise restraining or prohibiting  consummation of such
transactions; and  (g) by the Company or the Stockholder Representative, if,
at the time of the  Closing, Buyer has not completed the financing
contemplated in the  Commitment Letter or otherwise have sufficient funds for
Buyer to  consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the  payments required pursuant to Section 1.2 and Section 1.3, it
being  understood that this Section 9.1(g) shall not give rise to a right of
the  Company or the Stockholders to declare an anticipatory repudiation by
Buyer  or otherwise to effect termination of this Agreement prior to such
time as  all other conditions to Closing described in Section 7.2 have been 
satisfied or waived.  Section 9.2. Effect of Termination.   In the event
of termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 9.1,  this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and there shall be no further  liability or
obligations hereunder on the part of any party hereto or their  respective
Affiliates except for the obligations of the parties pursuant to  this
Section 9.2 and Sections 5.3, 5.7(b) and 10.2; provided, however, that 
nothing herein shall relieve either party from liability for any willful 
breach of this Agreement existing at the time of such termination. If this 
Agreement is terminated by the Company or the Stockholder Representative 
pursuant to Section 9.1(b) or 9.1(g), then the Buyer shall pay to the 
Company an amount in cash equal to $10,000,000 as promptly as possible (but 
in any event within five (5) business days) following such termination. If 
this Agreement is terminated by the Buyer pursuant to Section 9.1(c), then 
the Company shall pay to the Buyer an amount in cash equal to $10,000,000  as
promptly as possible (but in any event within five (5) business days) 
following such termination. Section 9.3. Waiver. At any time prior to the 
Closing, Buyer, the Company and the Stockholder Representative hereto may 
(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other 
acts of the other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the 
representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in  any
document delivered by the other party pursuant hereto or (c) waive 
compliance with any of the agreements of the other party or conditions to 
its own obligations contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be 
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party to 
be bound thereby. Waiver of any term or condition of this Agreement by a 
party shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or waiver 
of the same term or condition by such party, or a waiver of any other term 
or condition of this Agreement by such party.  Article X - GENERAL

Section, Schedule  or Exhibit, such reference will be to an Article or
Section of, or a  Schedule or Exhibit to, this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. The  table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement
are for  reference purposes only and will not affect in any way the meaning
or  interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include",
"includes"  or "including" are used in this Agreement, they will be deemed to
be  followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof,"
"herein"  and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this
Agreement  will refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision  of this Agreement. All terms used herein with initial capital
letters have  the meanings ascribed to them herein and all terms defined in
this  Agreement will have such defined meanings when used in any certificate
or  other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise
defined  therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable
to the  singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the
masculine as  well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any
agreement,  instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any
agreement or  instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement,
instrument or  statute as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, including  (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver

considered one and the same agreement and will become effective  when one or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and  delivered to
the other parties.  Section 10.7. Amendments.   This Agreement may not be
amended or modified, nor may compliance with any  condition or covenant set
forth herein be waived, except by a writing duly  and validly executed by
Buyer, the Company and the Stockholder  Representative, or in the case of a
waiver, the party waiving compliance.  Section 10.8. Entire Agreement;
Severability.   This Agreement (including the exhibits, schedules, documents
and  instruments referred to herein) and the Confidentiality Agreement 
constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and 
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to  the
subject matter of this Agreement. If any term, condition or other  provision
of this Agreement is found to be invalid, illegal or incapable of  being
enforced by virtue of any rule of law, public policy or court  determination,
all other terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement  shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect.  Section 10.9. Third Party
Beneficiaries.   Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, each party

cause of  action in or on behalf of any Person other than the parties

by, and construed in accordance with, the  internal laws of the Commonwealth

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations  under
this Agreement may be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of  law or
otherwise by the parties hereto without the prior written consent of  the
Company, the Stockholder Representative and the Buyer. Any assignment  in
violation of the preceding sentence will be void. Subject to the  preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the  benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the parties and their respective  successors and
assigns.  Section 10.12. Consent to Jurisdiction.   Each of the parties
hereby consents to exclusive jurisdiction, service of  process and venue in
the federal or state courts of the Commonwealth of  Massachusetts for any
claim, suit or proceeding arising under this  Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated hereby or in the case of a  third party claim subject to
indemnification hereunder, in the court where  such claim is
brought.  Section 10.13. Dispute Resolution.  (a) Any dispute arising out
of or relating to this Agreement, including, but  not limited to, claims for
indemnification pursuant to Article VIII other  than under Section 1.3 hereof
shall be resolved in accordance with the  procedures specified in this
Section 10.13 which shall be the sole and  exclusive procedures for the
resolution of any such disputes.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any dispute
regarding the Closing Working  Capital shall be resolved in accordance with
Section 1.3.  (b) The parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve any
dispute arising out  of or relating to this Agreement promptly by negotiation
between the  Stockholder Representative and executives of Buyer who, if
possible, are at  a higher level of management than the persons with direct
responsibility  for administration of this Agreement. Any party may give the
other party  written notice of any dispute not resolved in the normal course
of  business. Within 15 days after delivery of the notice, the receiving
party  shall submit to the other a written response. The notice and response
shall  include (i) a statement of each party\'s position, and (ii) the name
and  title of the executive who will act as such party\'s representative.
Within  30 days after delivery of the disputing party\'s notice, the
Stockholder  Representative and the Buyer shall meet at a mutually acceptable
time and  place, and thereafter as often as they reasonably deem necessary to
attempt  to resolve the dispute. All reasonable requests for information made
by one  party to the other will be honored. All negotiations pursuant to
this  clause are confidential and shall be treated as compromise and
settlement  negotiations for purposes of the Federal Rules of Evidence and
State Rules  of Evidence.  (c) If the matter has not been resolved by these
persons within 60 days of the  disputing party\'s notice, or if the parties
fail to meet within 30 days,  either party may initiate litigation as
provided hereinafter.  (d) All negotiations pursuant to this clause are
confidential and shall be  treated as compromise and settlement negotiations
for purposes of the  Federal Rules of Evidence and State Rules of
Evidence.  (e) If the dispute has not been resolved by the procedures
provided for in this  Section 10.13 within 60 days of the initiation of such
procedures, either  party may initiate litigation upon 30 days written notice
to the other  party; provided, however, that if one party has requested the
other to  participate in such procedures and the other party has failed to 
participate, the requesting party may provide written notice of its intent 
to initiate litigation prior to the expiration of such 60-day period.  (f)
The procedures specified in this Section 10.13 shall be the sole and 
exclusive procedures for the resolution of disputes between the parties 
arising out of or relating to this Agreement; provided, however, that any 
party may, without prejudice to the above procedures, seek preliminary 
injunction if in its sole judgment such action is necessary to avoid 
irreparable damage or to preserve the status quo. Despite such action the 
parties will continue to participate in good faith in the procedures 
specified in this Section 10.13.  (g) All applicable statutes of limitation
and defenses based upon the passage  of time shall be tolled while the
procedures specified in Section 10.13 are  pending. The parties will take
such action, if any, required to effectuate  such tolling.  (h) Each party
is required to continue to perform its obligations under this  Agreement
pending final resolution of any dispute arising out of or  relating to this
Agreement.  Section 10.14. Mutual Drafting.   The parties hereto are
sophisticated and have been represented by attorneys  throughout the
transactions contemplated hereby who have carefully  negotiated the
provisions hereof. As a consequence, the parties do not  intend that the
presumptions of laws or rules relating to the  interpretation of contracts
against the drafter of any particular clause  should be applied to this
Agreement or any agreement or instrument executed  in connection herewith,
and therefore waive their effects.  Section 10.15. Remedies.   Other than
any breach of a provision of this Agreement for which a payment  is provided
for under Section 9.2, it is specifically understood and agreed  that any
breach of the provisions of this Agreement or any other agreement  executed
and delivered pursuant to this Agreement by any party hereto could  result in
irreparable injury to the other parties hereto, that the remedy  at law alone
could be an inadequate remedy for such breach, and that, in  addition to any
other remedies which they may have, such other parties may  seek to enforce
their respective rights by actions for specific performance  (to the extent
permitted by law).  Section 10.16. New Agreements.   In connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the  Buyer has specifically
authorized and directed the Company to enter into  with Mr. Smith the (a)
Executive Employment Agreement and (b) Separate  Agreement and General
Release (together, the "Smith Employment Agreement")  and, prior to the
Closing, the Buyer may direct the Company to enter into  employment
agreements with other executives of the Company (all of such  agreements,
including the Smith Employment Agreement, the "New  Agreements").
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,  and except to
the extent the New Agreements preserve or restate the same  terms previously
existing with respect to Mr. Smith or such other  executives, the Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that (i) the Company and the  Stockholders are not
responsible for the terms or content of any New  Agreement or the impact or
effect of any New Agreement on any existing  agreement or Benefit Plan of the
Company, (ii) the New Agreements shall not  be deemed to exist for purposes
of the Company\'s and the Stockholders  representations, warranties,
covenants, obligations and conditions under  this Agreement, (iii) in no
event shall the existence of the New Agreements  be permitted to have an
adverse effect on any of the rights and obligations  of the Company and the
Stockholders under this Agreement, and (iv) neither  the existence or terms
of the New Agreements nor the effect of the New  Agreements on any existing
contract or Benefit Plan of the Company shall  form the basis of any
indemnification claim under Article VIII or any other  claim against the
Company or the Stockholders.   SECTION 1.3(B) OF THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A
BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION  WHICH MAY BE ENFORCED BY THE PARTIES.
