1.4. _Determination of the Purchase Price_.

 

(a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller Parent shall
deliver to Purchaser a statement (the " _Closing Payment Statement_ ")
setting forth Seller Parents good faith estimate of (i) the Closing
Indebtedness Amount (as estimated, the " _Estimated Closing Indebtedness
Amount_ "), (ii) the Net Working Capital Amount (as estimated, the "
_Estimated Net Working Capital Amount_ "), (iii) the Company Transaction
Expenses (as

 



3  estimated, the " _Estimated Company Transaction Expenses_ ") and (iv) the
resulting calculation of the Closing Date Purchase Price (as estimated, the "
_Estimated Closing Date Purchase Price_ "). Following delivery of the Closing
Payment Statement, Seller Parent will, and will cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, (A) provide reasonable access to Purchaser and its auditors,
advisors and all other Representatives to all financial statements and
supporting materials showing the calculation of each component, books, records
and work papers used in preparing the Closing Payment Statement, in each case
to the extent relating to the Closing Payment Statement, and (B) consider in
good faith any comments to the Closing Payment Statement made by Purchaser.

(b) As promptly as possible following the Closing, but in any event within
ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser, working in conjunction
with the Company and its Subsidiaries, shall deliver to Seller Parent a
reasonably detailed statement, together with reasonable supporting material
(the " _Closing Statement_ "), setting forth Purchasers good faith
calculations of the Closing Indebtedness Amount, the Net Working Capital
Amount, the Company Transaction Expenses and the resulting calculation of the
Closing Date Purchase Price. In connection with Seller Parents review of the
Closing Statement, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, provide reasonable access to Seller Parent and its auditors,
advisors and all other Representatives to all financial statements and
supporting materials showing the calculation of each component, books, records
and work papers used in preparing the Closing Statement, in each case to
the extent relating to the Closing Statement. If Seller Parent claims that
Purchaser has failed to comply with its obligation under this _Section
1.4(b)_ to provide access to books, records, and personnel, it may initiate
the appointment of the Independent Auditor, which shall have the authority to
determine if Purchaser has complied with its obligations to provide access and
to order Purchaser to comply with any such obligations. If Seller Parent has
any objections to the Closing Statement and/or any calculations set forth
therein, Seller Parent shall deliver to Purchaser a statement setting forth
its objections thereto and, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor, a
specific dollar amount related to each objection and Seller Parents
alternative calculations with respect to each disputed item (the " _Objections
Statement_ "). If the Objections Statement is not delivered by Seller Parent
within sixty (60) days after delivery by Purchaser of the Closing Statement
to Seller Parent, the Closing Statement shall be final, conclusive, binding
and non-appealable. If an Objections Statement is delivered by Seller Parent
within sixty (60) days after delivery by Purchaser of the Closing Statement
to Seller Parent, any item for which there is no objection specifically
identified on the Objections Statement shall become final and binding upon the
parties.

 

(c) If the Objections Statement is delivered by Seller Parent, then the
Closing Statement and the calculations set forth therein, each as revised in
accordance with this _Section 1.4(c)_, shall become final and binding upon
the parties on the earlier of (i) the date any and all matters specified in
the Objections Statement are finally resolved in writing by Seller Parent and
Purchaser and (ii) the date any and all matters specified in the Objections
Statement not resolved by Seller Parent and Purchaser are finally resolved in
writing by the Independent Auditor (it being understood that the
Independent Auditor shall be functioning solely as an expert and not as an
arbitrator). The Closing Statement and the calculations set forth therein
shall be revised to the extent necessary to reflect any resolution by Seller
Parent and Purchaser and any final resolution determined by the Independent
Auditor in accordance with this _Section 1.4(c)_. During the 30-day period
immediately following the delivery of the Objections Statement (or such
longer 

 



4  period as Seller Parent and Purchaser may agree in writing), Seller Parent
and Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any objections set
forth in the Objections Statement. At the end of such 30-day period, Seller
Parent and/or Purchaser may submit to the Independent Auditor for review and
resolution in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof, any and all
matters that remain in dispute with respect to the Objections Statement, the
Closing Statement and the calculations set forth therein. Seller Parent and
Purchaser shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Independent Auditor to resolve all such disputes as soon as practicable (which
final resolution by the Independent Auditor shall be requested by Purchaser
and Seller Parent to be delivered not more than thirty (30) days following
submission of such disputed matters to the Independent Auditor), and Purchaser
and Seller Parent shall reasonably cooperate with the Independent Auditor
during its engagement. The Independent Auditor may consider only those items
and amounts in the Closing Statement and the Objections Statement that
Purchaser and Seller Parent are unable to resolve. In resolving any disputed
item, the Independent Auditor may not assign a value to any item greater than
the highest value for such item claimed by either Purchaser or Seller Parent
or less than the lowest value for such item claimed by either Purchaser or
Seller Parent. The Independent Auditors determinations shall be based solely
on written submissions by Purchaser and Seller Parent that are in accordance
with the applicable guidelines and procedures set forth herein (i.e., not on
the basis of independent review) and on the definitions included herein. No
party shall engage in any _ex parte_ communications with the Independent
Auditor. The determinations by the Independent Auditor shall: (A) be set forth
in a brief written statement delivered to Purchaser and Seller Parent, (B) be
final, conclusive, binding, non-appealable and incontestable by the parties
hereto and each of their respective Affiliates and successors and permitted
assigns, and (C) not be subject to dispute for any reason other than manifest
error or fraud. The Closing Statement and the calculation of the Closing
Indebtedness Amount, the Net Working Capital Amount, the Company Transaction
Expenses and the resulting calculation of the Closing Date Purchase Price set
forth therein (as applicable) shall be modified if necessary to reflect such
determination(s). The fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor shall be
paid by Purchaser, on the one hand, and/or Seller Parent, on the other hand,
based upon the percentage that the disputed amount not awarded to each party
bears to the amount in dispute. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section
1.4_ to the contrary, in connection with its determination related to any
Objections Statement, the Independent Auditor shall not make any decision with
respect to any Tax matters, which shall be determined exclusively in
accordance with _Article VII_. If, before the Independent Auditor renders its
determination with respect to the disputed items in accordance with this
_Section 1.4(c)_, (x) Purchaser notifies Seller Parent of its agreement with
any items in the Closing Payment Statement or (y) Seller Parent notifies
Purchaser of its agreement with any items in the Closing Statement, then, in
each case, such items as so agreed will be final, conclusive and binding on
all parties immediately upon such notice.

 

(d) For purposes hereof, the " _Final Closing Indebtedness Amount_ ," " _Final
Net Working Capital Amount_ ," " _Final Company Transaction Expenses_ " and "
_Final Purchase Price_ " shall respectively mean the Closing Indebtedness
Amount, the Net Working Capital Amount, the Company Transaction Expenses and
the Closing Date Purchase Price, as applicable, in each case, as finally
determined pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)_ or _Section 1.4(c)_.

 



5 (e) Any difference between the Final Purchase Price and the Closing Date
Purchase Price shall constitute an adjustment to the Aggregate Purchase
Price, and the Aggregate Purchase Price, as adjusted, is referred to herein as
the " _Final All-In Purchase Price_."

 

(f) Each of the Closing Payment Statement and the Closing Statement shall be
(i) in a format substantially similar to the sample calculation with respect
to Net Working Capital Amount attached to this Agreement as _Schedule 1.4(f)_
, it being understood that in the event of an inconsistency between such
illustrative calculation and the Agreed Principles, the Agreed Principles
will prevail; (ii) prepared and determined from the books and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and in accordance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods indicated and with the Agreed Principles; and (iii)
consistent with the provisions of this Agreement relating to the parties
respective rights and obligations for the payment or reimbursement of costs
and expenses.

(g) If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Closing Date
Purchase Price, Seller Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the account
designated in writing by Purchaser within three (3) Business Days following
the date on which the Final Purchase Price is determined pursuant to this
_Section 1.4_, an amount equal to the absolute value of the difference
between the Final Purchase Price and the Estimated Closing Date Purchase
Price.

1.5. _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
and for the avoidance of doubt, (a) each payment made by a party or any
Affiliate thereof pursuant to this Agreement shall be made net of any Taxes
required by applicable Law to be deducted or withheld from such payment, and
(b) any amounts deducted or withheld from any such payment shall be remitted
to the applicable Taxing Authority and shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which
such withholding was required. Provided that Shaw delivers a certificate
described in _Section 1.2(b)(iv)(H)_, the parties do not currently anticipate
that any payments made pursuant to this Agreement will be subject to any
withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Seller Parent or
Purchaser becomes aware that any amount is required to be so withheld, it
shall promptly (and in any event, no later than five (5) Business Days prior
to any such withholding) notify the other of any such required withholding,
and the parties shall cooperate with each other in good faith to reduce or
eliminate any such withholding Taxes.

 

1.6. _Purchase Price Allocation_. Within one hundred and twenty (120) days
following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare (or cause to be prepared)
and deliver to Seller Parent a schedule (the " _Allocation Schedule_ ")
allocating the total consideration paid for the Transferred Equity Interests
(and all other amounts payable and liabilities assumed pursuant to this
Agreement or otherwise treated as consideration for federal income tax
purposes) among the Company and its Subsidiaries and among the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable. Thereafter, Purchaser shall
provide Seller Parent from time to time revised copies of the Allocation
Schedule (the " _Revised Statements_ ") so as to report any matter on the
Allocation Schedule that needs updating (including adjustments made pursuant
to _Section 1.3_ or _Section 1.4_, if any). The Allocation Schedule and the
Revised Statements shall be prepared in accordance with Section 338 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. The Allocation Schedule and the
Revised Statements shall be deemed to be accepted by, and shall be

 



6  final, conclusive and binding on, Seller Parent except to the extent, if
any, that Seller Parent shall have delivered, within thirty (30) days after
the date on which the Allocation Schedule or Revised Statement is delivered
to Seller Parent, a written notice to Purchaser stating each and every item to
which Seller Parent takes exception (it being understood that any amounts not
disputed shall be final, conclusive and binding). If a change proposed by
Seller Parent is disputed by Purchaser, then Purchaser and Seller Parent shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If, after a period of twenty
(20) days following the date on which Seller Parent gives Purchaser notice of
any such proposed change, any such proposed change still remains disputed,
then Seller Parent and Purchaser shall submit the remaining disputes to the
Independent Auditor to be resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth
in  _Section 1.4_. Promptly upon receiving the final and binding Allocation
Schedule and Revised Statement, Purchaser and Seller Parent shall return an
executed copy thereof to the other party. Purchaser and Seller Parent shall
file (or cause to be filed) all federal, state and local Tax Returns (such as
IRS Form 8883 or any other forms required to be filed pursuant to Section 338
of the Code or any comparable provisions of Law) in accordance with the
Allocation Schedule and the Revised Statements, and shall take and cause to
be taken no position contrary thereto or inconsistent therewith in any amended
return or claim for refund, any examination or audit by any Taxing Authority,
or any other proceeding, except to the extent otherwise required by Law.

4.4. _Purchase Entirely for Own Account; Economic Risk; Financial
Capability_. Purchaser is acquiring the Transferred Equity Interests for its
own account, for investment purposes only and not with a view to the
distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act. Purchaser has no
present intention of selling, granting any participation in or otherwise
distributing the Transferred Equity Interests. Purchaser understands that the
Transferred Equity Interests have not been registered under the Securities Act
and cannot be sold unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act or
an exemption from such registration is available. Purchaser acknowledges that
it can bear the economic risk of its investment in the Transferred Equity
Interests and has such knowledge and experience in financial or business
matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the
investment in such Transferred Equity Interests. Purchaser has available
sufficient cash for it to complete the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to satisfy all of the obligations under this Agreement.

4.5. _Proceedings_. As of the date hereof, there are no Proceedings pending
or to Purchasers Knowledge threatened in writing against Purchaser by or
before any Governmental Authority, which if determined adversely to Purchaser
would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Purchaser. As
of the date hereof, there are no Proceedings pending or to Purchasers
Knowledge threatened in writing against or by Purchaser that challenge or seek
to prevent, enjoin or otherwise delay the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except as would not have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

4.6. _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any
brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or
on behalf of Purchaser.

 



25 4.7. _Owner Settlement and Release Agreements_. As of the date hereof, the
Owner Settlement and Release Agreements are valid and binding and in full
force and effect with respect to Purchaser Parent and to the Knowledge of
Purchaser, the other parties thereto. There are no conditions to effectiveness
of the Owner Settlement and Release Agreements other than the closing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that such closing shall have
occurred no later than March 31, 2016, and neither Owner Settlement and
Release Agreement is terminable except with the mutual written agreement of
all parties thereto. Neither of the Owner Settlement and Release Agreements
requires any consent of, waiver by, approval of or other agreement from the
DOE for such Owner Settlement and Release Agreement, or any portion or
provision thereof, to be in full force and effect or otherwise to be fully
effective (it being understood that a DOE Waiver is required for the release
of the SandW Parent Guaranty to be effective).

 

4.8. _Exclusivity of Representations_. The representations and warranties made
by Purchaser in this _Article IV_ are the exclusive representations and
warranties made by Purchaser. Purchaser hereby disclaims any other express or
implied representations or warranties.

 

ARTICLE

VCOVENANTS 

5.1. _General_. Subject to, and not in limitation of, _Section 5.7_, each of
the parties will use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken
all actions and to do or to cause to be done all things necessary, proper or
advisable in order to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

5.2. _Notices and Consents_.

 

(a) Each party shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain, and reasonably cooperate with the other
parties hereto in obtaining, at the earliest practicable date prior to the
Closing all consents, waivers and approvals from, and provide all notices to,
all Persons that are not a Governmental Authority, which consents, waivers,
approvals and notices are required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the consents, waivers, approvals and
notices referred to in _Sections 2.4_ , _3.3_ and _4.3_ (except for such
matters covered by  _Section 5.7_).

(b) All such consents, waivers, approvals and notices shall be in writing and
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, and executed
counterparts of such consents, waivers and approvals shall be delivered to
Purchaser promptly after receipt thereof, and copies of such notices shall be
delivered to Purchaser promptly after the making thereof. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Seller Parent, the
Company, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates shall be required to
pay any material amounts or incur any Liability or Loss in connection
with obtaining any consent, waiver or approval; _provided_ that with respect
to obtaining landlords consents to the assignment of leases for Outlier
Leased Real Property, Seller Parent shall offer to guarantee the assignees
obligations under the lease if reasonably necessary to obtain such consent.

 



26 (c) With respect to the letters of credit set forth on _Schedule 5.2(c) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule_ (the " _Seller L/Cs_ "), prior to the Closing,
Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to cause itself or one of its
Affiliates to either be substituted for Seller Parent and its Affiliates or
have the Seller L/Cs replaced, and for Seller Parent and its Affiliates, to
be fully released and relieved of all of their obligations pursuant to,
effective as of the Closing, any reimbursement obligations with respect to the
Seller L/Cs (" _Seller L/C Obligations_ "). In the event that Seller Parent
and its Affiliates are not fully released and relieved of all of the Seller
L/C Obligations on the Closing Date, Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall,
at Purchasers expense, cause one or more financial institutions reasonably
acceptable to Seller Parent to issue on the Closing Date to Seller Parent, as
beneficiary, a letter of credit (the " _Backstop L/C_ ") in an amount equal to
the aggregate amount of outstanding Seller L/C Obligations on the Closing
Date. After the Closing, Seller Parent may draw on the Backstop L/C in an
amount equal to any amounts drawn under the Seller L/Cs. Seller Parent and
Purchaser agree to reduce the amount of the Backstop L/C from time to time
after the Closing Date to the extent that Seller Parent and its Affiliates are
fully released and relieved of the Seller L/C Obligations, so that the
Backstop L/C shall at all times be equal in amount to the amount of
outstanding Seller L/C Obligations.

(d) With respect to the guarantee (the " _Seller Guarantee_ ") and the
Contract (the " _Specified Contract_ ") in each case set forth on _Schedule
5.2(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ , prior to the Closing, (i) Seller
Parent and its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts, in
cooperation with Purchaser, to obtain any third party consent from a party to
the Specified Contract required in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Specified Contract Consent_ ") and
(ii) in the event the Specified Contract Consent is obtained, Purchaser shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause itself or one of its Affiliates
to either be substituted for Seller Parent and its Affiliates or have the
Seller Guarantee replaced and for Seller Parent and its Affiliates to be
fully released and relieved of all of their obligations pursuant to the Seller
Guarantee, effective as of the Closing (for the avoidance of doubt, in the
event the Company or its Subsidiaries do not obtain the benefit of the
Specified Contract from and after the Closing Date in accordance with the
terms thereof, Purchaser shall have no obligation under this clause (ii));
_provided_ that, in the event that notwithstanding such efforts the
Specified Contract Consent is not reasonably expected to be obtained prior to
the Closing Date, the parties will reasonably cooperate to implement an
arrangement whereby from and after the Closing Seller Parent retains the
Specified Contract and obtains from the Company and its Subsidiaries at
Seller Parents sole cost and expense the use of the assets and/or services of
personnel necessary to perform the obligations under the Specified Contract
consistent with past practice, and if the consent of a third party is needed
to provide such assets or services, the parties shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain; _provided_ , _further_ , that in
the event the Specified Contract Consent is not obtained, any Liabilities
incurred by Purchaser or its Affiliates (including, from and after the
Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) arising from or related to the
Specified Contract, including, as a result of the failure of Seller Parent and
its Affiliates to obtain the Specified Contract Consent, shall be considered
Excluded Liabilities.

termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, except as

27  Law, as contemplated or required by this Agreement (including, for the

other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or
agree to acquire any assets or take any other action if the entering into of a
definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of such acquisition,
merger, consolidation or other action could reasonably be expected to (i)

approvals of any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby or the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period, (ii) significantly increase the risk of any
Governmental Authority entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the

significantly delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

its controlled Affiliates not to, and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its and its controlled Affiliates directors, officers and
employees (collectively, the " _Restricted Solicitors_ ") not to, directly

(c) From and after the Closing Date, Seller Parent shall not and shall cause
its controlled Affiliates not to, and shall use its commercially reasonable

employees not to, directly or indirectly, disclose, reveal, divulge
or communicate to any Person other than authorized officers, directors and
employees of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) any Purchaser Confidential Information; _provided_ that Seller
Parent shall not have any obligation to keep confidential (or cause its

(d) The covenants and undertakings contained in this _Section 6.3_ relate to

injury to Purchaser, the amount of which will be impossible to estimate or
determine and which cannot be adequately compensated. Accordingly, the remedy
at law for any breach of this _Section 6.3_ will be inadequate. Therefore,
Purchaser will be entitled to a temporary and permanent injunction,
restraining order or other equitable relief from any court of competent
jurisdiction in the event of any breach of this _Section 6.3_ without the
necessity of proving actual damage or posting any bond whatsoever. The rights
and remedies provided by this _Section 6.3_ are cumulative and in addition to
any other rights and remedies that Purchaser may have hereunder or at law or
in equity.

 



39 (e) The parties hereto agree that, if any court of competent jurisdiction
determines that a specified time period, a specified geographical area, a
specified business limitation or any other relevant feature of this _Section
6.3_ is unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, then a lesser period
of time, geographical area, business limitation or other relevant feature
that is determined by such court to be reasonable, not arbitrary and not
against public policy may be enforced against the applicable party.

 

6.4. _Further Assurances_.

 

(a) Subject to, and not in limitation of, _Section 5.7_, each party shall use

any Liability or Loss in connection with providing such assistance
and cooperation.

6.5. _Post-Closing Transfers_. From the Closing Date until the six (6) month

expense, transfer or cause to be transferred such assets, Permits, properties,

property and Intellectual Property Rights) to Purchaser, if any, as are
necessary to cause the representations in _Section 2.20_ to have been true
and correct in all material respects as of the Closing Date had such assets
been transferred to Purchaser as of the Closing Date.

 

6.6. _Restructuring Transactions_.

 

(a) Following the date hereof and prior to the Closing, Seller Parent shall
cause the Restructuring Transactions to be consummated in accordance with the
terms set forth on _Schedule 6.6_ in all material respects, with such

by Seller Parent.

Affiliates to, treat any distribution by the Company pursuant to
the Restructuring Transactions as having occurred in the deemed complete
liquidation of the Company, within the meaning of Section 332 of the Code,
resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election, in each case as contemplated
by Treasury Regulations §1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(4).

7.1.  _Seller Parent Returns and Reports_. Seller Parent shall file, or shall
cause its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to file, when due (a) all Tax Returns
that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries on or before the Closing Date (taking into account all valid
extensions of time to file) and (b) all Tax Returns required to be filed after
the Closing Date (taking into account all valid extensions of time to file)
that are Consolidated Tax Returns, and in each case shall pay all Taxes shown
as due on such Tax Returns. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with prior practice unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

7.2. _Purchaser Returns and Reports_ . Purchaser shall file or cause to be
filed when due all Tax Returns (other than those identified in  _Section
7.1_ above) that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company
and its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date with respect to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods and, subject to the rights to payment from Seller Parent as
provided in this _Section 7.2_, shall pay all Taxes shown as due on such Tax
Returns. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
prior practice unless otherwise required by applicable Law or this Agreement.
Purchaser shall provide Seller Parent with copies of such completed Tax
Returns at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing thereof,
along with supporting work papers, for Seller Parents review and approval.
Seller Parent and Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to resolve any

the event that Seller Parent and Purchaser are unable to resolve any dispute
with respect to such Tax Return at least ten (10) days prior to the due date
for filing, such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to _Section 7.9_, which
resolution shall be binding on the parties. Not later than ten (10) days prior
to the due date for the payment of Taxes on any Tax Returns which Purchaser
has the responsibility to cause to be filed pursuant to this _Section 7.2_,
Seller Parent shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Purchaser the amount of
Taxes, as reasonably determined by Purchaser, owed by Seller Parent in
respect of such Tax Returns. No payment pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ shall
excuse Seller Parent from its indemnification obligations pursuant to _Section
10.2_ if the amount of Taxes as ultimately determined (on audit or otherwise)
for the periods covered by such Tax Returns exceeds the amount of Seller
Parents payment under this _Section 7.2_.

 

7.3. _Amendments_ . Unless required by applicable Law, Purchaser shall not
permit any amendment of any Tax Return filed with respect to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period (if Seller Parent would be liable for any Losses arising from such

consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; 
_provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to any amended Tax Return that
may be required following resolution of a Tax audit or other inquiry from a
Taxing Authority conducted in accordance with the contest provisions of 
_Section 7.4_.

 



43 7.4. _Contest Provisions_.

 

(a) If a claim shall be made by any Taxing Authority or Governmental
Authority, that, if successful, might result in a payment on behalf of Seller
Parent to Purchaser under _Section 10.2_ in respect of Taxes Purchaser shall
promptly notify Seller Parent with such potential liability in writing (a "
_Tax Notice_ ") of such claim (a " _Tax Claim_ ");  _provided_ that
Purchasers failure to deliver such Tax Notice to Seller Parent shall not
limit Purchasers rights under _Section 10.2_ except to the extent Seller
Parent is actually and materially prejudiced by such failure.

(b) Seller Parent shall have the right, at the expense of Seller Parent, to
control all proceedings in connection with any Tax Claim; _provided_ that,
(i) Seller Parent shall provide Purchaser with copies of all correspondence,
notices and other written materials received from any Taxing Authorities and
shall otherwise keep Purchaser and its tax advisors advised of developments
in the audit or dispute and of communications involving representatives of the
Taxing Authorities, (ii) Seller Parent shall keep Purchaser reasonably
informed and consult seriously and in good faith with Purchaser and its
tax advisors with respect to any issue relating to such audit or dispute,
(iii) Seller Parent shall provide Purchaser with a copy of any written
submission to be sent to a Taxing Authority prior to the submission thereof
and shall give serious and good faith consideration to any comments or
suggested revisions that Purchaser or its tax advisors may have with respect
thereto, and (iv) there will be no settlement, resolution, or closing or other
agreement with respect thereto without the consent of Purchaser, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

7.5. _Transfer Taxes_. The party legally obligated to do so shall (a) pay
within any time period prescribed by Law or Taxing Authority all transfer,
documentary, filing, recording, stamp, sales, use, customs duties,
registration, and other similar Taxes or fees or governmental charges,
including interest or penalties thereon, in each case arising out of or in
connection with the transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement ("
_Transfer Taxes_ ") and (b) at its own expense, file (or cause to be
filed) all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to any
such Transfer Taxes. Purchaser and Seller Parent each agrees to assume
liability for, and shall pay, fifty percent (50%) of any such Transfer Taxes.
If required by applicable Law, Seller Parent shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation. Seller Parent and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the
amount of Transfer Taxes payable by reason of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereunder.

7.6.  _Cooperation; Access to Records_. After the Closing, Seller Parent and
Purchaser shall cooperate fully in preparing for and conducting any audits of,
or disputes with any Taxing Authorities regarding, any Tax Returns, and shall
provide such information as reasonably necessary for such audits, disputes or
for the filing of all Tax Returns, subject to the provisions of _Section
7.4_. Seller Parent shall, and shall cause its applicable Affiliates to, after
the Closing, consistent with current practices of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, retain such records, documents, accounting data and other
information as are necessary for the preparation, filing and examination of
Tax Returns with respect to Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
shall make available to the other parties and to any Government Authority as
reasonably requested all records, documents, accounting data and other
information relating to Taxes of the Company and

 



44  its Subsidiaries until the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations
and shall give Purchaser reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying, or discarding any such books and records and, if Purchaser so
requests, Seller Parent, or Seller Parents Affiliates, as the case may be,
shall allow Purchaser to take possession of such books and records; _provided_
that the external auditors and accountants of Seller Parent or any of its
Affiliates shall not be obliged to make any work papers available to any
Person except in accordance with such auditors and accountants normal
disclosure procedures and only then after such Person has signed a customary
agreement relating to such access to work papers in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such auditors and accountants.

 

7.7. _Tax Sharing_. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller Parent shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, terminate any tax sharing, tax allocation and tax
indemnification agreements and arrangements of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and such agreements shall have no further effect for any taxable

to Pre-Closing Tax Periods of the Company or its Subsidiaries for which
Seller Parent is responsible pursuant to _Section 10.2_, plus any interest

indemnify Purchaser and each of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Company and its Subsidiaries) and each of their officers, managers,

and permitted assigns (the " _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ ") from and
against any Loss that any Purchaser Indemnified Party suffers as a result of,

Indemnified Taxes, (c) any Excluded Liabilities, (d) any Special Loss, (e)
breach of the Specified Covenants and (f) breach of the Multiemployer Plan
Representation.

10.3. _Related Matters_.

operation of the provisions of _Section 1.4(c)_ providing for the resolution
of certain disputes relating to the Final Purchase Price between the parties
and/or by an Independent Auditor or (ii) limit the rights of the parties

this _Article X_ , after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify Seller Parent

of or relating to, without duplication, (a) breach of a Purchaser Fundamental
Representation, (b) any Assumed Liabilities and (c) any Guaranty Liability.

10.5. _Defense of Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) Promptly after the assertion by any Person that is not a party to this
Agreement of any claim (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") against any Person
entitled to seek indemnification under _Section 10.2_ or _Section 10.4_ (an
" _Indemnitee_ ") that results or may result in the incurrence by such
Indemnitee of any Loss for which such Indemnitee desires to seek
indemnification under this _Article X_ , such Indemnitee shall notify each
Person from whom such indemnification could be sought hereunder with respect
to such claim (collectively, the " _Indemnitor_ ") of such claim in writing
promptly after receiving notice of such claim, describing the claim, the
amount thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof in reasonable
detail (such written notice, an " _Indemnification Notice_ ");  _provided_
that the failure or delay to so notify an Indemnitor shall not relieve the
Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the

 



50  extent that such failure or delay shall have caused the damages for which
the Indemnitor is obligated to be greater than such damages would have been
had the Indemnitee given the Indemnitor prompt notice hereunder. Any
Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Proceeding
giving rise to an Indemnitees claim for indemnification at such Indemnitors
expense, and at its option shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof by
appointing a reputable counsel at such Indemnitors expense reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnitee to be the lead counsel in connection with such
defense; _provided_ that the Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in
the defense of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such
purpose; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that if the Indemnitee elects to
participate in the defense of such claim, the fees and expenses of
such counsel employed by the Indemnitee shall be borne by the Indemnitee and
shall not be recoverable from such Indemnitor(s) under this _Article X_ ,
unless (a) the named parties to such Proceeding (including any impleaded
parties) include the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee and representation of both
parties by the same counsel would not be permitted under applicable standards
of professional conduct or such Indemnitee shall have been advised by its
counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to the
Indemnitee that are not available to such Indemnitor, or if available to such
Indemnitor, the assertion of which would be adverse to or in conflict with the
interests of the Indemnitee, or (b) if so requested to participate by the
Indemnitor, in each such case the reasonable expense of one separate counsel
for Indemnitee shall be paid by the Indemnitor. If the Indemnitor shall
control the defense of any such claim, the Indemnitor shall be entitled to
settle such claims or consent to the entry into any judgment; _provided_ that
the Indemnitor shall be required to obtain the prior written consent of the
Indemnitee before entering into any such settlement or consenting to such
judgment or ceasing to defend such claim if, pursuant to or as a result of
such settlement or judgment, material injunctive or other equitable relief
will be imposed against the Indemnitee, if such settlement or judgment is not
solely for monetary relief and does not expressly and unconditionally release
the Indemnitee from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such claim
or such settlement of judgment adversely affects the Indemnitee in any
material respect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
the Indemnitor shall not have the right to control the defense of a Third
Party Claim (and the Indemnitee shall control such defense at the expense of
the Indemnitor) to the extent that (i) it (A) seeks an injunction
or equitable relief against the Indemnitee, (B) involves any criminal act or
(C) involves any customer or supplier of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or
(ii) the Indemnitor does not assume the defense within fifteen (15)
Business Days after receipt of the Indemnification Notice. In all cases, the
Indemnitee shall provide, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, its
reasonable cooperation to the Indemnitor in defense of claims or litigation,
including by making employees, information and documentation reasonably
available during regular business hours. In no event will an Indemnitee
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to any Third Party Claim without the written consent of the Indemnitor (which
such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned and/or delayed)
if any Indemnitee is seeking or will seek indemnification hereunder with
respect to such matter; it being understood and agreed, for the avoidance
of doubt, that any such consent of the Indemnitor to the entry of judgment or
settlement shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgement that any
Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification hereunder with respect to any such
Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent this _Section
10.5(a)_ is inconsistent with _Section 7.4_ with respect to any Tax matter,
the provisions of _Section 7.4_ shall control.

 



51 (b) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 10.5(a)_ to the contrary, Seller
Parent and its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall
have the sole and exclusive right to (i) direct and control the Litigation,
including the defense, conduct and settlement thereof, (ii) employ and engage
attorneys of their own choice with respect to the Litigation and (iii) settle
or compromise the Litigation or consent to the entry of judgment, in each case
without the consent of Purchaser. Purchaser shall provide and shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to provide, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, its reasonable cooperation in connection with the Litigation,
including by making employees, information and documentation reasonably
available during regular business hours. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 10.5(b)_, Seller Parent and its Affiliates shall
give reasonable advance notice to Purchaser with respect to any material
developments or Proceeding with respect to any such Litigation and
shall afford Purchaser the opportunity to attend any such event or
Proceedings at Purchasers sole cost and expense. Seller Parent shall not
agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of such Litigation without
the consent of Purchaser, not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned, to the extent such settlement, compromise or discharge (i)
requires any admission of wrongdoing by the Company or its Subsidiaries, (ii)
involves a finding of any violations of Law by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (iii) imposes any adverse injunctive relief or other limiting
restrictions on the future operations of the Business.

 

10.6. _Determination of Loss Amount_. The amount of any Loss subject to
indemnification under this _Article X_ shall be calculated net of any
insurance proceeds actually received by the Indemnitee, and/or any Affiliate
of the Indemnitee, on account of such Loss (such amount actually recovered
shall be net of any increases in premiums, Taxes, any costs incurred in
connection with such recovery or making claims under such insurance policies
(including costs of collection or deductibles)).

10.7. _No Right of Contribution_. Seller Parent shall not, and none of its
Affiliates shall, have any right of contribution against any of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or their respective directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates, agents, attorneys, Representatives, assigns or successors for any
claim (including any Third Party Claim) asserted by any Purchaser Indemnified
Party under this _Article X_ , it being acknowledged and agreed that the
representations and warranties, covenants and agreements of, or on behalf of,
any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are solely for the benefit of
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties.

otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, any Proceeding seeking to

be brought in any State or Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, and
each of the parties hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of
the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such Proceeding and
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such
Proceeding in any such court or that any such Proceeding which is brought in
any such court has been brought in an inconvenient form. Process in any such
Proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or
without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing,
each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided in
_Section 12.2_ shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

 

12.12. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND
INTENTIONALLY WAIVES, AND UNDERSTANDS THAT EACH OTHER PARTY IS RELYING
THEREON, ANY PRESENT OR FUTURE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY CASE OR
CONTROVERSY IN WHICH ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT IS OR BECOMES SUBJECT, WHICH
CASE OR CONTROVERSY ARISES OUT OF, OR IS IN RESPECT TO, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
PERFORMANCE HEREOF. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY FURTHER WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN

MATTER WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR IN RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
PERFORMANCE HEREOF.

 

12.13. _Disclosure Schedules_. Each section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
shall be deemed to incorporate by reference all information disclosed in any
other section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule to the extent that the
relationship of such disclosure to such other Section of this Agreement is
reasonably apparent. The inclusion of information in the Seller Disclosure
Schedule shall not be construed as or constitute an admission or agreement to
any Person that a violation, right of termination, default, liability or other
obligation of any kind exists with respect to any item.

 

12.14. _References_. The table of contents and the Section and other headings
and subheadings contained in this Agreement and the Exhibits hereto are
solely for the purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the
parties and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement or any Exhibit hereto. All references to days or months shall
be deemed references to calendar days or months. All references to "$" or
"dollars" shall be deemed references to United States dollars. Any reference
in this Agreement to wire transfers or other payments requires payment in
dollars of the United States of America unless some other currency is
expressly stated in that reference. Unless the context otherwise requires, any

 



75  reference to a "Section," "Exhibit" or "Schedule" shall be deemed to refer
to a Section of this Agreement, Exhibit to this Agreement or Schedule to the
Disclosure Schedule (which is a part of this Agreement), as applicable. The
words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import referring
to this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to
any particular provision of this Agreement. The words "include," "includes"
and "including" shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The terms defined in this Agreement include the singular as well
as the plural. Whenever the context requires, the gender of all words used in
this Agreement includes the masculine, feminine and neuter.

 

12.15. _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Nonassertion of
Attorney-Client Privilege_. Each of Purchaser and Purchaser Parent waives and
will not assert, and agrees to cause its Subsidiaries, including the Company
and its Subsidiaries, to waive and not to assert, any conflict of interest
arising out of or relating to the representation, after the Closing (the "
_Post-Closing Representation_ "), of Seller Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or
any shareholder, officer, employee or director of Seller Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (any such Person, a " _Designated Person_ ") in any matter
involving this Agreement or any agreements or transactions contemplated
hereby, by any legal counsel currently representing Seller Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement or any agreements or
transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Current Representation_ "). Each of
Purchaser and Purchaser Parent waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause
its Subsidiaries, including the Company and its Subsidiaries, to waive and not
to assert, any attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication
between any legal counsel and any Designated Person occurring during the
Current Representation in connection with any Post-Closing Representation,
including in connection with a dispute with Purchaser, Purchaser Parent or
their Subsidiaries, including the Company and its Subsidiaries (including in
respect of any claim for indemnification by any Purchaser Indemnified Party),
it being the intention of the parties hereto that all such rights to such
attorney-client privilege and to control such attorney-client privilege shall
be retained by Seller Parent; _provided_ that the foregoing waiver and
acknowledgement of retention shall not extend to any communication not
involving this Agreement or any agreements or transactions contemplated
hereby, or to communications with any Person other than the Designated Persons
and their advisors. Accordingly, from and after Closing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not have any access to any such communications or to the
files of the Current Representation or to internal counsel relating to such
engagement, and none of Purchaser, Parent Purchaser or their Subsidiaries,
including the Company and its Subsidiaries, or any Person acting or
purporting to act on their behalf shall seek to obtain the same by any process
on the grounds that the privilege attaching to such communications and files
belongs to Seller Parent.

 

12.16. _Construction_. The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event of an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement.

12.17. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto hereby acknowledge and agree
that the failure of any party to perform its agreements, obligations
(including its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) and covenants hereunder will cause irreparable injury to the other
parties, for which damages, will not be an adequate remedy

 



76  (including with respect to the restrictive covenants and agreements
contained in _Section 6.2_). Accordingly, Purchaser, Purchaser Parent, the
Company and Seller Parent hereby consent to the issuance of injunctive relief
by any court of competent jurisdiction to compel performance of such partys
agreements, obligations and covenants, and to the granting by any court of the
remedy of specific performance of its obligations hereunder, in addition to
any other remedy to which the parties are entitled at law or in equity.

12.18. _Mutual Release_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Closing, and without limiting the rights of Purchaser
or the Company and its Subsidiaries under this Agreement, any Transaction
Document or any other agreements among the parties hereto or their Affiliates
specifically referencing this Agreement, Purchaser and the Company and the
Companys Subsidiaries, on each of its own behalf and on behalf of each of
its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and their respective successors and assigns,
hereby unconditionally and irrevocably, waive any and all rights, defenses,
claims or causes of action (including rights of contributions) known and
unknown, foreseen and unforeseen, arising prior to or on the Closing that
each of Purchaser and the Company and/or its Subsidiaries have or may in the
future have against Seller Parent, its Affiliates or any of its or its
Affiliates respective directors, officers, employees or equityholders, in
each case arising out of, resulting from or relating to the Projects, the
Business, the Project Agreements, the Consortium Agreements and any Liability
or Loss relating thereto (it being understood that this  _Section 12.18_
shall not apply to warranty obligations, if any, under the CBandI Affiliate
Scope Contracts (as the same are being amended as provided in _Schedule
11.1(b)_ ).

 

(b) Effective as of the Closing, and without limiting the rights of Seller
Parent or its Affiliates under this Agreement, any Transaction Document or
any other agreements among the parties hereto or their Affiliates specifically
referencing this Agreement, Seller Parent, on its own behalf and on behalf of
its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and their respective successors and
assigns, hereby unconditionally and irrevocably, waives any and all rights,
defenses, claims or causes of action (including rights of contributions) known
and unknown, foreseen and unforeseen, arising prior to or on the Closing that
they (or any of its respective successors or assigns) have or may in the
future have against Purchaser, its Affiliates (including, following the
Closing, the Company and/or its Subsidiaries) or any of its or its Affiliates
respective directors, officers, employees or equityholders, in each case
arising out of, resulting from or relating the Projects, the Business, the
Project Agreements, the Consortium Agreements and any Liability or Loss
relating thereto. Seller Parent acknowledges that, effective as of the
Closing, each of the Toshiba Guarantees shall be terminated and neither Seller
Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall have any further rights or Liabilities
thereunder.

 

12.19. _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and a
claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to this
Agreement may only be brought against a signatory to this Agreement and then
only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to
such party. Except to the extent a signatory to this Agreement, no present,
former or future Affiliate, officer, director, employee, incorporator,
member, partner, stockholder, agent, attorney or other Representative of any
party or their Affiliates shall have any Liability (whether in contract, in
tort or otherwise) for any obligations or Liabilities of any party that is
not otherwise expressly identified as a signatory hereto, and no recourse
shall be brought

 



77  or granted against any of them, by virtue of or based upon any alleged
misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations,
warranties, agreements or covenants of any party hetero under this Agreement
for any claim based upon, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated hereby or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged
to have been made in connection herewith or therewith;  _provided_ that the
provisions of this _Section 12.19_ shall not apply to the mutual releases
contained in _Section 12.18_. The provisions of this _Section 12.19_ are
intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by the Affiliates
officers, directors, employees, incorporators, members, partners,
stockholders, agents, attorneys and other Representatives referenced in this
_Section 12.19_ and each such Person shall be a third party beneficiary of
this _Section 12.19_.

12.20. _Purchaser Parent Guaranty_.

 

(a) Purchaser Parent hereby irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally
guarantees to Seller Parent each and every obligation and liability
of Purchaser hereunder, and the full and timely payment and performance of
Purchasers obligations hereunder, in each case through the Closing (together
with any and all reasonable fees, costs and expenses (including but not
limited to reasonable attorneys fees) that may be paid or incurred by Seller
Parent or its Affiliates in enforcing the Guaranty, the " _Guaranteed
Obligations_ ") (the " _Guaranty_ "). Purchaser Parent agrees and acknowledges
that the Guaranty is a guarantee of payment and performance and not merely of
collection and that the Guaranty is full and unconditional, and no release or
extinguishment of Purchasers obligations or liabilities under this Agreement,
whether by decree in any bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, shall affect the
continuing validity and enforceability of the Guaranty. Purchaser Parent
agrees and acknowledges that Seller Parent is relying on the Guaranty in
entering into this Agreement and that this Guaranty is a material inducement
to Seller Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement.

(b) Purchaser Parent hereby agrees that if any Guaranteed Obligation is not
paid when and as due, Seller Parent may notify Purchaser Parent of such non-
payment, whereupon Purchaser Parent shall cause Purchaser to promptly pay or
Purchaser Parent shall promptly pay, as the case may be, such Guaranteed
Obligation.

(c) The obligations of Purchaser Parent under this Guaranty shall be absolute
and unconditional, present and continuing, irrespective of any bankruptcy
proceeding involving Seller Parent or any voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of or termination of the
existence of Seller Parent, or any circumstance that might constitute a legal
or equitable discharge of a guarantor.

(d) Purchaser Parent hereby waives and agrees not to assert notice
of acceptance of this Guaranty, presentment, demand, protest, or (except only
as set forth in _Section 12.20(b)_) any notice of any kind whatsoever, with
respect to any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations, and promptness in making
any claim or demand hereunder; and no act or omission of any kind shall in
any way affect or impair this Guaranty. Purchaser Parent also waives and
agrees not to assert (i) any requirement, and any right to require, that any
right or power be exercised or any action be taken against Purchaser or any
other Person or any assets for any of the Guaranteed Obligations and any right
to require Seller Parent to require Purchaser Parent, as a condition of
payment or performance by Purchaser Parent under the Guaranty, to proceed

 



78  against Purchaser or pursue any other remedies whatsoever, (ii) to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, any defenses or benefits that may be derived
from or afforded by Law that limit the liability or exonerate guarantors or
sureties, and (iii) any and all promptness, diligence, notice of the creation,
renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and notice
of or proof of reliance by Seller Parent upon this Guaranty or acceptance of
this Guaranty.

(e) This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case
may be, if at any time payment, observance or performance, or any part
thereof, of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise
be restored or returned by the Seller Parent upon the insolvency, bankruptcy
or reorganization of Purchaser, all as though such payment, observance or
performance had not been made.

(f) Purchaser Parent is a limited liability company duly formed, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization and has all necessary power and authority to enter into this
Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Purchaser Parent
and the performance by Purchaser Parent of its obligations hereunder have
been duly authorized by all requisite action on the part of Purchaser Parent.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Purchaser Parent, and
(assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties
hereto) this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of
Purchaser Parent, enforceable against Purchaser Parent in accordance with its
terms.

 

(g) If Purchaser Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper provisions shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser Parent or any of its
successors or assigns assumes all of the obligations set forth in this
_Section 12.20_.
