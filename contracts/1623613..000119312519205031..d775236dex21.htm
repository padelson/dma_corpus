 necessary to enable or cause Spinco Sub to, at or prior to the Effective

Common Stock sufficient to make all such deliveries. The Exchange Fund shall

Utah) is entitled pursuant to the Liquidation Distribution (prior to giving
effect to any Tax withholding) (the " _Gross Number_ ") and (ii) the amount

which the Utah Newco shareholders (or, if the Alternative Transaction
Structure is adopted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.4_, Utah shareholders)
would otherwise be entitled as is necessary to obtain net cash proceeds as
close as possible to, but no less than, the Aggregate Withholding Amount (the
" _Spinco Common Stock Sale_ "). In the event that the cash proceeds obtained
by the Exchange Agent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.5(b)_ exceed the
Aggregate Withholding Amount, such surplus cash proceeds shall be paid to the
Utah Newco shareholders (or, if the Alternative Transaction Structure is
adopted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.4_, Utah shareholders) on a _pro rata_
basis consistent with the procedures for payment of cash in lieu of fractional
shares;  _provided_ that Spinco Sub shall be entitled to any such surplus if
the amount is _de minimis_.

of Utah Newco Ordinary Shares (or, if the Alternative Transaction Structure is
adopted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.4_, the holders of Utah Ordinary Shares)
who were entitled to receive a portion of the Exchange Fund in the
Liquidation Distribution twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be
returned to Spinco Sub, upon demand, and any such holder of Utah Newco
Ordinary Shares (or, if the Alternative Transaction Structure is adopted
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.4_, any such holder of Utah Ordinary Shares) who
has not received its portion of the Liquidation Distribution (less Taxes
required to be withheld from such Liquidation Distribution, if any), and, if
applicable, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Spinco Common Stock
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.6_ or the terms of the Exchangeable Note in
accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 3.5_ prior to that time, shall
thereafter look only to Spinco Sub (subject to abandoned property, escheat, or
other similar Laws), as general

 



31

    

 creditors thereof, for the Liquidation Distribution and, if applicable, any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Spinco Common Stock pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 3.6_ or the terms of the Exchangeable Note. Notwithstanding the

Shares (or, if the Alternative Transaction Structure is adopted pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.4_, any holder of Utah Ordinary Shares) for any amounts
paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat,
or similar Laws. Any shares of Spinco Common Stock and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Spinco Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.6_
remaining unclaimed by holders of Utah Newco Ordinary Shares (or, if the
Alternative Transaction Structure is adopted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.4_,
holders of Utah Ordinary Shares) two (2) years after the Effective Time (or
such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall
become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Spinco Sub
free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

 

Section 3.6. No Fractional Shares.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no fractional shares
of Spinco Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Liquidation
Distribution, and any such fractional share interests to which a Utah
shareholder or Utah Newco shareholder, as applicable, would otherwise be
entitled shall not entitle such holder to vote or to any other rights as
a stockholder of Spinco. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each Utah
shareholder or Utah Newco shareholder, as applicable, who, but for the
provisions of this _Section 3.6_, would be entitled to receive a fractional
share interest of Spinco Common Stock pursuant to the Liquidation
Distribution, shall be paid cash, without any interest thereon, as hereinafter
provided. Pluto shall instruct the Exchange Agent to determine the number of
whole shares and fractional shares of Spinco Common Stock allocable to each
Utah shareholder or Utah Newco shareholder, as applicable, to aggregate all
such fractional shares into whole shares, to sell the whole shares obtained
thereby in the open market at the then-prevailing prices on behalf of each
Utah shareholder or Utah Newco shareholder, as applicable, who otherwise would
be entitled to receive fractional share interests and to distribute to each
such Utah shareholder or Utah Newco shareholder, as applicable, his, her or
its ratable share of the total proceeds of such sale, after deducting any
applicable Taxes and the costs and expenses of such sale and distribution,
including brokers fees and commissions. The sales of fractional shares shall
occur as soon after the Effective Time as practicable and as determined by
the Exchange Agent. None of the Parties or the Exchange Agent shall guarantee
any minimum sale price for the fractional shares of Spinco Common Stock. None
of the Parties shall pay any interest on the proceeds from the sale of
fractional shares. The Exchange Agent shall have the sole discretion to select
the broker-dealers through which to sell the aggregated fractional shares and
to determine when, how and at what price to sell such shares. Neither the
Exchange Agent nor the broker-dealers through which the aggregated fractional
shares are sold shall be Affiliates of any of the Parties.

 

(b) Solely for purposes of computing fractional share interests pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 3.6_, the beneficial owner of Utah Ordinary Shares held
of record in the name of a nominee in any nominee account shall be treated as
the holder of record with respect to such shares.

reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, and such assessment

of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of Pluto, (ii) provide reasonable

audit committee of the Pluto Board (i) any significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal controls over
financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Plutos
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information
with respect to the Spinco Business and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Plutos internal control over financial reporting with respect to the
Spinco Business.

maintained or contributed to by any of the Spinco Entities, (ii) for which any
of the Spinco Entities has any liability, contingent or otherwise, or (iii) in
the case of a bi-lateral agreement, to which any of the Spinco Entities is a

(A) an entity other than a Spinco Entity pursuant to a Collective Bargaining
Agreement or (B) a Governmental Authority. The term Spinco Benefit Plan shall
not include any plan, program or arrangement sponsored or maintained by any of
the Pluto Entities that is retained by any of the Pluto Entities pursuant to

ERISA, the Code and in each case the regulations thereunder, in each case,
except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Spinco Material Adverse Effect. There are no pending or, to the
knowledge of Pluto, threatened or anticipated claims (other than routine
claims for benefits) by, on behalf of or against any of the Spinco Benefit
Plans (or, to the extent reasonably expected to result in material liability
to Spinco, any of the Pluto Benefit Plans) or any trusts related thereto and
no event has occurred that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
such claim, except where such claims would not reasonably be expected to have,

Revenue Code of 2011) has received a favorable determination or opinion
letter from the IRS (or the Puerto Rico Treasury Department) that it is so
qualified, and, to the knowledge of Pluto, such letter has not been revoked
(nor has revocation been threatened), no event has occurred that would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any such action and there are no
existing circumstances or any events that have occurred that would reasonably
be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any such plan.

that has not been satisfied in full, in each case, except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Spinco
Material Adverse Effect.

(g) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (either alone
or in conjunction with any other event) would (i) result in, cause the
vesting, exercisability or delivery of, or materially increase the amount or
value of, any payment, right or other benefit (including severance, "excess
parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code),
forgiveness of indebtedness or otherwise) becoming due to any current or
former director or employee of any of the Spinco Entities under any Spinco
Benefit Plan or otherwise, (ii) materially increase any benefits otherwise
payable under any Spinco Benefit Plan, (iii) result in any acceleration of
the time of payment, funding or vesting of any such benefits, or (iv) result
in any limitation on the right to amend, merge, terminate or receive a

Laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States (i) if intended to qualify

commitment to become a party to, any off-balance sheet joint venture, off-
balance sheet partnership or any other "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC).

 

(e) Utah maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that all information required to be
disclosed by Utah is reported on a timely basis to the individuals
responsible for the preparation of Utahs filings with the SEC and other
public disclosure documents. Utahs management has completed an assessment of
the effectiveness of Utahs internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, and such assessment concluded that
such internal control system was effective. Utahs independent registered
public accountant has issued (and not subsequently withdrawn or qualified) an
attestation report concluding that Utah maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. Utahs internal control
over financial reporting (as defined

 



62

    

 in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act) is
effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Utah,
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and
that receipts and expenditures of Utah are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of Utah and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Utahs assets that could have
a material effect on its financial statements. Utah has disclosed, based on
its most recent evaluation of internal controls prior to the date hereof, to
Utahs auditors and the audit committee of the Utah Board (i) any significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal
controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect Utahs ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Utahs internal
control over financial reporting.

 

Section 7.9. Litigation and Proceedings. (a) There are no Actions pending
or, to the knowledge of Utah, threatened before or by any Governmental
Authority against Utah or any Utah Subsidiary that would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Utah Material Adverse
Effect and (b) there is no continuing Governmental Order to which Utah or any
Utah Subsidiary is a party or by which any of them are bound that would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Utah
Material Adverse Effect.

Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2017, none of the Utah Entities has

Agreement, Pluto shall seek the IRS Ruling and the Supplemental Ruling:

understood and agreed by the Parties that in the event of any inconsistency
or conflict between Section 8.7 and this Section 8.3(b), this Section 8.3(b)
shall prevail), in connection with obtaining the IRS Ruling and the
Supplemental Ruling:

actions taken or proposed to be taken by Pluto in connection therewith;

(B) Pluto shall (1) reasonably in advance of the submission of the
requests for the IRS Ruling and the Supplemental Ruling provide Utah with
draft copies thereof, (2) reasonably consider Utahs comments on such draft
copies, and (3) provide Utah with copies of any documents filed with the IRS,
provided

 



87

judgment, considers to be confidential and not germane to Utahs or Spincos
obligations under this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents;
and

(C) Pluto shall provide Utah with notice reasonably in advance of any

(such opinion of Plutos Tax Counsel, the " _Pluto Tax Opinion_ ").

(e) Utah shall, as of the Closing Date, execute and deliver to Plutos Tax

able to obtain the Pluto Tax Opinion as contemplated by  _Section_ __ _
8.3(c)_.

would not be able to deliver the Utah Representation Letter at the applicable
time set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_.

 

(h) Utah shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that Utah Newco
and Utah Newco Sub are, and remain through the Closing Date, resident for Tax
purposes solely in the Netherlands. Utah shall comply with any obligations it

comment in advance on related correspondence with such Governmental
Authorities.

 

(i) Utah and Pluto shall together consider any United Kingdom stamp duty or
stamp duty reserve tax implications of the Combination (including, if
relevant, the Alternative Transaction Structure). On a timely basis in advance
of the Utah Merger, unless the Parties agree

 



88

    

 otherwise, Utah shall apply for confirmation from HM Revenue and Customs
that the Utah Merger should not give rise to United Kingdom stamp duty or
stamp duty reserve tax. Utah shall give Pluto the opportunity to comment on
the application before it is made.

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_,
neither Utah nor any of its Subsidiaries shall engage in any internal
reorganization or restructuring transaction in connection with or in
anticipation of the Combination without the prior written consent of Pluto
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless
such internal reorganizations are not reasonably expected to result in
material liabilities (including Taxes) to Utah, Spinco or any of their
respective Subsidiaries and are not otherwise reasonably expected to have an
adverse impact on the Tax liabilities or effective Tax rate of Spinco or any
of the Spinco Subsidiaries after the Combination.

 

Section 8.4. Netherlands Withholding Tax Confirmation.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the execution of this
Agreement (and in any event within thirty five (35) days of the date of this
Agreement), Utah shall (and shall cause Utah Newco to), following consultation
in good faith with Spinco and Pluto, prepare and file with the DTA a request
(the " _Request_ ") to promptly obtain the DTAs confirmation in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Pluto and Spinco of (i) the amount of
recognized paid up capital for Dutch Dividend Withholding Tax purposes of Utah
and Utah Newco prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the amount of Dutch
Dividend Withholding Tax due in respect of the Liquidation Distribution (the "
_Withholding Tax Confirmation_ "). In relation to the request for the
Withholding Tax Confirmation Utah shall (and shall cause Utah Newco to) (i)
provide Pluto and Spinco with a calculation of Utahs recognized paid-up
capital for Dutch Dividend Withholding Tax purposes (the " _Calculation_ "),
(ii) provide Pluto and Spinco with drafts of all material written
communications it intends to make with the DTA at least five (5) Business Days
before the communication is made (unless the DTA requires any such written
communication to be submitted more promptly, in which case such written
communications shall be provided to Pluto and Spinco as promptly as
practicable, and in any event before the communication is made) and consider
such amendments as reasonably and timely requested by Pluto and Spinco in
good faith before making such communication, (iii) promptly notify Pluto and
Spinco of any material communication from the DTA regarding the Withholding
Tax Confirmation and provide Pluto and Spinco with copies thereof and (iv)
use its reasonable best efforts to timely provide Pluto and Spinco with the
opportunity to attend any meetings or conversations with the DTA with respect
to the Withholding Tax Confirmation (other than discussions that cover
only administrative and non-substantive matters). Utah shall provide Spinco
and Pluto with a first draft of the Request, together with a first draft of
the Calculation within two (2) weeks following the execution of this
Agreement and promptly provide such further information as may reasonably be
requested by Spinco or Pluto for purposes of reviewing the Request and
verifying the Calculation.

 

(b) In the event that Utah does not receive the Withholding Tax
Confirmation prior to the Closing Date, the Parties agree to use the
Calculation that was submitted to the DTA to calculate any Dutch Dividend
Withholding Tax required pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(c)_ or _Section_ __ _
3.4(b)(iv)_, updated for any reasonable comments by Spinco or Pluto that have
not been reflected in such Calculation.

 



89

    

(c) In the event Utah receives a Withholding Tax Confirmation before the
Closing Date, the Parties agree to use the Withholding Tax Confirmation to
calculate the Dutch Dividend Withholding Tax required pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 3.3(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 3.4(b)(iv)_ unless (i) the Withholding Tax
Confirmation is not in line with the Request and Calculation submitted to the
DTA (a " _Negative Withholding Tax Confirmation_ ") and (ii) Parties have
otherwise agreed to file an objection against such Negative Withholding Tax
Confirmation, in which case the Dutch Dividend Withholding Tax required
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 3.4(b)(iv)_ shall be
based on the Calculation set out in the Request submitted to the DTA, updated
for any reasonable comments provided by Spinco or Pluto in good faith that
have not been reflected in such Calculation. In the event Parties agree that
such objection shall be filed Utah and its Representatives shall prepare the
objection and shall provide Spinco and Pluto with a draft thereof at least ten
(10) Business Days before submission. The foregoing shall not limit the
statutory rights of Utah, Utah Newco or the Utah shareholders to
file objections against the Withholding Tax Confirmation and any Dutch
Dividend Withholding Tax returns submitted in accordance with the foregoing or
to appeal any decision by the DTA in response to such objections. In case Utah
or Utah Newco files an objection against the Negative Withholding Tax
Confirmation without Pluto and Spinco having agreed thereto (acting
reasonably), the Negative Withholding Tax Confirmation so received shall be
used to calculate the Dutch Dividend Withholding Tax required pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.3(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 3.4(b)(iv), unless Parties agree
otherwise_.

 

(d) In the event that Dutch Dividend Withholding Tax is to be withheld in
accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 8.4_ in respect of the Utah Newco
Liquidation (or, in the Alternative Transaction Structure, the Utah
Liquidation), Utah and its Representatives shall prepare the Dutch Dividend
Withholding Tax return and shall provide Spinco and Pluto with a draft
thereof at least five (5) Business Days before submission, and Utah shall take
into account all reasonable comments of Spinco and Pluto and their respective
Representatives provided in good faith. The Parties shall keep each other
reasonably informed on any material developments in respect of the matters set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.4_.

 

Section 8.5. Preparation of the Securities Filings.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, to the extent such
filings are required by Law in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement: (i)(A) the Parties shall jointly prepare and Spinco shall
file with the SEC the Distribution Registration Statement; and (B) if the
Distribution is effected in whole or in part as an exchange offer, Pluto
shall prepare and file with the SEC, when and as required, a Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO and other filings pursuant to Rule 13e-4 under the
Exchange Act (collectively, the " _Split Off TO_ "); and (ii)(A) the Parties
shall jointly prepare and Utah shall file with the SEC a proxy statement to be
mailed to the shareholders of Utah relating to the Utah Shareholders Meeting
(including any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Proxy
Statement/Prospectus_ ", and together with the Combination Registration
Statement of which it forms a part, the " _Combination Documents_ "); and (B)
the Parties shall jointly prepare and Spinco and Utah Newco shall file with
the SEC the Combination Registration Statement and (iii) the Parties shall
jointly prepare and cause to be filed such other securities filings required
by Law in connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (the
securities filings described in clauses (i) to (iii), collectively, "
_Securities Filings_ ").

 



90

    

(b) Each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to have

obligation of any Party to make any payment to any such third party or assume
any Liability not otherwise required to be paid or assumed by the applicable
Party pursuant to the terms of an existing Contract or offer or grant any

appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the Combination and the other transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Documents as promptly as practicable, and in any event within
twenty (20) Business Days after the date hereof (unless the Parties shall

advantageous for purposes of satisfying the conditions to the Combination, in
which case the Parties shall identify a reasonable later date and the Parties

Governmental Authorities as soon as practicable. In connection with and
without limiting the foregoing, each Utah Party, on the one hand, and Pluto

94

    

 the efforts referenced in this _Section_ __ _ 8.7_ to obtain all Approvals,

Party of any communication received by such party from, or given by such
party to, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "),
the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or any other Governmental
Authority and of any material communication received or given in connection
with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding the Combination
or any other transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents (and in
each case, if any such communication is in writing, share a copy with the
other Party) and (z) to the extent permitted by Law, permit the other Party to
review in advance any communication to be given by it to, and consult in good
faith with each other in advance of any meeting or telephone call with, the
DOJ, the FTC or any such other Governmental Authority or, in connection with
any proceeding by a private party, any other Person, and to the extent
permitted by the DOJ, the FTC or such other applicable Governmental Authority
or other Person, give the other Party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, but without limiting each Partys obligations under
this  _Section_ __ _ 8.7_, Utah shall, on behalf of the Parties, control and
lead all communications and strategy for dealing with the DOJ, the FTC or such
other applicable Governmental Authority with respect to any antitrust,
merger control, competition, national security or trade regulation Law that
may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Combination
or any of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, and Utah
shall, on behalf of the Parties, control and lead the defense strategy for
dealing with all Actions challenging the Combination or any of the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents that are brought by
DOJ, the FTC or such other applicable Governmental Authority with respect to
any antitrust, merger control, competition, national security or trade
regulation Law.

 

(b) Without limiting this _Section_ __ _ 8.7_, but subject to the next
sentence of this  _Section_ __ _ 8.7(b)_, each Party will take, or to cause
to be taken, any and all steps and to make any and all undertakings necessary
to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, merger
control, competition, national security or trade regulation Law that may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Combination or any
of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents so as to enable
the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible, including (i) proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition of such
assets or businesses of Spinco (or the Spinco Subsidiaries) or Utah (or the

Spinco (or the Spinco Subsidiaries) or Utah (or the Utah Subsidiaries) (the
actions referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) collectively, " _Remedial
Actions_ ") in each case, as may be required in order to satisfy the
conditions to closing in _Section_ __ _ 9.1(a)_ and to avoid the entry of, or
to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order, or
other order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect
of preventing the Closing or the closing of any other transaction contemplated
by the Transaction Documents; _provided_ that, the effectiveness of any such
Remedial Action shall be contingent on consummation of the Closing or such
other closing, respectively; _provided_ , _further_ , that without the prior
written consent of 

 



95

    

 Utah, none of Pluto or any Spinco Party will take, or cause to be taken, any
Remedial Action with respect to the Spinco Business, the Spinco Assets or the
Spinco Liabilities. The obligations of this _Section_ __ _ 8.7(b)_ shall not
require Pluto to agree to any Remedial Action with respect to any assets,
Liabilities or businesses that are not included in the Spinco Assets, the
Spinco Liabilities or the Spinco Business, respectively.

Section 8.8. Financing.

 

(a) Spinco shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect,

Commitment Letter_ ")), from the financing sources party thereto (together
with all additional lenders, agents and financing sources added to the Spinco
Commitment Letter, the " _Spinco Lenders_ "), pursuant to which, among other
things, the Spinco Lenders have committed to provide Spinco with debt
financing in the amount set forth therein (the debt financing contemplated
by the Spinco Commitment Letter, together with any amendment, modification,
supplement, restatement, substitution or waiver thereof in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement being referred to as the " _Financing_ "), (ii)
materially comply with the obligations that are set forth in the Spinco
Commitment Letter that are applicable to Spinco and satisfy on a timely basis

Commitment Letter.

(b) In the event any funds in the amounts set forth in the Spinco
Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements, or any portion thereof, become

Letter or the Financing Agreements, Pluto (in consultation in good faith with
Utah) shall cause Spinco to, and Utah shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, use reasonable best efforts to cooperate to arrange to obtain promptly any
such portion from the same or alternative sources, in an amount sufficient,
when added to the portion of the Financing that is available, to allow Spinco
to make the Spinco Cash Distribution (the " _Alternative Financing_ "), and to
obtain a new financing commitment that provides for such financing; _provided_
, that (i) the terms of the Alternative Financing must (A) not result in any
adverse Tax consequences to Pluto and its Subsidiaries, including as to the
Tax-Free Status of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents
(as determined by Pluto in good faith) and (B) be customary and reasonable in
light of then-prevailing market terms and (ii) none of Spinco, any Spinco
Entity or any Utah Entity shall agree, or be required to agree, (A) to terms
and conditions of the Alternative Financing if the consummation thereof on
such terms and conditions, taking into account and after giving effect to the
Spinco Cash Distribution, the Combination and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, would result in Spinco having a Below
Investment Grade Rating or (B) to any Alternative Financing if, after giving
effect to such Alternative Financing, the Weighted Average Cost of the
Available Debt Financing would be in excess of the percentage set forth on
_Section_ __ _ 8.8_ of the Utah Disclosure Schedule.

 



96

    

(c) Spinco shall give Utah prompt written notice upon it
obtaining knowledge of (i) any material breach (or threatened material
breach) or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any
material breach or default) by any party to the Spinco Commitment Letter,
(ii) any actual or threatened withdrawal, repudiation or termination of the
Financing by any of the Spinco Lenders, (iii) any material dispute or
disagreement between or among any of the parties to the Spinco Commitment

Commitment Letter. Spinco shall not, without the prior written consent of
Utah, amend, modify, supplement, restate, substitute, replace, terminate, or
agree to any waiver under the Spinco Commitment Letter; _provided_ that
notwithstanding the foregoing, Spinco may (i) implement or exercise any of the
"market flex" provisions exercised by the Spinco Lenders in accordance with
the Spinco Commitment Letter as of the date hereof or (ii) amend and restate
the Spinco Commitment Letter or otherwise execute joinder agreements to the
Spinco Commitment Letter solely to add additional Spinco Lenders.

 

(d) Until the earlier of the Closing and the valid termination of this
agreement in accordance with  _Article_ __ _ X_, each of Spinco and Utah
agrees to cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to cause the arrangement
and consummation of the Financing, including, without limitation, by (i)
negotiating definitive agreements with respect thereto, on the terms and
conditions contained in the Spinco Commitment Letter or on such other terms as
are reasonably acceptable to Pluto and that are not materially less favorable
in the aggregate to Spinco or Utah than those in the Spinco Commitment Letter
as in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ , that (A) Plutos consent, in its
sole discretion, shall be required in respect of any such other terms to the
extent such terms would reasonably be expected to result in any adverse Tax
consequences to Pluto and its Subsidiaries as to the Tax-Free Status of the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents (as determined by Pluto
in good faith) and (B) Plutos consent, not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, shall be required in respect of any such other terms
to the extent such terms would reasonably be expected to result in any other
adverse Tax consequences to Pluto and its Subsidiaries (the " _Financing
Agreements_ "), (ii) satisfying on a timely basis all conditions precedent in
the Spinco Commitment Letter and the Financing Agreements that are within the
control of Utah or any of its Subsidiaries, and (iii) arranging as promptly
as reasonably practicable the Financing prior to the Closing on the terms and
conditions set forth in the Spinco Commitment Letter or on such other terms as

as in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ , that (A) Plutos consent, in its
sole discretion, shall be required in respect of any such other terms to the
extent such terms would reasonably be expected to result in any adverse Tax

transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents (as determined by
Pluto in good faith) and (B) Plutos consent, not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, shall be required in respect of any such other terms
to the extent such terms would reasonably be expected to result in any other
adverse Tax consequences to Pluto and its Subsidiaries. Pluto hereby consents
to the use of Spincos and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the
Financing and solely in a manner that is not intended or reasonably likely to
harm or disparage the reputation or goodwill of the relevant party, or any of
their respective intellectual property rights. Spinco and Utah shall, upon
request by Pluto, each keep Pluto informed in reasonable detail of the status
of its efforts to arrange the Financing and as promptly as practicable provide
copies of then-current drafts of the Financing Agreements and any definitive
agreements relating to the Permanent Financing.

 



97

    

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Financing is
available on terms contemplated by the Spinco Commitment Letter or otherwise
on terms that are reasonably satisfactory to Pluto and not materially less
favorable in the aggregate to Spinco or Utah than those in the Spinco
Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ , that (A)
Plutos consent, in its sole discretion, shall be required in respect of any
such other terms to the extent such terms would reasonably be expected to
result in any adverse tax consequences to Pluto and its Subsidiaries as to
the tax-free status of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents (as determined by Pluto in good faith) and (B) Plutos consent,
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, shall be required in
respect of any such other terms to the extent such terms would reasonably be
expected to result in any other adverse tax consequences to Pluto and its
Subsidiaries, and all conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article_ __ _

Business Day prior to the date of the Distribution without Utahs prior
written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of termination of this
Agreement pursuant to  _Article_ __ _ X_, Utah shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, (A) pay Pluto an amount of cash equal to 43% of the Financing
Obligations (such payment to be made promptly and in any event within ten (10)
Business Days of delivery by Pluto of a written request therefor accompanied
by reasonable supporting documentation evidencing such Financing Obligations)
and (B) indemnify and hold harmless Pluto, its Subsidiaries and its and their

the Utah Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that their obligations under
this Agreement are not conditioned in any manner upon Spinco obtaining the
Financing or any other financing.

 

Section 8.9. Access to Information. Pluto shall, and shall cause the Spinco
Entities to, on the one hand, and Utah shall, and shall cause the Utah
Subsidiaries to, on the other hand, afford to the other Party and to its
respective Representatives, reasonable access, during normal business hours,
during the Interim Period, in such manner as to not interfere with Utahs and
its Subsidiaries or the Spinco Entities (as applicable) normal operation,
the properties, books and records, Contracts and appropriate senior-level
officers and employees of Utah and the Utah Subsidiaries, the Spinco Business
or the Spinco Entities (as applicable), and shall furnish such Party and its
respective Representatives with financial and operating data of Utah and the
Utah Subsidiaries, the Spinco Business or the Spinco Entities (as applicable)
and other information concerning the affairs of Utah and the Utah
Subsidiaries, the Spinco Business or the Spinco Entities (as applicable), in
each case, as such Party and its Representatives may reasonably request solely
for the purposes of furthering the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or for integration purposes; _provided_ that (i) such investigation
shall only be upon reasonable notice and at the sole cost and expense of the
investigating Party; (ii) no Party or its Representatives shall be permitted
to perform any environmental sampling, including sampling of soil,
groundwater, surface water, building materials, or air or wastewater emissions
without the prior written consent of the other applicable Party; and (iii)
nothing in this Agreement (including _Section 8.25_ ) shall require any Party
to permit any inspection or disclose any information to any other Party that
(x) would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of such Partys business or
result in damage to property (other than immaterial damage), except with such
other Partys written consent (which may be withheld or denied at its sole
discretion), (y) would cause a violation of any Law or any confidentiality
obligations and similar restrictions that may be applicable to such
information or (z) would cause a risk of a loss of attorney-client privilege
or other disclosure privilege to such Party ( _provided_ that the Party
that would otherwise be required to disclose information to the other during
the Interim Period shall take any and all reasonable action necessary to
permit such disclosure without such loss of privilege or violation of
agreement or Law, including "clean room" or other similar procedures designed
to limit any such adverse effect of the sharing of such information by each
Party). The Parties hereby agree that the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement shall apply to all information and material furnished by any Party
or its Representatives thereunder and hereunder and that nothing in this
Section 8.9 shall require Pluto to provide access to any of its businesses or
any information other

 



100

    

 than with respect to the Spinco Business. The Confidentiality Agreement
shall survive any termination of this Agreement. All requests for such access
to any Party shall be made to such Party or its designated Representative.
Spinco will make available to Utah prior to the Closing true and complete
copies of the Organizational Documents of the Spinco Subsidiaries.

 

Section 8.10. DandO Indemnification and Insurance.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Spinco agrees that it
shall indemnify and hold harmless each Person who is, or at any time prior to
the Closing has been, a director or officer of Utah or any of its Subsidiaries
and each Person who served as a director, officer or fiduciary of another
company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise if such service was at the
request of Utah or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified
Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, Losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising
out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Closing, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing,
to the fullest extent that Utah or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may
be, would have been permitted under its Organizational Documents in effect on
the date hereof to indemnify such Person (including advancing expenses as
incurred in accordance with and to the fullest extent permitted under such
Organizational Documents; _provided_ that such Indemnified Party agrees in
advance to return any such funds to which a court of competent jurisdiction
has determined in a final, nonappealable judgment such Indemnified Party is
not ultimately entitled). Without limiting the foregoing, Spinco, Utah and
Utah Newco Sub agree that, for a period of six (6) years after the Closing,
neither Utah nor any of its successors (including Utah Newco Sub, as the
acquiring and surviving corporation in the Utah Merger) shall, and Spinco
shall cause Utah and its successors not to, amend, repeal or modify any
provision in its Organizational Documents in a manner that would adversely
affect the rights or exculpation or indemnification of present or former
directors or officers of Utah and its Subsidiaries, except as required by Law.

 

(b) At or prior to the Closing, any of the Utah Parties or Spinco may (i)
purchase a "tail" directors and officers liability insurance policy
covering the Indemnified Parties who are, or at any time prior to the Closing
were, covered by Utahs existing directors and officers liability insurance
policies, for a period of at least six (6) years after the Closing and on
terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties
(including as to coverage and amounts) than such existing insurance, with a
substantially comparable insurer to the existing insurer; _provided_ that, if
purchased by Utah, the premium thereof shall not exceed 300% of the last
annual premium paid by Utah prior to the date hereof (the " _Premium Cap_ "),
or (ii) if such a policy is not purchased by either Spinco or any of the Utah
Parties, then for a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Spinco shall
cause to be maintained the current officers and directors liability
insurance covering the Indemnified Parties who are, or at any time prior to
the Closing were, covered by Utahs existing officers and directors
liability insurance policies ( _provided_ that Spinco may substitute therefor
policies on terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the
Indemnified Parties (including as to coverage and amounts) than such existing
insurance with a substantially comparable insurer) with respect to claims
arising from facts or events, or actions or omissions, which occurred or are
alleged to have occurred at or before the Closing; _provided_ that Spinco
shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of the Premium Cap, and
if the amount of the premium necessary to maintain such insurance 

 



101

    

 would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then Spinco shall cause to be
maintained policies of insurance coverage which provide the maximum coverage
available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap.

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
this  _Section_ __ _ 8.10_ shall survive the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall be binding, jointly and severally,
on all successors and assigns of the Utah Parties and Spinco and is intended
to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each present and former
director and officer of any Utah Entity and his or her heirs and
representatives. In the event that Utah Newco Sub or Spinco or any of their
respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Utah Newco Sub or Spinco,
as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.10_.

 

Section 8.11. No Solicitation.

 

(a) Except as permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 8.11_, Utah agrees that,
from and after the date hereof, it shall (i) immediately cease and terminate,
and cause its Subsidiaries and all of its and its Subsidiaries respective
Representatives to cease and terminate, any discussions or negotiations with
any other Person (other than Pluto or its Affiliates) regarding any Competing
Proposal, (ii) promptly request, or cause to be requested, that each Person
that has received confidential information in connection with a possible
Competing Proposal within the 12-month period immediately prior to the date
hereof return to Utah or destroy all such confidential information heretofore
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of Utah or any of its Subsidiaries
and promptly prohibit any access by any Person (other than Pluto and its
Representatives) to any physical or electronic data room relating to a
possible Competing Proposal and (iii) not grant any waiver or release under or
knowingly fail to enforce any confidentiality, standstill or similar
agreement in respect of a proposed Competing Proposal, unless the Utah Board
concludes in good faith that a failure to take any action described in this
clause (iii) would be inconsistent with the Utah directors fiduciary duties
to Utahs shareholders and other stakeholders under applicable Law. From and
after the date hereof, except as otherwise permitted by this _Section_ __ _
8.11_, Utah shall not, directly or indirectly, nor shall Utah authorize or
permit its Subsidiaries or authorize or knowingly permit its or their
respective Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (1) solicit, initiate
or knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of furnishing
nonpublic information), or engage in, continue or otherwise participate in
discussions or negotiations regarding, any inquiry, proposal or offer, or the
making, submission or announcement of any inquiry, proposal or offer
(including any inquiry, proposal or offer to its shareholders) which
constitutes or would be reasonably expected to lead to a Competing Proposal
(except to notify such Person of the existence of the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 8.11_), (2) furnish any nonpublic or confidential information
or afford access to properties, books or records to any Person in connection
with or for the purpose of soliciting or knowingly encouraging or facilitating
a Competing Proposal, (3) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or
recommend, or execute or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, stock purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement or stock
exchange, option agreement, joint venture

 



102

    

 agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement relating to a
Competing Proposal or that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing
Proposal or that would require Utah to abandon or fail to consummate the
Combination (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.11(b)_) (a " _Utah Acquisition Agreement_
"), or (4) propose publicly or agree to do any of the foregoing. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Utah acknowledges and agrees that,
in the event any officer, director or financial advisor of Utah takes any
action that if taken by Utah would be a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 8.11_,
the taking of such action by such officer, director or financial advisor shall
be deemed to constitute a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 8.11_ by Utah. In
furtherance of its obligations hereunder, to the extent that any of the Utah
Parties has knowledge that any Representative of the Utah Parties has taken an
action that, if taken by any of the Utah Parties, would violate the
restrictions set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.11_, then such Utah Party
shall promptly instruct such Representative to cease such action.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 8.11(a)_ or any other provision of this Agreement, if an
unsolicited Competing Proposal is submitted to Utah by a third Person or group
after the date hereof, then prior to (but not after) the occurrence of the
Utah Shareholder Approval, Utah may, directly or indirectly through its
Representatives, (i) furnish information and access to such Person or group
and its Representatives (for so long as such Competing Proposal has not been
withdrawn) and (ii) participate in discussions and negotiate with such Person
concerning any such unsolicited Competing Proposal, in the case of clauses (i)
and (ii) if and only if, (A) the submission of such Competing Proposal did not
result from or arise in connection with a breach of this  _Section_ __ _
8.11_, (B) the Utah Board concludes, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, that such Competing Proposal would reasonably
be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, (C) Utah receives from the
Person or group making such Competing Proposal an executed Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, and (D) the Utah Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors)
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Utah
directors fiduciary duties to Utahs shareholders and other stakeholders
under applicable Law. Pluto shall be entitled to receive an executed copy of
any such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and notification of the
identity of such Person promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) after Utahs entering into such discussions or negotiations or
furnishing information to the Person or group making such Competing Proposal
or its Representatives. Utah shall promptly provide or make available to Pluto
any information concerning Utah and any of its Subsidiaries that is provided
to the Person or group making such Competing Proposal or its Representatives
which was not previously provided or made available to Pluto.

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 8.11(c)_, the
Utah Board shall make the Utah Recommendation, and unless permitted by this
_Section_ __ _ 8.11(c)_, neither the Utah Board nor any committee thereof
shall (i) (A) withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose to withhold,
withdraw, modify or qualify, in any manner adverse to Pluto, Spinco or their
respective Affiliates, the approval of this Agreement or the Utah
Recommendation, (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to
recommend, adopt or approve, any Competing Proposal or (C) resolve or publicly
propose or agree to do any of the foregoing (any action described in this
clause (i) being referred to as a " _Utah Change in Recommendation_ ") or
(ii) approve, endorse or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, endorse or
recommend, or allow Utah or any of its

 



103

    

 Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, a Utah Acquisition Agreement or (iii)
resolve, agree or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding
the foregoing but subject to Utahs compliance with the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 8.11(d)_, if the Utah Board has determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that
a Competing Proposal made after the date hereof that did not result from a
breach of any of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.11_ constitutes a
Superior Proposal, the Utah Board may make a Utah Change in Recommendation if
all of the following conditions are met: (x) the Utah Shareholder Approval
has not been obtained; (y) (1) Utah gives Pluto written notice (a " _Superior
Proposal Notice_ ") at least four (4) Business Days prior to taking such
action, which notice advises Pluto of the intention of the Utah Board to take
such action, specifies the material terms and conditions of such Competing
Proposal, identifies the Person making such Competing Proposal and includes a
copy of the proposed Utah Acquisition Agreement (if any) for such Competing
Proposal ( _provided_ that if there is any material change, material amendment
or material modification to the terms or status of such Competing Proposal,
Utah will provide a subsequent notice to Pluto of such changes, amendments or
modifications and not take any such action prior to the second (2nd) Business
Day following a subsequent notice to Pluto of such changes) (it being
understood that there may be multiple extensions of such notice period), (2)
during a period of four (4) Business Days following Plutos receipt of a
Superior Proposal Notice (or, in the event of a new Superior Proposal Notice
as a result of any such amendment or modification, an extension of two (2)
additional Business Days), if requested by Pluto, Utah and its Representatives
shall have negotiated with Pluto and its Representatives in good faith with
respect to any revisions or adjustments proposed by Pluto to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement; and (z) if applicable, at the end of such
applicable four (4)- or two (2)-Business Day period, the Utah Board, after
considering in good faith any such revisions or adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement that Pluto, prior to the expiration of such
applicable period, shall have offered in writing in a manner that would form a
binding Contract if accepted by Utah, continues to determine in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors)
that the Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and that failure
to make such Utah Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with the Utah
directors fiduciary duties to Utahs shareholders and other stakeholders
under applicable Law.

(d) In the event Utah receives a Competing Proposal, any inquiry, proposal
or indication of interest that would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Competing Proposal, any request for nonpublic information relating to Utah or
any Utah Subsidiary or for access to the properties, books or records of Utah
or any Utah Subsidiary by any Person or group that has made or, to the
knowledge of Utah, would reasonably be expected to make a Competing Proposal,
or any request for discussions or negotiations in respect of any Competing
Proposal, Utah will (i) as promptly as practicable (and in no event later
than twenty-four (24) hours after knowledge of receipt by Utah or any Utah
Subsidiary of any such Competing Proposal, inquiry, proposal, indication of
interest or request) notify (which notice may be provided orally and
confirmed in writing and shall identify the Person or group making such
Competing Proposal, inquiry, proposal, indication of interest or request and
set forth the material terms thereof (including a copy of such
Competing Proposal, if any)) Pluto thereof and (ii) keep Pluto reasonably and
promptly informed of the status and material terms of (including with respect
to changes to the status or material terms of) any such Competing Proposal,
inquiry, proposal, indication of interest or request. Without limiting the
generality of the preceding sentence, Utah shall provide to Pluto as promptly
as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof (and in any 

 



104

    

 event within 24 hours of receipt or delivery) copies of all documentation
comprising such Competing Proposal or other documentation that is material to
understanding such Competing Proposal received by Utah or any Utah Subsidiary
from the Person or group making a Competing Proposal (or such Persons
Representatives) and of all material documentation provided by Utah or any
Utah Subsidiary to the Person or group making a Competing Proposal (or such
Persons Representatives) that comprises any counterproposal or any other
material substantive response by Utah (to the extent such counterproposal or
substantive response is permitted under this  _Section_ __ _ 8.11_) to the
Person or group making such Competing Proposal. Utah shall not, and shall
cause the Utah Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality or other
agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that
prohibits Utah from providing such information to Pluto.

(e) Subject to Plutos rights under _Article_ __ _ IX_, nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.11_ shall prohibit the Utah Board from taking and disclosing
to Utahs shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9
(including any "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f)) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange
Act, or other applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such disclosure
that would amount to a Utah Change in Recommendation shall be permitted, made
or taken other than in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.11(c)_.

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) " _Competing Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer for, or
indication of interest in, any (A) direct or indirect acquisition, exclusive
license or purchase of any business or assets of Utah or any of its
Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, constitutes 15% or more
of the net revenues, net income or assets of Utah and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, (B) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 15% or more of
any class of equity securities, or Interests representing 15% or more of the
outstanding voting power, of Utah, (C) tender offer or exchange offer that,
if consummated, would result in any Person or group (or the stockholders of
any Person or group) beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of equity
securities, or Interests representing 15% or more of the outstanding voting
power, of Utah, or (D) merger, consolidation, business combination, share
exchange, joint venture, partnership, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving any business of Utah or any
of its Subsidiaries that constitutes 15% or more of the net revenue, net
income or assets of Utah and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Competing Proposal shall not include any
inquiry, proposal, offer, or indication of interest by the Foundation for the
exercise or possible exercise by the Foundation of the Call Option in
compliance with _Section_ __ _ 7.27(b)_. The Combination and the other
transactions contemplated hereby shall not be a Competing Proposal.

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Competing
Proposal, that the Utah Board determines in its good faith judgment (after
taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory, timing, risk of
consummation and other aspects of such Competing Proposal and after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) is more
favorable to Utah and its shareholders and other stakeholders than the
Combination and the other transactions contemplated hereby (taking into
account the likelihood of consummation on the terms so proposed and all
such other factors as the Utah Board deems relevant); _provided_ , that for
purposes of this definition, all references to "15%" in the term "Competing
Proposal" shall be deemed references to "75%".

 



105

    

(g) Pluto agrees that, from and after the date hereof, it shall (i)
immediately cease and terminate, and cause its Subsidiaries and all of its and
its Subsidiaries respective Representatives to cease and terminate, any
discussions or negotiations with any other Person (other than Utah or
its Affiliates) regarding any Competing Spinco Proposal, (ii) promptly
request, or cause to be requested, that each Person that has received
confidential information in connection with a possible Competing Spinco
Proposal within the 12-month period immediately prior to the date hereof
return to Pluto or destroy all such confidential information heretofore
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of Pluto or any of its Subsidiaries
and promptly prohibit any access by any Person (other than Utah and its
Representatives) to any physical or electronic data room relating to a
possible Competing Spinco Proposal and (iii) not grant any waiver or release
under or knowingly fail to enforce any confidentiality, standstill or similar
agreement in respect of a proposed Competing Spinco Proposal. From and after
the date hereof, Pluto shall not, directly or indirectly, nor shall Pluto
authorize or permit its Subsidiaries or authorize or knowingly permit its or
their respective Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of furnishing
nonpublic information), or engage in, continue or otherwise participate in
discussions or negotiations regarding, any inquiry, proposal or offer, or the
making, submission or announcement of any inquiry, proposal or offer
(including any inquiry, proposal or offer to its shareholders) which
constitutes or would be reasonably expected to lead to a Competing Spinco
Proposal (except to notify such Person of the existence of the provisions of

information or afford access to properties, books or records to any Person in
connection with or for the purpose of soliciting or knowingly encouraging or
facilitating a Competing Spinco Proposal, (C) approve or propose to approve,
or execute or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, stock
purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement or stock exchange, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
agreement relating to a Competing Spinco Proposal or that would require Pluto
or Spinco to abandon or fail to consummate the Combination, or (D) propose
publicly or agree to do any of the foregoing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Pluto acknowledges and agrees that, in the event
any officer, director or financial advisor of Pluto or Spinco takes any action
that if taken by Pluto would be a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 8.11_, the
taking of such action by such officer, director or financial advisor shall be
deemed to constitute a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 8.11_ by Pluto. In
furtherance of its obligations hereunder, to the extent that Pluto has
knowledge that any of its Representatives has taken an action that, if taken
by Pluto, would violate the restrictions set forth in this _Section_ __ _
8.11_, then Pluto, shall promptly instruct such Representative to cease such
action.

 

(i) " _Competing Spinco Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer

whole, (B) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 15% or more of any

revenue, net income or assets of the Spinco Business, taken as a whole, in the
case of each of clauses (A) through (C), other than as permitted by _Section_

shall not compromise or settle, or agree to compromise or settle, any such
Action to the extent (i) such Action includes Pluto or any of its

(a) Spinco and Utah shall use commercially reasonable efforts to jointly
obtain from the respective beneficiary, in form and substance reasonably

efforts to perform such obligations on behalf of Pluto and such Affiliates or
(y) otherwise use reasonable best efforts to take such action as reasonably
requested by Pluto and such Affiliates so as to put Pluto and such Affiliates
in the same position as if Spinco, and not Pluto, had performed or were
performing such obligations.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that at any time on or after the Closing Date, (i)
Pluto may, in consultation in good faith with Spinco, take any reasonable
action to terminate, obtain release of or otherwise limit its Liability under
any and all outstanding Support Obligations, and (ii) neither Pluto nor any
of its applicable Affiliates will have any obligation to renew any guarantees,
letters of credit, comfort letters, bonds, sureties and other credit support
or assurances issued on behalf of any of the Spinco Entities or the Spinco
Business after the expiration thereof.

Section 8.18. Employment and Benefit Matters.

 

(a) _Compensation and Benefit Continuation_.

 

(i) _Continuing Employees Generally_. For a period of one year following
the Effective Time, Spinco shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to
each Spinco Employee and each individual employed by the Utah Entities as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Utah Employee_ ", and any Spinco
Employee or Utah Employee, a " _Continuing Employee_ "), for so long as such
Continuing Employee remains employed by Spinco or its Affiliates, (A) base
compensation that is no less favorable than the base compensation provided to
such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; (B)
short-term incentive compensation opportunities that are no less favorable
than such Continuing Employees short-term incentive compensation
opportunities in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; (C)
severance benefits that are no less favorable than the severance benefits for
which such Continuing Employee was eligible as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time; and (D) other compensation (excluding long-term incentive
compensation) and employee benefits that, in the aggregate, are no less
favorable than the other compensation and employee benefits (excluding long-
term incentive compensation) provided to such Continuing Employee as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Pluto and Utah shall cooperate in
good faith in developing appropriate, market-based long-term incentive
programs that will apply to Continuing Employees following the Effective Time,
which shall treat similarly situated employees on a substantially equivalent
basis and not discriminate between Spinco Employees and Utah Employees, and
agree to the matters set forth on Section 8.18(a)(i) of the Utah Disclosure
Schedule.

 

(ii) _Collectively Bargained Employees_. Spinco and Utah shall cooperate
in respect of consultation obligations and similar notice and bargaining
obligations owed to any employees or consultants of any of the Spinco Entities
or any of the Utah Entities in accordance with all applicable Laws and works
council or other bargaining agreements, if any. With respect to any
Continuing Employee who is covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement or who
is in a collective bargaining unit, Spinco shall, or shall cause one of its
Subsidiaries to, provide compensation and employee benefits in accordance
with the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement as in effect from time to
time.

 



109

    

(b) _Service Credit_. For all purposes (including vesting, eligibility to
participate, accruals and level of benefits) under any plans providing
benefits to any Continuing Employee after the Effective Time (the " _New
Plans_ "), each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or her
years of service with any of the Utah Entities and their respective
Affiliates and predecessors, or any of the Pluto Entities or Spinco Entities
and their respective Affiliates and predecessors, before the Effective Time,
to the extent such service was recognized by any of the Utah Entities or
Spinco Entities, as applicable, for similar purposes prior to the Effective
Time (or, in the case of Spinco Employees, as set forth in the Employee
Matters Agreement); _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the
extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with
respect to the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (x) each Continuing Employee shall
be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and
all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing
comparable coverage under an Utah Benefit Plan or Spinco Benefit Plan, as
applicable, in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before
the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (y)
for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, Spinco shall cause (1) all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless
and to the extent the individual, immediately prior to entry in the New Plans,
was subject to such conditions under the comparable Old Plans, and (2) any
eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents
during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such
employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into
account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee
and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such
amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(c) _Change in Control_. Pluto and Spinco acknowledge and agree that the
occurrence of the Effective Time shall be treated as a "change in control",
"change of control" or term of similar import, as applicable, for purposes of
each Utah Benefit Plan set forth on Section 8.18(c) of the Utah Disclosure
Schedule.

(d) _Cash Long-Term Incentive Awards_. From and after the Effective Time,
Spinco shall assume and honor, in accordance with their terms, each
outstanding Utah cash-based long-term incentive award (each such unit, a "
_Utah Cash Award_ "), including as provided in Section 8.18(d) of the Utah
Disclosure Schedule.

(e) _Communications_. Pluto and Utah shall cooperate in good faith
(including by providing reasonable opportunity to review and comment) with
respect to any written broad-based notices or communications materials
(including website postings) from Utah or its Affiliates to the Utah
employees, or from Spinco or its Affiliates to the Spinco Employees or to any
employees of Utah or its Affiliates, with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or employment, compensation or benefits matters
of such employees that relate to the period following the Closing Date.

 



110

    

(f) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement shall
confer upon any Continuing Employee any right to continue in the employ or
service of Spinco or any of its Affiliates, or shall interfere with or
restrict in any way the rights of Spinco or any of its Affiliates, which
rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services
of any Continuing Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or
without cause. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.18_ shall (i) be deemed or
construed to be an amendment or other modification of any Spinco Benefit Plan,
Utah Benefit Plan or any plan, program or arrangement of Pluto and any of its
Affiliates, or (ii) create any third party rights in any current or former
service provider or employee of Pluto, Spinco, Utah or any of their respective
Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

to leave the employ of Utah or any of its Affiliates, or, following the
Closing Date, Spinco or any of its Affiliates, or enter into a consulting
agreement with any Utah Covered Employee; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i)
the placement of any general mass solicitation or advertising that is not
targeted at the employees of Utah or, following the Closing Date, Spinco
shall not be considered a violation of the non-solicitation restriction of
this _Section_ __ _ 8.19(a)_; (ii) this  _Section_ __ _ 8.19(a)_ shall not
preclude Pluto or its Subsidiaries from soliciting, offering to hire, hiring,

its Subsidiaries from soliciting, offering to hire, hiring, or entering into

or any of its Affiliates has been terminated by Pluto or any of its
Affiliates.

the date hereof, Utah shall determine (in consultation in good faith with
Pluto) whether the listing of the shares of Spinco Common Stock to be issued

(i) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.1(g)_,
then Utah shall pay, or cause to be paid, the entire Termination Payment on
the third (3rd) Business Day following such termination; or

 

(ii) (x) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _
10.1(e)_ as a result of a Willful Breach of _Section_ __ _ 8.11_, and (y)
within twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, a Competing
Proposal is consummated or Utah enters into a definitive written agreement in
respect of a Competing Proposal, then Utah shall be obligated to pay the
Termination Payment on the third (3rd) Business Day following the earlier of
the date Utah enters into a definitive agreement in respect of or consummates
such Competing Proposal;  _provided_ that, solely for purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 10.3(b)(ii)_, the term "Competing Proposal" shall have the
meaning set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.11(f)(i)_, except that all references
to 15% shall be changed to 50%.

(iii) (x) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
10.1(f)_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.1(e)_ as a result of a breach of _Section_ __ _
8.6_, (y) prior to such termination, a Competing Proposal shall have been
publicly announced or otherwise becomes publicly known (or, in the case of a
Willful Breach of _Section_ __ _ 8.6_, a Competing Proposal shall have been
communicated to the Board of Directors of Utah), and, other than in the case
of a termination pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.1(e)_ as a result of a
Willful Breach of _Section_ __ _ 8.6_, such Competing Proposal that has been
publicly announced or otherwise becomes publicly known shall not have been
publicly withdrawn at least seven (7) days prior to the Utah Shareholders
Meeting, and (z) within twelve (12) months after the date of such termination,
a Competing Proposal is consummated or Utah enters into a definitive written
agreement in respect of a Competing Proposal (which need not be the same
Competing Proposal referred to in clause (y)), then Utah shall be obligated to
pay the Termination Payment on the third (3rd) Business Day following the
earlier of the date Utah enters into a definitive agreement in respect of or
consummates such Competing Proposal; _provided_ that, solely for purposes of
this _Section_ __ _ 10.3(b)(ii)_, the term "Competing Proposal" shall have
the meaning set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 8.11(f)(i)_, except that all
references to 15% shall be changed to 50%.

(c) In the event this Agreement is terminated by either Pluto or Utah
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.1(f)_, then Utah shall pay to Pluto (by wire
transfer of immediately available funds promptly following delivery by Pluto
to Utah of a written statement setting forth the amount of the Pluto
Expenses, including specifying the portion of Pluto Expenses paid to each
vendor on a vendor-by-vendor basis), all reasonable out-of-pocket costs, fees
and expenses incurred by Pluto in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement but excluding all such costs,
fees and expenses incurred by Pluto prior to May 2, 2019 (the " _Pluto_

 



119

    

  _Expenses_ "); _provided_ that Utah shall not be obligated to pay the Pluto
Expenses in excess of $96 million; _provided_ , _further_ , that any payment
of the Pluto Expenses shall not affect Plutos right to receive any
Termination Payment otherwise due under _Section_ __ _ 10.3(b)_, but shall
reduce, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, any Termination Payment that becomes
due and payable under _Section_ __ _ 10.3(b)_.

 

(d) In the event of the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance
with this _Article_ __ _ X_ under circumstances in which the Termination
Payment is payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.3_, it is agreed that
the Termination Payment is liquidated damages and by way of compensation, and
not a penalty. Except with respect to claims resulting from fraud by the Utah
Parties, payment of any Termination Payment shall constitute the sole and
exclusive remedy of Pluto and the Spinco Parties against the Utah Parties,
their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, the Spinco Lenders, the Lender
Related Parties and each of their respective Representatives, in circumstances
where the Termination Payment is payable under this Agreement and the
Termination Payment is paid; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in circumstances
where the Termination Payment is payable under this Agreement and Utah has
committed a Willful Breach of this Agreement, Pluto and the Spinco Parties may
elect, no later than the date the Termination Payment is due, to forgo
the Termination Payment and instead pursue a claim for damages under this
Agreement. Each Party agrees that the agreements contained in this _Section_
__ _ 10.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Utah fails to pay any amounts due under
this _Section_ __ _ 10.3_ and, in order to obtain such payment, Pluto
commences a suit that results in a judgment against Utah for such amounts,
Utah shall pay interest on such amounts from the date payment of such amounts
was due to the date of actual payment at a rate per annum equal to the Prime
Rate in effect from time to time for the relevant period, together with the
costs and expenses of Pluto (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit.

 

(e) The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall Utah be
required to pay more than one Termination Payment, even if a Termination
Payment may be payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at the
same time or at different times and upon the occurrence of different events.

Section 11.3. Amendments and Waivers.

 

(a) Any Party may, at any time prior to the Closing, by action taken by its
board of directors, or officers thereunto duly authorized, waive any of the
terms or conditions of this Agreement or (without limiting _Section_ __ _
11.3(b)_) agree to an amendment or modification to this Agreement by an
agreement in writing executed in the same manner (but not necessarily by the
same Persons) as this Agreement; _provided_ that after the Utah Shareholder
Approval has been obtained, no amendment or waiver shall be made that pursuant
to applicable Law requires further approval or adoption by the shareholders
of Utah without such further approval or adoption. No waiver by any of the
Parties of any breach hereunder shall be deemed to extend to any prior or
subsequent breach hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue
of any prior or subsequent such occurrence. The failure or delay of any Party
to assert any of its rights hereunder or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights. No waiver by any of the Parties of any of the
provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing
and executed by the Party sought to be charged with such waiver.

 

(b) This Agreement may be amended or modified, in whole or in part, only by
a duly authorized agreement in writing executed by the Parties in the same
manner as this Agreement and which makes reference to this Agreement;
_provided_ that any amendments or modifications of this _Section_ __ _
11.3(b)_, Section _11.4(b)_ or Section _11.5_ , to the extent adversely
affecting any of the Spinco Lenders or their respective Lender Related
Parties, shall not be effective with respect to such affected Spinco Lenders
or Lender Related Parties unless such affected Spinco Lenders party to the
Spinco Commitment Letter provide their prior written consent to such amendment
or modification.

 

Section 11.4. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.

 

(a) This Agreement and all Actions (whether in contract or tort) that may
be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation,
execution or performance hereof shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Law of the State of Delaware, without

 



122

    

 regard to any Laws or principles thereof that would result in the
application of the Laws of any other jurisdiction (except that the Laws of the
Netherlands shall govern (i) the duties of the members of the Utah Board and
(ii) the Combination, to the extent mandatorily applicable thereto). Except as
expressly set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, the Parties
expressly waive any right they may have, now or in the future, to demand or
seek the application of a governing Law other than the Law of the State of
Delaware.

(b) Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or,
if such court shall not have jurisdiction, the United States District Court
for the District of Delaware (or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction,
any state court in the state of Delaware), and any appellate court from any
appeal thereof, in any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
and each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to
commence any such Action except in such courts, (ii) agrees that any claim in
respect of any such Action may be heard and determined in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or, to the extent permitted by Law, in such
other courts, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such Action in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware or such other courts and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action
in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such other courts.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
Party on behalf of itself and its controlled Affiliates: (i) agrees that it
will not bring or support any legal proceeding against any of the Spinco
Lenders or their Lender Related Parties in any way relating to the Financing
in any forum other than the federal and New York state courts located in the
Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York; (ii) agrees that, except as
specifically set forth in the Spinco Commitment Letter or the Financing
Agreements, all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the Spinco Lenders or their
Lender Related Parties relating to this Agreement, the Combination, or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the performance of services
related hereto, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to
the Financing, shall be exclusively governed by and construed in accordance
with the internal Laws of the State of New York; (iii) agrees to waive and
hereby waives, irrevocably and unconditionally, any right to a trial by jury
in any such legal action, suit or proceeding against any of the Spinco
Lenders or their Lender Related Parties relating to the Financing; and (iv)
agrees to waive and hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any objection which such Party may now or hereafter have to
the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of, any such legal action, suit or proceeding against any of the
Spinco Lenders or their Lender Related Parties relating to the Financing in
any such court. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any such Action
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each Party irrevocably
consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in
_Section_ __ _ 11.2_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any
Party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY

 



123

    

 IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OF THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (INCLUDING THE FINANCING). EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE SUCH WAIVERS,
(II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III)
IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS SECTION 11.4(C).

 

Section 11.5. Assignment; Parties in Interest; Non-Parties.

 

(a) No Party may assign its rights or delegate its duties under this
Agreement without the written consent of the other Parties. Any attempted
assignment or delegation in breach of this _Section_ __ _ 11.5_ shall be null
and void; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Utah Parties may collaterally
assign their respective rights (but not obligations) under this Agreement to
any of the Spinco Lenders or any Lender Related Party or other financing
source. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns. Nothing
expressed or implied in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to
confer upon or give any Person, other than the Parties, any rights or remedies
under or by reason of this Agreement, except as provided in  _Section_ __ _
8.10_ and this _Section_ __ _ 11.5_ (which is intended to be for the benefit
of the Persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such Persons).

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is
hereby agreed and acknowledged that this Agreement may only be enforced
against, and any claims of action that may be based upon, arise out of or
relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement may only be made against, the Parties hereto, and no former,
current or future Affiliates, officers, directors, managers, employees,
equityholders, Spinco Lenders or Lender Related Parties, financing sources,
managers, members, partners, agents or representatives of any Party, in each
case, who is not a Party to this Agreement, shall have any liability for any
obligations of the Parties hereto or for any claim based on, in respect of, or
by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby. The Spinco Lenders and the
Lender Related Parties are third party beneficiaries of _Section_ __ _
10.3(d)_, _Section_ __ _ 11.3(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 11.4(b)_, and this
_Section_ __ _ 11.5_. This  _Section_ __ _ 11.5(b)_ shall not affect (a)
the rights of the Persons party to the Spinco Commitment Letter to enforce the
Spinco Commitment Letters in accordance with its terms; or (b) the rights and
obligations of the Parties hereto set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.8_.

Section 11.6. Captions; Counterparts. The captions in this Agreement are
for convenience only and shall not be considered a part of or affect the
construction or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. This
Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more counterparts (including by
electronic or .pdf transmission), each of which shall be deemed an original,
but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
Delivery of any signature page by facsimile, electronic or .pdf transmission
shall be binding to the same extent as an original signature page.

 



124

    

Section 11.7. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Transaction Documents
and the Confidentiality Agreement, including any related annexes, Exhibits and
Schedules, as well as any other agreements and documents referred to herein
and therein, shall together constitute the entire agreement between
the Parties relating to the transactions contemplated hereby and supersede
any other agreements, whether written or oral, that may have been made or
entered into by or among any of the Parties or any of their respective
Affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 11.8. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or any
Transaction Document, or the application of any provision to any Person or
circumstance, is held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent
jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect. The Parties further agree that if any provision contained
herein is, to any extent, held invalid or unenforceable in any respect under
the Laws governing this Agreement, they shall take any actions necessary to
render the remaining provisions of this Agreement valid and enforceable to
the fullest extent permitted by Law and, to the extent necessary, shall amend
or otherwise modify this Agreement to replace any provision contained herein
that is held invalid or unenforceable with a valid and enforceable provision
giving effect to the intent of the Parties.

Section 11.9. Specific Performance. In the event of any actual or
threatened default in, or breach of, any of the terms, conditions and
provisions of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, the Party who
is, or is to be, thereby aggrieved shall have the right to specific
performance and injunctive or other equitable relief in respect of its rights
under this Agreement or such Transaction Document, without the necessity of
proving actual damages or the inadequacy of monetary damages as a remedy,
in addition to any other remedy to which such Party is entitled at law or in
equity. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Parties hereto
agree that each Party shall be entitled to enforce specifically the other
Parties obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the obligation to consummate the Closing and the
obligations with respect to the Financing), if the conditions set forth in
_Article_ __ _ IX_ have been satisfied (other than the conditions set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)_ and those conditions
which by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) or waived
(where permissible under applicable Law) and to prevent defaults in and
breaches of this Agreement. The Parties agree that the remedies at law for any
default or breach or threatened default or breach, including monetary damages,
are inadequate compensation for any Loss hereunder or default herein or
breach hereof, and that any defense in any Action for specific performance
that a remedy at law would be adequate is waived. Any requirements for the
securing or posting of any bond with such remedy are waived by each Party.
