among Avago Technologies Wireless (U.S.A.) Manufacturing Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" ** _Parent_** "), Pluto Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the " ** _Purchaser_** ")
and PLX Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " ** _Company_** "). All

WHEREAS, pursuant to this Agreement, the Purchaser has agreed to commence a
tender offer (the " ** _Offer_** ") to acquire all of the outstanding shares
of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the " **
_Shares_** ") at a price per Share of $6.50 in cash (such amount or any
different amount per Share that may be paid pursuant to the Offer in
accordance with this Agreement, the " ** _Offer Price_** "), without interest,
subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law;

 



 

WHEREAS, following the acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the
Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company

WHEREAS, the parties intend that the Merger shall be governed by Section 253
or Section 251(h) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " ** _DGCL_**
") and shall be effected as soon as practicable following consummation of the
Offer upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " ** _Company Board_** ")
has, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein,
unanimously (i) determined that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to and in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved and declared
advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Offer and the Merger and (iii) recommended that the Companys stockholders
accept the Offer, tender their Shares to the Purchaser in the Offer and, to
the extent applicable, approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger (the "
** _Company Board Recommendation_** ");

 



 

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of Parent and the Purchaser have, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, unanimously (i)
determined that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the

WHEREAS, as a condition to and inducement of Parents and the Purchasers
willingness to enter into this Agreement, simultaneously with the execution of
this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company have executed and
delivered to Parent and the Purchaser a Tender and Support Agreement in
substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ , with such changes
thereto as may have been approved by Parent prior to the date hereof (each, a
" ** _Tender Agreement_** "), dated as of the date hereof, pursuant to which
such stockholders have, among other matters, agreed to (i) tender the Shares
beneficially owned by them in the Offer and (ii) support the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, each on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Tender Agreements; and

 



 

WHEREAS, Parent, the Purchaser and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Offer and
the Merger.

 



 

 **AGREEMENT**

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I 
THE OFFER AND THE MERGER**

 



 

1.1 _The Offer_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within ten
Business Days after the date of this Agreement, as such period may be extended
if and to the extent the Company fails to satisfy its obligations pursuant to
_Section 1.1(g)_ or other information required from Representatives of the
Company or Parent is delayed), the Purchaser shall commence, within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act, the Offer to purchase all of the
outstanding Shares for cash at the Offer Price. The consummation of the Offer,
and the obligation of the Purchaser to accept for payment and pay for Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer, shall be subject to: (i) there being validly
tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date
that number of Shares which, together with the number of Shares (if any) then
owned by Parent or any of its wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiaries,
including the Purchaser, or with respect to which Parent or any of its wholly-
owned direct or indirect Subsidiaries, including the Purchaser, otherwise has,
directly or indirectly, sole voting power, represents at least a majority of
the Shares then outstanding (determined on a fully diluted basis) and no less
than a majority of the voting power of the shares of capital stock of the
Company then outstanding (determined on a fully diluted basis) and entitled to
vote upon the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger (excluding
from the number of tendered Shares, but not from the number of outstanding
Shares, Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures (to the
extent such procedures are permitted by the Purchaser) that have not yet been
delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee) (collectively, the
" ** _Minimum Condition_** ") and (ii) the satisfaction, or waiver by the
Purchaser (to the extent permitted in _Annex I_ ), of the other conditions and
requirements set forth in _Annex I_. Subject to this _Section 1.1_ and _Annex
I_ , the conditions and requirements to the Offer set forth in _Annex I_ are
for the sole

 



      
 

 



 

benefit of the Purchaser and may be asserted by the Purchaser regardless of
the circumstances giving rise to such condition or may be waived by the
Purchaser, in its sole discretion, in whole or in part at any time and from
time to time.

 



 

(b) Subject to the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction,
or waiver by the Purchaser (to the extent permitted by _Annex I_ ), of the
other conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_ , the Purchaser
shall, and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to, accept for payment and pay all
Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as
promptly as practicable and in any event not more than two Business Days after
the first Expiration Date upon which such conditions are satisfied or waived.
The Offer Price payable in respect of each Share validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid, without interest,
subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law. To the extent
any such amounts are so withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 



 

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " ** _Offer
to Purchase_** ") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer in
accordance with this Agreement, including the Minimum Condition and the other
conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_. The Purchaser expressly
reserves the right to increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes in
the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless
otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or as previously approved by the
Company in writing, the Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price, (ii)
change the form of consideration payable in the Offer (other than adding
consideration), (iii) reduce the maximum number of Shares to be purchased in
the Offer, (iv) amend or waive the Minimum Condition or the conditions set
forth in clause (b) of _Annex I_ , (v) add to or amend any of the other
conditions and requirements to the Offer set forth in _Annex I_ in a manner
that is material and adverse to the holders of Shares, (vi) except as provided
in _Section 1.1(e)_ , extend the Offer or (vii) otherwise amend the Offer in
any manner that is material and adverse to the holder of Shares.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Offer Price
shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Shares), cash dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to the Shares, occurring on or after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Acceptance Time, and such adjustment to the Offer
Price shall provide to the holders of Shares the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action; _provided_ , that nothing
in this sentence shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action
with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

 



 

(d) Unless extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer
shall initially expire at midnight (New York City time) on the date that is 25
Business Days (calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the
Exchange Act) following the commencement of the Offer (within the meaning of
Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) (such date and time, the " ** _Initial
Expiration Date_** ") or, if the Initial Expiration Date has been extended as
required by or otherwise in accordance with this Agreement, the date and time
to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such
later date and time to which the

 



      
 

 



 

Initial Expiration Date has been extended in accordance with this Agreement,
the " ** _Expiration Date_** ").

 



 

(e) If on or prior to any then scheduled Expiration Date, any condition to the
Offer (including the Minimum Condition and the other conditions and
requirements set forth in _Annex I_ ) has not been satisfied, or, where
permitted by applicable Law and this Agreement, waived by the Purchaser, the
Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to), extend the Offer on
one or more occasions, for successive periods of up to 20 Business Days each,
the length of each such period (subject to such 20 Business Day maximum) to be
determined by Parent in its sole discretion, in order to permit the
satisfaction of such conditions. In addition, the Purchaser shall (and Parent
shall cause the Purchaser to) extend the Offer for any period or periods
required by applicable Law or applicable rules, regulations, interpretations
or positions of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the " **
_SEC_** ") or its staff. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Purchaser shall not be required to extend the Offer for any
reason beyond November 23, 2014 (the " ** _Outside Date_** "). Nothing in this
_Section 1.1(e)_ shall be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any
manner the right of Parent or the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _ARTICLE 7_ hereof.

 



 

(f) The Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled
Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _ARTICLE 7_. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _ARTICLE 7_ , the Purchaser shall promptly (and in any
event within 48 hours of such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by the Purchaser,
or this Agreement is terminated prior to the purchase of Shares in the Offer,
the Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause any depositary acting on
behalf of the Purchaser to return, in accordance with applicable Law, all
tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

 



 

(g) As soon as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer, the
Purchaser shall file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3 under the
Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "
** _Schedule TO_** "), which shall include, as exhibits, the Offer to
Purchase, a form of letter of transmittal and a form of summary advertisement
(collectively, together with any amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto,
the " ** _Offer Documents_** "). The Purchaser may, in its sole discretion,
provide guaranteed delivery procedures for the tender of Shares in the Offer.
The Purchaser agrees to cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to
holders of Shares, as and to the extent required by the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and the Purchaser
in writing all information concerning the Company that may be required by
applicable securities Laws or reasonably requested by Parent or the Purchaser
for inclusion in the Offer Documents. The Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided
by it for use in the Offer Documents, if and to the extent that it shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by
applicable Law, and the Purchaser agrees to cause the Offer Documents, as so
corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in
each case as and to the extent required by the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review the Offer Documents before they are filed with the SEC, and the
Purchaser shall give due

 



      
 

 



 

consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Company and its counsel. In addition, the Purchaser shall
provide the Company and its counsel with copies of any written comments, and
shall inform them of any oral comments, that the Purchaser or its counsel may
receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral
responses thereto. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review any such written responses and the Purchaser shall give
due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Company and its counsel.

 



 

1.2 _Company Actions_.

 



 

(a) On the date of the filing of the Schedule TO with the SEC, the Company
shall, in a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, file
with the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and
exhibits thereto, the " ** _Schedule 14D-9_** ") that shall, subject to the
provisions of _Section 5.3(c)_ , contain the Company Board Recommendation. The
Company shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 a notice of appraisal rights in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall also include in the
Schedule 14D-9, and represents that it has obtained all necessary consents of
the Company Financial Advisor to permit the Company to include in the Schedule
14D-9, in its entirety, the Fairness Opinion, together with a summary thereof
in accordance with Item 1015(b) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act
(regardless of whether such item is applicable). The Company hereby approves
and consents to the Offer and hereby approves and consents to the inclusion in
the Offer Documents of a description of the Company Board Recommendation. The
Company further agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to
holders of Shares, as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. To the
extent requested by the Purchaser, the Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9
to be mailed or otherwise disseminated to the holders of Shares together with
the Offer Documents disseminated to the holders of Shares. The Company, on the
one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9, if and to the extent
that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as
otherwise required by applicable Law, and the Company agrees to cause the
Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange
Act. The Purchaser and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company
shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by the Purchaser and its counsel. In addition, the Company
shall provide the Purchaser and its counsel with copies of any written
comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the Company or its
counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written
or oral responses thereto. The Purchaser and its counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses and the Company
shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by the Purchaser and its counsel.

 



 

(b) Promptly after the date hereof and otherwise from time to time as
requested by the Purchaser or its agents, the Company shall furnish or cause
to be furnished to the Purchaser mailing labels, security position listings,
non-objecting beneficial owner lists and

 



   

     
 

 



 

any other listings or computer files containing the names and addresses of the
record or beneficial holders of the Shares as of the most recent practicable
date, and shall promptly furnish the Purchaser with such information
(including updated lists of holders of the Shares and their addresses, mailing
labels, security position listings and non-objecting beneficial owner lists)
and such other assistance as the Purchaser or its agents may reasonably
request in communicating with the record and beneficial holders of Shares. In
addition, in connection with the Offer, the Company shall, and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any Third Parties to, cooperate with
the Purchaser to disseminate the Offer Documents to holders of Shares held in

 **ARTICLE II 
CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER**

Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Purchaser, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

 



 

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and any Dissenting Shares, shall be converted
into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price (the " **
_Merger Consideration_** "), without interest, subject to any withholding of
Taxes required by applicable Law, upon surrender of the certificate formerly
representing such Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2_.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All Shares that
are held in the treasury of the Company, and all Shares owned of record by
Parent or any of its direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries, including
the Purchaser, shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, with
no payment being made in exchange therefor (other than Shares owned by wholly-
owned Subsidiaries of the Company, each of which shall remain outstanding and
be converted into one newly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation).

 



 

(c) _Purchaser Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Purchaser (the " ** _Purchaser Common Stock_** ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one newly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall
designate a reputable bank or trust company to act as the paying agent for
purposes of effecting the payment and distribution of the Merger Consideration
in connection with the Merger (the " ** _Paying Agent_** "). At or promptly
after the Effective Time (and, in any event, on the Closing Date), the
Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, cash
in an amount sufficient to make all payments pursuant to this _ARTICLE 2_ to
which holders of Shares shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to
this Agreement. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed
by the Purchaser, in its sole discretion, pending payment thereof by the
Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares. Earnings from such investments
shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Purchaser, and no part of such
earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Shares.

 



 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, but in no event later than 5 Business Days thereafter, the Surviving
Corporation shall

 



      
 

 



 

cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates that represented Shares (the " ** _Certificates_** ") or non-
certificated Shares represented by book-entry (" ** _Book-Entry Shares_** "),
in each case, which Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter
of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form and have
such other provisions as the Purchaser or the Paying Agent may reasonably
specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Paying
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the Purchaser,
and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper
form, with respect to such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the holder of
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificates and for
each Book-Entry Share and the Paying Agent shall deliver the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive within 5 Business Days.
Any Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is registered,
it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of
the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not
required to be paid. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-
Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry
Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
as contemplated by this Agreement, without interest thereon.

 



 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records
of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise
provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any time
following six months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any cash funds
(including any interest received with respect thereto) made available to the
Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares and compliance with the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_ , without
interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law.
If, immediately

 



      
 

 



 

prior to the six year anniversary of the Effective Time (or otherwise
immediately prior to such time on which any payment in respect hereof would
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), any holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares has not complied with the procedures in
_Section 2.2(b)_ to receive payment of the Merger Consideration to which such
holder would otherwise be entitled, the payment in respect of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be
liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts that Parent, the
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
other provision of applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

 



 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ hereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser may, in its sole discretion and as
a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the
owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in
such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

 



 

(g) _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, stamp, documentary and similar Taxes
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
herein shall be the responsibility of the holders of the Shares, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



 

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, no shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and in respect of which appraisal
rights shall have been perfected in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL in
connection with the Merger (collectively, " ** _Dissenting Shares_** ") shall
be converted into a right to receive that portion of the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable to the holder of such Dissenting Shares as provided in
_Section 2.1(a)_ , but shall instead be converted into the right to receive
such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such
Dissenting Shares pursuant to the DGCL. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who,
pursuant to the provisions of the DGCL, becomes entitled to payment of the
fair value of such shares shall receive payment therefor in accordance with
the DGCL (but only after the value therefor shall have been agreed upon or
finally determined pursuant to the DGCL). In the event that any holder of
Company Common Stock fails to make an effective demand for payment or fails to
perfect its appraisal rights as to its shares of Company Common

 



      
 

 



 

Stock or any Dissenting Shares shall otherwise lose their status as Dissenting
Shares, then any such shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ in respect of such
shares as if such shares had never been Dissenting Shares, in accordance with
and following the satisfaction of the applicable requirements and conditions
set forth in _Section 2.2_. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice (and
in no event more than two Business Days) of (i) any demand received by the
Company for appraisal of Company Common Stock (and shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
any such demand) or (ii) any notice of exercise by any holder of Company
Common Stock of appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL. The Company
agrees that, except with Parents prior written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), it shall not voluntarily make
any payment or offer to make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer
to settle, any such demand for appraisal or exercise of appraisal rights.

 



 

2.4 _Treatment of Company Options and Company RSUs_.

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase Shares (each, a " **
_Company Option_** ") granted under each stock option or other equity plan of
the Company (each, a " ** _Company Stock Plan_** ") shall be cancelled and, in
exchange therefor, each former holder of any such cancelled Company Option
shall be entitled to receive from the Company, in consideration of the
cancellation of such Company Option and in settlement therefor, a payment in
cash (subject to all applicable withholding or other Taxes required by
applicable Law) of an amount equal to the product of (i) the total number of
Shares(whether vested or unvested) subject to such Company Option immediately
prior to such cancellation and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per Share subject to such Company Option
immediately prior to such cancellation (such amounts payable hereunder being
referred to as the " ** _Option Payments_** "); _provided_ , _however_ , that
Option Payments with respect to any of the Company Options identified on
_Section 2.4(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be subject to the
applicable agreement entered into by the holder of such Company Options and
the Company (in such form as previously approved by Parent) on or prior to the
date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, to
the extent the per share exercise price for the shares of Company Common Stock
that would have been issuable upon exercise of such Company Option is greater
than or equal to the Merger Consideration, the Company Option shall be
terminated and cancelled at the Effective Time and no Option Payment shall be
made. From and after the Effective Time, any such cancelled Company Option
shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only
entitle such holder to the payment of the Option Payment, if any. The Option
Payments shall be paid by Parent or the Surviving Corporation as soon as
practicable (and in any event within 15 Business Days) following the Effective
Time, without interest; _provided_ , _however_ , that Option Payments with
respect to any of the Company Options identified on _Section 2.4(a)_ of the of
the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be paid to the holder of such Company
Options in accordance with the agreement entered into by such holder and the
Company (in such form as previously approved by Parent) on or prior to the
date hereof.

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Company RSUs_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
restricted stock unit representing a right to receive a Share (each, a " **
_Company RSU_** ")

 



      
 

 



 

granted under a Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each former
holder of any such cancelled Company RSU shall be entitled to receive from the
Company, in consideration of the cancellation of such Company RSU and in
settlement therefor, a payment in cash (subject to all applicable withholding
or other Taxes required by applicable Law) of an amount equal to the product
of (i) the total number of Shares subject to such Company RSU immediately
prior to such cancellation and (ii) the Merger Consideration (such amounts
payable hereunder being referred to as the " ** _RSU Payments_** ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to each Company RSU, (A) one-half
of the RSU Payments, without interest, shall be paid to the holder of such
Company RSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time on the one-year
anniversary of the Closing Date and (B) the remaining one-half of the RSU
Payments, without interest, shall be paid to the holder of such Company RSU as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time on the two-year anniversary of the
Closing Date, in each case subject to such holders continued employment with
the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries on each applicable payment date;
_provided_ , _further_ , that if such holders employment with the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries is terminated by the Surviving Corporation or
one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, without Cause (as defined in _Section
2.4(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule) or due to such holders death or
permanent disability (each, a " ** _Qualifying Termination_** "), the
remaining unpaid portion of the RSU Payments shall be paid to such holder as
described in the immediately succeeding sentence on the first payroll date
following the date of such Qualifying Termination.. From and after the
Effective Time, any such cancelled Company RSU shall no longer represent the
right to receive a Share by a holder thereof, but shall only entitle such
holder to the payment of the RSU Payment.

 



 

(c) _Miscellaneous_. The Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, take (or
cause to be taken) any and all action, and shall obtain all such consents, as
may be necessary to effect the foregoing provisions of this _Section 2.4_ ,
including by amending the applicable Company Stock Plans as set forth on
_Section 2.4(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, have been duly and validly authorized by
all necessary corporate action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part
of the Company and no stockholder votes or consents are necessary to authorize
this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (other
than, with respect to the Merger, the filing of the Certificate of Merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL).
The Company Board, by resolutions duly adopted by unanimous vote of those
voting on such matters at a meeting duly called and held, has, and as of the
date of this Agreement not subsequently rescinded or modified in any way, (x)
determined that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the

(z) resolved to recommend that the Companys stockholders accept the Offer,
tender their Shares to the Purchaser in the Offer and, to the extent
applicable, adopt this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly authorized and
validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by Parent and the Purchaser, constitutes a legally
valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company
in accordance with its terms (except as such enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,

Agreement. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set
forth in _Section 4.10_ , no other "moratorium," "fair price," "business
combination," "combinations with interested stockholders," "control share

the Effective Time will be, applicable to the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement, the Offer and/or the Merger, including the
acquisition of Shares pursuant thereto, the Tender Agreements and/or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(c) The affirmative vote of the holders of shares representing a majority of
the voting power of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock is the
only vote required of the holders of any class or series of capital stock or
other Equity Interests of the Company, absent Section 251(h) of the DGCL, to
approve adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, and to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

Agreement by the Company, the acceptance for payment or acquisition of Shares
pursuant to the Offer, the consummation by the Company of the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or the Companys compliance
with any of the provisions of this Agreement will (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both): (a) conflict with or violate any provision of the
Company Charter or Company Bylaws or any equivalent organizational or
governing documents of any Company Subsidiary, (b) assuming that all consents,
approvals, authorizations and permits described in _Section 3.5_ have been
obtained and all filings and notifications described in _Section 3.5_ have
been made and any waiting periods thereunder have terminated or expired,
violate any Law applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of
their respective properties or assets or (c) require any consent or approval
under, violate, result in any breach of or any loss of any benefit under, or
constitute a default under, or result in termination or give to others any
right of termination, vesting, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or
result in the creation of a Lien upon any of the respective properties or
assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to, any Contract,
Company Permit or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is a party or by which they or any of their respective
properties or assets may be bound or affected, except, with respect to clauses
(b) and (c), for any such conflicts, violations, consents, breaches, losses,
defaults, other occurrences or Liens which, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Company, the acceptance for payment or acquisition of Shares pursuant to the
Offer, the consummation by the Company of the Merger or any other transaction

2011, in the case of any pending claim, has been questioned or disputed by the
underwriters of such Insurance Policies. None of the Insurance Policies will

reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

3.21 _Properties and Assets_. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have,
and immediately following the Effective Time will continue to have, good and
valid title to their owned assets and properties, or in the case of assets and
properties they lease, license, or have other rights in, good and valid rights
by lease, license or other agreement to use, all assets and properties (in
each case, tangible and intangible) (i) necessary and desirable to permit the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to conduct their businesses in all
material respects as currently conducted and (ii) free and clear of all Liens
other than Permitted Liens. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood
and agreed that matters regarding Company Intellectual Property are addressed

3.22 _Real Property_.

 



 

(a) (i) The Company and each Company Subsidiary has good and marketable fee
simple title to all of its Owned Real Property (as defined below), and valid

each case free and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted Liens.

 



 

(b) _Section 3.22(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete
and correct list of all real property and interests in real property currently
owned by the Company or any Company Subsidiary (each, an " ** _Owned Real
Property_** "). _Section 3.22(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets

subleased or otherwise occupied by the Company or any Company Subsidiary

applicable, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, of the other party or
parties thereto, and are in full force and effect, without penalty,
acceleration, termination, default, breach, repurchase right or other adverse
consequence on account of the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company has provided
Parent with true, correct, accurate and complete copies of each Lease
Agreement, and each Lease Agreement represents the entire agreement between
the Company or any Company Subsidiary and the counterparty thereto. Except for
Permitted Liens, no Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property is subject to
any Lien or agreement granting to any Third Party any interest in such Owned
Real Property or Leased Real Property or any right to the use or occupancy of
any Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property. The Company and each Company
Subsidiary has performed all material obligations required to be performed by
it to date under each Lease Agreement, and there are no outstanding defaults
or circumstances which, upon the giving of notice or passage of time or both,
would constitute a default or breach by any party under any Lease Agreement.

 



 

(c) The Owned Real Property and the Leased Real Property constitute all real
property currently used in connection with the business of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and which are necessary for the continued operation of
the business as the business is currently conducted. Except as would not
materially affect the ability of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, to operate their business as currently conducted, there are
no structural, electrical, mechanical or other defects in any improvements
located on any of the Owned Real Property or the Leased Real Property. Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received written notice of any
pending, and to the Knowledge of the Company there is no threatened,
condemnation proceeding with respect to any of the Owned Real Property or the
Leased Real Property. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
received written notice of, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, oral notice
of, any zoning, ordinance, building, land use, fire or health code or other
legal violation affecting such Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property.

 



 

(d) Each Owned Real Property and Leased Real Property and the improvements
located thereon are supplied with utilities and other services necessary for
the

 



      
 

 



 

operation of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as
applicable, at such Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property and
improvements, including gas, electricity, water, telephone, sanitary sewer and
storm sewer, all of which services are adequate in accordance with all
applicable laws and are provided via public roads or via permanent,
irrevocable, appurtenant easements benefitting such Owned Real Property or
Leased Real Property.

 



 

(e) The Company has delivered to Parent correct and complete copies of all
surveys of, and title insurance policies with respect to, each Owned Real
Property and Leased Real Property in such Partys possession or reasonably
available to such Party, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no
material changes in the facts depicted in such surveys or reflected on such
title insurance policies.

written opinion (the " ** _Fairness Opinion_** ") of Deutsche Bank Securities

Securities Act or Exchange Act, as the case may be, together with all
certifications required pursuant to the Sarbanes Oxley Act (such documents and

each case filed on or after December 20, 2013 and prior to the date hereof,
and only to the extent reasonably apparent from the disclosure therein (but

other disclosures included therein to the extent they are primarily
predictive, cautionary or forward looking in nature and (B) information
included in, or incorporated by reference as, exhibits and schedules to any
Avago SEC Documents that have been filed with the SEC) and (ii) as set forth
in the disclosure schedule delivered by Parent to the Company prior to the

identifies items of disclosure by reference to a particular Section or
Subsection of this Agreement ( _provided_ , _however_ , that any disclosure
made in the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed with
respect to any section of this Agreement to the extent the relevance of such
disclosure to any such representation or warranty is reasonably apparent from
the text of such disclosure), Parent and the Purchaser hereby represent and
warrant to the Company as follows:

 



 

4.1 _Organization and Qualification_. Each of Parent and the Purchaser is an
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of
its jurisdiction of incorporation and has all requisite organizational power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry
on its business as currently conducted. Each of Parent and the Purchaser is
duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
where the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or assets or the
conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure
to be so qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate,
would not materially impair the ability of Parent and the Purchaser to
consummate, or prevent or materially delay, the Offer, Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

4.2 _Authority_.

 



 

(a) Each of Parent and the Purchaser has all necessary organizational power

obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,

consummation by Parent and the Purchaser of the transactions contemplated

authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
other than, with respect to the Merger, the filing of the Certificate of
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with
the DGCL. This Agreement has been duly authorized and validly executed and
delivered by Parent and the Purchaser, and, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes a legally valid and binding
obligation of Parent and the Purchaser, enforceable against Parent and the
Purchaser in accordance with its terms (except as such enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws affecting creditors rights
generally and subject to the effect of general principles of equity, whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

 



 

(b) Further to _Section 4.2(a)_ , no vote or consent of the holders of any
class or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary or required (including
under the NASDAQ rules, the amended and restated certificate of incorporation
or bylaws of Parent or applicable Law) to approve this Agreement or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger. The vote
or consent of Parent as the sole stockholder of the Purchaser (which shall
have occurred prior to the Effective Time) is the only vote or consent of the
holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Purchaser necessary to
approve this Agreement or the other transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger.

Agreement, or compliance by Parent and the Purchaser with any of the
provisions of this Agreement will (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both): (a) conflict with or violate any provision of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Parent and the Purchaser; (b) assuming that all
consents, approvals, authorizations and permits described in _Section 4.4_
have been obtained and all filings and notifications described in _Section
4.4_ have been made and any waiting periods thereunder have terminated or
expired, violate any Law applicable to Parent and the Purchaser or any other
Subsidiary of Parent (each a " ** _Parent Subsidiary_** ") or any of their
respective properties or assets or (c) require any consent or approval under,
violate, result in any breach of or any loss of any benefit under, or
constitute a default under, or result in termination or give to others any
right of termination, vesting, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or
result in the creation of a Lien upon any of the respective properties or
assets of Parent or the Purchaser or any Parent Subsidiary pursuant to any
Contract or permit to which Parent or the Purchaser or any Parent Subsidiary
is a party or by which they or any of their respective properties or assets
may be bound or affected, except, with respect to clauses (b) and (c), for any
such conflicts, violations, consents, breaches, losses, defaults, other
occurrences or Liens which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
materially impair the ability of Parent and the Purchaser to consummate, or
prevent or materially delay, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

4.4 _Required Filings and Consents_. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company in _Section 3.5_ , none of the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by Parent and the
Purchaser, the acceptance for payment or acquisition of Shares

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to the Offer, the consummation by Parent and the Purchaser of the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or compliance
by Parent or the Purchaser with any of the provisions of this Agreement will
require (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) any consent,
approval, authorization or permit of, or filing or registration with or
notification to, any Governmental Authority or any other Person, other than

or in the aggregate, would not materially impair the ability of Parent and the
Purchaser to consummate, or prevent or materially delay, the Offer, the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

4.5 _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no Order or Action pending,
or to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing against Parent or the
Purchaser or their respective assets or properties, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, materially impair the ability of Parent or
the Purchaser to consummate, or prevent or materially delay, the Offer, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

4.6 _Information in the Schedule 14D-9_. The information supplied by Parent
and the Purchaser in writing expressly for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Schedule 14D-9 (and any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto) will not, at the date mailed to the Companys stockholders, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements

material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and any other
applicable federal securities Laws.

any of the foregoing.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(b)_ or

that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a
breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company and its

Agreement, information (including non-public

that the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) provide to
Parent any material non-public information concerning the Company or any
Company Subsidiary that is provided to any Person given such access which was
not previously provided to Parent or its Representatives and (B) engage in or
otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person or group

terms and conditions thereof and of any modification thereto), and any
material developments, discussions and negotiations, including furnishing
copies of any revised written proposals or offers relating thereto. Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary will enter into any confidentiality
agreement with any Person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the
Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with this
_Section 5.3_.

 



 

(e) From and after the date of this Agreement, except as expressly permitted
by this _Section 5.3(e)_ and subject in all respects to _Section 5.3(f),_

withdraw, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or the Purchaser, the Company
Board Recommendation, (ii) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in
the Schedule 14D-9, (iii) if a tender offer or exchange offer for shares of

commenced, fail to publicly recommend against acceptance of such tender offer

respect to the acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the
stockholders of the Company, shall constitute a failure to recommend against
acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer) within 10 Business Days

Recommendation within four Business Days after Parent so requests in writing (
_provided_ , that Parent shall be not be entitled to request such

Recommendation Change_** ") or (v) cause or permit the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set

 



      
 

 



 

forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company
Board shall be permitted to effect any Adverse Recommendation Change (x)
described in clause (i) of such definition or otherwise terminate this
Agreement to concurrently enter into a definitive Alternative Acquisition
Agreement, in each case solely, under this clause (x), with respect to a
Superior Proposal, subject in each case to compliance with _Section 5.3(f)_
and the concurrent payment of any amount owed Parent pursuant to _Section
7.2_, if the Company Board (A) has received a bona fide written Competing
Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, constitutes
a Superior Proposal, after having complied with, and giving effect to all of
the adjustments which may be offered by Parent and the Purchaser pursuant to
_Section 5.3(f)_ and (B) determines in good faith, after consultation with
its legal advisors, that failure to take such action would be reasonably
likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or
(y) in response to a material development or change in circumstances (that is
not a Competing Inquiry or Competing Proposal) and that was not known to the
Company Board as of the date of this Agreement (an " ** _Intervening Event_**
") if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
legal advisors, that failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would be
reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Company Board may not make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event unless the Company
(A) provides Parent with a written description of such Intervening Event in
reasonable detail, (B) keeps Parent reasonably informed of material
developments with respect to such Intervening Event, (C) notifies Parent in
writing at least four Business Days before making an Adverse Recommendation
Change with respect to such Intervening Event of its intention to do so and
specifying the reasons therefor and (D) prior to the expiration of such four
Business Day period, Parent does not make a bona fide proposal to amend the
terms of this Agreement that the Company Board determines in good faith would
obviate the need to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(f) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company Board shall not be
entitled to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement, in each case, with respect to a Superior Proposal unless (i) none
of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their Representatives has
breached this _Section 5.3_ in any respect as relates to such Superior
Proposal, (ii) the Company has provided written notice (a " ** _Notice of
Superior Proposal_** ") to Parent and the Purchaser that the Company intends
to take such action, which notice includes an unredacted copy of the Superior
Proposal that is the basis of such action (including the identity of the Third
Party making the Superior Proposal) and copies of all relevant documents
relating to such Superior Proposal, (iii) during the four Business Days period
following Parents and the Purchasers receipt of the Notice of Superior
Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause the its Representatives to,
negotiate with Parent and the Purchaser in good faith (to the extent Parent
and the Purchaser desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal would cease to
constitute a Superior Proposal and (iv) following the end of the four Business
Days period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, taking into account any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing
by Parent and the Purchaser in response to the Notice of Superior Proposal or
otherwise, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Superior
Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal. Any amendment to the
financial terms or any other material

 



      
 

 



 

amendment of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior
Proposal and the Company shall be required to comply again with the
requirements of this _Section 5.3(f)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that for
purposes of this sentence, references to the four Business Day period above
shall be deemed to be references to a two Business Day period.

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through their respective
Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders
a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a Third Party
pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any
"stop, look and listen" communication to the Companys stockholders pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act if the Company Board has determined in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to
take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any disclosure permitted under _Section 5.3(g)(i)_ that is not an
express rejection of any applicable Competing Proposal or an express
reaffirmation of the Company Boards recommendation in favor of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed an Adverse
Recommendation Change.

 



 

(h) The Company agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this _Section 5.3_ by any of its Representatives shall be deemed a breach of
this Agreement (including this _Section 5.3_) by the Company.

 



 

5.4 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 



 

(a) The Company and Parent shall use (and cause their respective Subsidiaries
to use) their commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take, or cause to be
taken, all appropriate action and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate
and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly
as practicable, (ii) obtain from any Governmental Authorities any consents,
licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be
obtained by Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or
to avoid any Action or Order by any Governmental Authority, in connection with
the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and
the Merger and (iii) promptly make all necessary filings, and thereafter make
any other required submissions, and pay any fees due in connection therewith,
with respect to this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger required under (A)
the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and any other applicable securities Laws,
(B) the HSR Act and the Foreign Antitrust Laws and (C) any other applicable
Law, if any; _provided_ , that the Company and Parent shall cooperate with
each other in all respects in connection with (x) preparing and filing the
Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 and any other filings made or required to
be made with the SEC in connection with the Offer or the Merger and the
transactions contemplated thereby, (y) making an appropriate filing pursuant
to the HSR Act and the Foreign Antitrust Laws as set forth in _Section
5.4(d)_ and determining whether any other action by or in respect of, or
filing with, any Governmental Authority is required, in connection with the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger and (z) seeking any such actions,
consents, approvals or waivers or timely making any such filings. The Company
and Parent shall furnish to each other all information required for any
application or other filing under the rules and regulations of any applicable
Law in

 



      
 

 



 

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company
and Parent may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate
any competitively sensitive material provided to the other pursuant to this
_Section 5.4_ as "Outside Counsel Only Material."

 



 

(b) The Company and Parent shall give (or shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to give) any notices to Third Parties required to be given by
such Person, and use, and cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any Third Party consents applicable
to the Company or Parent, as the case may be, (i) necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii)
required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, as applicable or (iii) in the case of the Company,
required to prevent a Company Material Adverse Effect from occurring prior to
or after the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company and
Parent shall coordinate and cooperate in determining whether any actions,
consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any
Company Material Contracts in connection with consummation of the Offer or the
Merger and seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers. In the
event that the Company shall fail to obtain any Third Party consent described
in the first sentence of this _Section 5.4(b),_ the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts, and shall take any such actions reasonably
requested by Parent, to minimize any adverse effect upon the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and their respective businesses resulting, or which could
reasonably be expected to result, after the consummation of the Offer or the
Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such consent. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any
approval or consent from any Person with respect to the Offer or the Merger,
(i) without the prior written consent of Parent, none of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary shall pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or
consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any
commitment or incur any liability or other obligation due to such Person and
(ii) neither Parent nor the Purchaser shall be required to pay or commit to
pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or
other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other
obligation due to such Person.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
5.4_, each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of any
request, inquiry, objection, charge or other Action, actual or threatened, by

United States Department of Justice (" ** _DOJ_** ") or any other applicable
Governmental Authority or any Third Party with respect to the Offer, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii)
keep the other parties informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry,
objection, charge or other Action and (iii) promptly inform the other parties
of any communication to or from any Governmental Authority or any Third Party
regarding the Offer or the Merger. Each party hereto will (i) use its
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such request, inquiry,
objection, charge or other Action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in
effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement so as to permit consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) consult and cooperate
with the other parties and consider in good faith the views of the other
parties in connection with any filing, analysis, appearance, presentation,
memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in
connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement (such cooperation shall include consultation with each other in
advance of any meeting or conference with the FTC, the DOJ or any other
Governmental Authority or, in connection with any Action by a Third Party,
with any other Person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such
other applicable Governmental Authority or other Person, providing the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences).

 



 

(d) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
5.4_, each party hereto agrees to: (i) on the date of the commencement of the
Offer, make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant
to the HSR Act (including seeking early termination of the waiting period
under the HSR Act) with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) on the later of (x) the date of the commencement of the Offer
and (y) 10 Business Days following the date of this Agreement, make the
appropriate initial filings pursuant to the Foreign Antitrust Laws with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) supply as
promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act by the FTC or the DOJ
or pursuant to the Foreign Antitrust laws by the applicable Governmental
Authorities and (iv) use its commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause
to be taken all other actions necessary, proper or advisable consistent with
this _Section 5.4_ to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods, or receipt of required authorizations, as applicable, under
the HSR Act and the Foreign Antitrust Laws as soon as practicable. Parent
shall be entitled to direct the antitrust defense of the Offer, the Merger or
any other transactions contemplated thereby, or negotiations with, any
Governmental Authority or other Third Party relating to the Offer, the Merger
or regulatory filings under applicable competition Law, subject to the
provisions of this _Section 5.4_. The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide full and effective support of Parent in all
material respects in all such negotiations and other discussions or actions to
the extent requested by Parent. The Company shall not make any offer,
acceptance or counter-offer to or otherwise engage in negotiations or
discussions with any Governmental Authority with respect to any proposed
settlement, consent decree, commitment or remedy, or, in the event of
litigation, discovery, admissibility of evidence, timing or scheduling, except
as specifically requested by or agreed with Parent. Each party hereto shall
bear its own Expenses in connection with any such filings and actions
contemplated pursuant to this _Section 5.4(d)_. None of Parent, the Purchaser
or the Company shall commit to or agree with any Governmental Authority to
stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or
applicable competition Laws, without the prior written consent of the other
parties. If any request for additional information and documents, including a
"second request" under the HSR Act, is received from any Governmental
Authority then the Parties shall substantially comply with any such request at
the earliest practicable date. If any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental
Authority challenging the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
violative of the HSR Act or any applicable antitrust or competition Law, each
of the Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to, cooperate to contest and resist, except insofar as the
Parent and the Company may otherwise agree, any such action or proceeding,
including any action or proceeding that seeks a temporary restraining order or
preliminary injunction that would prohibit, prevent or restrict consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement
(but subject in all respects to _Section 5.1_), (i) nothing in this _Section
5.4_ shall limit a partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_ARTICLE 7_ hereof and (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Parent,
the Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates to agree to (and none of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall, without the prior written consent
of Parent): (A) sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of all or a portion
of its respective business, assets or properties, or conduct its business in a
specified manner, (B) pay any amounts (other than the payment of filing fees
and expenses and fees of counsel), or grant any counterparty to any Contract
any material accommodation, (C) limit in any manner whatsoever the ability of
such entities to conduct, own, operate or control any of their respective
businesses, assets or properties or of the businesses, properties or assets of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or (D) waive any of the conditions
set forth in _Annex I_ of this Agreement.

 



 

(f) Parent and the Purchaser agree that, between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Purchaser shall not, and shall
ensure that none of their Subsidiaries or other Affiliates shall, take any
action or propose, announce an intention or agree, in writing or otherwise, to
take any action that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or
prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

5.5 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, each party hereto shall promptly notify the other party hereto
of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that would be likely to
cause any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Offer, the
Merger, or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement not to be
satisfied or (b) the failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which would reasonably be
expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any party to effect
the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement
not to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this _Section 5.5_ shall not cure any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or
otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice.

 



 

5.6 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby shall be a joint release mutually agreed upon by the Company and
Parent. Thereafter, none of the parties shall (and each of the parties shall
cause its Representatives and Affiliates, if applicable, not to) issue any
press release or make any public announcement concerning this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby without
obtaining the prior written consent of (a) the Company, in the event the
disclosing party is Parent, the Purchaser, any of its Affiliates or
Representatives or (b) Parent, in the event the disclosing party is the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their Representatives, in each case,
with such consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if a party determines in good faith and
based upon advice of counsel, that a press release or public announcement is
required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable stock
exchange, such party may make such press release or public announcement, in
which case the disclosing party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to provide the other parties reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance, (ii) this _Section 5.6_ shall

 



      
 

 



 

terminate upon an Adverse Recommendation Change and (iii) each of the parties
may make public statements in response to specific questions by the press,
analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or financial
analyst conference calls, so long as any such statements are not materially
inconsistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made jointly by Parent and the Company and do not reveal material,
non-public information regarding the other parties, the Offer, the Merger or
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

5.7 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 



 

(a) Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree that all rights of
indemnification, exculpation and limitation of liabilities existing in favor
of past and present directors and officers of the Company as provided in the
Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or under any indemnification, employment
or other similar Contracts between such past and present directors and
officers of the Company and the Company, in each case as in effect on the date
of this Agreement with respect to acts or omissions in their capacity as
directors or officers occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and the
Company represents and warrants that any such indemnification, employment and
other similar Contracts entered into on or after January 1, 2011 are set forth
on _Section 5.7(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule) shall survive the
Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
respective terms (unless otherwise required by applicable Law). From and after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to pay and
perform in a timely manner such indemnification obligations. Subject to
_Section 5.7(c)_, for a period of six years from and after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, exculpation, and advancement of expenses of directors and
officers of the Company for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are
currently set forth in the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws (unless
otherwise required by applicable Law).

 



 

(b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain for the benefit of the Companys directors and
officers, as of the Effective Time, an insurance and indemnification policy
that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the "
** _D andO Insurance_**") that is substantially equivalent to and in any event
not less favorable in the aggregate than the Companys existing policy
(accurate and complete copies of which have been previously provided to
Parent) or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the
best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO
Insurance in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date
of this Agreement, which premium the Company represents and warrants to be as
set forth on _Section 5.7(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The
provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been
satisfied if prepaid policies are obtained by Parent prior to the Effective
Time, which policies provide such directors and officers with substantially
equivalent coverage for an aggregate period of six years with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective
Time, including in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policies in full force and effect,
and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving
Company (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or
surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may
be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.7_.

 



 

(d) The obligations under this _Section 5.7_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect in any material respect any
indemnitee to whom this _Section 5.7_ applies without the consent of such
affected indemnitee, subject to applicable Law (it being expressly agreed that
the indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.7_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 5.7_).

 



 

5.8 _State Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Statute becomes or is deemed to be
applicable to the Company, Parent, the Purchaser or any Affiliate of Parent,
the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, the Offer or the
Merger, including the acquisition of Shares pursuant thereto, the Tender
Agreements or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then the
Company Board shall take all action necessary to render such Law inapplicable
to the foregoing.

 



 

5.9 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take
all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Company equity
securities (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common
Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

 



 

5.10 _Employees and Employee Benefit Plan Matters_.

 



 

(a) For a period of twelve months following the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to those employees of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries who continue to be employed by the Parent and Parent
Subsidiaries (individually, " ** _Company Employee_** " and collectively, " **
_Company Employees_** ") (i) annual base salary or base wages and short-term
incentive compensation opportunities and (ii) benefits (including severance
benefits) that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the benefits
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and levels of benefits
(but not benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan or vesting under any
equity incentive plan) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries in which Company Employees first become eligible to
participate after the Effective Time (including any Company Employee Plans)
(the " ** _New Plans_** "), each Company Employee shall be credited with his
or her years of service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and
their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as
such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for
such service under any similar Company Employee Plan in which such Company
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent

 



      
 

 



 

that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to
the same period of service. In addition, Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause (i) each Company Employee to be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans,
and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents,
to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived under the comparable
Company Employee Plans in which such Company Employee participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred
by any Company Employee and his or her covered dependents during the plan year
that includes the Effective Time to be taken into account for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents under
any New Plan (to the extent such amounts would have been taken into account
for such requirements under any comparable Company Employee Plan prior to the
Effective Time).

 



 

(c) Effective as of the day immediately preceding the date that the Purchaser
and the Company become part of the same controlled group pursuant to Sections
414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (the " ** _Controlled Group Date_** "),
unless otherwise directed in writing by Parent at least ten Business Days
prior to the Controlled Group Date, the Company shall take or cause to be
taken all actions necessary to effect the termination of any and all Company
Employee Plans intended to qualify as qualified cash or deferred arrangements
under Section 401(k) of the Code (each, a " ** _401(k) Plan_**"). The Company
shall provide Parent with evidence that each such 401(k) Plan has been
terminated pursuant to an action by the Company Board.

 



 

(d) The Company shall take such action as may be necessary under the Companys
Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the " ** _ESOP_** ") to terminate the ESOP
effective as of the day immediately preceding the Controlled Group Date. The
Company shall make the final contribution to the ESOP immediately after the
date of this Agreement and shall not make any additional contributions to the
ESOP thereafter. The Company shall provide timely notice of termination of the
ESOP in accordance with the terms of the ESOP.

 



 

5.11 _Rule 14d-10(d) Matters_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall cause the compensation committee of the Company Board to
be, at all times from and after the date of this Agreement until the first
date on which the Parents designees constitute a majority of the Company
Board pursuant to _Section 1.3_, composed solely of "independent directors"
within the meaning of Rule 14d- 10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the
instructions thereto. In furtherance of the foregoing, to the extent
necessary, the Company Board shall, at a meeting duly called and held,
determine that each of the members of the Compensation Committee of the
Company Board is an "independent director." Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company (acting through a compensation committee of the Company Board or its
independent directors), shall take all steps that may be necessary or
advisable to cause each Company Compensation Arrangement and each Parent
Compensation Arrangement with any of its directors, officers or employees to
be approved as an Employment Compensation Arrangement, and shall take all
other action necessary to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe-
harbor with respect to such Company Compensation Arrangements and

 



       
 

 



 

Parent Compensation Arrangements in accordance to Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the
Exchange Act; _provided_ , that the Company shall deliver to Parent drafts of
all calculations, resolutions, consents, disclosures and other documents
prepared in connection with the actions required under this _Section
5.11(a)_, and provide 10 Business Days for Parents review and comment on all
such calculations, resolutions, consents, disclosures and other documents (and
the Companys acceptance of Parents reasonable comments shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). For purposes of this
Agreement, " ** _Parent Compensation Arrangement_** " means (i) any employment
agreement, severance agreement or change of control agreement between Avago
Technologies Limited, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and any holder of Shares who is or was a director, officer or
employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on the other hand, (ii) any
Company Options or Company RSUs awarded to, or any acceleration of vesting of
any Company Options or Company RSUs held by, any holder of Shares who is or
was a director, officer or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
and (iii) other Employment Compensation Arrangements entered into or proposed
to be entered into between Avago Technologies Limited, Parent or any of their
respective direct or indirect Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on
the other hand.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall, from and after the date hereof and
until the Effective Time, enter into, establish, amend or modify any plan,
program or Contract pursuant to which compensation is paid or payable, or
pursuant to which benefits are provided, in each case to any current or former
director, manager, officer, employee or independent contractor of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary unless, prior to such entry into, establishment,
amendment or modification, the Compensation Committee (each member of which
the Company Board determined is an "independent director" within the meaning
of Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ rules and shall be an "independent
director" in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the
Exchange Act at the time of any such action) shall have taken all such steps
as may reasonably be necessary to (i) approve as an Employment Compensation
Arrangement each such plan, program or Contract and (ii) satisfy the
requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under
the Exchange Act with respect to such plan, program or Contract; _provided_ ,
that nothing in this _Section 5.11_ shall be construed to permit the Company
to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement.

 



 

5.12 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall control, and the Company
shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense of, any Action
brought by stockholders of the Company against the Company and/or its
directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Offer and the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to
compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding any Action arising or
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or consent to
the same without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

5.13 _NASDAQ Matters_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate
with Parent and use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary,
proper or advisable on its part under applicable

 



      
 

 



 

Laws and rules and policies of NASDAQ to cause the delisting of the Company
and of the Company Common Stock from NASDAQ as promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time and the deregistration of the Common Stock under the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting.

 



 

5.14 _Obligations of the Purchaser_. Parent will take all actions necessary to
cause the Purchaser to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the Offer and the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement.

 



 

5.15 _FIRPTA Certificate_. At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall
deliver to the Purchaser or Parent an affidavit that meets the requirements of
Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1445-2(c)(3) and 1.897-2(h), dated as of the
Closing Date and in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent.

 



 

5.16 _Treatment of Certain Indebtedness_. Simultaneously with the Acceptance
Time, the Company shall repay or cause to be repaid, any outstanding
Obligations (as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement) as directed by the
Bank (as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement). In connection therewith,
the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, deliver all notices
and to take all other actions to facilitate and cause the termination of the
Loan and Security Agreement effective as of the Acceptance Time, the repayment
in full of all Obligations (as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement)
then outstanding thereunder and the release of any liens and termination of
all guarantees in connection therewith as of the Acceptance Time; _provided_ ,
that in no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pay, or commit
to pay, any amounts (other than the payment of any then outstanding
Obligations (as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement), customary filing
fees and reasonable and documented attorneys fees) or grant the Bank (as
defined in the Loan and Security Agreement) any concession or accommodation,
in each case, without the prior written consent of Parent. The Company shall
deliver to Parent (i) a copy of a payoff letter, in customary form (and in any
event, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent), from the Bank
(as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement) under the Loan and Security
Agreement no later than three Business Days prior to the Acceptance Time and
(ii) a duly executed copy of such payoff letter from the Bank immediately
prior to the Acceptance Time.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI 
CONDITIONS TO CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER**

 



 

6.1 _Conditions to Obligations of Each Party Under This Agreement_. The
respective obligations of each party to consummate the Merger shall be subject
to the satisfaction at or prior to the Effective Time of each of the following
conditions:

 



 

(a) The Purchaser shall have accepted for payment, or caused to be accepted
for payment, all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer.

 



 

(b) There shall not be any Law or Order enacted, entered, enforced,
promulgated or which is deemed applicable pursuant to an authoritative
interpretation by or on behalf of a Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction with respect to the Merger which

 



      
 

 



 

would reasonably expected to result in any of the consequences referred to in
clauses (A) through (C) of paragraph (c)(i) of _Annex I_.

 



 

6.2 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. None of the Company, Parent or the
Purchaser may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in this _ARTICLE
6_ to be satisfied if such failure was primarily caused by or primarily
resulted from such partys breach of this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII 
TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER**

 



 

7.1 _Termination_. Subject to _Sections 1.3(c)_ and _1.3(d)_ , this Agreement
may be terminated, and the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby may be abandoned by action taken or authorized by the

party or parties, whether before or after approval of the Merger by the
stockholders of the Company:

 



 

(a) By mutual written consent of Parent and the Company at any time prior to
the Effective Time;

 



 

(b) By either the Company or Parent, if the Offer (as it may have been
extended pursuant to _Section 1.1_) expires on or after the Outside Date as a
result of the non-satisfaction of any condition or requirement of the Offer
set forth in _Annex I_ or is terminated or withdrawn pursuant to its terms
without any Shares being purchased thereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the right to terminate the Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)_ shall
not be available to any party whose breach of this Agreement has been the
primary cause of or primarily resulted in the failure or the non-satisfaction
of any condition or requirement of the Offer set forth in _Annex I_ or the
termination or withdrawal of the Offer pursuant to its terms without any
Shares being purchased thereunder;

 



 

(c) By either the Company or Parent, if any court or other Governmental

or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting (i) prior to the Acceptance Time, the acceptance for payment of,
or payment for, Shares pursuant to the Offer or (ii) prior to the Effective
Time, the Merger, and such Order or other action shall have become final and
non-appealable (which Order or other action the party seeking to terminate
this Agreement shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts to resist,
resolve or lift, as applicable, subject to the provisions of _Section 5.4_);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section 7.1(c)_ shall not be available to any party if the issuance

(d) By Parent, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if (i) an Adverse
Recommendation Change shall have occurred (whether or not in compliance with

extent required pursuant to _Section 5.3(e)(iii)_ or (v) the Company or the
Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall authorize or publicly propose
to do any of the foregoing;

 



 

(e) By the Company, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if the Company
Board determines to enter into a definitive written Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, but only if the Company shall
have complied in all respects with its obligations under _Section 5.3_ with
respect to such Superior Proposal (and any Competing Proposal that was a
precursor thereto) and is otherwise permitted to accept such Superior Proposal
pursuant to _Section 5.3(e)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall
simultaneously with such termination enter into the Alternative Acquisition
Agreement and pay the Breakup Fee to Parent pursuant to _Section 7.2_;

 



 

(f) By Parent, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if: (i) there shall be
an Uncured Inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of the Company
contained in this Agreement or breach of any covenant of the Company contained

likely to be satisfied, (ii) Parent shall have delivered to the Company
written notice of such Uncured Inaccuracy or breach and (iii) either such

days shall have elapsed since the date of delivery of such written notice to
the Company and such Uncured Inaccuracy or breach shall not have been cured;

 



 

(g) By the Company, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if: (i) there

the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) the Company shall
have delivered to Parent written notice of such Uncured Inaccuracy or breach;
and (iii) either such Uncured Inaccuracy or breach is not capable of cure or
at least 20 calendar days shall have elapsed since the date of delivery of
such written notice to Parent and such Uncured Inaccuracy or breach shall not
have been cured;

 



 

(h) By Parent, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if there has been a
Company Material Adverse Effect since the date hereof and the same is
continuing;

 



 

(i) By the Company at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if the Purchaser
shall fail to accept for payment and pay for Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn in the Offer subject to the terms of and in accordance with _Section

forth on _Annex I_ are satisfied or have been waived.

 



      
 

 



 

7.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or
Parent as provided in _Section 7.1_, this Agreement shall become void and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, the Purchaser
or the Company or their respective Subsidiaries, officers or directors except
(i) with respect to _Section 5.2(b)_, _Section 5.6_, this _Section 7.2_ and
_ARTICLE 8_, each of which shall remain in full force and effect and (ii)
with respect to any liabilities or damages incurred or suffered as a result of
the intentional and material breach by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent
or the Purchaser, on the other hand, of any of their respective
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) Parent and the Company agree that if this Agreement is terminated by
Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(i)_ (but only with respect
to an Adverse Recommendation Change arising in connection with a Superior
Proposal), _Sections 7.1(d)(ii)_  _(v)_ or _Section 7.1(e)_, then the
Company shall pay to Parent immediately prior to such termination, in the case
of a termination by the Company, or within two Business Days thereafter, in
the case of a termination by Parent, a termination fee equal to $10,850,000
(the " ** _Breakup Fee_** "); _provided_ , _however_ , that such termination
shall not be effective until the Company pays the Breakup Fee.

 



 

(c) Parent and the Company agree that if this Agreement is terminated by
Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ (by reason of a failure of
the Minimum Condition or any of the conditions of the Offer specified in
paragraphs (c)(iv) or (c)(vi) (to the extent the same relates to a matter
under paragraph (c)(iv)) of _Annex I_ ) or _Section 7.1(f)_ (to the extent
such termination right arises from to a breach of a covenant under this
Agreement) and prior to the date of termination of this Agreement a Competing
Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise become publicly
known, then the Company shall pay the Breakup Fee to Parent no later than two
Business Days after the earlier to occur of (A) the date of entrance by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary into a definitive agreement concerning a
transaction that constitutes a Competing Proposal; ( _provided_ , that for
purposes of this _Section 7.2(c)_, the term " ** _Competing Proposal_** "
shall have the meaning assigned to such term, except that the references to
"15%" shall be replaced by "50%") or (B) the date any Person (other than
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary) purchases (in one or a series of
transactions) assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary representing 50%
or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and the Companies
Subsidiaries, or Equity Interests representing 50% or more of the voting power
of the Company; _provided_ , that any definitive agreement or purchase
referred to in clauses (A) and (B), respectively, of this sentence that is
entered into or consummated by the Company or any Company Subsidiary within 12
months of the termination of this Agreement, or if there is no such definitive
agreement with respect to a purchase contemplated by clause (B), such purchase
described in clause (B) is consummated within 12 months of the termination of
this Agreement.

 



 

(d) All payments under this _Section 7.2_ shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by in writing by Parent.
For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay,
or cause to be paid, the Breakup Fee on more than one occasion.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Breakup Fee when due,
the Company shall reimburse Parent for all reasonable Expenses actually
incurred or accrued by Parent and the Purchaser (including reasonable Expenses
of counsel) in connection with the collection under and enforcement of this
_Section 7.2_.

agreements contained in this _Section 7.2_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

7.3 _Amendment_. Subject to _Section 1.3(c)_, this Agreement may be amended
by the Company, Parent and the Purchaser by action taken by or on behalf of
their respective boards of directors at any time prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, after approval of the Merger by the Companys
stockholders, no amendment may be made which, by Law or in accordance with the
rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires further approval by such
stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by the parties hereto.

 



 

7.4 _Waiver_. Subject to _Section 1.3(c)_, at any time prior to the Effective
Time, Parent and the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other
hand, may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other, (ii) waive any Uncured Inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance by the other
with any of the agreements or covenants contained herein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after any approval of this Agreement by the Companys
stockholders, there may not be any extension or waiver of this Agreement which
decreases the Merger Consideration or which adversely affects the rights of
the Companys stockholders hereunder without the approval of the Companys
stockholders. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in
an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby,
but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

8.6 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement.

 



 

8.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 



 

8.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Exhibits, Parent
Disclosure Schedule and Company Disclosure Schedule and the other documents
delivered pursuant hereto, and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the
entire agreement of the parties and supersede all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof and, except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights
or remedies hereunder.

 



       
 

 



 

8.9 _Assignment_. The Agreement shall not be assigned by any party by
operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other
parties; any assignment without such prior consent shall be null and void.

 



 

8.10 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
other than pursuant to _Section 5.7_, is intended to or shall confer upon any
other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.

 



 

8.11 _Mutual Drafting; Interpretation_. Each party hereto has participated in
the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of
extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa, the masculine gender
shall include the feminine and neuter genders, the feminine gender shall
include the masculine and neuter genders and the neuter gender shall include
masculine and feminine genders. As used in this Agreement, the words "include"
and "including," and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of
limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement
to "Articles," "Sections," "Exhibits," "Annexes" and "Schedules" are intended
to refer to Sections of this Agreement and Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules to
this Agreement. The schedules and exhibits attached to this Agreement
constitute a part of this Agreement and are incorporated herein for all
purposes. The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein," "hereunder" and
words of similar import, when used in this Agreement, shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular section or article in which
such words appear. All references in this Agreement to "$" are references to
United States dollars. Unless otherwise specifically provided for herein, the
term "or" shall not be deemed to be exclusive.

 



 

8.12 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Enforcement; Waiver of Trial by
Jury_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement and all claims and causes of action arising out of, based
upon, or related to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance hereof, shall be governed by and construed, interpreted and
enforced in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware (without regard
to Laws that may be applicable under conflicts of Laws principles, whether of
the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction).

 



 

(b) Any action, claim, suit or proceeding between the parties hereto arising
out of, based upon or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be brought solely in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of
Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court
within the State of Delaware and any direct appellate court therefrom). Each
party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts
in respect of any such action, claim, suit or proceeding and agrees that it
will not bring any such action, claim, suit or proceeding in any other court.

 



      
 

 



 

Furthermore, each party hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert as
a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any such action, claim, suit or
proceeding, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure
to serve process in accordance with _Section 8.3_, (ii) any claim that it or
its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from
any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, any claim that (A) the action, claim, suit or proceeding in
such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of the action,
claim, suit or proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each party agrees
that notice or the service of process in any action, claim, suit or proceeding
arising out of, based upon or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be properly served or delivered if delivered in the
manner contemplated by _Section 8.3_ or in such other manner as may be
permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY AND ALL RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO
ARISING OUT OF, BASED UPON OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE NEGOTIATION,
EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE HEREOF. EACH OF THE PARTIES (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO
HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 8.12(c)_.

 



 

8.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including via facsimile, .pdf or other electronic means), and by
the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 



 

8.14 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no
adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement exclusively in the
Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court
therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court of the State
of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any
state or federal court within the State of Delaware) and any such injunction
shall be in addition to any other remedy to which any party is entitled, at
law or in equity. In connection with any action for specific performance, each
party hereby irrevocably waives any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with the remedies referred to in this _Section 8.14_.

 



      
 

 



 

8.15 _Non-Recourse_. Any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of,
or related to this Agreement may only be brought against Persons that are
expressly named as parties hereto, and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein. No former, current or future direct or indirect
equity holders, controlling Persons, stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, agents, affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners
or assignees of the Company, Parent or the Purchaser or any of their
respective affiliates or any former, current or future direct or indirect
equity holders, controlling Persons, stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, agents, affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners
or assignees of any of the foregoing shall have any liability or obligation
for any of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, obligations
or liabilities of the Company, Parent or the Purchaser under this Agreement or
of or for any action, suit, arbitration, claim, litigation, investigation, or
proceeding based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the breach, termination or failure to
consummate such transactions), in each case whether based on Contract, tort,
strict liability, other Laws or otherwise and whether by piercing the
corporate veil, by a claim by or on behalf of a party hereto or another Person
or otherwise.

(i) there shall be instituted any Action by any Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction against Parent, the Purchaser, the Company or any

all or any portion of the assets or businesses of Parent, the Company or any

the ability of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
conduct its business or own such assets or (C) make illegal, restrain,

(ii) there shall be any Law or Order enacted, entered, enforced, promulgated
or which is deemed applicable pursuant to an authoritative interpretation by
or on behalf of a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction with
respect to the Offer or the Merger, other than the application to the Offer or

Required Governmental Approvals, which would reasonably expected to result in
any of the consequences referred to in clauses (A) through (C) of paragraph

(iii) (A) any representation or warranty of the Company contained in _Sections
3.2_ , _3.3_ or _3.25_ of the Merger Agreement shall fail to be true and
correct in all material respects, as of the date of the Merger Agreement or as
of the Expiration Date with the same force and effect as if made on and as of
such date, except for representations and warranties that relate to a specific
date or time (which need only be true and correct in all material respects as
of such date or time) or (B) any other representation or warranty of the
Company contained in the Merger Agreement (without giving effect to any
references to any Company Material Adverse Effect or materiality
qualifications and other qualifications based upon the concept of materiality
or similar phrases contained therein) shall fail to be true and correct in any
respect as of the date of

 



      
 

 



 

the Merger Agreement or as of the Expiration Date with the same force and
effect as if made on and as of such date, except for representations and
warranties that relate to a specific date or time (which need only be true and
correct as of such date or time), except as has not had, individually or in

Material Adverse Effect; _provided_ , _however_ , the actual combined
aggregate number of Shares referred to in clause (i) of the first sentence of
_Section 3.2(a)_, and the numbers of Shares subject to outstanding Equity
Interests referred to in the first sentence of _Section 3.2(b)_, exceeds the
combined aggregate number of such shares disclosed in the Merger Agreement and
any applicable schedules, by 250,000 or more shares, such representations and

perform or to comply with any material agreement or covenant to be performed
or complied with by it under the Merger Agreement and such breach or failure

be continuing a Company Material Adverse Effect;

 



 

(vi) the Company shall have failed to deliver a certificate of the Company,

set forth in paragraphs (iii), (iv) and (v) of this _Annex I_ have been
satisfied;

 



 

(vii) an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred and not been
withdrawn or the Company shall have approved, endorsed or recommended a
Competing Proposal other than the Offer or the Merger; or

 



 

(viii) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its
terms.

 



 

The foregoing conditions (including those set forth in clauses (a), (b) and
(c) of the initial paragraph) of this _Annex I_ are, for the sole benefit of
the Purchaser and may be asserted by the Purchaser regardless of the
circumstances giving rise to any such conditions (except if any breach of the
Merger Agreement by Parent or the Purchaser has been the primary cause of or
primarily resulted in the failure or the non-satisfaction of any such
condition) and, except as set forth in the following proviso, may be waived by
the Purchaser in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in its
sole discretion, in each case subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement and
the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC; _provided_ , _however_ , that
clauses (a) and (b) shall not be waivable and may not be waived by the
Purchaser. Any reference in this _Annex I_ or the Merger Agreement to a
condition or requirement contained in this _Annex I_ being satisfied shall be
deemed to be satisfied if such condition or requirement is so waived. The
foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the
rights of the Purchaser to extend, terminate, amend and/or modify the Offer
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. The failure by
the Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be
deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an
ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as
amended, restated, modified or supplemented from time to time, the " **

Technologies Wireless (U.S.A.) Manufacturing Inc., Pluto Merger Sub, Inc., and
