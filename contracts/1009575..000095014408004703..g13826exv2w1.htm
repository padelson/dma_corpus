ARTICLE VII. 
 TAX MATTERS 

   

 Section 7.01 _Tax Indemnities_. 

 

 (a) The Seller shall be responsible for and shall indemnify and hold the Purchaser and its Affiliates harmless against all Excluded Taxes and associated expenses. The Purchaser shall be responsible for and shall indemnify and hold the Seller and its Affiliates harmless against all Taxes and associated expenses other than Excluded Taxes.

  

 (b) In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion of the taxable period ending on the date of the Closing shall be:

  

 (i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related to income or receipts or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible) (other than conveyances pursuant to this Agreement, as provided under Section 7.06), deemed equal to the amount which would be payable (after giving effect to amounts which may be deducted from or offset against such Taxes) if the taxable period ended on the date of the Closing; and

  

 (ii) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the assets of either Company, or otherwise measured by the level of any item, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (after giving effect to amounts which may be deducted from or offset against such Taxes) (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the period ending on the date of the Closing and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period.

  

 (iii) Any credit or refund resulting from an overpayment of Taxes for a Straddle Period shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and/or the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date based upon the method employed in Section 7.01(b)(i) and Section 7.01(b)(ii) taking into account the type of Tax to which the credit or refund relates. In the case of any Tax based upon or measured by capital (including net worth or long-term debt) or intangibles, any amount thereof required to be allocated under this Section 7.01(b) shall be computed by reference to the level of such items on the date of the Closing. All determinations necessary to effect the foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice of the Companies.

  

 (c) Payment by the indemnifying party of any amount due under this Section 7.01 shall be made within 30 days following written notice by the indemnified party that payment of such amounts to the appropriate taxing authority is due, _provided_ that the Purchaser

   ##### 

  

   

shall comply with its obligation to promptly notify the Seller under Section
7.03(a), and  _provided further_ , that the indemnifying party shall not be
required to make any payment earlier than five days before it is due to the
appropriate taxing authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, if the Seller or any of its Affiliates receives an assessment or other
notice of Taxes due with respect to either Company for which the Seller is
not responsible, in whole or in part, pursuant to Section 7.01(a), then the
Purchaser shall pay such Taxes, or if the Seller or any of its Affiliates
pays such Taxes, then the Purchaser or the Companies shall pay to the Seller
the amount of such Taxes for which the Seller is not responsible within five
days following such payment. In the case of a Tax that is contested in
accordance with the provisions of Section 7.03, payment of the Tax to the
appropriate taxing authority will be considered to be due no earlier than the
date a final determination to such effect is made by the appropriate taxing
authority or court.

  

 (d) Transactions occurring or actions taken on the Closing Date, but after the Closing, outside the Ordinary Course of Business of the Companies and not contemplated by this Agreement shall be treated as occurring on the next day and as such shall for purposes of this Agreement be treated (and consistently reported by the parties) as occurring in the taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning the day after the Closing Date.

   

 Section 7.02 _Tax Refunds and Tax Benefits_. 

 

 (a) Any Tax refund, credit or similar benefit (including any interest paid or credited with respect thereto) relating to taxable periods (or portions of taxable period) ending on or before the date of the Closing and not taken into account in the determination of Closing Net Working Capital shall be for the benefit and the property of the Seller, and if received by the Purchaser or either Company, shall be paid over promptly to the Seller. The Purchaser shall, if the Seller reasonably requests and at the Sellers expense, cause each Company or other relevant entity to file Tax Returns requesting a refund of Taxes to which the Seller is entitled under this Section 7.02, and shall file such Tax Returns and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such Tax refund, _provided, however_ , that (i) the Seller will pay or reimburse the Purchaser for any reasonable professional fees incurred by the Purchaser or its Affiliates in connection with the filing of such amended Tax Return within thirty (30) days of written request therefore, (ii) to the extent such amended Tax Return would result in any increase in Taxes of the Purchaser (or of either Company for any Tax period beginning after the Closing Date), the Seller must obtain the prior written consent of the Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (iii) if the receipt of such Tax refund is taxable to Purchaser, Purchaser shall be entitled to withhold an amount equal to its Tax obligation in respect of the receipt of such Tax refund prior to remitting it to Seller. The Purchaser shall permit the Seller to participate in (at the Sellers expense) the prosecution of any such refund claim.

  

 (b) Any amount otherwise payable by the Seller under Section 7.01 shall be reduced by the Tax Benefit actually realized by the Purchaser, its Affiliates and the Companies in a taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date as a result of the Tax payment or any underlying adjustment resulting in the obligation of the Purchaser, its Affiliates or a Company to pay Taxes or other amounts for which the Seller is responsible under Section 7.01 or the accrual or payment of such Taxes, when and such Tax Benefit is realized through receipt of a Tax refund or a reduction in Taxes that otherwise would have been reflected on a Tax

   ##### 

  

   

Return of the Purchaser, its Affiliates or the Companies. The Purchaser shall
pay to the Seller the amount of any Tax Benefit within thirty (30) days of
the filing of the Tax Return to which such Tax Benefit relates and, in the
case, of a Tax refund, within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the Tax
refund. To the extent that a Tax refund is payable to Seller pursuant to
Section 7.02(a), such Tax refund shall not be treated as a Tax Benefit.

   

 Section 7.03 _Contests_. 

 

 (a) After the Closing, each party shall promptly notify the other party in writing of the proposed assessment or the commencement of any Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding or of any demand or claim on the other party or its Affiliates which, if determined adversely to the taxpayer or after the lapse of time, could be grounds for indemnification under Section 7.01. Such notice shall contain factual information (to the extent known to such party) describing the asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or other document received from any taxing authority in respect of any such asserted Tax liability. If either party fails to give the other party prompt notice of an asserted Tax liability as required by this Section 7.03, then such party shall not have any obligation to indemnify for any loss arising out of such asserted Tax liability, but only to the extent that failure to give such notice results in a detriment to such party.

  

 (b) In the case of a Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding (a " _Contest_ ") that relates to taxable periods ending on or before the date of the Closing, the Seller shall have the sole right, at its expense, to control the conduct of such Contest, _provided, however_ , that if the resolution of any such Contest would result in an increase in Taxes otherwise borne by Purchaser (or either Company for any Tax period beginning after the Closing Date), Seller shall not resolve such contest without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

 (c) With respect to Straddle Periods, the Seller may elect to direct and control, through counsel of its own choosing, any Contest involving any asserted Tax liability with respect to which indemnity may be sought from the Seller pursuant to Section 7.01. If the Seller elects to direct such Contest, the Seller shall within 30 days of receipt of the notice of asserted Tax liability notify the Purchaser of its intent to do so, and the Purchaser shall cooperate and shall cause the Companies to cooperate, at the Sellers expense, in each phase of such Contest. If the Seller elects to direct such Contest, then the Purchaser may participate in such Contest, at the Purchasers expense. If the Seller elects not to direct the Contest, the Purchaser may assume control of such Contest (at the Purchasers expense). If the Purchaser assumes control of such Contest, then the Seller may participate, at its own expense, in the Contest. Neither the Seller nor the Purchaser may settle or compromise any asserted liability with respect to any Contest governed by this Section 7.03(c) without prior written consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

 (d) The Purchaser and the Seller agree to cooperate, and agree to cause their Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense against or compromise of any claim in any Contest.

   ##### 

  

    

 Section 7.04 _Preparation of Tax Returns_. 

 

 (a) The Seller shall prepare and file (or cause each Company to prepare and file) all income and franchise Tax Returns relating to such Company for taxable periods ending on or before the date of the Closing and all other Tax Returns required to be filed prior to the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with those prepared for prior taxable periods unless a different treatment of any item is required by an intervening change in Law.

  

 (b) The Purchaser shall prepare and file (or cause each Company to prepare and file) all Tax Returns of such Company that are not prepared by the Seller pursuant to Section 7.04(a) (including Straddle Periods); it being understood that all Taxes shown as due and payable on such Tax Returns shall be the responsibility of the Purchaser, except for such Taxes which are the responsibility of the Seller pursuant to Section 7.01, which the Seller shall pay in accordance with this Article VII. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with those prepared for prior taxable periods unless: (i) a different treatment of any item is required by an intervening change in Law or (ii) a different treatment of an item would not increase any Tax of the Seller or obligate the Seller to indemnify the Purchaser for Taxes pursuant to Section 7.01 (unless the prior written consent of the Seller has been obtained for such preparation, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). With respect to any such Tax Return for a period that begins prior to the Closing Date or as to which Taxes are otherwise allocable to the Seller under Section 7.01, the Purchaser shall provide the Seller and its authorized representative with a copy of such completed Tax Return and a statement (with which the Purchaser will make available supporting schedules and information) certifying the amount of Tax shown on such Tax Return that is allocable to the Seller pursuant to Section 7.01 at least 30 days prior to the due date (including any extension thereof) for filing of such Tax Return, and the Seller and its authorized representative shall have the right to review and approve (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) such Tax Return and statement prior to the filing of such Tax Return. The Seller and the Purchaser agree to consult and to attempt in good faith to resolve any issues arising as a result of the review of such Tax Return and statement by the Seller or its authorized representative.

  

 (c) The Purchaser will, and will cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with the Parent and the Seller to cause the filing of any amended Tax Return that is either required to be filed or reasonably requested by the Seller relating to a taxable period (or portions thereof) of the Companies ending on or before the Closing Date; provided, however, that (i) the Seller will pay or reimburse the Purchaser for any reasonable professional fees incurred by the Purchaser or its Affiliates in connection with the preparation and filing of such amended Tax Return within thirty (30) days of written request therefor, and (ii) to the extent such amended Tax Return would result in any increase in Taxes for the Purchaser, the Seller must obtain the prior written consent of the Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

   

 Section 7.05 _Tax Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. The Seller and the Purchaser shall provide each other with such cooperation and information as either of them reasonably may request of the other (and the Purchaser shall cause the Companies to provide such cooperation and information) in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes or participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes. Such cooperation and information 

   ##### 

  

    

shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof,
together with related work papers and documents relating to rulings or other
determinations by taxing authorities. The Seller and the Purchaser shall make
themselves (and their respective employees) reasonably available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide explanations of any documents
or information provided under this Section 7.05. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in Section 5.02, each of the Seller and the Purchaser shall
retain all Tax Returns, work papers and all material records or other
documents in its possession (or in the possession of its Affiliates) relating
to Tax matters of either Company for any taxable period that includes the date
of the Closing and for all prior taxable periods until the later of (i) the
expiration of the statute of limitations (taking into account any extensions
or waivers thereof) of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and
other documents relate or (ii) six years following the due date
(without extension) for such Tax Returns. After such time, before the Seller
or the Purchaser shall dispose of any such documents in its possession (or in
the possession of its Affiliates), the other party shall be given an
opportunity, after 90 days prior written notice, to remove and retain all or
any part of such documents as such other party may select (at such other
partys expense). Any information obtained under this Section 7.05 shall be
kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or
other proceeding. 

  

 Section 7.06 _Conveyance Taxes_. Companies shall prepare (with the Sellers and Buyers cooperation as needed) and file any Tax Returns in respect of any Conveyance Taxes that are required to be filed in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Purchaser and the Seller each agree to pay 50% of any and all Conveyance Taxes that may be imposed upon, or payable or collectible or incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. The Purchaser and the Seller agree to cooperate in the execution and delivery of all instruments and certificates necessary to enable the Purchaser to comply with any pre-Closing filing requirements. 

  

 Section 7.07 _Tax Covenants_. 

 

 (a) Neither the Purchaser nor any Affiliate of the Purchaser shall take, or cause or permit either Company to take, any action or omit to take any action which could increase the Sellers or any of its Affiliates liability for Taxes, unless otherwise required by Law.

 (b) This Article VII shall be the sole provision governing indemnities for Taxes under this Agreement.

  

 (c) For purposes of this Article VII, all references to the Purchaser, the Seller, Affiliates or the Companies include successors.

  

 (d) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the covenants and agreements of the parties hereto contained in this Article VII shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force until the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations for the Taxes in question (taking into account any extensions or waivers thereof).

 (f) If, with respect to any Tax for which the Seller has an indemnification obligation under this Article VII, the Purchaser, the Companies or their Affiliates receive an indemnity, contribution or other similar payment from a third party, either (i) the Sellers indemnification obligation with respect to such Tax shall be reduced by such recovery or (ii) if Seller has already satisfied such indemnification obligation, the Purchaser shall refund the amount of such recovery (less Purchaser expenses, including Taxes, incurred in respect of such recovery) to the Seller within thirty (30) days of receipt.

   #####

Companies products made or services purchased, after the Closing), except
for claims or causes of action with respect to which the Seller is obligated
to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 9.02
(without reference to or application of (a) any threshold or cap described in
Section 9.04 relating to such Persons ability to recover for Losses, or (b)
the expiration of any representation or warranty pursuant to Section 9.01). 

  

 Section 9.04 _Limits on Indemnification_. 

 

 (a) No claim may be asserted nor may any Action be commenced against either party for breach of any representation or warranty contained herein, unless written notice of such claim or action is received by such party describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim or Action on or prior to the date on which the representation or warranty on which such claim or Action is based ceases to survive as set forth in Section 9.01.

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement: (i) except with respect to any Loss arising out of, relating to or resulting from any fraud by or on behalf of any party hereto or that arises out of a breach of Section 3.01, the first sentence of Section 3.02(a), Section 3.02(b), Section 3.03, Section 3.04, Section 3.16, Section 3.21, Section 4.01 or Section 4.07, an Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.02(i) or Section 9.03(i), unless and until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from the Indemnifying Party equals or exceeds 1% of the Purchase Price after which the Indemnifying Party shall be liable only for indemnifiable Losses in excess of such amount; (ii) except with respect to any Loss arising out of, relating to or resulting from any fraud by or on behalf of any party hereto or that arises out of a breach of Section 3.01, the first sentence of Section 3.02(a), Section 3.02(b), Section 3.03, Section 3.04, Section 3.16, Section 3.21, Section 4.01 or Section 4.07, the maximum amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from an Indemnifying Party arising out of or resulting from the causes set forth in Section 9.02(i) or Section 9.03(i) shall be an amount equal to 15% of the Purchase Price; (iii) other than as may be paid to an unaffiliated third party, neither party shall have any liability under any provision of this Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement for any punitive, incidental, consequential, special or indirect damages relating to the breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement; (iv) no Losses may be claimed under Section 9.02 or Section 9.03 by any Indemnified Party to the extent such Losses are attributable solely to an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.08, and the fact of any such adjustment in and of itself shall not be deemed a breach of a representation or warranty by the Seller to the extent that the Closing Net Working Capital exceeds the Reference Net Working Capital; and (v) no representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Seller shall be deemed breached as a result of the Seller failing to secure any consents, permits, licenses or authorizations from third parties, or upon the termination of any agreements, permits or licenses as a result of such failure, unless (A) such agreement, consent, permit or license is (or was required to have been) listed in Section 3.05 or Section 3.13 of the Disclosure Schedule and the Seller has failed to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consent, permit or license. No knowledge of, or investigation by or on behalf of, any party hereto shall constitute or effectuate a waiver of such partys right to enforce any representation,

   ##### 

  

   

warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein or in the Transition Services
Agreement, or in any way limit such partys right to indemnification under
this Article IX.

  

 (c) For all purposes of this Article IX, "Losses" shall be net of (i) any third-party insurance, indemnification or other recoveries actually received by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates under any third-party insurance policy or any other third-party Contract in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification and (ii) the Tax Benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates arising in connection with the accrual, incurrence or payment of any such Losses, when and as such Tax Benefit is realized through receipt of a Tax refund or a reduction in Taxes that otherwise would have been reflected on a Tax Return of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall pay to the Indemnifying Party the amount of any Tax Benefit within thirty (30) days of the filing of such Tax Return to which such Tax Benefit relates and, in the case of a Tax refund, within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the Tax refund, and in each case, net of costs and expenses to recover and any applicable premium increases, to the extent resulting from such claims. To the extent that a Tax refund is payable to Seller pursuant to Section 7.02(a), such Tax refund shall not be treated as a Tax Benefit.

   

 Section 9.05 _Notice of Loss; Third-Party Claims_. 

 

 (a) An Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party notice of any matter which an Indemnified Party has determined has given, or would reasonably be expected to give rise to, a right of indemnification under this Agreement, within a reasonable time following such determination, stating the estimated amount of the Loss, if known, and method of computation thereof, and containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or arises; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the rights of the Indemnified Party hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party shall have been prejudiced by reason of such failure.

  

 (b) If an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Action, audit, claim, investigation, demand or assessment (each, a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") against it which may give rise to a claim for Loss under this Article IX, reasonably promptly following receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party notice of such Third-Party Claim; _provided_ that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the rights of the Indemnified Party hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party shall have been prejudiced by reason of such failure. If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its responsibility for all indemnifiable Losses arising out of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third-Party Claim at its sole risk and expense and through counsel of its choice (which shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party) if it gives notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnified Party within 15 days of the receipt of such notice from the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to undertake any such defense against a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at its own expense. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified Partys possession or under the Indemnified Partys control relating thereto as is reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to direct the defense of any such claim or proceeding in accordance with this Section 9.05(b), the Indemnified Party shall not make any

   ##### 

  

   

payment toward a settlement of such claim, nor permit to be paid any monies as
part of a settlement, unless the Indemnifying Party consents in writing to
such payment. In the event that (i) the Indemnifying Party shall elect not to
undertake such defense; (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall fail to actually
undertake to defend such Third-Party Claim, or diligently pursue or
maintain such defense, within a reasonable time after notice from the
Indemnified Party of such Third-Party Claim; or (iii) the Indemnifying Party
and Indemnified Party cannot, pursuant to applicable rules of professional
conduct, be represented by the same counsel, with respect to such Third-
Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party (upon further written notice to the
Indemnifying Party) shall have the right to undertake the defense, compromise
and/or settlement of such Third-Party Claim, by counsel or other
representatives of its own choosing, on behalf of and for the sole account
and risk of the Indemnifying Party (subject to Section 9.04); furthermore, in
each case where a Third-Party Claim seeks equitable remedies, the Indemnified
Party (upon written notice to the Indemnifying Party) shall have the right to
undertake the defense, compromise and/or settlement of the equitable aspects
of such Third-Party Claim, by counsel or other representatives of its
own choosing, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party (subject to Section
9.04). In the event that the Indemnified Party undertakes the defense of a
Third-Party Claim under this Section 9.05(b), the Indemnifying Party shall
pay, subject to Section 9.04, in addition to all other amounts required to be
paid hereunder, the reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees) incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense, compromise and/or settlement thereof as and when such costs and
expenses are so incurred. Anything in this Section 9.05(b) to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the Indemnified
Partys written consent, settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim or
consent to the entry of any Governmental Order unless (i) the Indemnifying
Party agrees in writing to pay all amounts payable pursuant to such
settlement, compromise or Governmental Order, (ii) such settlement, compromise
or Governmental Order includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by
the claimant or the plaintiff (or any other applicable Person) to the
Indemnified Party of an irrevocable release from all liability in respect of
such Third-Party Claim (including the underlying facts resulting therein) in
form and substance satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and (iii) such
settlement, comprise or Governmental Order does not impose any injunctive
relief or operational restrictions on the Indemnified Party or admit to any
wrongdoing by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party.

   

 Section 9.06 _Remedies_. The Purchaser has conducted its own independent investigation, review and analysis of the business, operations, assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition, software, technology and prospects of the Companies. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it and its representatives have been provided access to the personnel and records of the Companies and their business for such purpose. The Purchaser Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties acknowledge and agree that they are not entitled to rely on any representations or warranties or other statements of fact or opinion, other than the representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement. Absent fraud on the part of any party hereto, the Purchaser and the Seller also acknowledge and agree that (i) following the Closing, the indemnification provisions of this Article IX shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties for any breach by the other party of the representations and warranties in this Agreement and for any failure by the other party to perform and comply with any covenants and agreements in this Agreement, except that if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their terms or are otherwise breached, the parties shall be entitled to specific 

   ##### 

  

    

performance of the terms thereof in addition to any other remedy at law or
equity and (ii) anything to the contrary notwithstanding, no breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein shall give
rise to any right on the part of the Purchaser or the Seller, after the
consummation of the purchase and sale of the Shares contemplated by this
Agreement, to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby. Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate its
Losses (including, to the extent consistent with sound business judgment,
incurring costs only to the minimum extent necessary to remedy the
breach which gives rise to the Losses) upon becoming aware of any event which
would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto. In furtherance
and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event any Losses are
recoverable under third party insurance policies or other collateral
sources, the Purchaser shall make a claim for such Losses under such third
party insurance policies or other collateral sources, and in the event the
Purchaser receives any recovery, the amount of such recovery (net of costs
and expenses of such recovery and any applicable premium increases, to
the extent resulting from such claim) shall be applied to refund any payments
made by the Sellers which would not have been so paid had such recovery been
obtained prior to such payment 

  

 Section 9.07 _Tax Matters_. Anything in this Article IX to the contrary notwithstanding, the rights and obligations of the parties hereto with respect to indemnification for all Tax matters shall be solely governed by Article VII and shall not be subject to the provisions of this Article IX. 

  

 Section 9.08 _No Recourse Against the Companies_. The Seller hereby releases and forever discharges (a) each of the Companies from liability for any and all claims for Losses, of whatever kind or nature, in law or equity, known or unknown, vested or contingent, suspected or unsuspected, and whether or not concealed or hidden, whichever have or may have existed, or which do exist, that may now or hereafter at any time be made or brought against either Company by or on behalf of the Seller arising out of, relating to or in respect of any period on or prior to Closing, other than in respect of the Surviving Interaffiliate Contracts, and (b) each Companys current and former officers, directors and employees, in their capacity as such, from liability for any and all claims for Losses arising out of the negotiation, documentation, execution and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement, of whatever kind or nature, in law or equity, known or unknown, vested or contingent, suspected or unsuspected, and whether or not concealed or hidden, whichever have or may have existed, or which do exist, that may now or hereafter at any time be made or brought against either Company by or on behalf of the Seller arising out of, relating to or in respect of any period on or prior to Closing. The Seller shall not be entitled to contribution from, subrogation to or recovery against the Companies with respect to any Loss imposed on or incurred by the Seller or any Seller Indemnified Party in connection with this Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement.

 (c) by either the Purchaser or the Seller in the event that any Governmental Order restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have become final and nonappealable;

  

 (d) by the Purchaser if the Seller shall have breached any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Article VIII, which breach cannot be or has not been cured by the Termination Date as may be extended pursuant to Section 10.01(b); or

  

 (e) by the Seller if the Purchaser shall have breached any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement which would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Article VIII.

 Section 11.03 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by applicable Law or public policy, all other terms and 

   ##### 

  

    

provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect for so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to either party hereto. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest
extent possible. 

  

 Section 11.04 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement, the GD Guarantee and the Parent Guarantee constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between the Seller and the Purchaser with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

This Agreement may not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise without the express written consent of the Seller and the Purchaser (which consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of the Seller or the Purchaser, as the case may be), except that the Purchaser may, without the prior approval of the Seller, assign any of its rights, interests and/or obligations to any Affiliate of the Purchaser (it being understood that such assignment shall not relieve the Purchaser of any of its obligations hereunder).

Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party to be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition of this Agreement. The failure of either party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any of such rights. 

  

 Section 11.08 _Schedules_. Any matter, information, item or exception disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule, under any specific representation or warranty or schedule number hereof, shall be deemed to have been disclosed for purposes of every other representation or warranty in this Agreement in respect of which it is apparent on its face that such matter, information, item or exception applies to such other representation or warranty. The inclusion of any matter, information, item or exception in the Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to constitute an admission of any liability by the Seller, or either Company to any third party or otherwise imply that any such matter, information, item or exception is material or creates a measure for materiality or Material Adverse Effect for the purposes of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 11.09 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as expressly set forth herein (including the provisions of Article IX relating to indemnified parties) this Agreement shall be

implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or

This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York. All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively in any New York federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York; _provided, however_ , that if such federal court does not have jurisdiction over such Action, such Action shall be heard and determined exclusively in any New York state court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York. Consistent with the preceding sentence, the parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party hereto and (b) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may not be enforced in or by any of the above-named courts. 

  

 Section 11.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a trial by jury with respect to any Action directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 _GUARANTEE OF HLTH CORPORATION_  

    

 HLTH Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the " _Guarantor_ "), hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to General Dynamics Information Technology, Inc., a Virginia corporation (the " _Purchaser_ ") and the full and timely observance, payment, performance and discharge of the obligations of SNTC Holding, Inc. (the " _Seller_ ") under the provisions of that certain Stock Purchase Agreement (the " _Purchase Agreement_ ") dated as of the date hereof, by and between the Seller and the Purchaser and under that certain Transition Services Agreement (as such term is defined in the Purchase Agreement) (collectively, the " _Obligations_ "), and not of their collectibility only. This Guarantee shall remain in force and effect until performance in full of all the Obligations, and is in no way conditioned upon any requirement that the Purchaser first attempt to collect any of the Obligations from the Seller or resort to any collateral security or other means of obtaining payment. 

  

 If any of the Obligations have become irrecoverable from or unenforceable against the Seller in whole or in part by reason of the Sellers insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization, or if the collection or enforcement of any of the Obligations shall be stayed, or the Obligations shall be discharged, in each case in any insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Seller, this Guarantee shall notwithstanding any of the preceding nevertheless be binding on Guarantor and the enforceability of this Guarantee in accordance with its terms shall not be affected thereby. 

  

 Guarantor waives promptness, diligence, presentment, demand, protest, notice of acceptance, any right to require the marshalling of assets of the Seller, and all suretyship defenses generally. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Guarantor agrees that its obligations hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (a) the failure of Purchaser to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Seller; (b) the addition, substitution or release of any entity or other person primarily or secondarily liable for any Obligation; (c) the adequacy of any other means Purchaser may have of obtaining repayment of any of the Obligations; (d) the amendment of the Purchase Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof; or (e) other acts or omissions which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of Guarantor or otherwise operate as a release or discharge of Guarantor. The agreements and waivers of Guarantor set forth above in this Guarantee shall not operate to waive, affect or impair (i) any of the rights of the Seller under the Purchase Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement, including but not limited to any right to receive notice, or prejudice any right of the Guarantor to assert any defense, counterclaim or setoff otherwise applicable to any of the Obligations, or (ii) any right of Guarantor to receive notice under the Purchase Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement. The Obligations shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Purchase Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if an Obligation is compromised in accordance with the provisions of the 

   ##### 

  

    

Purchase Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement, such Obligation shall
be compromised for purposes of this Guarantee. 

 

Until the final payment and performance in full of all of the Obligations,
Guarantor shall not exercise and hereby waives any rights against the Seller
arising as a result of payment by Guarantor hereunder, by way of subrogation,
reimbursement, restitution, contribution or otherwise, and will not file or
assert any claim in competition with ViPS in respect of any payment
hereunder in any bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization case or proceedings
of any nature involving the Seller, nor will Guarantor assert any setoff,
recoupment or counterclaim to any of its obligations hereunder in respect of
any liability of the Seller to Guarantor

  

All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications hereunder
shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given or made (a)
when delivered by hand, (b) three (3) days after date of mailing, if sent by
registered or certified mail or (c) as of the time when confirmation of a
successful transmission is received by the sending facsimile machine, if sent
by electronic transmission by facsimile, in each case, to the respective
parties hereto at the following addresses (or at such other address for a
party as shall be specified in a notice given in accordance with this

If any term or other provision of this Guarantee is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by applicable Law or public policy, all other
terms and provisions of this Guarantee shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect for so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated by this Guarantee is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to either party hereto. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the Purchaser and the Guarantor hereto shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Guarantee so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated by this Guarantor are consummated as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible.

  

The Purchaser may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the Seller under the Purchase Agreement or of
the Guarantor hereunder, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties of the Seller contained in the Purchase Agreement or in any
document delivered by the Seller pursuant thereto or (c) waive compliance
with any of the agreements of the Seller or conditions to the Sellers
obligations contained in the Stock Purchase Agreement or the Guarantors
obligations hereunder. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Purchaser. Any waiver
of any term or condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent
breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of
any other term or condition of the Purchase Agreement or this Guarantee. The
failure of the Purchaser to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not
constitute a waiver of any of such rights.

  

Section 11.05, Section 11.09, Section 11.11 and Section 11.12 of the Purchase
Agreement shall apply to this Guarantee, mutatis mutandis, as if they had
been fully set forth herein.

  

Executed as of the 3rd day of June, 2008.
