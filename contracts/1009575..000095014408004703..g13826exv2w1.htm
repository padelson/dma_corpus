discharged, in each case in any insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Seller, this
Guarantee shall notwithstanding any of the preceding nevertheless be binding on Guarantor and the

the failure of Purchaser to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against
the Seller; (b)&nbsp;the addition, substitution or release of any entity or other person primarily or

obtaining repayment of any of the Obligations; (d)&nbsp;the amendment of the Purchase Agreement or the
Transition Services Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof; or (e)&nbsp;other acts or omissions
which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of Guarantor or otherwise operate as a
release or discharge of Guarantor. The agreements and waivers of Guarantor set forth above in this
Guarantee shall not operate to waive, affect or impair (i)&nbsp;any of the rights of the Seller under
the Purchase Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement, including but not limited to any right
to receive notice, or prejudice any right of the Guarantor to assert any defense, counterclaim or
setoff otherwise applicable to any of the Obligations, or (ii)&nbsp;any right of Guarantor to receive
