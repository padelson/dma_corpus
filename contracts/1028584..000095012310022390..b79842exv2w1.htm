RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, Parent proposes to cause Merger Sub to make a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), including the associated Rights (as defined below) at a price per share of Company Common Stock (including the associated Right) of $6.05 (such amount, or any other amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer and this Agreement, the " _Offer Price_ "), net to the seller in cash, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub each have determined that it is advisable, fair to and in the best interests of its stockholders to effect the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of Merger Sub with and into the Company pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ ") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, pursuant to which each outstanding share of Company Common Stock (including the associated Rights) not owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall be converted into the right to receive cash, as set forth herein, all upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement. 

  

 WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board of Directors_ ") has unanimously (i) concluded that the Offer, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitute a Superior Proposal (as such term is defined in the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated December 24, 2009 by and among Amicas, Inc., Project Alta Merger Corp. and Project Alta Holdings Corp. (the " _Prior Merger Agreement_ ")) to the merger and transactions contemplated in the Prior Merger Agreement (ii) determined that the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, taken together, are at a price and on terms that are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders (the " _Company Common Stockholders_ "), (iii) withdrawn its recommendation of the Prior Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, (iv) approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (v) approved resolutions recommending the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the Company Common Stockholders, (vi) approved resolutions recommending that the Company Common Stockholders accept the Offer and tender their Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (the recommendations set forth in clauses (v) and (vi) being the " _Company Recommendations_ "), and (vii) taken all necessary action to render the Companys Rights Agreement, dated as of December 5, 2002, between the Company (f/k/a VitalWorks, Inc.) and StockTrans, Inc. as rights agent (the " _Rights Plan_ ") and the rights to 

   ##### 

  

 

purchase Series B Junior Preferred Stock (each, a " _Right_ ") outstanding
thereunder, inapplicable to the Offer, this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 WHEREAS, the Company Board of Directors has deemed the Offer and the Merger as contemplated by this Agreement to be a "Superior Proposal" (as such term is defined in the Prior Merger Agreement) and therefore, immediately prior to execution of this Agreement by Company, the Company terminated the Prior Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms and has paid the Company Termination Fee pursuant thereto. 

  

 WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, certain Company Common Stockholders have entered into stockholder agreements in the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit A_ (the " _Stockholder Agreements_ "), dated as of the date hereof, with Parent. 

  

 WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of the Company to enter into this Agreement, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, certain entities have issued the Equity Commitment Letters attached as _Exhibit B_ hereto (the " _Equity Commitment Letters_ ") to Parent and the Sponsor has entered into the Guarantee, dated as of the date hereof (the " _Guarantee_ "), in the form attached as _Exhibit C_ hereto, pursuant to which the Sponsor is guaranteeing certain obligations of Parent and Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein. 

  

 WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of the Company to enter into this Agreement, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent and the Company have entered into an Escrow Agreement with Bank of New York Mellon as escrow agent thereunder in the form attached as _Exhibit F_ hereto (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), pursuant to which the Parent has caused the Escrow Amount (as defined below) to be placed into escrow for the benefit of the Company in the event that the Parent Termination Fee becomes payable hereunder. 

  

AGREEMENT 

   

 NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties hereby agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER 

  

 Section 1.1 _The Offer_. 

   

 (a) Subject to the conditions of this Agreement, as promptly as practicable but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the date that the Company executes this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence the Offer within the meaning of the applicable rules and regulations of the Exchange Act. The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, commence the Offer and accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of Company Common Stock 

   ##### 

  

    

tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject only to the conditions set forth
in  _Annex A_ hereto. The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the
20th Business Day following the commencement of the Offer (determined using
Rule 14d-1(g)(3) of the SEC). 

   

Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to waive any condition to the Offer or
modify the terms of the Offer, except that, without the consent of the
Company, Merger Sub shall not (i) reduce the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) waive
or modify the Minimum Tender Condition (as defined in _Annex A_ ) to the
extent that Merger Sub or Parent would purchase 50% or less of the
Fully Diluted Shares or to increase the Minimum Tender Condition, (iv) add to
the conditions set forth in _Annex A_ or modify any condition set forth in
_Annex A_ in any manner adverse to the Company Common Stockholders, (v)
extend the Offer, or (vi) modify the form of consideration payable in the
Offer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merger Sub may, without the consent of
the Company, (i) extend the Offer, if at the scheduled expiration date of
the Offer any of the conditions (other than the Minimum Tender Condition) to
Merger Subs obligation to purchase shares of Company Common Stock are not
satisfied, until such time as such conditions are satisfied or waived,
including, without limitation, HSR Clearance, (ii) extend the Offer for a
period of not more than ten (10) Business Days beyond the initial expiration
date of the Offer, if on the date of such extension less than 90% of
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock have been validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, (iii) extend the Offer for any
period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the
SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer and (iv) extend the Offer,
one time only, for any reason for a period of not more than fifteen (15)
Business Days beyond the latest expiration date that would otherwise
be permitted under clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this sentence. In addition if
at the otherwise scheduled expiration date of the Offer any condition to the
Offer is not satisfied, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to, extend the Offer at the request of the Company for one period of not more
than twenty (20) Business Days. In addition, Merger Sub may make available a
"subsequent offering period," in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the SEC, of
not less than ten (10) Business Days. On the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, (A) as soon as practicable after becoming
obligated to purchase shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer,
accept for payment and pay for all shares of Company Common Stock validly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the date of acceptance
for payment, the " _Acceptance Date_ "), which acceptance may be by oral
notice to the Paying Agent, (B) on the closing date of the Offer (which shall
be not more than five (5) Business Days following the Acceptance Date),
deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, cash in U.S. dollars
sufficient to pay the aggregate Offer Price for all such accepted shares of
Company Common Stock and (C) as soon as practicable following such deposit,
cause the Paying Agent to pay for all shares of Company Common Stock so
accepted for payment. 

   

 (b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall file with the SEC and deliver to the Company and its counsel a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which shall contain an offer to purchase and a related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and the 

   ##### 

  

    

documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together
with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Each
of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect,
and each of Parent and Merger Sub shall take all steps necessary to amend or
supplement the Offer Documents and to cause the Offer Documents as so amended
or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the
Company Common Stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable Federal securities laws. To the extent practicable, the Company
and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on the Offer Documents each time before any such document is filed with the
SEC, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by the Company and its counsel. Parent
and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel as promptly as
practicable with copies of any correspondence that Parent, Merger Sub or
their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents as promptly as practicable after receipt of
those comments. 

   

 (c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company Common Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer. 

   

 (d) Subject to Section 5.1 of this Agreement, if, between the date of this Agreement and the Acceptance Date, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, solely by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, reverse split, combination or exchange of shares or any other similar transaction, the Offer Price shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, reverse split, combination or exchange of shares or any other similar transaction and to provide to the Company Common Stockholders the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action. 

  

 Section 1.2 _Company Actions_. 

   

 (a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents (collectively, the " _Transactions_ "). 

   

 (b) On the date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, as amended from time to time, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") describing the Company Recommendations and shall mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the Company Common Stockholders. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so 

   ##### 

  

    

amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
Company Common Stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable Federal securities laws. To the extent practicable, the Parent and
its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Schedule 14D-9 each time before such document is filed with the SEC, and
the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any
comments made by the Parent and its counsel. The Company shall provide the
Parent and its counsel as promptly as practicable with copies of any
correspondence that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 as promptly as
practicable after receipt of those comments. 

   

 (c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to furnish Merger Sub promptly with mailing labels containing the names and addresses of the record holders of Company Common Stock as of a recent date and of those persons becoming record holders subsequent to such date, together with copies of all lists of stockholders, security position listings and computer files and all other information in the Companys possession or control regarding the beneficial owners of Company Common Stock, and shall furnish to Merger Sub such information and assistance (including updated lists of stockholders, security position listings and computer files) as Parent may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the Company Common Stockholders. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Transactions, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon written request, deliver to the Company (or, at the Companys option, destroy) all copies of such information then in their possession. 

  

 Section 1.3 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time: (a) Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, (b) the Company shall be the successor or surviving corporation in the Merger and shall continue to be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, and (c) the separate corporate existence of the Company with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL. 

  

 Section 1.4 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Closing of the Merger will take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, as promptly as practicable but in no event later than the second Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) set forth in _Article VI_ (the " _Closing Date_ "), at the offices of McDermott Will and Emery LLP, 227 West Monroe Street, Chicago, Illinois 60606, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties. 

  

 Section 1.5 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Certificate of Merger shall be delivered for filing with the Delaware Secretary. The Merger shall become effective at the Effective Time. If the Delaware Secretary

The Escrow Amount shall be available to fund the purchase of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and the Merger or to satisfy the Parent Termination Fee payable to the Company by Parent under the terms of this Agreement; provided, that in the event that the Parent Termination Fee is payable to the Company, Parent shall have the right, at its election, to fund the Parent Termination Fee from other financing sources (including its own working capital) as long as such alternative financing does not delay the payment of such fee; provided, further, that if the Offer is consummated or this Agreement is terminated in circumstances where the Parent Termination Fee is not payable to the Company, the Escrow Amount shall be released directly to, or as directed by, Parent.

Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit,

 (a) _Exchange of Certificates_. Promptly following the Effective Time (but in no event later than three (3) Business Days following the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ", it being understood that any references herein to " _Certificates_ " shall be deemed to include references to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of shares of Company Common Stock) and whose shares of Company Common Stock have been converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to _Article I_ (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates, or appropriate affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided below, to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation (or, subject to _Section 2.6_ below, an appropriate affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions (or, if such shares are held in book-entry or other uncertificated form, upon the entry through a book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of such shares on a book-entry account statement), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration payable to holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Article II_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration or the right to demand to be paid the "fair value" of the shares represented thereby as contemplated by _Article I_. 

   

 (b) _Special Payment Procedures for DTC_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") to ensure that (x) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 

   ##### 

  

    

11:30 am (New York time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit
to DTC or its nominee on the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately
available funds equal to the number of Shares held of record by DTC or such
nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Per Share
Merger Consideration (such amount, the " _DTC Payment_ "), and (y) if the
Closing occurs after 11:30 am (New York time) on the Closing Date, the Paying
Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the first Business Day after the
Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the DTC
Payment.

 Section 2.5 _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any cash from the Exchange Fund required to be delivered, to the extent so delivered, to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

 Section 2.6 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in reasonable and customary amount, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon. 

  

 Section 2.7 _No Further Dividends_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates. 

  

 Section 2.8 _Withholding of Tax_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock and or Company Common Stock Options such amount as Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be (a) paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity in accordance with applicable Law or Order and (b) treated for all purposes of this Agreement as

Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board of Directors
any known fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls over

access to, any material written materials relating to the foregoing. The
Company has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) designed in all material
respects to ensure that information relating to the Company, including its
consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in the reports the
Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is made known to the Chief
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company by
others within those entities. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer of the Company have concluded that such disclosure controls
and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level in timely
alerting the Companys Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial
Officer to material information required to be included in the
Companys periodic reports required under the Exchange Act. 

   

 (e) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Company and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of Company or its Subsidiaries or their accountants (including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not have a material adverse effect on Companys system of internal accounting controls.

 (d) If any Antitakeover Laws are or may become applicable to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and the Company Board of Directors shall promptly grant such approvals and use commercially reasonable efforts to take such other lawful actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger, as the case may be, and otherwise take such other commercially reasonable and lawful actions to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute, and any regulations promulgated thereunder, on such transactions. 

   

 (e) Prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company (acting through its Board of Directors or its Compensation Committee) shall take all steps necessary to cause any 

   ##### 

  

    

employment compensation, severance or employee benefit arrangements that have
been entered into by the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates with current or future directors, officers or employees of the
Company and its Affiliates to be exempt under amended Rule 14d-10(c)
promulgated under the Exchange Act and to insure that any such arrangements
fall within the safe harbor provisions of such rule. 

  

 Section 5.4 _Proxy_. 

   

 (a) _Proxy Statement_. If the adoption of this Agreement by the Company Common Stockholders is required by Law, the Company shall, at Parents request, prepare preliminary proxy materials which shall constitute the Proxy Statement and the Company shall cause such Proxy Statement to be filed with the SEC as soon as practicable after the expiration of the Offer, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such filing to occur no later than the date that is two (2) Business Days following such date. Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish all information as the Company may reasonably request in connection with such actions and the preparation of the Proxy Statement. Subject to and without limiting the rights of the Company Board of Directors pursuant to _Section 5.6_, the Proxy Statement shall include the Company Recommendation.

As promptly as practicable after comments are received from the SEC thereon and after the furnishing by the Company and Parent of all information required to be contained therein, the Company shall, in consultation with the Parent, prepare and the Company shall file any required amendments to, and the definitive, Proxy Statement with the SEC. The Company will advise Parent, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information and will promptly supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of the Company Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or filing any other required filings (or, in each case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent with an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and shall give due consideration to including in such document or response comments reasonably and timely proposed by Parent. As promptly as practicable after the clearance of the Proxy Statement by the SEC (the " _SEC Clearance Date_ "), the Company shall mail the Proxy Statement and all other proxy materials to the Company Common Stockholders and, if necessary in order to comply with applicable securities Laws, after the Proxy Statement shall have been so mailed, promptly circulate amended, supplemental or supplemented proxy material, and, if required in connection therewith, re-solicit proxies. If the SEC has failed to affirmatively notify the Company within ten (10) days after the filing of the Proxy Statement with the SEC that it will not be reviewing the Proxy Statement, then the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain such affirmative clearance of the Proxy Statement from the SEC and the date on which the Company receives such affirmative clearance shall be the " _SEC Clearance Date_ ". 

    ##### 

 

    

 (c) _Information Supplied_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees, as to it and its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents or Representatives, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, expressly for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement or any other documents filed or to be filed with the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, will, as of the time such documents (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) are mailed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company further agrees that all documents that such Party is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Merger will comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and any other applicable Laws and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event or circumstance relating to Parent or Merger Sub, or their respective officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent or Merger Sub which should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement, would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, Parent shall promptly notify the Company and, to the extent required by the Exchange Act and any other applicable Laws, the Company shall amend or supplement the Proxy Statement promptly to disclose such event or circumstance. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event or circumstance relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or their respective officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement, would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Company shall promptly notify Parent and, to the extent required by the Exchange Act and any other applicable Laws, the Company shall amend or supplement the Proxy Statement promptly to disclose such event or circumstance.

 (a) If the adoption of this Agreement by the Company Common Stockholders is required by Law: 

   

 (i) The Company shall duly call, give notice of and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of considering and voting upon the adoption of this Agreement (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") as promptly as practicable following the date on which the Proxy Statement is mailed to the Company Common Stockholders; _provided_ , that without the prior written consent of Parent, (i) the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the 

   ##### 

  

    

Company Stockholders Meeting to be held not later than thirty (30)
calendar days after the SEC Clearance Date, and (ii) the Company may not
adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting; 

   

 (ii) The Company shall establish a record date for purposes of determining stockholders entitled to notice of and vote at the Company Stockholders Meeting (the " _Record Date_ "), which record date shall not be prior to the Acceptance Date. Once the Company has established the Record Date, the Company shall consult with Parent prior to changing the Record Date or establishing a different record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting, unless required to do so by applicable Law. 

   

 (iii) Subject to _Section 5.6_ and _Article VII_, at the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall, through the Company Board of Directors, make the Company Recommendation unless there has been a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (which cannot occur after the Acceptance Date). Prior to any Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall take all reasonable lawful action to solicit the Company Required Vote. Notwithstanding any Company Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to, and in accordance with _Article VII_, this Agreement shall be submitted to the Company Common Stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company Required Vote. The Company shall, upon the reasonable request of Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to advise Parent during the last ten (10) Business Days prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, as to the aggregate tally of the proxies received by the Company with respect to the Company Required Vote. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) shall be the only matter (other than procedure matters) which the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting. 

   

 (iv) Parent shall cause all shares of Company Common Stock purchased pursuant to the Offer and all other shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent to be voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) If, following the Acceptance Date and, if exercised, the closing of the Additional Share Option, Parent, Merger Sub, and any other subsidiary of Parent shall own, in the aggregate, at least 90% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after the expiration of the Offer or exercise of the Additional Share Option, as applicable, without a Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL, including, for the avoidance of doubt, (i) causing the transfer to Merger Sub of any Company Common Stock owned by Parent and any other subsidiary of Parent and (ii) executing, acknowledging and filing with the Delaware Secretary a Certificate of Ownership and Merger. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 5.6 _No Solicitation of Transactions_. 

   

 (a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.6_, the Company and its officers and directors shall, and the Company shall instruct and cause its Representatives and Subsidiaries and their Representatives to, immediately from the date hereof until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with  _Article VII_, not: 

   

 (i) initiate, solicit, propose, encourage (including by providing information) or take any action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; 

   

 (ii) engage in or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide any information or data concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or provide any information or data concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person pursuant to any commercial arrangement, joint venture arrangement, or other existing agreement or arrangement if it is reasonably likely that the Person receiving the confidential information could use such information for purposes of evaluating or developing an Acquisition Proposal; 

   

 (iii) grant any waiver, amendment or release under any standstill or confidentiality agreement, the Rights Agreement or Takeover Statutes; 

   

 (iv) approve, endorse, recommend, or execute or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or that contradicts this Agreement or requires the Company to abandon this Agreement; or 

   

 (v) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

   

The Company will, and will cause its Representatives to, promptly cease and
cause to be terminated, any existing activities, discussions or negotiations
with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, and will promptly request the return of all confidential
information provided by or on behalf of the Company to any and all
Persons (including Project Alta Merger Corp., Project Alta Holdings Corp.,
their sponsors and any of their affiliates or representatives) who have had
such discussions or negotiations or who have entered into confidentiality
agreements with the Company pertaining to an Acquisition Proposal or similar
transaction. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.6(a)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, but subject to the penultimate sentence of this _Section _  

   ##### 

  

    

 _5.6(b)_ , at any time following the date hereof and prior to, but not after,
the Acceptance Date, the Company may, subject to compliance with this
_Section 5.6_: 

   

 (i) provide information in response to a request therefor to a Person who has made an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement if and only if, prior to providing such information, the Company has received from the Person so requesting such information an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, _provided_ that the Company shall promptly make available to Parent any material information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person making such Acquisition Proposal that is given such access and that was not previously made available to Parent or the Parent Representatives; or 

   

 (ii) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made such an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal; 

   

 _provided_ , that prior to taking any action described in _Section
5.6(b)(i)_ or  _Section 5.6(b)(ii)_ above, (A) the Company Board of
Directors shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would violate the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Laws, and (B) the Company Board
of Directors shall have determined in good faith, based on the
information then available and after consultation with its independent
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal. Without modifying the generality of the foregoing, prior
to engaging in substantive discussions or negotiations with a
Person submitting an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal, the Company,
after consultation with its Representatives shall make a determination that,
to the best of the Companys Knowledge: (x) such Person is reasonably likely
to have adequate sources of financing or adequate funds to consummate such
Acquisition Proposal and (y) such Person has stated in writing that it does
not propose obtaining financing as a condition to its obligation to consummate
such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall not provide any such Person with
access to non-public information until the preceding criteria are satisfied.
The Company shall require any Person submitting an unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal to include any proposed changes to the terms of this Agreement. 

   

 (c) Except as expressly provided by _Section 5.6(d)_, at any time after the date hereof, neither the Company Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall: 

   

 (i) (A) withhold, withdraw (or not continue to make), qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw (or not continue to make), qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent or the Merger Sub, the Company Recommendation with respect to the Offer or the Merger, (B) adopt, approve or recommend or propose to adopt, approve or recommend (publicly or otherwise) an Acquisition Proposal, (C) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days after Parent so requests in writing (provided that Parent may make such request no more than two (2) times) or at a time when an Acquisition Proposal has been made and not withdrawn, (D) 

   ##### 

  

    

fail to recommend against any Acquisition Proposal subject to Regulation
14D under the Exchange Act in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 within twenty (20) Business Days after the commencement of
such Acquisition Proposal or (E) fail to include the Company Recommendation
in the Schedule 14D-9 related to the Offer and the Proxy Statement (any
action described in clauses (A) through (E), a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "); or 

   

 (ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any Acquisition Agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement (i) at any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or any committee thereof) may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so is reasonably likely to violate the directors fiduciary duties under applicable laws, and (ii) at any time prior to the Acceptance Date, if the Company has received a written Acquisition Proposal from any Person that is not withdrawn and that the Company Board of Directors concludes constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board of Directors may authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement to enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, provided, however, that the Company may take the action provided for in this clause (ii), if and only if: 

   

 (A) the Company shall have complied with its obligations under this _Section 5.6_ in all material respects; 

   

 (B) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent at least five (5) Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), to the effect that the Company Board has received a written Acquisition Proposal that is not withdrawn and that the Company Board of Directors concludes constitutes a Superior Proposal and, absent any revision to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board of Directors has resolved to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 5.6(d)_, which notice shall specify the basis for such termination, including the identity of the party making the Superior Proposal and the material terms thereof; and 

   

 (C) prior to effecting such termination, the Company shall, and shall cause their financial and legal advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and the Parent Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal;  _provided_ , that in the event of any material revisions to the Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board of Directors has determined to be a Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.6_ (including this  _Section 5.6_ (d)) with respect to such new written notice. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.6_ shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Company Board of Directors from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders), or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.6_ to the contrary, the Company and the Company Board of Directors may not take, agree or resolve to take any action that would result in the Company Common Stockholders no longer being capable under Delaware Law of validly adopting this Agreement. 

   

 (f) From and after the date hereof, the Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event, within two days) notify Parent if any proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (including any material amendments thereto) are received by, any non-public information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or any of its Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such offer or proposal and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (subject to any pre-existing confidentiality agreements binding upon the Company). Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall communicate with any Person who has made an Acquisition Proposal with respect to such Acquisition Proposal or any related matter during the term of this Agreement. 

   

 (g) The Company agrees that in the event any of its Representatives takes any action which, if taken by the Company, would constitute a breach of this _Section 5.6_, then the Company shall be deemed to be in breach of this _Section 5.6_. 

  

 Section 5.7 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or make such public statement as may be required by Law or Order or the applicable rules of Nasdaq or any listing agreement if it has used its commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other party and to obtain such partys consent but has been unable to do so prior to the time such press release or public statement is so required to be issued or made. 

  

 Section 5.8 _Litigation_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to defend any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging, or seeking damages or other relief as a result of, the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, including seeking to have any Order adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents entered by any court or other Governmental Entity promptly vacated or reversed. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 5.9 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. 

   

 (a) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, advance expenses to, and hold harmless all past and present officers and directors of the Company (" _Indemnified Persons_ ") to the fullest extent permitted by law and the same extent and in the same manner such persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the DGCL, the Company Certificate of Incorporation and the Company Bylaws for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, in the case of advancement of expenses, any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, to the extent required by the DGCL, to repay such advance if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification. The Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation, advancement and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Persons as those contained in the Company Certificate of Incorporation and the Company Bylaws as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company, unless such a modification is required by Law. 

   

 (b) The Company shall negotiate and purchase "tail" insurance coverage from the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurers, or from other insurers, that provides for a period of six (6) years that is no less favorable in both amount and terms and conditions of coverage than the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance programs, or if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is not available, the best available coverage (" _D andO Insurance_"); provided however that the aggregate cost for the purchase of such DandO Insurance (for the entire six (6) year tail coverage period) shall not exceed more than 250% of the aggregate premium paid by the Company for the existing directors and officers liability and fiduciary liability insurance program, provided, further, that should the cost of DandO Insurance exceed the 250% cap, the Company shall instead purchase the best available coverage for 250% of the aggregate premium paid by the Company for the existing directors and officers liability and fiduciary liability insurance program. 

   

 (c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 5.9. 

   

 (d) The obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person or any other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance (and their heirs and representatives) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified 

   ##### 

  

    

Person or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance (and their
heirs and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons
who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance (and their heirs and
representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 5.9_, with full rights of enforcement against the Surviving
Corporation and Parent as if a party thereto. The rights of the
Indemnified Persons and other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO
Insurance (and their heirs and representatives) under this _Section 5.9_
shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that
such persons may have under the charters, bylaws or other equivalent
organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of
or entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable law
(whether at law or in equity). 

   

 (e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.9_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies. 

  

 Section 5.10 _Conveyance Taxes_. The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees, and any similar taxes which become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are required or permitted to be filed on or before the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 5.11 _Delisting_. Each of the parties agrees to cooperate with each other in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to delist the Company Common Stock from Nasdaq and terminate registration under the Exchange Act, provided that such delisting and termination shall not be effective until or after the Effective Time. After the Effective Time, the Company shall also, upon Parents request, take all action necessary to elect to be treated as a "controlled company" as defined by Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5615(c) and make all necessary filings and disclosures associated with such status. 

  

 Section 5.12 _Financing_. 

   

 (a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (a) negotiate definitive agreements with respect to the Financings on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Financing Commitments or, to the extent the Financing Commitments are not available to Parent, on other terms not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent) and (b) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions set forth in such Financing Commitments applicable to Parent and Merger Sub that are within their control. If any portion of the Financing Commitments becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Financing Commitments, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on terms not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent) as promptly as 

   ##### 

  

    

practicable following the occurrence of such event; provided, that
consummating the Financings is not a condition to consummation of the Offer
or the Merger and Parent shall draw down each Financing Commitment in full
and without condition in order to consummate the Offer and the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby. Parent shall give the Company prompt
notice of any material breach by any party to any Financing Commitment,
of which Parent becomes aware, or any termination of any Financing
Commitment. The Company shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate, and to
cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to cooperate, with Parent and
Representatives of Parent in connection with obtaining the Financing,
including, without limitation, participating in the preparation of any pro
forma financial statements, the preparation of rating agencies presentations,
the preparation of any comfort letters and offering memoranda and
registration statements, and, at Parents request and expense, marketing
efforts conducted in connection with the Financings. 

   

 (b) Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions, and do (or cause to be done) all things necessary or advisable to obtain the Financing contemplated by each Financing Commitment and, subject to Section 4.5, to fully enforce each Financing Commitment, including but not limited to (i) maintaining in effect each Financing Commitment without any amendment, alteration, or waiver that impairs Parents ability to provide the funds necessary to complete the Offer and the Merger, (ii) satisfying on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub set forth in each Financing Commitment that are material to the completion of the Financings and (iii) consummating the Financings contemplated by each Financing Commitment (or any alternative financing contemplated by an Alternative Financing Commitment) at or prior to the Acceptance Date. 

  

 Section 5.13 _Employee Matters_. 

   

 (a) After the Effective Time and through the end of the fiscal year of the Company in which the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving Corporation shall provide to Company Employees employee benefits (other than any bonus or incentive plans, and individual employment agreements) that will, in the aggregate, be substantially similar to those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to its employees as of the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) With respect to the benefit plans in which the Companys employees participate following the Effective Time (other than any bonus or incentive plans, and individual employment agreements), Parent agrees that it shall (i) recognize all service performed for the Company prior to the Effective Time for eligibility and vesting purposes, (ii) waive any pre-existing condition exclusions (other than pre-existing conditions that, as of the Effective Time, have not been satisfied under any Company Benefit Plan) and (iii) provide that any deductible, coinsurance or out-of-pocket expenses incurred on or before the Effective Time during the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs under any applicable Company Benefit Plan providing health benefits will be taken into account for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (c) Nothing in this _Section 5.13_ or any other provision of this Agreement shall create any third-party beneficiary right for the benefit of any Person other than the parties to this Agreement, or any right to employment or continued employment or to a particular term or condition of employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates. Nothing in this _Section 5.13_ or any other provision of this Agreement (i) shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) shall limit the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them. 

   

 (d) Between the date of this Agreement and the Acceptance Date, the Company shall use reasonable efforts to cause any employee involved in product development at the Company or at any of its Subsidiaries who has not executed an Intellectual Property assignment and confidentiality agreement to execute such an agreement in the form reasonably approved by the Parent. 

  

 Section 5.14 _Release of Liens_. Between the date of this Agreement and the Acceptance Date, upon the request of Parent the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the release of any liens on its tangible or intangible assets. 

  

 Section 5.15 _Directors_. Promptly upon the acceptance for payment of, and payment by Merger Sub for, shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, the parties hereto shall use best efforts such that Merger Sub may designate such number of members of the Company Board of Directors as will give Merger Sub, subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act, representation on the Company Board of Directors equal to at least that number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, which is the product of (a) the total number of directors on the Company Board of Directors (giving effect to the directors elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by (b) the percentage that (i) such number of shares of Company Common Stock so accepted for payment and paid for by Merger Sub plus the number of shares of Company Common Stock otherwise owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent bears to (ii) the number of such shares outstanding; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that Merger Subs designees are appointed or elected to the Company Board of Directors, then until the Effective Time the Company shall use best efforts to cause the Company Board of Directors to have at least two (2) directors who are (i) directors on the date of this Agreement and (ii) independent directors for purposes of the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq (such directors, the " _Independent Directors_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that if any Independent Director is unable to serve due to death or disability or any other reason, the parties hereto shall use best efforts such that the remaining Independent Directors may elect or designate another individual (or individuals) who serve(s) as a director (or directors) on the date of this Agreement (provided that such individual is an independent director for purposes of the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq) to fill the vacancy, and such director (or directors) shall be deemed to be an Independent Director (or Independent Directors) for purposes of this Agreement. If no Independent Director remains prior to the Acceptance Date, the parties hereto shall use best efforts such that a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company at the time of the execution of this Agreement shall be entitled to designate two (2) 

   ##### 

  

 

individuals to fill such vacancies who shall not be employees of or otherwise
affiliated with the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, and such individuals shall
be deemed Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement. Following the
election or appointment of Parents designees to the Company Board of
Directors pursuant to this Section 5.15, and until the Effective Time,
the approval of a majority of the Independent Directors shall be required to
authorize: (a) any amendment or termination of this Agreement, (b) any
amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company or the Bylaws of
the Company (except for the Merger), (c) any extension by the Company of the
time for the performance of any of the obligations of Merger Sub or Parent,
(d) waiver of any of the Companys rights under this Agreement or any other
action adversely affecting the rights of the Company Common Stockholders
(other than Parent or Merger Sub), and (e) any other consent of the Company
or the Company Board of Directors with respect to this Agreement, the
Offer or the Merger or any other transaction contemplated thereby or in
connection therewith. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the
authorization of any such matter by a majority of the Independent Directors
shall constitute the authorization of such matter by the Company Board
of Directors, and no other action on the part of the Company or any other
director of the Company shall be required to authorize such matter. Following
the Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time, neither Parent nor
Merger Sub shall take any action to remove any Independent Director unless
the removal shall be for cause. Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall
take all action requested by Parent necessary to effect any such election,
including mailing to its stockholders the Information Statement containing
the information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder, and the Company shall make such mailing with the
mailing of the Schedule 14D-9 (provided that Merger Sub shall have provided to
the Company on a timely basis all information required to be included in the
Information Statement with respect to Merger Subs designees). In connection
with the foregoing, the Company shall promptly, at the option of Merger Sub,
either increase the size of the Company Board or obtain the resignation
of such number of its current directors as is necessary to enable Merger
Subs designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board of Directors
as provided above. 

   

 Section 5.16 _Rights Agreement; Consequences if Rights Triggered_. The Company Board shall take all action requested in writing by Parent in order to render the Rights inapplicable to the Offer, the Merger and the Transactions. Except as approved in writing by Parent, the Company Board of Directors shall not (i) waive or amend any provision of the Rights Plan, (ii) redeem the Rights or (iii) take any action with respect to, or make any determination under, the Rights Plan. If any Distribution Date, Share Acquisition Date or Triggering Event occurs under the Rights Plan at any time during the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall make such adjustment to the Offer Price and the Merger Consideration as the Company and Parent shall mutually agree so as to preserve the economic benefits that the Company and Parent each reasonably expected on the date of this Agreement to receive as a result of the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions.

 Section 7.2 _Expenses; Company Termination Fee_. 

   

 (a) _Expense Allocation_. Except as otherwise specified in this _Section 7.2_ or agreed in writing by the parties, all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Transaction Documents, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense. 

   

 (b) _Company Termination Fee_. Subject to the last sentence of this Section 7.2(b), if this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_ , or (ii) by Parent pursuant to _Sections 7.1(d)_, _7.1(f)_ , or  _7.1(i)_ (if, with respect to _Section 7.1(i)_, the failure of the Offer to be consummated is the result of the existence of any of the conditions set forth in clauses (a), (c), (d), (g) or (i) of _Annex A_ to this Agreement), then the Company shall promptly, and in any event within five (5) Business Days after the date of such termination (except as provided in the proviso below), pay Parent the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Subject to the last sentence of this Section 7.2(b), if this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent pursuant to Section _7.1(d)_ or Section _7.1(f)_ or by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(c), or (ii) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section _7.1(e)_ or by Parent pursuant to Section  _7.1(i)_ in each case only if the failure of the Acceptance Date to have occurred prior to the date of such termination is the result of (x) the failure to satisfy the Minimum Tender Condition Threshold or (y) the existence of any of the conditions to the Offer set forth in clauses (a), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) or (i) of _Annex A_ , then the Company shall promptly, and in any event within five (5) Business Days after the date of such termination, repay to Parent the Initial Funding Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if Merger Sub extends the Offer pursuant to clause (ii) or clause (iv) of the fifth sentence of Section 1.1(a) of this Agreement when all of the conditions to the Offer have been met then, notwithstanding a subsequent termination of this Agreement, under no circumstances shall the Company be obligated to pay the Company Termination Fee or to repay the Initial Funding Amount to Parent if such obligation arises only from events that occur after the Offer is extended, _provided_ , that this restriction shall not apply if the Company shall have willfully failed to perform any obligation to be performed by it under this Agreement at such time of termination and the failure of such performance has resulted in the termination of this Agreement. 

   

 (c) _Expense Reimbursement_. In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(e)_ or _Section 7.1(i)_ in each case only if the failure of the Acceptance Date to have occurred prior to the date of such termination is the result of the failure to satisfy the Minimum Tender Condition in circumstances where the Company Termination Fee is not required to be paid without giving effect to the final sentence of Section 7.2(b), then the Company shall, following receipt of an invoice therefor, promptly (in any event within two (2) Business Days) pay all of Parents reasonably documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by Parent and its Affiliates on or prior to the termination of this Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Financing) in an amount not to exceed $3,000,000 (the " _Parent_  

   ##### 

  

    

 _Expenses_ "), by wire transfer of same day funds to one or more
accounts designated by Parent; _provided_ , the Company shall not be
obligated to pay any Parent Expenses if Parent and Merger Sub have not
performed in all material respects all obligations to be performed by them
under this Agreement at such time of termination and the failure of such
performance has resulted in the termination of this Agreement. 

   

 (d) _Parent Termination Fee_. If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to  _Section 7.1(e)_ (but not if the failure of the Acceptance Date to have occurred prior to the date of such termination is the result of (x) the failure to satisfy the Minimum Tender Condition, (y) the existence of any of the conditions set forth in _Annex A_  to this Agreement (other than as a result of the existence of the condition set forth in clause (k) of _Annex A_ to this Agreement), or (z) the failure to receive the HSR Clearance prior to the Outside Termination Date), _Section 7.1(g)_ or _Section 7.1(h)_ , or (ii) Merger Sub has extended the Offer pursuant to clause (ii) or clause (iv) of the fifth sentence of Section 1.1(a) of this Agreement at a time when the Minimum Tender Condition and HSR Clearance are met and none of the conditions set forth in clauses (a) through (j) of _Annex A_ to this Agreement are in existence, and this Agreement is subsequently terminated as a result of events that occur after the Offer is extended, then Parent shall promptly (but in any event within 2 Business Days) pay to the Company the Parent Termination Fee by wire transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts designated by the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Parent does not promptly pay such amount to the Company, then the Company may cause the Escrowed Funds to be paid to the Company pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. 

   

 (e) _Acknowledgment_. The parties acknowledge that (i) the agreements contained in this _Section 7.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, (ii) the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under circumstances where a Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and therefore, the amounts payable pursuant Section 7.2(b) and Section 7.2(d) are not a penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and the Company, respectively, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) without the agreements contained in this _Section 7.2_, the parties would not have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to Section 7.2(b) or Parent fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to Section 7.2(d), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in Section 7.2(b) or any portion thereof or a judgment against Parent for the amount set forth in Section 7.2(d) or any portion thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or Parent shall pay to the Company, on the other hand, its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of such amount or portion thereof at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment. Parent agrees that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the Company Termination Fee is paid in 

   ##### 

  

    

accordance with this Section 7.2, the payment of such Company Termination Fee
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent, its Subsidiaries,
shareholders, Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and Representatives
against the Company or any of its Representatives or Affiliates for, and in
no event will the party being paid any Company Termination Fee or any other
such person seek to recover any other money damages or seek any other remedy
based on a claim in law or equity with respect to (1) any loss
suffered, directly or indirectly, as a result of the failure of the Merger to
be consummated, (2) the termination of this Agreement, (3) any liabilities or
obligations arising under this Agreement or (4) any claims or actions arising
out of or relating to any breach, termination or failure of or under this
Agreement, and upon payment of any Company Termination Fee in accordance with
this Section 7.2, neither the party paying such fee, nor any
Representative or Affiliate of such party shall have any further liability or
obligation to the other party relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company agrees that notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the Parent
Termination Fee is paid in accordance with this Section 7.2, the payment
of such Parent Termination Fee (and up to an additional $24,300,000 of
liability, if damages incurred exceed $25,700,000) shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Company, its Subsidiaries, shareholders, Affiliates,
officers, directors, employees and Representatives against Parent and Merger
Sub for, and in no event will the party being paid any Parent Termination Fee
or any other such person seek to recover any other money damages or seek
any other remedy based on a claim in law or equity with respect to (1) any
loss suffered, directly or indirectly, as a result of the failure of the
Merger to be consummated, (2) the termination of this Agreement, (3) any
liabilities or obligations arising under this Agreement or (4) any claims or
actions arising out of or relating to any breach, termination or failure of
or under this Agreement in an aggregate amount in excess of Fifty
Million Dollars (which amount shall include the amount of any Parent
Termination Fee paid), and upon payment of such amount, neither the Parent or
Merger Sub shall have any further liability or obligation to the Company
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. The Company agrees that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, in the event of a termination of this Agreement, or
obligation of Merger Sub or Parent to pay the Parent Termination Fee, in no
event shall any of the Representatives or Affiliates of Parent or Merger Sub
be liable to the Company for any damages or amounts owed to the Company under
this Agreement, and in no event will the Company seek to recover from any
such Representatives any money damages or seek any other remedy based on a
claim in law or equity with respect to (1) any loss suffered, directly or
indirectly, as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated, (2)
the termination of this Agreement, (3) any liabilities or obligations arising
under this Agreement or (4) any claims or actions arising out of or relating
to any breach, termination or failure of or under this Agreement. 

  

 Section 7.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in _Section 7.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of Parent and Merger Sub or the Company, except that (a) the provisions of _Section 7.1_, _Section 7.2_ , this _Section 7.3_ and _Article VIII_ shall survive such termination and (b) nothing herein shall relieve any party from 

   ##### 

  

 

liability for specific performance or damages for any material breach of this
Agreement or for fraud in connection with this Agreement. 

   

 Section 7.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties in writing at any time before or after the Company Required Vote has been obtained and prior to the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after the Company Required Vote shall have been obtained, no such amendment, modification or supplement shall be made which by Law requires the further approval of the Company Common Stockholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended, changed or supplemented or otherwise modified except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of all of the parties. 

  

 Section 7.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, or (c) subject to the provisions of _Section 7.4_, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other parties contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

 _Conditions of the Offer_  

    

 Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement, Merger Sub shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Merger Subs obligation to pay for or return tendered shares of Company Common Stock promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer unless (i) there shall have been validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer that number of shares of Company Common Stock which would represent both (x) a majority of the Fully Diluted Shares and (y) at least the number of shares necessary for the Merger Sub to acquire in the Offer so that when added with the amount of shares that the Merger Sub is able to purchase pursuant to the Additional Share Option Merger Sub would own a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to satisfy the Short-Form Threshold as of the closing date of the Offer (the " _Minimum Tender Condition_ ") and (ii) any waiting period under the HSR Act applicable to the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer shall have expired or been terminated (" _HSR Clearance")_. The term " _Fully Diluted Shares_ " means all outstanding securities entitled generally to vote in the election of directors of the Company on a fully diluted basis, after giving effect to the exercise or conversion of all options other than the option granted to Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to Section 1.11 of this Agreement, rights and securities exercisable or convertible into such voting securities, other than potential dilution attributable to the Rights. Furthermore, notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement, Merger Sub shall not be required to commence the Offer, accept for payment or to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock not theretofore accepted for payment or paid for if, on or prior to the acceptance of such Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, any of the following conditions exists (it being understood that with respect to the commencement of the offer, only the condition set forth in clauses (a), (b), (c), (d), (g), (h) or (j) shall be applicable): 

   

 (a) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred. 

   

 (b) a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have (i) enacted a law that is in effect and renders the Offer or the Merger illegal in the United States or any State thereof, or (ii) formally issued an injunction that is in effect and prohibits the Offer or the Merger in the United States or any State thereof. 

   

 (c) (i) other than the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 3.1(a)_ , _3.2_ , _3.3_ and _3.20_ the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall not be true and correct (without giving effect to any materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect qualifications set forth therein) as of the date of this Agreement and as of such time as if made at and as of such time (except to the extent that any such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which case such representation and warranty shall not be true and correct as of such earlier date), except for such failures to be true and correct which, individually or in the aggregate, have not and would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect; (ii) the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 3.1(a)_, _3.2_ ,  _3.3_ and _3.20_ shall not be true and correct 

  

 _Signature Page to Agreement and Plan of Merger_

in all material respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of such time
as if made at and as of such time (except to the extent that any such
representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which
case such representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all
material respects as of such earlier date); provided that with respect to the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.3(a), (b) and (d),
as long as, despite all such understatements in the aggregate, Parent and
Merger Sub are still able to exercise the Additional Share Option in an
amount sufficient to meet the Short-Form Threshold, the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding or issuable upon exercise or
conversion of any outstanding Company Common Stock Rights as of the
date hereof, taken together, shall not be understated by more than 50,000
shares of Company Common Stock (with each Company Common Stock Right being
counted as a fraction of a share of Company Common Stock equal to the result
obtained by dividing the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the exercise
price of such Company Common Stock Right by the Offer Price) plus an
additional number of shares equal to (w) the amount of any cash reduction in
the transaction Bonus Pool disclosed by the Company on Section 3.13(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter divided by (x) the Offer Price; plus an additional
number of shares equal to (y) the amount, if any, by which Company Closing
Cash exceeds the Minimum Closing Cash divided by (z) the per share Merger
Consideration. Prior to the acceptance of the shares in the Offer, Parent
shall have received a certificate of an executive officer of the Company on
its behalf to certifying that this condition does not exist as of the
expiration of the Offer. 

   

 (d) the Company shall not have performed or complied in all material respects with all agreements and covenants required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by it. Prior to the acceptance of the shares in the Offer, Parent shall have received a certificate of an executive officer of the Company on its behalf to certifying that this condition does not exist immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer. 

   

 (e) the Company Closing Cash is less than an amount equal to the Minimum Closing Cash. 

   

 (f) Parent shall not have received a certificate from the Company, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_, to the effect that the Company is not a U.S. real property holding company. 

   

 (g) there shall have occurred a Company Material Adverse Effect that is continuing. 

   

 (h) the Company shall not have filed all Company Reports required to be filed with the SEC prior to the expiration of the Offer. 

   

 (i) the Company shall not have delivered to Parent evidence of the release of all the liens in and to the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are reasonably requested by Parent and evidence of termination of all financing statements filed with respect to such liens, except Permitted Encumbrances (for this purpose clause (vii) of the 

   ##### 

  

    

definition of "Permitted Encumbrance" shall mean other liens in an amount not
more than $500,000 in the aggregate. 

   

 (j) no Person shall have become an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights Plan). 

   

 (k) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms. 

  

 The foregoing conditions (other than the Minimum Tender Condition) are for the sole benefit of Merger Sub and Parent and may be asserted by Merger Sub or Parent or may be waived by Merger Sub and Parent in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion. The failure by Parent, Merger Sub or any other affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
