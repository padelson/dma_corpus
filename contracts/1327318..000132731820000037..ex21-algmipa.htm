Estimated Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the
definitions in this Agreement together with reasonable supporting detail of
each calculation contained therein. The Seller shall consider in good faith
any comments of Buyer to the Estimated Closing Statement.



(b) Reconciliation Procedures.



(i) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than 90 days after the
Closing Date, the Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Seller a signed
certificate (the "Final Closing Statement"), prepared in the same manner as
the Estimated Closing Statement, setting forth the Buyer's good faith
determination, as of 12:01 AM, Pacific time, on the Closing Date, of the Cash
(the "Final Cash," subject to any adjustment pursuant to Section 2.04(b)(ii)),
the Indebtedness (the "Final Indebtedness," subject to any adjustment pursuant
to Section 2.04(b)(ii)), the Transaction Expenses (the "Final Transaction
Expenses," subject to any adjustment pursuant to Section 2.04(b)(ii)) and the
Net Working Capital (the "Final Net Working Capital," subject to any
adjustment pursuant to Section 2.04(b)(ii)). The Final Closing Statement shall
be prepared in accordance with Exhibit D and such process is not intended to
permit the introduction of different accounting methods, policies, principles,
practices, procedures, classifications or estimation methodologies for the
purpose of determining the Final Cash, Final Net Working Capital, Final
Indebtedness and Final Transaction Expenses. From and after delivery of the
Final Closing Statement, the Buyer shall provide the Seller and its authorized
Representatives with reasonable access during normal business hours to the
books and records, relevant personnel and accountants relevant to the
preparation of the Final Closing Statement of the Company.



(ii) For 30 days after its receipt of the Final Closing Statement, the Seller
shall have the right to object thereto. Any such objection made by the Seller
shall be accompanied by materials showing in reasonable detail the Seller's
support for its position. The Seller shall be deemed to have waived any rights
to object to the Final 



Closing Statement unless it furnishes its written objections, together with
supporting materials, to the Buyer within such 30-day period ("Notice of
Disagreement"). Representatives of the Buyer and the Seller shall seek in good
faith to resolve any differences in their respective positions with respect to
the Final Closing Statement. If the Buyer and the Seller are unable to agree
on the Final Closing Statement within 30 days of the Buyer's receipt of the
Notice of Disagreement, then PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (or such other
independent accounting firm of recognized national standing in the United
States as may be mutually selected by the Buyer and the Seller) shall resolve
any remaining disagreements. If neither PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP nor any
such mutually selected accounting firm is willing and able to serve in such
capacity, then the Seller shall deliver to the Buyer a list of three other
accounting firms of recognized national standing and the Buyer shall select
one of such three accounting firms (such firm as is ultimately selected, the
"Accountant"). The Seller and the Buyer shall execute any agreement reasonably
required by the Accountant for its engagement hereunder. The Accountant shall
be charged with determining as promptly as practicable, but in any event
within 30 days after the date on which such dispute is referred to the
Accountant, whether the Final Cash, the Final Indebtedness, the Final Net
Working Capital and the Final Closing Statement were prepared in accordance
with this Agreement and (only with respect to the disagreements as to the
items set forth in the Notice of Disagreement and submitted to the Accountant
and any other items affected by the resolution of those disputed items, and in
all instances, the Accountant's determinations must be within the range of the
amounts asserted by the Buyer and the Seller in the Final Closing Statement
and the Notice of Disagreement, respectively) whether and to what extent, if
any, the Final Cash, the Final Indebtedness, the Final Net Working Capital,
the Final Transaction Expenses or the Final Closing Statement require
adjustment. Each Party shall furnish to the Accountant such working papers and
other relevant documents and information relating to the disputed items, and
shall provide interviews and answer questions as the Accountant may reasonably
request in connection with its determination of such disputed items; provided,
that a copy of such documents shall be delivered to the Buyer and the Seller
and each shall have a right to respond in writing to the written statement of
the other. In resolving disputes pursuant to this Section 2.04(b)(ii), the
Accountant will be deemed an expert and not an arbitrator. The Accountant
shall allocate its costs and expenses between the Buyer and the Seller based
upon the percentage of the contested amount submitted to the Accountant that
is ultimately awarded to the Buyer on the one hand and the Seller on the other
hand, such that the Buyer bears a percentage of such costs and expenses equal
to the percentage of the contested amount awarded to the Seller and the Seller
bears a percentage of such costs and expenses equal to the percentage of the
contested amount awarded to the Buyer. If there is no timely Notice of
Disagreement, the Final Closing Statement as determined by the Buyer shall be
binding and final for purposes of this Agreement. If there is a timely Notice
of Disagreement, the determination of the Accountant shall be binding and
final for purposes of this Agreement; provided, that, before the Accountant
renders a final decision, the Parties may mutually enter into an agreement to
resolve any dispute under this Section 2.04(b)(ii), which resolution shall, if
it includes an agreement regarding any disputed amounts under this Section
2.04(b)(ii) and the allocation of the costs and expenses of the Accountant
incurred before the Accountant is notified thereof, be binding and final as of
the date of such agreement. 



(iii) Within two Business Days after the final determination of the Final
Closing Statement under Section 2.04(b)(ii), (A) the Buyer shall pay to the
Seller an amount equal to the Adjustment Amount, if the Adjustment Amount is a
positive number, and (B) the Seller shall pay to the Buyer an amount equal to
the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount, if the Adjustment Amount is a
negative number. Such amounts shall be paid, in immediately available funds,
pursuant to instructions previously delivered by the Buyer or the Seller, as
applicable, to the other.



(iv) Any payment made pursuant to Section 2.04(b)(iii) shall, for Tax
purposes, be deemed to be an adjustment to the consideration payable to the
Seller to the extent permitted by applicable Law.



Section 2.05 Earnout.



(a) Earnout Payment. If the Earnout Revenue is greater than $18,400,000, then
the Buyer shall pay the Seller pursuant to Section 2.05(c) an amount (the
"Earnout Payment") equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the amount
by which the Earnout Revenue exceeds $18,400,000 by (ii) a fraction, (x) the
numerator of which is 30 and (y) the denominator of which is 7; provided, that
the Earnout Payment shall in no case exceed $15,000,000.



(b) Calculations. The Buyer shall deliver to the Seller a statement containing
its calculation of the Earnout Payment due, if any, with appropriate
evidentiary support for the determination made therein, within 30 days
following the receipt by the Buyer of the audited financial statements of the
Buyer or one of its direct or indirect parents for the fiscal year 2022 (the
"Earnout Statement"). If, within 20 Business Days after the Seller's receipt
of the Earnout Statement, the Seller has not given the Buyer written notice of
objection to such Earnout Statement, or if the Seller earlier notifies the
Buyer that it has no objections thereto, the amount reflected in the Earnout
Statement shall be final upon the expiration of such period or the receipt of
such notice, as applicable, and the Earnout Payment, if any, shall be paid
pursuant to Section 2.05(c). If the Seller provides such notice of objection,
the Seller and the Buyer shall, during the 20 Business Day period following
the delivery of such notice, discuss in good faith a resolution of the matters
set forth in the notice of objection. If the Seller and the Buyer cannot
resolve all disputed matters by the end of such period, such matters shall be
submitted immediately to the Accountant for resolution. The provisions of
Section 2.04(b)(ii) regarding the timing of the Accountant's decision, the
scope of the review and the decision, the binding nature of the decision and
the fees and expenses of the Accountant shall apply to any dispute under this
Section 2.05(b) mutatis mutandis.



(c) Payment Details. The Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Seller
by wire transfer of immediately available funds the Earnout Payment, if any is
payable, within 30 days following the finalization of the amount of such
Earnout Payment pursuant to Section 2.05(b), whether by decision of the
Accountant, notice from the Seller that it has no objections or expiration
without objection of the period for objection.



(d) Operation of the Company. Following the date hereof, nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed to limit or restrict, directly or indirectly, the
discretion of the Buyer, 



or any of the Buyer's Affiliates, in directing the Company; provided, that
during the Earnout Period, the Buyer shall not take or permit to be taken any
action with the primary purpose of reducing the amount, or avoiding the
payment, of the Earnout Payment and no other reasonable business purpose (it
being agreed and understood by the Parties that, in alleging or proving a
breach of this proviso, the burden of proof shall be on the Person(s) bringing
such a claim or action). The Seller agrees that any payments that may be
payable pursuant to this Section 2.05 depend upon the performance of the
Company and that none of the Buyer or its Affiliates has made, or is making,
any representations or warranties or other promises regarding the current or
future performance of the Company and any such representations or warranties
or other promises have been and are hereby expressly disclaimed, and the
Seller agrees that the Seller is not relying on any such representations or
warranties and in no case shall the Seller or the Seller's Affiliates have or
assert any claims against the Buyer or the Buyer's Affiliates based on any
such representations or warranties or on the failure of the Company to achieve
any particular amount of Earnout Revenue or meet any other performance
projections or thresholds.



(e) Inspection of Records. The Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to,
keep books and records in sufficient detail to permit the Seller to confirm
the accuracy of the Earnout Statement. Following delivery of the Earnout
Statement, subject to applicable Law (including antitrust Laws) and any
reasonably appropriate accommodations or limitations (whether pursuant to
applicable Law or otherwise) as may then be in effect in light of the
Coronavirus Pandemic or similar circumstances, upon reasonable advance notice,
the Seller shall have the right to reasonably inspect all such records
covering all transactions relating to the computation of the Earnout Revenue
and the Earnout Payment during normal business hours , upon prior written
notice by the Seller to the Buyer and in a manner so as not to unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business of the Buyer solely to the extent
reasonably related to the Buyer's determination of the Earnout Statement (or
the calculations therein) reasonably requested by the Seller.



(f) Interim Reporting.



(i) Not later than December 31, 2021, the Buyer shall provide the Seller with
its forecast of the Earnout Revenue, prepared in good faith.



(ii) During the Earnout Period, within 45 days following the end of each
fiscal quarter of the Buyer, the Buyer shall provide the Seller with a report
which sets forth the actual Earnout Revenue earned by the Buyer from January
1, 2022 through the last day of such fiscal quarter of Buyer, prepared in good
faith.



(g) Tax Treatment. Any payment made pursuant to this Section 2.05 shall, for
Tax purposes, be deemed to be an adjustment to the consideration payable to
the Seller with respect to the Interests to the extent permitted by applicable
Law.



(h) Subrogation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
if the payment of the Earnout Payment on the date it is due hereunder would
result in a default under any of the Buyer's or its Affiliates' senior or
subordinated debt financing agreements or if a default exists thereunder at
the time the Earnout Payment becomes due that prohibits the payment of all or
a portion of the Earnout Payment pursuant to the terms of such senior or 



subordinated debt financing agreements, then the Buyer and the Company may
withhold payment of all or any portion of the Earnout Payment so prohibited
from being paid for the period beginning on the date that the Earnout Payment
is due and ending on the earlier of (x) the date that is six months after the
Earnout Payment is otherwise due and (y) the earlier date, if any, that the
payment of the Earnout Payment is no longer so prohibited pursuant to the
terms of such senior or subordinated debt financing agreements. During such
period, the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any
applicable restrictions under such senior or subordinated debt financing
agreements that prohibits the payment of all or a portion of the Earnout
Payment to be waived, amended or removed so as to enable the payment of the
Earnout Payment. The Buyer shall pay or caused to be paid any amounts it is
obligated to pay under this Section 2.05 as soon as the restrictions set forth
in this Section 2.05(h) no longer exist. Any amounts due and owing under this
Section 2.05 in respect of the Earnout Payment that are not paid when due
shall accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Rate,
calculated from the date such payment is otherwise due hereunder until the
actual date of payment.



(i) Transfers. The right of the Seller to receive any portion of the Earnout
Payment, if any, (i) is solely a contractual right and is not a security for
purposes of any federal or state securities Laws (and shall confer upon the
Seller only the rights of a general unsecured creditor under applicable state
Law), (ii) will not be represented by any form of certificate or instrument,
(iii) does not give the Seller any dividend rights, voting rights, liquidation
rights, preemptive rights or other rights common to holders of the Buyer's or
the Company's equity securities, (iv) is not redeemable and (v) may not be
sold, assigned, pledged, gifted, conveyed, transferred or otherwise disposed
of (a "Transfer"), except, in the case of an entity, by operation of Law or,
in the case of an individual, by will or the Laws of descent and distribution
(and any Transfer in violation of this Section 2.05(h)) shall be null and
void).



(j) Change of Control. Unless the Earnout Payment has earlier been paid (or it
has been earlier determined pursuant to Section 2.05(b) that no Earnout
Payment is owed), if, in connection with such Change of Control, the Person or
group acquiring control of the Buyer or its assets in such Change of Control
does not succeed to and assume the Buyer's obligations under this Section
2.05, then, not later than concurrently with the consummation of such Change
of Control, the Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Seller, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to $15,000,000,
regardless of whether any other amount or no amount at all would have been
payable pursuant to this Section 2.05, with the passage of time or otherwise,
had such Change of Control not occurred; provided, that a payment pursuant to
this Section 2.05(j) shall be in lieu, and without duplication, of an Earnout
Payment pursuant to Section 2.05(a).



Section 2.06 Escrow.



(a) Escrow Payment. If the total revenue recognized by the Company (determined
in accordance with GAAP) during the period from and including January 1, 2020
through and including December 31, 2020 (the "Company Revenue") is equal to or
greater than $18,600,000 (the "2020 Target"), then the Buyer and the Seller
shall cause the Escrow Agent to pay from the Escrow Account to the Seller
pursuant to Section 2.06(c) an amount equal $7,500,000. If the Company Revenue
is greater than $17,600,000 (the "Minimum Target") but less than the 2020
Target, then the Buyer and the Seller shall cause the Escrow Agent to pay 



from the Escrow Account to the Seller pursuant to Section 2.06(c) a portion of
the Escrow Amount based on linear interpolation beginning with $0 if the
Company Revenue is equal to the Minimum Target and $7,500,000 if the Company
Revenue is equal to the 2020 Target; provided, that the total payment from the
Escrow Account pursuant to this Section 2.06(a) shall in no case exceed
$7,500,000.



(b) Calculations. Prior to January 15, 2021, the Buyer shall deliver to the
Seller a statement containing its calculation of the payment due pursuant to
Section 2.06(a) (the "Escrow Payment"), if any, with appropriate evidentiary
support for the determination made therein (the "Performance Earnout
Statement"). If, within 20 Business Days after the Seller's receipt of the
Performance Earnout Statement, the Seller has not given the Buyer written
notice of objection to such Performance Earnout Statement, or if the Seller
earlier notifies the Buyer that it has no objections thereto, the amount
reflected in the Performance Earnout Statement shall be final upon the earlier
of the expiration of such period or the receipt of such notice and the Escrow
Payment, if any, shall be paid pursuant to Section 2.06(c). If the Seller
provides such notice of objection, the Seller and the Buyer shall, during the
20 Business Day period following the delivery of such notice, discuss in good
faith a resolution of the matters set forth in the notice of objection. If the
Seller and the Buyer cannot resolve all disputed matters by the end of such
period, such matters shall be submitted immediately to the Accountant for
resolution. The provisions of Section 2.04(b)(ii) regarding the timing of the
Accountant's decision, the scope of the review and the decision, the binding
nature of the decision and the fees and expenses of the Accountant shall apply
to any dispute under this Section 2.06(b) mutatis mutandis.



(c) Payment Details. Immediately following the final determination of the
Escrow Payment, if any, the Buyer and the Seller shall deliver a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent to direct the Escrow Agent (i) to make a
payment to the Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, of an
amount equal to the Escrow Payment, if any (up to the Escrow Amount), from the
Escrow Account and (ii) if the Escrow Payment is less than the Escrow Funds,
to make a payment to the Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, any funds remaining in the Escrow Account after payment of any amounts
contemplated by clause (i).



(d) Operation of the Company. If the Closing occurs on or before December 31,
2020, then during the period beginning on the Closing and ending on December
31, 2020, the Company shall, and the Buyer shall cause the Company to:



(i) maintain the Company's books and records in accordance with GAAP;



(ii) not take or permit to be taken any action with the primary purpose of
reducing the amount, or avoiding the payment, of the Escrow Payment and no
other reasonable business purpose; and



(iii) not take any action that would reasonably be expected to delay the
recognition of revenue by the Company or the delivery of services or products
to a customer of the Company. 



(e) Inspection of Records. The Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to,
keep books and records in sufficient detail to permit the Seller to confirm
the accuracy of the Performance Earnout Statement. Following delivery of the
Performance Earnout Statement, subject to applicable Law (including antitrust
Laws) and any reasonably appropriate accommodations or limitations (whether
pursuant to applicable Law or otherwise) as may then be in effect in light of
the Coronavirus Pandemic or similar circumstances, upon reasonable advance
notice, the Seller shall have the right to reasonably inspect all such records
covering all transactions relating to the computation of the Company Revenue
and the Escrow Payment during normal business hours, upon prior written notice
by the Seller to the Buyer and in a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere
with the conduct of the business of the Buyer solely to the extent reasonably
related to the Buyer's determination of the Performance Earnout Statement (or
the calculations therein) reasonably requested by the Seller.



Section 2.07 Withholding. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Buyer, the Company, and their respective Affiliates, agents and
designees shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as such Person is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding were made.

individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to prevent, materially
delay or materially impair the consummation of the Transactions.

aggregate, reasonably be likely to prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the consummation of the Transactions.



(b) No Violation. The Seller's execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, and of the Ancillary Documents to which the Seller is a party, do
not, and the consummation of the Transactions will not, constitute or result
in (i) a breach or violation of, or a default under, any provisions of the
Seller's Organizational Documents or (ii) with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, a breach or violation of, a termination (or right of
termination) or default under, the creation or acceleration of any obligations
under or the creation of a Lien on any of the assets of the Seller pursuant to

the Seller's Knowledge, threatened against the Seller that relate to the

connection with the origination, negotiation or consummation of the

warranties expressly made by the Seller and the Company in this Article III as
modified by the Seller Disclosure Letter, Article IV as modified by the Seller
Disclosure Letter and by the applicable party or Person in any Ancillary

its business only in, and has not engaged in any material transaction other
than in accordance with, the ordinary course of such business, consistent with
past practices, and the Company has not taken any actions that, had such

Section 4.09 Employee Benefits. 



(a) Benefit Plans. The Company does not maintain or sponsor any Benefit Plans.
Employees participate in Benefit Plans maintained by the Seller. No Benefit
Plan is subject to the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States.
Section 4.09(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete and
correct list of all Benefit Plans and separately designates any Benefit Plan

plan description (and any summaries of material modifications thereto); and
(iii) the most recent IRS determination, opinion or advisory letter.



(b) Pension Plans. The Benefit Plans have been established, maintained, funded
and administered in all material respects in accordance with their terms and
in compliance with ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws. Each Benefit
Plan that is subject to ERISA and is an "employee pension benefit plan" within
the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Pension Plan"), intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable
determination, opinion or advisory letter from the IRS, and nothing has
occurred that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualification of such Benefit Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code.



(c) No Penalties. The Company has not engaged in a transaction with respect to
any Benefit Plan and nothing else has occurred with respect to any Benefit
Plan that could subject the Company to a Tax or penalty imposed by either
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA. The Company has not
incurred and does not reasonably expect to incur any Tax or penalty imposed by
Section 4980F of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA or any material liability
under Section 4071 of ERISA.



(d) ERISA Affiliates. Neither the Company nor any Person that is, or at any
relevant time was, considered one employer with the Company under Section 4001
of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate") has, within the
past six years, maintained or contributed to, and the Company does not
otherwise have any actual or potential liability with respect to a "defined
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA) or any other plan that is
or was, at the relevant time, subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV
of ERISA. No Benefit Plan is a, and at no time during the past six years has
the Company or any ERISA Affiliate been obligated to contribute to any, and
the Company does not otherwise have any actual or potential liability with
respect to any, "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA).
The Company does not have any current or contingent liability or obligation by
reason of at any time being treated as a single employer with any other Person
under Section 414 of the Code. No Benefit Plan is (i) a "multiple employer
plan" (within the meaning of Section 210 of ERISA or Section 413(c) of the
Code), or (ii) a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (as such term is
defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA).



(e) Contributions. All contributions, premiums and other payments required to
be made under each Benefit Plan have been timely made (to the extent due) and
all obligations in respect of each Benefit Plan have been properly accrued and
reflected in the Most Recent Balance Sheet (to the extent not yet due). There
are no unfunded or underfunded liabilities or 



obligations relating to any Benefit Plan with respect to which funding is
required by its terms or applicable Laws.



(f) No Actions. There is no pending or, to the Company's Knowledge, threatened
Action relating to the Benefit Plans.



(g) Continuation Coverage. No Benefit Plan provides, and the Company has no
current or contingent obligations to provide, for post-termination, post-
ownership or retiree health, life or other welfare benefits, other than as
required by Section 4980B of the Code for which the covered Person pays the
full premium cost of coverage. The Company has not incurred (whether or not
assessed) and is not reasonably expected to incur any Tax, penalty or other
liability under Sections 4980B, 4980D, 4980H, 6721 or 6722 of the Code.



(h) Section 280G. Neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement,
stockholder adoption of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Transactions will (i) entitle any Employee or service provider to the Company
to severance pay or any other payment of benefit (whether in cash, property or
the vesting of property) or any increase in severance pay upon any termination
of employment after the date of this Agreement, (ii) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting or result in any payment, funding or delivery (through a
grantor trust or otherwise) or forfeiture of compensation or benefits under,
increase the amount payable or result in any other material obligation
pursuant to, any of the Benefit Plans, (iii) limit or restrict the right of
the Seller or, after the consummation of the Transactions, the Buyer to merge,
amend or terminate any of the Benefit Plans or (iv) result in payments of any
"excise tax" under any of the Benefit Plans that could individually or in
combination with any other payment (excluding arrangements entered into with
Buyer), that could become payable under Section 4999 of the Code and not be
deductible under Section 280G of the Code except as set forth in Section
4.09(h) of the Seller Disclosure Letter.



(i) Section 409A. Each Benefit Plan subject to Section 409A of the Code (if
any) has at all relevant times complied in all respects with applicable
document requirements of, and has been operated in all respects in compliance
with Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations and other official
guidance promulgated thereunder. Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates
is a party to, or is otherwise obligated under, any Contract that provides for
the gross-up, indemnification, reimbursement of or other payment for any of
any Taxes, interest or penalties imposed by Sections 409A or 4999 of the Code
(or any corresponding provisions of state or local Law relating to Tax) to any
Employees.



Section 4.10 Compliance with Laws. Since July 1, 2017, the Company has been in
material compliance with all Laws applicable to it or its business, property
or assets, including applicable Data Requirements. Except with respect to
regulatory matters covered by Section 6.02, no material investigation or
review by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Company is pending or,
to the Company's Knowledge, threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity
indicated an intention to conduct the same. No material change is required in
the Company's processes, properties or procedures in connection with any such
Laws, and the Company has not received any notice or communication of any
noncompliance with any such Laws that has not been cured as of the date of
this Agreement. The Company has obtained and is in compliance with all
permits, certifications, approvals, registrations, consents, authorizations, 



franchises, variances, licenses, exemptions and orders issued or granted by a
Governmental Entity necessary to lawfully conduct its business as presently
conducted.

Section 5.01 Organization. The Buyer (a) is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware,
(b) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted
and is qualified to do business and (c) is in good standing as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of
its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except, in the case of clause (b) or clause (c), where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing or to have such power or
authority would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the
Transactions.



Section 5.02 Authority. The Buyer has all requisite corporate power and
authority and has taken all corporate action necessary to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents to
which the Buyer is a party. The Buyer has duly executed and delivered this
Agreement, which, assuming it is duly executed and delivered by all 



other Parties, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Buyer
enforceable against the Buyer in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.



Section 5.03 Governmental Filings; No Violations.



(a) Governmental Filings. Other than the Antitrust Filings, no notices,
reports or other filings are required to be made by the Buyer with, nor are
any consents, registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations required to
be obtained by the Buyer from, any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Buyer's execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or the Ancillary
Documents to which the Buyer is a party or the consummation of the
Transactions, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
consummation of the Transactions.



(b) No Violations. The Buyer's execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, and of the Ancillary Documents to which the Buyer is a party, do
not, and the consummation of the Transactions will not, constitute or result
in (i) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the Organizational
Documents of the Buyer or (ii) with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
a breach or violation of, a termination (or right of termination) or default
under, the creation or acceleration of any obligations under or the creation
of a Lien on any of the assets of the Buyer pursuant to any Contract binding
upon the Buyer or, assuming (solely with respect to performance of this
Agreement and consummation of the Transactions) compliance with the matters
referred to in Section 5.03(a), under any Law to which the Buyer is subject,
except, in the case of clause (ii), for any such breach, violation,
termination, default, creation or acceleration that would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the consummation of the Transactions.



Section 5.04 Investment Purpose. The Buyer is acquiring the Interests solely
for its own account for investment purposes and not with a view to, or for
offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof. The Buyer
acknowledges that the Interests are not registered under the Securities Act or
any state securities Laws, and that the Interests may not be transferred or
sold except pursuant to the registration provisions of the Securities Act or
pursuant to an applicable exemption therefrom and subject to state securities
Laws, as applicable.



Section 5.05 Litigation. There are no Actions pending or, to the Buyer's
Knowledge, threatened against the Buyer that seek to enjoin or would
reasonably be expected to have the effect of preventing, making illegal or
otherwise interfering with, the consummation of the Transactions, except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the Transactions.



Section 5.06 Available Funds. As of the Closing, the Buyer will have available
sufficient funds to satisfy all of its obligations under this Agreement.



Section 5.07 Independent Investigation.



(a) The Buyer has conducted its own independent investigation, review and
analysis of the business, results of operations, prospects, condition
(financial or otherwise) and assets of the Company, and acknowledges that it
has been provided access to the personnel, 



properties, assets, premises, books and records and other documents and data
of the Seller and the Company for such purpose. The Buyer acknowledges and
agrees that (i) in making its decision to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the Transactions, the Buyer has relied solely upon its own
investigation and the express representations and warranties of the Seller and
the Company set forth in Article III, Article IV (including the related
portions of the Seller Disclosure Letter), any Ancillary Document and
disclaims reliance on any other representations and warranties of any kind or
nature express or implied (including any relating to the future or historical
financial condition, results of operations, assets or liabilities or prospects
of the Company) and (ii) none of the Seller, the Company or any other Person
has made any representation or warranty as to the Seller, the Company or this
Agreement, except as expressly set forth herein or as set forth in any
Ancillary Document.



(b) In connection with their due diligence investigation of the Company, the
Buyer and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives have received
and may continue to receive after the date of this Agreement from the Seller
and the Company, their Affiliates and their respective Representatives certain
estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as
well as certain business plan information, regarding the Company and its
business and operations. The Buyer hereby acknowledges that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as well as in such business
plans, and that the Buyer, except in the case of Fraud, will have no claim
against the Seller, the Company or any of their Affiliates or their respective
Representatives, or any other Person, with respect thereto, including as to
the accuracy or completeness of any information provided. Accordingly, for
clarity, and without in any way limiting the provisions of Section 5.07(a),
the Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations
and warranties expressly set forth in Article III, Article IV (including, and
subject to, the related portions of the Seller Disclosure Letter), and any
Ancillary Document none of the Seller, the Company or any of their Affiliates
or their respective Representatives has made or is making, and the Buyer is
not relying upon, any express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements
or business plans.



Section 5.08 No Other Representations. Except for the representations and
warranties expressly made by the Buyer in this Article V, and by the Buyer in
any Ancillary Document, the Buyer makes no other representations or warranties
of any kind, express or implied, in connection with the Transactions.

Section 6.02 Government and Third-Party Approvals.



(a) Cooperation. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Parties shall cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to
take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on their part under this 



Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
Transactions as soon as practicable, including preparing and filing as
promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices,
reports and other filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all
consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or
advisable to be obtained from any third party or any Governmental Entity to
consummate the Transactions, including within 10 Business Days following the
date of this Agreement to file with the United States Federal Trade Commission
("FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice
("DOJ") a Notification and Report Form relating to this Agreement and the
Transactions as required by the HSR Act. No Party shall stay, toll or extend
any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust
Laws, or pull or refile any filing made under the HSR Act without the advance
written agreement of the other Parties (such agreement not to be unreasonably
withheld or conditioned). Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange
of information, each Party shall have the right to review in advance and, to
the extent practicable, each shall consult with the others on and consider in
good faith the views of the others, and incorporate the others' reasonable
comments, particularly in connection with all the information relating to
them, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that
appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third
party or Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions. In
exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Parties shall act reasonably and
as promptly as practicable. No Party shall permit any of its Representatives
to participate in any substantive meetings or discussions with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry
relating to the Transactions unless it consults with the other Parties in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the
other Parties the opportunity to attend and participate thereat.



(b) Information. Each Party shall, upon request by another, furnish the
requesting Party with all information concerning itself, its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with any statement, filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of the requesting Party or any of its
Affiliates or their respective Representatives to any third party or
Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions; provided, that each
Party may, as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate material
provided to the other as "Outside Counsel Only Material" and also may
reasonably redact the material as necessary to (i) remove personally or
competitively sensitive information, (ii) comply with contractual
arrangements, (iii) prevent the loss of a legal privilege or (iv) comply with
applicable Law.



(c) Status. Subject to applicable Laws and limits imposed by any Governmental
Entity, the Parties shall keep each other apprised of the status of matters
relating to consummation of the Transactions, including promptly informing the
others of any written or oral communications received from any Governmental
Entity and promptly furnishing the other Party with copies of notices or other
communications received by them, or any of their Affiliates, from any third
party or Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions.



(d) Antitrust Matters. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, without limiting the generality of the Parties' other undertakings
contained in this Section 6.02, each of the Seller and the Company and the
Buyer agree to take or cause to be taken the following actions: (i) the prompt
provision to each Governmental Entity with 



jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable antitrust or competition Laws
(each, an "Antitrust Authority") of non-privileged information and documents
requested by such Antitrust Authority or that are necessary, proper or
advisable to permit consummation of the Transactions (provided, that if any
Party receives a request for additional information or documentary material
from any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions pursuant to the
HSR Act or any other antitrust Laws applicable to the Transactions, then such
Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to make (or cause to be made), as
soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other Parties,
an appropriate response in compliance with such request); and (ii) the prompt
use of its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of any permanent,
preliminary or temporary injunction or other decree, decision, determination
or judgment that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of the Transactions.



(e) Buyer Covenant. The Buyer shall not, before receiving antitrust approval
related to Antitrust Filings pursuant to Section 6.02(a), acquire or enter
into any Contract to acquire, or announce any acquisition of, any Person,
business or assets that compete with or may compete with the Company, without
the prior written approval of the Seller.

Section 6.03 Access and Reports. Subject to applicable Law (including
antitrust Laws) and any reasonably appropriate accommodations or limitations
(whether pursuant to applicable Law or otherwise) as may then be in effect in
light of the Coronavirus Pandemic, upon reasonable advance notice, the Company
shall afford the Buyer's Representatives reasonable access, at reasonable
times throughout the period before the Closing, to its personnel, employees,
properties, books and records and Contracts and, during such period, the
Company shall furnish promptly to the Buyer all information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as the Buyer may reasonably request;
provided, that nothing in this Section 6.03 shall require the Company (x) to
permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that would be likely to
result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any
of its obligations with respect to confidentiality or (y) to disclose any
privileged information of the Company; provided, further, that the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Buyer to
permit disclosure of such information to the extent doing so would not be
reasonably likely to violate any Law or result in the loss of such privilege.
All requests for information made pursuant to this Section 6.03 shall be
directed to an executive officer of, or other Person designated by, the
Seller. All such information shall be governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. The Seller and the Company shall further provide
the transition cooperation set forth on Exhibit G.



Section 6.04 Publicity. The initial press release, if any, regarding the
Transactions shall be a joint press release by the Buyer and the Seller issued
promptly following the execution of this Agreement and thereafter the Parties
shall not issue any press release or make any other public statements with
respect to the Transactions without the consent of the Buyer and the Seller.
Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent any Party from making such filings
with any Governmental Entity as its counsel advises it are required by
applicable Law, including filings with the SEC required by the Exchange Act;
provided, that before making any such filing, the filing Party shall provide
the other Parties with reasonable prior notice of the content of such filing
and an opportunity to comment thereon. Nothing in this Section 6.04 shall
apply to the issuance of press releases or the making of other public
statements or filings (i) the content of which (as it relates to the
Transactions) has already been disclosed in a press release, public 



statement or filing with a Governmental Entity that was made in compliance
with this Section 6.04, (ii) that are made in the ordinary course of business
and do not relate specifically to the signing of this Agreement or the
Transactions, (iii) any report or disclosure of the status and terms
(including price terms) of this Agreement and the Transactions to the Buyer's
Affiliates and each of its current and prospective, direct or indirect limited
partners, (iv) disclosure of the occurrence of the Transactions by the Buyer
or its Affiliates on their website or otherwise in the ordinary course of
their business or (v) disclosure pursuant to an internal communication or
otherwise to each Party's employees.



Section 6.05 Employee Benefits.



(a) Maintenance of Benefits. For a period of one year following the Closing or
until the termination of employment of the relevant Continuing Employee, if
sooner, the Buyer shall or shall cause one of its Affiliates to provide each
Employee who continues to be employed by the Company immediately following the
Closing (a "Continuing Employee") (i) base salary or wages, as applicable, and
target bonus, in each case that are no less favorable than those provided to
such Continuing Employee as of immediately before the Closing and (ii)
benefits (excluding any defined benefit pension, equity or equity-based,
nonqualified deferred compensation, retention, change in control, sale or
divestiture bonuses or post-termination or retiree health or welfare benefits)
that are no less favorable in the aggregate to such compensation and benefits
provided to such Continuing Employee as of immediately before the Closing.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, prior to the Closing,
the Seller will take all actions necessary to transfer those Employees who as
of the Closing are or will be on disability or workers' compensation leave
(together "Inactive Employees") to the Seller or one of its Affiliates (other
than the Company), and the Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company)
shall be solely responsible for the provision of benefits and compensation to
and all costs and other liabilities incurred in respect of any Inactive
Employee. The Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates (including,
following the Closing, the Company), to offer employment to an Inactive
Employee to the extent such employee is able to commence employment within a
12-month period immediately following the Closing Date. For the avoidance of
doubt, an Inactive Employee will not be considered a Continuing Employee for
purposes of this Section 6.05 until such time that they commence employment
with the Buyer or one of its Affiliates.



(b) Credit for Service. The Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates
to, cause any employee benefit plans (other than any plan providing for
defined benefit pension, equity or equity-based, nonqualified deferred
compensation or post-termination or retiree health or welfare benefits) in
which the Continuing Employees are entitled to participate following the
Closing (the "New Plans") to take into account for purposes of eligibility,
vesting and (for vacation and severance benefits only) benefit accrual
thereunder, except to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits
or compensation, service by employees of the Company as if such service were
with the Buyer, to the same extent and for the same purpose as such service
was credited under a comparable Benefit Plan.



(c) Certain Waivers. The Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to, for the plan year in which the Closing
occurs, cause (i) to be waived all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements and similar limitations, eligibility waiting
periods and evidence of insurability requirements under any New 



Plans that are group health plans, to the extent waived or satisfied by a
Continuing Employee under any comparable Benefit Plan as of the Closing and
(ii) any deductible, co-insurance and covered out-of-pocket expenses paid on
or before the Closing by any Continuing Employee (or covered dependent
thereof) to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying the corresponding
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions after the Closing
under any applicable New Plan that is a group health plan in the same plan
year in which the Closing occurs.



(d) Other Benefit Matters. Except as set forth on Section 6.05(d) of the
Seller Disclosure Letter, the Seller and its Affiliates (other than the
Company) shall assume and retain the sponsorship of and be solely responsible
for all liabilities relating to or at any time arising under or in connection
with or pursuant to any Benefit Plan or any other benefit or compensation
plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement of any kind at any time
maintained, sponsored, contributed to or required to be contributed to by the
Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the Company) or under or in
connection with which the Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the
Company) has any liability. The Seller will be solely responsible for
complying with the requirements of Section 4980B of the Code with respect to
any "MandA qualified beneficiary" as that term is defined in Treasury Regulation
Section 54.4980B-9. With respect to any Benefit Plan that is a Pension Plan,
the Seller shall take all actions necessary or appropriate to, effective as of
the Closing Date, (x) cause all Continuing Employees who participate in any
such Benefit Plan to be fully vested in their account balances under such
plan, and (y) make all employer contributions that would have been made on
behalf of such Continuing Employees had the Transactions not occurred,
regardless of any service or end of year employment requirements, but prorated
for the portion of the plan year that ends on the Closing Date.



(e) No Implied Amendment or Third-Party Beneficiaries. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 6.05, nothing contained in this Section
6.05 shall (i) be treated as the establishment of or an amendment of any
particular Benefit Plan or any other benefit or compensation plan, program,
policy, agreement or arrangement, (ii) give any third party any right to
enforce the provisions of this Section 6.05, (iii) obligate the Buyer or any
of its Affiliates to (x) maintain any particular benefit or compensation plan,
program, policy, agreement or arrangement, or (y) retain the employment or
engagement (or any specific term of employment or engagement) of any
particular Employee or service provider, or (iv) be construed to limit or
otherwise prohibit the ability of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (or,
following the Closing, the Company) to amend, modify or terminate any benefit
or compensation plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement, or to limit
the ability of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (or, following the Closing,
the Company) to modify or terminate the employment or engagement of any
Person, including any Continuing Employee, at any time and for any or no
reason. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.05, the
covenants set forth in this Section 6.05 shall not apply to employees who are
furloughed, terminated, temporarily laid off or subject to reduced hours or
benefits as a result of Coronavirus Pandemic-related circumstances.



Section 6.06 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.



(a) Indemnification Obligation. From and after the Closing, each of the Buyer
and the Company shall cause, unless otherwise required by Law, the Company's
Organizational Documents to contain provisions no less favorable to the DandO
Indemnified 



Persons with respect to exculpation of liabilities, indemnification and
advancement of expenses than are set forth in the Company's Organizational
Documents as of the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the
date of the Closing in a manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of each present and former director and officer of the Company (the
"DandO Indemnified Persons").



(b) Insurance Policy. Before the Closing, the Company shall, and, if the
Company is unable to or otherwise does not, the Buyer shall cause the Company
as of the Closing to, obtain and fully pay for a "tail" insurance policy with
a claims period of at least six years from and after the Closing from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Seller's
current insurance carriers with respect to directors' and officers' liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance for the benefit of the Company
(collectively, "DandO Insurance") with benefits and levels of coverage at least
as favorable as the existing policies with respect to matters existing or
occurring at or before the Closing (including in connection with the
Transactions). If the Company for any reason fails to obtain such "tail"
insurance policies as of the Closing, the Company shall, and the Buyer shall
cause the Company to, purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year
period with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as the
existing policies as of the date of this Agreement.



(c) Continuing Obligation. If the Buyer or the Company or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, in each case, the Buyer shall make
proper provisions so that the successors and assigns of the Buyer or the
Company shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.06.



(d) Third-Party Beneficiaries. The provisions of this Section 6.06 are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the
DandO Indemnified Persons.



(e) Cumulative Rights. The rights of the DandO Indemnified Persons under this
Section 6.06 shall be in addition to any rights such DandO Indemnified Persons
may have under the Organizational Documents of the Company, or under any
applicable Contracts or Laws.



Section 6.07 Takeover Statutes. If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to the Transactions, the Company and its board of directors shall
grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
Transactions shall be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on the Transactions.



Section 6.08 Confidentiality. From and after the Closing, neither the Seller
nor any of its Affiliates shall use or disclose to any Person, except (a) as
required by Law (including the Exchange Act) or (b) in connection with
disputes arising hereunder, any information of a confidential or proprietary
nature or that is not generally available to the public (whether or not
specifically labelled or identified as "confidential"), in any form or medium,
concerning or related to the Company and/or the Business, products, financial
data, strategic business plans, proprietary product data, customer lists,
information relating to governmental relations, 



discoveries, practices, processes, methods, research and development,
marketing plans, suppliers, distributors, customers, other business relations
and other material proprietary and confidential information of the Company
that, in any case, is not otherwise generally available to the public (other
than as a result of disclosure by the Seller or its Affiliates) (such
information, "Confidential Information") for their own purposes or for the
benefit of any Person, except the Buyer or the Company. In the event the
Seller is required by Law to disclose any Confidential Information, the Seller
shall promptly notify the Buyer in writing (if it is legally permitted to do
so), which notification shall include the nature of the legal requirement and
the extent of the required disclosure, and the Seller shall cooperate with the
Buyer and the Company, at the Buyer's expense, to preserve the confidentiality
of such information consistent with applicable Law; provided, that the
Seller's obligation to provide notice to and cooperate with the Buyer in
accordance with this sentence shall not prevent the Seller from timely filing
or furnishing any materials or disclosures with the SEC pursuant to Section 13
or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.



Section 6.09 Tax Matters.



(a) Preparation of Returns. The Seller shall prepare and timely file (or cause
to be prepared and timely filed) all Group Returns in which the Company is
included as a member, that are required to be filed after the Closing Date and
include any Pre-Closing Tax Period (the "Seller Prepared Returns"). The Seller
Prepared Returns shall be prepared in all material respects in a manner
consistent with the past practices of the Company or the Seller, except as
otherwise required by applicable Law, and all Transaction Deductions shall be
treated as arising in a Tax period (or portion thereof) that ends on or before
the Closing Date to the extent "more likely than not" permitted (or permitted
at a higher level of confidence) by applicable Law. The Seller shall timely
remit (or cause to be timely remitted) any and all Taxes required to be paid
with respect to such Seller Prepared Returns and any other Group Return filed
on or prior to the Closing Date. The Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Buyer and the Company and their Affiliates against and from any and all
Taxes that the Buyer, the Company or any of their Affiliates may incur or
suffer that arise out of or result from Group Returns in which the Company was
included as a member while the Company was owned by the Seller; provided, that
the Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify the Buyer, the Company or
their Affiliates for any Taxes (i) resulting from any transactions occurring
on the Closing Date after the Closing outside the ordinary course of business
of the Company, (ii) borne by the Buyer pursuant to Section 6.09(c) or (iii)
taken into account in the calculation of Final Net Working Capital, Final
Indebtedness or Final Transaction Expenses.



(b) Allocation of Straddle Period Taxes. With respect to Tax periods beginning
on or before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date (each, a
"Straddle Period"), any income Taxes shall be allocated to the portion of such
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date based on a "closing of the books"
as if such Straddle Period ended as of the close of business on the Closing
Date (and any income Taxes for such Straddle Period not so allocated to the
portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be allocated
to the portion of such Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date);
provided, that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an
annual or other periodic basis (including depreciation and amortization
deductions) shall be allocated between the portion of such Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date and the portion of such Straddle Period beginning 



after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each such
period. Any property, ad valorem and other similar Taxes imposed on an annual
or other periodic basis shall be allocated between the portion of the
applicable Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the portion of such
Straddle Period beginning on the day after the Closing Date in proportion to
the number of days in each such period.



(c) Transfer Taxes. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Buyer
and the Seller shall each be responsible for and shall pay 50% of any
transfer, stock transfer, stamp, real property transfer, mortgage, sales, use,
ad valorem, gross receipts, conveyance, excise, license and documentary stamp
Taxes, recording charges and other similar Taxes and fees, if any, arising
from the Transactions. The Buyer shall prepare and file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation in connection with such Taxes and the Seller
shall cooperate as necessary in filing any such Tax Returns.



(d) Post-Closing Actions. The Buyer shall not (and shall not permit any of its
Affiliates to) (i) amend any Tax Returns of the Company with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (ii) make or change any Tax election or change any
method of accounting that has retroactive effect to any Tax Return of the
Company or the Seller for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, except in each case with
the prior written consent of the Seller (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).



(e) Cooperation. The Seller and the Buyer shall reasonably cooperate, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates and Representatives to reasonably
cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns relating to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period and any Tax period during which services are being provided by the
Seller under the Transition Services Agreement, including maintaining and
making available to each other, and to any Governmental Entity as reasonably
requests, all records necessary in connection with Taxes of the Company and in
resolving all disputes and audits with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
or any Tax period during which services are being provided by the Seller under
the Transition Services Agreement. The Seller and the Buyer shall (i) retain
all books and records (or, in the alternative, deliver such books and records
to the Company) with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating
to any Tax period beginning before the Closing Date until 90 days after the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations and abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Entity, (ii) allow the
other and its Representatives, at times and dates mutually acceptable to both,
to inspect, review and make copies of such records as such inspecting Party
may deem necessary or appropriate from time to time, such activities to be
conducted during normal business hours and at such inspecting Party's expense,
and (iii) give the other reasonable written notice before transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other so
requests, the notice-giving Party shall allow the other to take possession of
such books and records before such transfer, destruction or discard.



(f) No Access to Group Returns. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall have any right to
access or review any Group Return or related Tax work papers. If reasonably
requested by the Buyer, with respect to any such Group Return that is an
income or other material Tax Return, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to make available a pro forma or redacted version of such
Tax Return including only the Company. 





(g) Tax Treatment. The Transactions are intended to be treated as an asset
sale for U.S. federal, and applicable state and local income Tax purposes.
Neither the Seller, the Company, nor any of their respective affiliates shall
file an election pursuant to Treas. Reg. § 301.7701-3 (or any similar or
analogous provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law) to change the
classification of the Company as a disregarded entity following the LLC
Conversion.



(h) Purchase Price Allocation. Within 30 days following the Closing Date, the
Buyer shall provide the Seller with an allocation of the Purchase Price (and
all other items required under the Code) among the assets of the Company in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. Law, as
appropriate) (the "Purchase Price Allocation"). Upon receipt from the Buyer,
the Seller shall have 30 days to review the Purchase Price Allocation (the
"Purchase Price Allocation Review Period"). If the Seller disagrees with any
items set forth on the Purchase Price Allocation, the Seller shall, on or
before the last day of the Purchase Price Allocation Review Period, deliver a
written notice to the Buyer (the "Purchase Price Allocation Notice of
Objection"), setting forth such objections. Unless the Seller delivers the
Purchase Price Allocation Notice of Objection to the Buyer within the Purchase
Price Allocation Review Period, the Seller shall be deemed to have accepted
the determinations set forth in the Purchase Price Allocation. If the Seller
delivers the Purchase Price Allocation Notice of Objection to the Buyer within
the Purchase Price Allocation Review Period, the Buyer and the Seller shall,
during the 30 days following such delivery or any mutually agreed extension
thereof, use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the
disputed items. At the end of any such period or any mutually agreed extension
thereof, any remaining disputes between the Buyer and the Seller shall be
resolved in accordance with the procedures contemplated by Section
2.04(b)(ii). The Parties shall not take any position, in connection with any
Tax Return, audit or similar Action related to Taxes, that is inconsistent
with the Purchase Price Allocation (as finalized pursuant to this Section
6.09(h)), except to the extent required by applicable Law.



Section 6.10 Restrictive Covenants.



(a) Non-Compete by Seller. The Seller, for and in consideration of payments
and deliveries to be made to the Seller at the Closing and the other covenants
set forth herein, shall not, other than as permitted by the Data License
Agreement or in connection with the performance of services for Company under
the Transition Services Agreement, during the period beginning on the Closing
Date and ending on the third anniversary of the Closing Date, directly or
indirectly (including through any Subsidiaries):



(i) as a stockholder, investor, member, partner, licensor or otherwise, own,
manage, operate, set up, control, participate in or engage, render services
for or in any enterprise engaged in the Company's business of determining,
publishing and providing (i) residual value data for automobiles, including
any related consulting and award licensing services as conducted by the
Company as of the Closing (the "RV Business") in the United States; or



(ii) induce or attempt to induce any customer, supplier, service provider or
other business relations of the Company as of immediately prior to the 



Closing to cease doing business, or to reduce the level of business, with the
Buyer or any of its Affiliates with respect to the RV Business (or otherwise
interfere with the business relationship between the foregoing and the Buyer),
or induce or attempt to induce any prospective customer of the RV Business to
refrain from doing business with the Buyer or any of its Affiliates with
respect to the RV Business.



(b) Non-Solicitation by Seller. Until the one-year anniversary of the date of
this Agreement, the Seller shall not, and shall cause its directors, officers,
employees and controlled Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, solicit
for hire any employee of the Buyer or any of its post-Closing Subsidiaries,
including the Company, other than a person who has not been an employee of the
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries for at least 180 days and whom neither the
Seller nor any of its Representatives or those of any of its controlled
Affiliates, directly or indirectly, solicited following the date of this
Agreement; provided, that nothing in this Section 6.10(b) shall apply to any
employee who responds to general solicitations of employment not specifically
directed toward employees of the Buyer or any of its post-Closing
Subsidiaries, which general solicitations are expressly permitted.



(c) Non-Solicitation by Buyer. Until the one-year anniversary of the date of
this Agreement, the Buyer shall not, and shall cause its directors, officers,
employees and controlled Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, solicit
for hire any employee of the Seller or any of its post-Closing Subsidiaries
other than a person who has not been an employee of the Seller or any of its
post-Closing Subsidiaries for at least 180 days and whom neither the Buyer nor
any of its Representatives or those of any of its controlled Affiliates,
directly or indirectly, solicited following the date of this Agreement;
provided, that nothing in this Section 6.10(c) shall apply to any employee who
responds to general solicitations of employment not specifically directed
toward employees of the Seller or any of its post-Closing Subsidiaries, which
general solicitations are expressly permitted.



(d) Acknowledgment. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the
covenants and agreements set forth in this Section 6.10 were a material
inducement to the other Parties to enter into this Agreement and to perform
their obligations hereunder, and that the Parties and their respective
Affiliates would not obtain the benefit of the bargain set forth in this
Agreement as specifically negotiated by the Parties hereto if another Party
breached the provisions of this Section 6.10. Each of the Parties agrees that
each of the covenants set forth in this Section 6.10 is reasonable with
respect to its duration and scope. The Parties intend that the covenants made
in this Section 6.10 shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under
the Laws of any applicable jurisdiction, and acknowledge that these covenants
are required and appropriate in scope, area and duration for the adequate
protection of the businesses of the Buyer and its Affiliates and to induce the
Buyer to enter into this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents to which it is
party and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. If
any provision of this Section 6.10 shall be illegal, invalid or unenforceable
in any jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought, then in such jurisdiction
only, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such illegality,
invalidity or unenforceability, without affecting in any way the remaining
provisions of this Section 6.10, and without rendering such provision illegal,
invalid or unenforceable in any other jurisdiction. If, however, any provision
of this Section 6.10 shall be illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought because the scope of such
provision is excessive or more restrictive than permitted by the 



Laws of such jurisdiction, then in such jurisdiction only, the scope of such
provision shall be limited to the minimum extent necessary (and without
limiting the scope of such provision in any other jurisdiction) to render such
provision valid, legal and enforceable to the greatest extent permitted under
the Laws of such jurisdiction.



Section 6.11 RandW Insurance. If the Buyer chooses to obtain an RandW Insurance
Policy, the Buyer shall not amend, or agree to amend, the RandW Insurance Policy
in a manner that permits the insurer to pursue any subrogation rights against
any DandO Indemnified Person or the Seller, except in the case of Fraud. The
Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, when due, the premiums, the mitigation
loss fee and the surplus line Taxes payable in connection with any such RandW
Insurance Policy, whether due before or after the Closing.



Section 6.12 Exclusivity. After the date of this Agreement until the earlier
of the Closing or the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 8.01, the Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and
Representatives (including the Company) not to, directly or indirectly, (a)
solicit, knowingly encourage, initiate or accept any Acquisition Proposal from
any person or entity (other than the Buyer or its Representatives) or (b)
provide any non-public information to any third party in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal. In addition, the Seller shall immediately cease and
cause to be terminated all existing negotiations with any Person conducted
prior to the execution of this Agreement with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal. The Seller shall notify the Buyer immediately if any Person makes
any Acquisition Proposal and shall provide the details of such Acquisition
Proposal, including the identity of the potential buyer and terms of such
Acquisition Proposal. The Seller shall further notify the Buyer promptly (and
in any case within five calendar days) if any Person makes a bona fide Seller
Offer with respect to which the Board of Directors or management of the Seller
determines to engage that could reasonably be expected to have a material
impact as determined in good faith by the Seller on either (x) the Seller's
ability to consummate the Transactions or (y) the timing of the consummation
of the Transactions.



Section 6.13 Further Assurances. Each Party shall, and shall cause its
respective Affiliates to, from time to time before the Closing at the request
of the other Party, without any additional consideration, furnish to the
requesting Party such further information or assurances, execute and deliver
such additional documents, instruments and conveyances, and take such other
actions and do such other things, as may be reasonably necessary or
appropriate to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents and give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Documents.



Section 6.14 Seller Marks. Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.14
or pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, immediately after the
Closing, the Company and its Affiliates shall not have any rights hereunder to
use any Trademarks of the Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company)
(collectively, the "Seller Marks"). For a period not to exceed 30 days after
the Closing, the Company may make continued use of the Seller Marks to the
extent they appear on any assets of the Company, and may make incidental use
of the Seller Marks solely in connection with the transition activities of the
Business pertaining to the identification, removal or obliteration of Seller
Marks from the Company's materials, such as collateral, purchase orders,
invoices, sales orders, labels, letterheads, shipping documents, 



business cards and other similar materials. All goodwill associated with any
use of any of the Seller Marks will inure solely to the benefit of the Seller
and its Affiliates.



Section 6.15 Background Intellectual Property License. Without limiting any
services to be provided under the Transition Services Agreement, the Seller,
on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates (other than the Company)
hereby grants to the Company a worldwide, nonexclusive, irrevocable and
perpetual, fully paid-up and royalty-free license (with the right to grant
sublicenses) to the Seller-Owned Business IP for use in the Business,
including any natural evolutions of the Business or the Company Products. Such
license may be assigned, in whole or in part, to the Company's Affiliates or
in connection with the sale or transfer of assets to which such license
relates. For purposes of this Agreement, "Seller-Owned Business IP" means any
and all Intellectual Property (other than Trademarks) owned by the Seller or
any of its Affiliates (other than the Company) and used by the Business during
the 12 months prior to the Closing.



Section 6.16 LLC Conversion. Before the Closing, and in accordance with
Section 266 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and
Section 18-214 of the Limited Liability Company Act of the State of Delaware,
the Seller shall cause the Company to be converted into a Delaware limited
liability company.

warranties both written and oral, among the Parties, with respect to the
subject matter hereof.

and Section 10.13, the Parties' respective representations, warranties and
covenants set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other Parties, in
accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement
is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the
Parties any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the

sole benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in accordance with Section

representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the Parties 



of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the Knowledge of any
of the Parties. Consequently, Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon
the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.



Section 10.09 Severability. The provisions of this Agreement are severable and
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the other provision. If any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is
invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be
substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision
and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application thereof to other
Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or
unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the
validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application of such
provision, in any other jurisdiction.



Section 10.10 Interpretation.



(a) In General. The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience
of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a
reference in this Agreement is made to an Exhibit, Article or Section, it is
to an Exhibit, Article or Section of this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. Any capitalized terms used in any Exhibit or Schedule but not
otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning as defined in this Agreement.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The definitions of terms herein shall apply equally to the
singular and plural forms of the terms defined. Whenever the context may
require, any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine and
neuter forms. All references herein to "dollars," "U.S. dollars" or "$" shall
be deemed to be references to the lawful money of the United States. All
provisions herein qualified by the term "domestic" or "foreign" shall be
construed on the basis that the United States is the relevant domestic
country.



(b) Ordinary Course. "ordinary course of business" or "ordinary course"
describes any action taken by a Person if it is (i) taken in the ordinary
course of the normal day-to-day operations of such Person, except for any
reasonable changes required to provide appropriate accommodations to preserve

disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement. 



(d) Seller Disclosure Letter. The Seller Disclosure Letter has been arranged,
for purposes of convenience only, as separate schedules corresponding to
sections and subsections of this Agreement. The representations and warranties

disclosures set forth in the part of the Seller Disclosure Letter
corresponding to the particular section or subsection of Article III or
Article IV in which such representation and warranty appears, (ii) any
exceptions or disclosures explicitly cross-referenced in such part of the
Seller Disclosure Letter by reference to another part of the Seller Disclosure
Letter and (iii) any exception or disclosure set forth in any other part of
the Seller Disclosure Letter to the extent it is reasonably apparent that such
exception or disclosure is intended to qualify such representation and
warranty. No reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in the
Seller Disclosure Letter shall be construed as an admission or indication that
such item or other matter is material (nor shall it establish a standard of
materiality for any purpose whatsoever) or that such item or other matter is
required to be referred to or disclosed in the Seller Disclosure Letter. The
information set forth in the Seller Disclosure Letter is disclosed solely for
the purposes of this Agreement, and no information set forth therein shall be
deemed to be an admission by any Party hereto to any third party of any matter
whatsoever, including of any violation of applicable Law or breach of any
agreement. The Seller Disclosure Letter and the information and disclosures
contained therein are intended only to qualify and limit the representations,
warranties and covenants of the Seller and the Company contained in this
Agreement. Nothing in the Seller Disclosure Letter is intended to broaden the
scope of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or create
any covenant. Matters reflected in the Seller Disclosure Letter are not
necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in
the Seller Disclosure Letter. Such additional matters are set forth for
informational purposes and do not necessarily include other matters of a
similar nature.



(e) Business Days. Any reference in this Agreement to "days" means calendar
days unless Business Days are specified. If any action under this Agreement is
required to be done or taken on a day that is not a Business Day, then such
action shall be required to be done or taken not on such day but on the first
