1.06 _Consents to Certain Assignments._ (a) Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement will not constitute an agreement to
transfer or assign, directly or indirectly, any asset (including any Contract)
or any Claim or right arising under or resulting from such asset if an
attempted direct or indirect transfer or assignment thereof, without the
consent, approval or authorization (" _Consent_ ") of a third party, would
constitute a breach, default, violation or other contravention of the rights
of such third party, would be ineffective with respect to any party to an
agreement concerning such asset, Claim or right or would in any way adversely
affect the rights of Seller or any of the Seller Parties or, upon transfer,
Purchaser under such asset, Claim or right. If any transfer or assignment by
Seller or any of the Seller Parties to Purchaser of, or any direct or indirect
acquisition or assumption by Purchaser of, any interest in, or Liability
under, any asset, Claim or right requires the Consent of a third party, then
such transfer, assignment, acquisition or assumption will be made subject to
such Consent being obtained. Prior to the Closing, each of Seller and
Purchaser shall provide or cause to be provided all commercially reasonable
assistance to the other party (not including the payment of any consideration)
reasonably requested by such other party to secure any such Consent. Except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither Seller nor any of the Seller
Parties will have any liability whatsoever to Purchaser or any of the
Purchaser Parties arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any such
Consent or because of any circumstances resulting therefrom.

 



 

(b) If any such Consent is not obtained before the Closing, the Closing will
(subject to _Article VII_) nonetheless take place on the terms set forth in
this Agreement and, thereafter, each of Purchaser and Seller will use its
reasonable best efforts to secure such Consent as promptly as practicable
after the Closing (not including the payment of any consideration) to

 



      
 

 



 

secure such Consent as soon as practicable after the Closing and shall
cooperate at Purchasers expense in any lawful and commercially reasonable
arrangement reasonably proposed by Purchaser under which (i) Purchaser will
obtain (without infringing upon the legal rights of such third party or
violating any Applicable Law) the economic claims, rights and benefits under
the asset, Claim or right with respect to which the Consent has not been
obtained in accordance with this Agreement and (ii) Purchaser will assume any
related economic burden with respect to the asset, Claim or right with respect
to which the Consent has not been obtained in accordance with this Agreement.

 



 

1.07 _Transferred Real Property Separation._ (a) Purchaser acknowledges that
the Irapuato Property is adjacent or near to other real estate owned by Seller
and the Seller Parties in Irapuato, Guanajuato, Mexico and that the operations
of the Business located on and around the Irapuato Property are currently
integrated with other operations of Seller and its affiliates at such other
real estate. Purchaser further acknowledges that Seller and its affiliates
currently utilize the Le Sueur Property for certain operations unrelated to
the Business.

 



 

(b) Following the Closing, each of Seller and Purchaser will use commercially
reasonable efforts at the request of the other party to facilitate the orderly
co-existence of the Business at the Irapuato Property, on the one hand, and
the businesses of Seller and its affiliates at adjoining real property, on the
other hand. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such
commercially reasonable efforts shall include the provisions set forth on
_Section 1.07(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(c) Following the Closing, each of Seller and Purchaser will use commercially
reasonable efforts at the request of the other party to facilitate the orderly
transition of the unrelated operations of Seller and its affiliates from the
Transferred Real Property, including agricultural research projects being
conducted on the Irapuato Property and the Le Sueur Property. Such
commercially reasonable efforts will, to the extent requested by Seller,
include permitting Seller and its affiliates reasonable access to each
Transferred Real Property to remove assets unrelated to the Business and the
transitional use of the Transferred Real Property to complete projects that
are ongoing as of the Closing. Following execution of this Agreement and prior
to the Closing, if requested by either party, Purchaser and Seller will
cooperate to create a joint plan for such transitional arrangements relating
to the Transferred Real Property (including any time periods applicable
thereto).

 



 

1.08 _Withholding_. In the event that either party becomes aware that any
Taxes are required to be withheld from any amount payable to the other party
pursuant to this Agreement under Applicable Law relating to Taxes, such party
shall promptly notify the other party, and the parties shall discuss the
requirement for such withholding in good faith. Each party shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any payment under this Agreement any Taxes that
such party is required to deduct and withhold under Applicable Law relating to
Taxes and shall pay such amount to the appropriate Taxing Authority. Any such
amounts so withheld and paid shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the applicable party.

 



       
 

 



 

1.09 _Retained Technology License_ _._ Subject to, and effective upon the
Closing:

 



 

(a) _Grant_. Effective upon (and subject to the occurrence of) the Closing,
and further subject to the terms set forth in this Agreement, Seller hereby
grants to Purchaser a non-exclusive, fully paid, perpetual, royalty-free
license to use the Retained Licensed Technology exclusively in its operation
of the Business and in a manner consistent with the use of such Retained
Licensed Technology by Seller prior to the Closing. " _Retained Licensed
Technology_ " means any Trade Secrets owned by Seller or any of the Seller
Parties that are actually used in connection with and reasonably necessary for
the operation or conduct of the Business on the Closing Date and that are not
included in the Transferred Technology. The license granted to Purchaser under
this Agreement (the " _Retained Technology License_ ") is subject to Purchaser
complying with all Applicable Laws, enactments, regulations and similar
instruments, and Purchaser shall comply with all regulations and practices in
force or use to safeguard Sellers rights in the Retained Licensed Technology.

 



 

(b) _Term and Termination_. The Retained Technology License shall commence and
be effective as of the Closing and shall remain in full force and effect until
terminated (i) by mutual written consent of Purchaser and Seller at any time,
(ii) by Seller on giving prior written notice to Purchaser, if Purchaser is in
material breach of any term of this _Section 1.09_ and Purchaser fails to
correct such breach within 30 days after receipt of such written notice of
such breach from Purchaser, (iii) automatically in the event that Purchaser is
adjudged bankrupt or insolvent, makes an assignment for the benefit of
creditors or enters into any arrangement pursuant to any bankruptcy law or if
a receiver is appointed for Purchaser or for Purchasers business or (iv) by
Seller on giving written notice to Purchaser, if Purchaser challenges the
secret or substantial nature of the Retained Licensed Technology and/or
Sellers ownership of the Retained Licensed Technology. Upon and after
termination of the Retained Technology License, (i) all rights granted to
Purchaser shall automatically revert to Seller and Purchaser shall claim no
rights to the Retained Licensed Technology and (ii) at Purchasers expense,
Purchaser shall (at Sellers sole option) either promptly return to Seller or
destroy, all records and copies of the Retained Licensed Technology and any
related information of a confidential nature communicated to Purchaser by
Seller within Purchasers possession or control.

 



 

(c) _Indemnification_. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller
Indemnitees from and against any and all Losses that any Seller Indemnitee may
at any time suffer or incur as a result of or in connection with the Retained
Technology License or Purchasers use of the Retained Licensed Technology,
except those arising from intentional fraud of Seller.

 



 

(d) _Infringement Actions_. Seller may from time to time take all steps that
it may consider necessary to protect its rights in and to the Retained
Licensed Technology, and Purchaser agrees to promptly communicate in writing
to Seller any infringements or threatened infringements of any of such rights
that may come to its notice and, at Sellers expense, to do all and any such
acts as Seller may reasonably require for preventing such infringements or
threatened infringements; provided that nothing in this _Section 1.09(d)_
shall impose upon Seller any obligation to incur any expense in protecting any
of its rights in any case where, in Sellers

 



      
 

 



 

absolute discretion, such expense is considered not warranted. In the event
Seller decides to take affirmative action against an infringement or unfair
competition, Purchaser agrees to assist Seller in whatever manner Seller
directs, at the expense of Seller. Recovery of damages resulting from any such
action shall be solely for the account of Seller. Purchaser will provide
information reasonably requested by Seller in any infringement action,
including in connection with the calculation of damages.

 



 

(e) _Reservation of Rights; No Warranty_. Except for the express terms of the
Retained Technology License, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as
an assignment or other grant of any right, title or interest in or to the
Retained Licensed Technology to Purchaser or its affiliates, it being
understood that all right, title and interest in and to the Retained Licensed
Technology are expressly reserved by Seller.

 



 

(f) _Assignment; Sublicense_. The Retained Technology License may not be
assigned, sublicensed or transferred by Purchaser without the prior written
consent of Seller, except that Purchaser may, solely to the extent necessary
for the operation of the Business and subject to the terms of the Retained
Technology License, (i) assign the Retained Technology License or grant
sublicenses to any of its wholly owned subsidiaries without the prior written
consent of Purchaser (in which case Purchaser shall continue to be bound by
the terms of this Agreement and Purchaser shall remain liable to Seller in
respect of the acts of any sublicensee) and (ii) assign this Agreement, in
whole or in part, in connection with the sale (whether by asset transaction,
stock sale, merger or otherwise) to a third party of any material part of any
business of Purchaser or its wholly owned subsidiaries that uses the Retained
Licensed Technology. No sublicense or assignment will grant or purport to
grant rights more extensive, or subject to fewer restrictions, than those set
out in this _Section 1.09_ in relation to the Retained Technology License and
Purchaser will procure that each of its sublicensees complies with the terms
of its respective sublicense. Purchaser will notify Seller in writing of the
grant of any proposed sublicense and the name of the proposed sublicensee
prior to sublicensing any of Purchasers rights under this Agreement.

Purchaser;

 



 

it being understood that such instruments will not require Seller or any of
its affiliates to make or be deemed to include, and will in any event be
deemed not to include, any additional representations, warranties or
covenants, expressed or implied, not contained in this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Purchaser will deliver to Seller and the Seller Parties:

connection with such designation, the Seller may direct that any amounts
payable to Seller in Canadian Dollars or Mexican Pesos under this _Section
2.02(b)(i)_ be reduced by all or any portion of the amounts payable to

it being understood that such instruments will not require Purchaser or any of
its affiliates to make or be deemed to include, and will in any event be

execution of local forms or notarization or legalization required for the
filing or recording thereof may be effectuated after the Closing and will be

2.03 _Determination of Closing Inventory Amounts._ Before the Closing, the
Closing Inventory Amounts will be determined in accordance with the principles
in this _Section 2.03_ and the methodologies reflected in _Section 2.03_ of
the Seller Disclosure Letter. The Purchaser and Seller shall jointly perform
an audit and/or physical count of the Finished Goods Inventory in order to
validate or correct the book values thereof in Sellers books and records with
respect to such Finished Goods Inventory in each of Canada, Mexico and the
United States. Such book values will thereafter be updated by Seller in the
ordinary course of business to reflect changes to Finished Goods Inventory.
The updated book values of the Finished Goods Inventory, as generated with
respect to each of Canada, Mexico and the United States from Sellers books
and records at the latest practicable time before the Closing Date, will
constitute the " _Canadian Closing Inventory Amount_ ," the " _Mexican Closing
Inventory Amount_ ," and the " _U.S. Closing Inventory Amount_ ," respectively
(collectively, the " _Closing Inventory Amounts_ "). The Closing Inventory
Amounts will be final and binding upon the parties for all purposes, including
calculation of the Purchase Price. Following the determination of the Closing
Inventory Amounts through the Closing, Seller will not, and will cause the
Seller Parties not to, take any action outside the ordinary course of business
for the purpose of manipulating the book

 



      
 

 



 

value of the Transferred Inventory as of the Effective Time in a manner
adverse to Purchaser. " _Finished Goods Inventory_ " means the inventory of
finished and semi-finished goods included in the Transferred Inventory.

 



 

2.04 _Identification of Seller Parties and Purchaser Parties._ No later than
the fifth business day prior to the Closing, each of Seller and Purchaser
shall deliver to the other party a written schedule specifically identifying
each of the Seller Parties (in the case of Seller) and each of the Purchaser
Parties (in the case of Purchaser), and with respect to each such party, a
description (sufficient to prepare the Ancillary Agreements) of the
Transferred Assets and the Assumed Liabilities (or categories thereof) to be
transferred from or to such party.

4.05 _Source of Funds; Solvency._ (a) Pursuant to (i) the existing borrowing
facilities of Purchaser (the " _Existing Debt Facilities_ ") and (ii) an
executed commitment letter from Barclays Bank PLC, Royal Bank of Canada and

complete copy of (i) the Existing Debt Facilities and (ii) the Debt Commitment
Letter.

 



 

(b) The obligations of the lenders to fund their commitments under the
Existing Debt Facilities are not subject to any condition other than set forth
in the Existing Debt Facilities. To the knowledge of Purchaser, there are no
facts or circumstances existing on the date of this Agreement that would
reasonably be expected to (i) cause the Existing Debt Facilities to be
ineffective or (ii) preclude or are reasonably likely to preclude in any
material respect the satisfaction of the borrowing conditions set forth in the
Existing Debt Facilities. As of the date hereof, the Existing Debt Facilities
are in full force and effect and, since the date Purchaser has delivered a
copy thereof to Seller, have not been amended in any respect (except for any
amendments after the date hereof that would not reasonably be expected to have
a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect). All commitment and other fees required

has not been amended in any respect. All commitment and other fees required to
be paid under the Debt Commitment Letter on or prior to the date hereof have
been paid, and Purchaser is not in breach or default in any respect thereunder
nor has any event occurred that with notice or lapse of time would result in
any such breach or default.

 



 

(d) None of the funds to be paid by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement will
(i) be derived from, or related to, any activity that is deemed criminal or
subject to sanctions under Applicable Law or (ii) cause Seller or any other

1970, the United States Money Laundering Control Act of 1986, the United
States International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti Terrorist Financing

(e) As of the Closing and immediately after consummating the Acquisition and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, assuming the accuracy
in all material respects of the representations and warranties of Seller set
forth in this Agreement, Purchaser will not (i) be insolvent (either because
its financial condition is such that the sum of its debts is greater than the
fair value of its assets (including both tangible and intangible assets) or
because the present fair salable value of its assets (including both tangible
and intangible assets) will be less than the amount required to pay its
probable liability on its debts as they become absolute and matured), (ii)

including the Business, or (iii) have incurred or plan to incur debts beyond
its ability to repay such debts as they become absolute and matured.

engaged by Purchaser or any of its affiliates is or will be entitled to any

Business and (b) properties, books, Contracts, commitments and records to the
extent relating to the Business (other than the Excluded Assets) including

which will remain in full force and effect pursuant to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, notwithstanding execution of this Agreement.
Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement will

engaged in the conduct of the Business); _provided_ that any and all other
information furnished or made available to it by Seller or Sellers
representatives concerning Seller, the Seller Parties and their respective
affiliates will remain subject to the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement after the Closing notwithstanding the expiration or
termination thereof.

 



 

5.04 _Reasonable Best Efforts._ (a) On the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, each of Seller and Purchaser will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Closing to occur as promptly as
practicable, including taking all reasonable actions necessary to comply
promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on it or any of its
affiliates with respect to the Closing.

 



 

(b) Each of Seller and Purchaser will as promptly as practicable, but in no
event later than 10 business days after the execution and delivery of this

connection with the CFCE Approval, and (iv) make or cause to be made such
other filings as are necessary in other jurisdictions in order to comply with
any other applicable competition, merger control, antitrust or similar
Applicable Law of any jurisdiction. Each of Seller and Purchaser will promptly
submit any supplemental information requested by the FTC, the DOJ or any other
applicable Governmental Entity in connection with any such filing. Any such
filing or submission will be in substantial compliance with the requirements
of the HSR Act or such other Applicable Law. Each of Seller and Purchaser will
furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as
the other may request in connection with its preparation of any filing or
submission under the HSR Act or such other Applicable Law.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.04_, Purchaser will, and
will cause each of its Affiliates to, take any and all steps necessary to
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust or
competition Law that may be asserted by any antitrust or competition
Governmental Entity so as to enable the parties hereto to close the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, and in any event
before the Outside Date, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders or otherwise, the exclusion
from the Transferred Assets certain assets relating to the Business, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of its assets, properties or businesses or of the
assets, properties or businesses to be acquired by it pursuant hereto, and the
entrance into such other arrangements, as are necessary or advisable in order
to avoid the entry of, and the commencement of litigation seeking the entry
of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining
order or other order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the
effect of materially delaying or preventing the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that the effectiveness of such
sale, divestiture or disposition or entry into such other arrangement will be
contingent on the consummation of the contemplated transaction. In addition,
Purchaser will, and will cause its Affiliates to, defend through litigation on
the merits any action by any antitrust or competition Governmental Entity in
order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order
or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent
the Closing on or before the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
obligation of Purchaser set forth in this sentence will in no way limit the
obligation of Purchaser to take any and all steps necessary to eliminate each
and every impediment under any antitrust or competition law to close the
transactions contemplated hereby on or before the Outside Date.

 



 

(d) To assist Purchaser in complying with its obligations under _Section
5.04(c)_, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, enter into
agreements or arrangements requested by Purchaser to be entered into by any of
them prior to the Closing with respect to any matters contemplated by _Section
5.04(c)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) this _Section 5.04_ (other than
the express terms of _Section 5.04(f)_ relating to Permits) will not require
Seller or any of its Affiliates to agree to any sale, divestiture, disposition
or other arrangement with respect to any businesses or assets other than the
Business and (ii) the effectiveness of any sale, divestiture or disposition or
entry into such other arrangements will be contingent on the consummation of
the contemplated transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser will take
any and all actions necessary to ensure that (1) no requirement, waiver or
Consent of the FTC, the DOJ, any state attorney general, the Canada
Competition Bureau, the CFCE or other Governmental Entity, (2) no Judgment
(including any temporary restraining

 



      
 

 



 

order) or injunction in any Proceeding and (3) no other matter relating to any
applicable competition, antitrust or similar Applicable Law would preclude
consummation of the Acquisition by the Outside Date.

 



 

(e) Each of Seller and Purchaser will (i) cooperate in all respects with each
other in connection with any filing or submission made with any Governmental
Entity relating to the Acquisition and in connection with any investigation or
other inquiry by or before any Governmental Entity relating to the
Acquisition, including any Proceeding initiated by a private party, and (ii)
keep the other party informed in all material respects and on a reasonably
timely basis of any material communication received by such party from, or
given by such party to, the FTC, the DOJ, the Canada Competition Bureau or any
other Governmental Entity and of any material communication received or given
in connection with any Proceeding by a private party, in each case relating to
the Acquisition. Subject to Applicable Law relating to the exchange of
information, each of Seller and Purchaser will have the right to review in
advance, and each of Seller and Purchaser will consult the other party on, all
the information relating to the other party that appears in any filing or
submission made with any Governmental Entity or any private party relating to
the Acquisition. Each of Seller and Purchaser agree not to participate in
meetings or discussions, either in person or by telephone, with any
Governmental Entity relating to the Acquisition unless, to the extent
reasonably practicable, it consults with the other party in advance and, to
the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party
the opportunity to attend and participate. Purchaser shall have principal
responsibility for devising and implementing strategy for obtaining any
necessary approvals, for responding to any inquiry or investigation, for
responding to any request involving both Purchaser and Seller, and for leading
all meetings and communications with any Governmental Entity that has
authority to enforce antitrust or competition Law.

 



 

(f) To the extent any material Permit that is used in the Business is not a
Transferred Permit, the parties will cooperate in good faith in any lawful and
commercially reasonable arrangement reasonably proposed by Purchaser under
which (i) Purchaser will obtain (without violating such Permit or any
Applicable Law) the authorization, rights and benefits granted pursuant to
such Permit and (ii) Purchaser will assume any related burden with respect to
such authorization, rights and benefits, in each case solely to the extent
relating the Business and without adversely affecting the other operations of
the Seller and its affiliates that may use such Permit. In furtherance of the
foregoing, the parties will negotiate in good faith prior to the Closing an
arrangement to provide the Purchaser with respect to the Irapuato Property
with the authorization, rights and benefits relating to the Business currently
held by Seller pursuant to that certain concession title granted to Seller by
the National Water Commission.

 



 

5.05 _Purchaser Financing._ (a) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best
efforts to finalize and consummate the receipt of funds pursuant to the terms
and conditions of the Financing, and will not terminate the Existing Debt
Facilities or the Debt Commitment Letter or amend or waive any material
provisions thereof (except for any amendments or waivers after the date hereof
that would not reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect) without the prior written consent of Seller, which reasonable best
efforts shall include (i) negotiating definitive agreements with respect to
the Debt Commitment Letter on terms and conditions contained therein (such
definitive agreements, together with the Debt Commitment Letter and the
agreements relating to the Existing Debt Facilities, the " _Financing
Agreements_ "),

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) satisfying on a timely basis all conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter
and the Financing Agreements and (iii) consummating the Financing at or prior
to the Closing.

 



 

(b) In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions contemplated in the Financing Agreements, Purchaser shall
use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, financing on terms not materially less favorable to
either Seller (including with respect to conditionality and the aggregate
amount of the Financing) or Purchaser than those set forth in the Existing
Debt Facilities and the Debt Commitment Letter from alternative sources in an
amount sufficient to consummate the Acquisition and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") and to obtain
(and, when obtained, to provide Seller with a copy of) a new financing
commitment for the Alternative Financing (the " _Alternative Financing
Commitment Letter_ "). To the extent applicable, Purchaser shall use
reasonable best efforts to arrange and to consummate the Alternative Financing
as soon as reasonably practicable on the terms and conditions described in the
Alternative Financing Commitment Letter, which reasonable best efforts shall
include (i) negotiating definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms
and conditions contained therein (the " _Alternative Financing Agreements_ "),
(ii) satisfying on a timely basis all conditions in the Alternative Financing
Commitment Letter and the Alternative Financing Agreements, (iii) enforcing
its rights under the Alternative Financing Commitment Letter and the
Alternative Financing Agreements and (iv) drawing upon any bridge financing
provided for therein (if necessary).

 



 

(c) Purchaser shall give Seller notice immediately following any breach or
threatened breach or of any termination or threatened termination by any party
of any Financing Agreement and, if applicable, the Alternative Financing
Commitment Letter or the Alternative Financing Agreements. Purchaser shall
keep Seller informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the
status of its efforts to arrange the Financing and, if applicable, the
Alternative Financing, including providing copies of all material documents to
Seller.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, at
Purchasers sole cost and expense, use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide to Purchaser such cooperation as may be reasonably requested by
Purchaser in connection with the Financing, including (i) taking commercially
reasonable actions as reasonably requested by Purchaser, in order to satisfy
the conditions precedent to the consummation of, and funding under, and in
order to comply with the terms and conditions of, the Financing or Alternative
Financing, as applicable, (ii) if requested by Purchaser, facilitating
Purchasers efforts to pledge any of the Transferred Assets as collateral (
_provided_ such pledging of collateral, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not
be effective prior to the Closing), and (iii) using commercially reasonable
efforts to assist Purchaser in obtaining estoppels, surveys, appraisals, and
title insurance and similar instruments and agreements; _provided_ , _however_
, that such actions do not unreasonably interfere with the normal operations
or employee relations of Seller or its affiliates or the Business; and,
_provided_ , _further_ , that Seller shall not be required to pay any
commitment fee or other fee or payment to obtain consent or to incur any
liability (other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses subject to
reimbursement by Purchaser in accordance herewith) with respect to the
Financing or Alternative Financing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, but without limiting the express terms of _Section 11.12_, in no
event shall Seller be obligated to deliver any financial

 



      
 

 



 

statements (audited or unaudited) relating to the Business in connection with
the Financing or Alternative Financing.

 



 

(e) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, except as otherwise expressly
provided in this _Section 5.05_, Seller and its affiliates and
representatives have no responsibility for any financing (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Financing and the Alternative Financing) that
Purchaser may raise in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
and shall not be requested to sign any authorization letter to the Lenders or
other financing sources. Seller and its affiliates shall not have any
responsibility for any offering materials or other related documents prepared
by or on behalf of or utilized by Purchaser or its affiliates, the Lenders or
other financing sources, in connection with Purchasers financing activities
related to the transactions contemplated hereby, including any offering
memorandum, bankers book or any other written materials used in connection
with any debt or securities offering or other such financing.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, compliance by
Purchaser with this _Section 5.05_ shall not relieve Purchaser of its
obligation, subject to the terms hereof, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof whether or not the
Financing or the Alternative Financing is available.

 



 

5.06 _Real Estate Matters_ _._ (a) Seller shall, and shall cause the Seller
Parties to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Purchaser in
obtaining, at Purchasers sole cost and expense, (i) an owners extended
coverage title insurance policy or an unconditional commitment thereof with
respect to each Transferred Real Property, issued by a nationally recognized
title insurance company duly licensed in the relevant jurisdiction, dated as
of a date reasonably proximate to the Closing Date, insuring Purchaser in such
amounts (not less than the fair market value of the applicable Transferred
Real Property) and together with such endorsements as are available in the
relevant jurisdictions, and otherwise in such form, as Purchaser shall
reasonably require, committing to insure good and marketable fee simple title
to each Transferred Real Property, free and clear of all Liens other than
Permitted Liens, and (ii) an appropriately certified ALTA/ACSM land title
survey for each parcel of the Transferred Real Property from a licensed
surveyor, dated as of a date reasonably proximate to the Closing Date, and
showing no Liens other than Permitted Liens, and otherwise in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of Seller, the other Seller Parties or their affiliates shall be required
to make any additional representations, warranties or covenants, expressed or
implied, not contained in this Agreement or to assume or incur any
Liabilities.

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, but in any event at
least 10 business days prior to Closing, Purchaser will notify Seller in
writing if Purchaser elects to acquire Irapuato Property 8 and Irapuato
Property 9 (each as defined in _Section 3.06(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter). In the event Purchaser provides such notice, Irapuato Property 8 and
Irapuato Property 9 will be deemed to be part of the "Irapuato Property"
included among the Transferred Assets. In the absence of such election,
Irapuato Property 8 and Irapuato Property 9 will be deemed not to have been
disclosed in the Seller Disclosure Letter and will be deemed not to be part of
the "Irapuato Property" for any purpose under this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements. For the avoidance of doubt, such election will be taken into
account in the

 



      
 

 



 

allocation of the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 10.02_, but will not
affect the amount of the Purchase Price.

 



 

5.07 _Exclusivity_ _._ Seller has been in negotiations with other parties
concerning a possible sale of the Business and such other parties have
obtained certain information relating thereto. Seller agrees to immediately
terminate, and to direct its applicable affiliates, representatives, agents,
officers, employees, attorneys and accountants to terminate, all existing
negotiations or activities with any such party other than Purchaser, its
affiliates and their representatives. Seller shall not, and shall not
authorize, permit or direct any of its affiliates or any of its or their
representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit the submission of
proposals, inquiries or offers relating to, (ii) enter into discussions or
negotiations with, or provide any confidential information to, any person, or
(iii) enter into any agreement or agreement in principle, in each case in
connection with any divestiture of the Business or similar transaction
involving the Business or the Transferred Assets (other than Inventory and
obsolete equipment in the ordinary course of business), in each case other
than with respect to the Acquisition or otherwise with respect to Purchaser or
its affiliates.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI 
_MEXICO EMPLOYMENT MATTERS_**

 



 

6.01 _Continuation of Employment; Employer Substitution_ _._ (a) For purposes
of this Agreement, the term " _Irapuato Business Employee_ " will refer to
each employee of Seller or any of the Seller Parties who is (i) set forth on
_Section_ _6.01(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter or (ii) after the date of
this Agreement becomes employed by Seller or any of the Seller Parties at the
Irapuato Property primarily in connection with the Business.

 



 

(b) Each Irapuato Business Employee (whether or not actively at work) will be
transferred to Purchaser (either directly or indirectly to one or more service
companies) through an "employer substitution" ( _sustituci on patronal_) under
Article 41 of the Mexican Federal Labor Law ( _Ley Federal de Trabajo_ ) (each
such transferred Irapuato Business Employee, a " _Transferred Irapuato
Employee_ "), as set out in greater detail in the Employer Substitution
Agreement. Purchaser (either directly or indirectly to one or more service
companies) and Seller will jointly deliver a written employer substitution
notice to all Irapuato Business Employees. Purchaser (and any affiliate
employing any Transferred Irapuato Employee) will ensure that the terms and
conditions of employment of each Transferred Irapuato Employee (A) will, for
at least 6 months following the employer substitution, be the same as (or,
subject to the other provisions of this Article VI and to the extent permitted
under Applicable Law with respect to an employer substitution, substantially
similar to) those in effect immediately before the employer substitution, (B)
be sufficient to avoid statutory or other severance obligations and to avoid
severance and similar obligations under any applicable severance benefit plan,
program, policy, agreement or arrangement and (C) otherwise comply in all
respects with Applicable Laws and Purchasers covenants set forth in this
_Article VI_. Effective as of the Effective Time, each Transferred Irapuato
Employee will cease to be an employee of Seller and will cease to participate
in any Seller Benefit Plan. Nothing herein will be construed as a
representation, warranty, covenant or guarantee by Seller or any Seller Party
that some or all of the Irapuato Business Employees will remain employed by
the Seller Parties at any time or will continue employment with Purchaser
after Closing.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Without limiting the other obligations of Purchaser hereunder or in the
Employer Substitution Agreement, from and after the Effective Time, Purchaser
and its affiliates will give each Transferred Irapuato Employee full credit
for all purposes under any employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained
by Purchaser and its affiliates for such Transferred Irapuato Employees
service with Seller, the Seller Parties and any of their respective
predecessor employers to the same extent recognized by Seller and the Seller
Parties immediately before the Effective Time.

 



 

6.02 _Continuation of Benefits_ _._ Without limiting the other obligations of
Purchaser hereunder or in the Employer Substitution Agreement, until the later
of June 1, 2016 and the date that is six months after the Closing Date,
Purchaser will, or will cause its affiliates to, provide each Transferred
Irapuato Employee with (a) salary and cash bonus opportunities that in each
case are no less favorable to such Transferred Irapuato Employee than those in
effect immediately before the Effective Time and (b) employee benefit plans
and arrangements (other than salary, cash bonus opportunities and equity and
equity-based compensation plans and arrangements) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such Transferred Irapuato
Employee immediately before the Closing Date. Purchaser agrees to honor and
assume, and to cause its affiliates to honor and assume, in accordance with
their respective current terms (but subject to any right of Purchaser to amend
or terminate such arrangements in accordance with such terms), each
employment, deferred compensation, severance, termination or other agreement
or arrangement between Seller or any of the Seller Parties, on the one hand,
and any Transferred Irapuato Employee, on the other hand, in each case to the
extent the Liabilities under such arrangements arise out of, relate to or are
in respect of the period from and after the Closing.

 



 

6.03 _Severance_ _._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, but without limiting the other obligations of Purchaser hereunder
or in the Employer Substitution Agreement, Purchaser agrees to provide each
Transferred Irapuato Employee whose employment is terminated by Purchaser or
its affiliates during the one-year period immediately following the Closing
Date with severance benefits that are no less favorable than the greater of
(a) the severance benefits provided by the Seller severance plan applicable to
such Transferred Irapuato Employee immediately before the Closing Date and (b)
the severance benefits such Transferred Irapuato Employee would be entitled to
receive under the plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement of Purchaser
or its affiliates applicable to similarly situated employees immediately
before such termination, in each case taking into account such Transferred
Irapuato Employees length of service with Seller or the applicable Seller
Party as provided in _Section 6.01(c)_. Seller and Purchaser intend that (i)
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not constitute a
severance of employment of any Transferred Irapuato Employee before or upon
the consummation of such transactions and (ii) the Transferred Irapuato
Employees will have continuous and uninterrupted employment immediately before
and immediately after the Closing. Purchaser will assume all Liabilities in
respect of claims made by any Irapuato Business Employees for severance or
other separation benefits (including claims for wrongful dismissal, notice of
termination of employment or pay in lieu of notice) arising out of, relating
to or in respect of (A) Purchasers failure to give the employer substitution
notice to any Irapuato Business Employee in accordance with this Agreement,
(B) any Transferred Irapuato Employees termination of employment on or after
the Effective Time or (C) any Transferred Irapuato Employees resignation from
employment on or after the Effective Time.

 



      
 

 



 

6.04 _Certain Welfare Benefits Matters_ _._ (a) No later than the Closing
Date, Purchaser will establish or cause to be established, at its own expense,
benefit plans that provide life insurance, health care, dental care,
accidental death and dismemberment insurance, disability and other group
welfare benefits for Transferred Irapuato Employees (" _Purchaser Welfare
Plans_ "), subject to the same coverage limits as such group welfare benefits
granted by Seller to the Transferred Irapuato Employees immediately prior to
Closing. Purchaser will (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to the Transferred Irapuato Employees and
their eligible dependents under the Purchaser Welfare Plans to the extent
waived or otherwise satisfied under the applicable corresponding Seller
Benefit Plan immediately before the Effective Time and (ii) provide each
Transferred Irapuato Employee and his or her eligible dependents with credit
for any co-payments and deductibles paid before the Effective Time in the
calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying
any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any Purchaser
Welfare Plans in which such Transferred Irapuato Employee participates after
the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Seller and the applicable Seller Parties will be responsible in accordance
with their respective welfare plans in effect before the Effective Time for
all reimbursement claims (such as medical and dental claims) for expenses
incurred, and for all non-reimbursement claims (such as life insurance claims)
incurred, under such plans before the Effective Time by Transferred Irapuato
Employees and their eligible dependents. Purchaser will be responsible in
accordance with the applicable Purchaser Welfare Plans for all reimbursement
claims (such as medical and dental claims) for expenses incurred, and for all
non-reimbursement claims (such as life insurance claims) incurred, on or after
the Effective Time by Transferred Irapuato Employees and their eligible
dependents. For purposes of this _Section 6.04(b)_, a claim will be deemed to
have been incurred on (i) the date of death or dismemberment in the case of
claims under life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment policies or
(ii) the date on which the charge or expense giving rise to such claim is
incurred (without regard to the date of inception of the related illness or
injury or the date of the submission of the claim related thereto) in the case
of all other claims; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event of a hospital
stay that commences before the Effective Time and ends at or after the
Effective Time, the cost thereof will be apportioned between Seller, on the
one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, with Seller responsible for that
portion of the cost incurred before the Effective Time and Purchaser
responsible for the balance of such cost.

 



 

6.05 _Bonus Plan_ _._ Seller will make a prorated annual bonus payment to each
Transferred Irapuato Employee as of, and who remains employed through, the
Closing, the amount (if any) of which will equal the product of the applicable
Transferred Irapuato Employees annual bonus amount (as described in the next
sentence) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
days in the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs that elapse before
the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is 365. Seller may determine
the annual bonus amount using any good faith methodology (which need not be
the same for each Transferred Irapuato Employee), including by basing such
amount upon target bonus or upon actual performance. Such prorated bonuses
will be paid no later than the date on which Seller pays annual bonuses to
similarly situated other employees of Seller and its Affiliates.

 



       
 

 



 

6.06 _Accrued Vacation_ _._ For purposes of determining the number of vacation
days to which each Transferred Irapuato Employee will be entitled during the
calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs, Purchaser will assume and
honor all vacation days accrued or earned but not yet taken by such
Transferred Irapuato Employee as of the Effective Time. To the extent that a
Transferred Irapuato Employee is entitled under Applicable Law or any policy
of Seller or the Seller Parties to be paid for any vacation days accrued or
earned but not yet taken by such Transferred Irapuato Employee as of the
Effective Time, Purchaser will discharge the Liability for such vacation days.

 



 

6.07 _Liabilities_ _._ Except as otherwise specifically provided in this
_Article VI _or Applicable Law, effective as of the Closing, (a) Seller and
the Seller Parties will retain all Liabilities relating to employment and
employee benefits that are incurred or arise before the Closing Date, in each
case, that relate to the Irapuato Business Employees (or any dependent or
beneficiary of any Irapuato Business Employee) and (b) Purchaser will not
assume any such Liabilities. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this
Agreement, effective as of the Closing, (i) Purchaser will be responsible for
all Liabilities that are incurred or arise on or after the Closing Date and
that relate to Purchasers employment relationship with any Transferred
Irapuato Employee (or any dependent or beneficiary of any Transferred Irapuato
Employee) and (ii) Seller and the Seller Parties will not retain or be
responsible for any such Liabilities.

 



 

6.08 _Collectively Bargained Employees_ _._ With respect to each CBA,
Purchaser will, or will cause one of its affiliates to, enter into a new CBA
with the union representing the Transferred Irapuato Employees pursuant to
which the Purchaser or such affiliate agrees to terms and conditions relating
to the Transferred Irapuato Employees substantially identical to those
effective as of the Effective Time (including the obligation to honor the
terms and conditions of the original CBA and any obligations thereunder
requiring a successor to recognize a particular labor union as authorized
representative or authorized bargaining agent of an employee group or for any
other purpose). In any event, as of the Effective Time, Purchaser and its
affiliates will be the "employer" of each Transferred Irapuato Employee for
purposes of each CBA and Purchaser and its affiliates will, subject to the
immediately succeeding sentence, have sole responsibility for all Liabilities
arising under the CBAs. Following the Effective Time, any employee benefit
that is required pursuant to any CBA to be provided to any Transferred
Irapuato Employee pursuant to a Seller Benefit Plan (other than benefits
accrued and vested as of the Closing under any Seller Benefit Plan that is not
assumed as of the Closing by Purchaser and its affiliates pursuant to this
_Article VI_) will instead be provided pursuant to an employee benefit plan
maintained by Purchaser or one of its affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this _Article VI_ and for the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser
agrees that the provisions of this _Article VI_ will be subject to any
applicable provisions of each CBA in respect of Transferred Irapuato Employees
to the extent the provisions of this _Article VI _are inconsistent with or
otherwise in conflict with the provisions of such CBA.

 



 

6.09 _Administration; Employee Communications_ _._ (a) Following the date of
this Agreement, Seller and Purchaser will reasonably cooperate in all matters
reasonably necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this _Article
VI_, including exchanging

 



      
 

 



 

information and data relating to employee benefits and employee benefit plan
coverages, and in obtaining any governmental approvals required hereunder.

 



 

(b) From the date of this Agreement to the Closing, Purchaser will consult
with Seller and obtain Sellers consent (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) before distributing any communications to
Irapuato Business Employees, whether relating to employee benefits, post-
Closing terms of employment or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Purchaser will be permitted to provide communications to Irapuato Business
Employees as part of the employee communications plan jointly developed by
Purchaser and Seller. Seller will reasonably consult with Purchaser before
commencing any information or consultation process with any labor unions that
are required to accomplish the transfer of Irapuato Business Employees to
Purchaser or one of its affiliates.

 



 

6.10 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_ _._ Notwithstanding any other provision
herein to the contrary and without limiting the generality of _Section
12.02_, no provision of this _Article VI_ will (a) be construed to establish,
amend or modify any benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, agreement
or arrangement or (b) create any third-party beneficiary rights or obligations
in any person (including for the avoidance of doubt any Irapuato Business
Employee) other than the parties hereto or any right to employment or
continued employment or to a particular term or condition of employment with
Purchaser or any of its affiliates.

 **ARTICLE VIII 
_TERMINATION; EFFECT OF TERMINATION_**

before the Closing:

 



 

(i) by mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser;

 



 

(ii) by (x) Seller, if any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ or
_Section 7.03 _have become incapable of fulfillment by the Outside Date and
shall not have been waived by Seller, or (y) Purchaser, if any of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ or _Section 7.02 _have become
incapable of fulfillment by the Outside Date and shall not have been waived by
Purchaser;

 



 

(iii) by Seller or Purchaser, if the Closing does not occur on or before the

(iv) by Seller if (A) all of the conditions to Purchasers obligations set
forth in _Section 7.01_ and _Section 7.02_ have been satisfied or (to the

Purchaser has failed to complete the Closing within two business days
following the date the Closing is required to be consummated

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to _Section 2.01_ due to the proceeds of the Financing not being

Agreements.

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that the party seeking termination pursuant to
clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) is not then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement.

 



 

(b) In the event of termination by Seller or Purchaser pursuant to this

which will remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the termination of
this Agreement, and (y) all confidential information received by Seller, its
directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives or advisors with
respect to the businesses of Purchaser and its affiliates will be kept
confidential in the same manner as Sellers confidential information is
required to be treated in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(c) Subject to the last sentence of _Section 8.01(d)_, in the event of an
Antitrust Failure or a Financing Failure, Purchaser shall pay or cause to be
paid to Seller a fee of $57,375,000 (the " _Reverse Termination Fee_ ") by
wire transfer of same-day funds no later than the effective date of such
termination (in the case of a termination by Purchaser) within two business
days of the effectiveness of such termination (in the case of termination by
Seller). " _Antitrust Failure_ " means the termination of this Agreement by
Purchaser or Seller pursuant to _Section 8.01(a)(ii)_ or _Section
8.01(a)(iii)_ after all of the conditions to Purchasers obligations set forth
in _Article VII_ have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by law)
waived other than (i) solely to the extent the failure of such conditions
relates to the HSR Act or Foreign Antitrust Law, the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.01(a)_, (ii) solely to the extent the failure of such conditions
relates to the HSR Act or Foreign Antitrust Law, the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.01(b)_, and (iii) those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to such conditions being reasonably
capable of being satisfied at the Closing. " _Financing Failure_ " means the
termination of this Agreement by Seller pursuant to _Section 8.01(a)(iv)_.

 



 

(d) Each of Seller and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that (i) the
agreements contained in _Section 8.01(c)_ are an integral part of the
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) in light of the
difficulty of accurately determining actual damages with respect to the
foregoing, upon any such termination of this Agreement and payment in full of
the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.01(c)_, the right to such
payment constitutes a reasonable estimate of the losses that will be suffered
by reason of any such termination of this Agreement and constitutes liquidated
damages (and not a penalty) and (iii) if the Reverse Termination Fee is
payable but not timely paid as required by _Section 8.01(c)_, Seller shall be
entitled to seek and receive, in addition to the Reverse Termination Fee,
interest thereon and Sellers costs and expenses of collection thereof
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth herein, Seller may pursue

 



      
 

 



 

the remedies permitted pursuant to _Section 12.14_ at any time prior to a
valid termination of this Agreement by Seller pursuant to _Section 8.01_, and
in the event of a willful and material breach by Purchaser of the terms,
conditions or other provisions of this Agreement, may at Sellers election
pursue its actual damages arising from such breach in accordance with the last
sentence of _Section 8.02_ in lieu of receiving the Reverse Termination Fee.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if Purchaser
fails to effect the Closing when required pursuant to the terms hereof, then
Sellers sole and exclusive remedies (regardless of the Theory of Liability
asserted) against Purchaser in respect of this Agreement, any Ancillary
Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby shall be to (i) seek an order of specific performance or pursue
damages prior to termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 12.14_ or
(ii) terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.01(a)_ and either
(A) collect from Purchaser, if payable pursuant to _Section 8.01(c)_, the
Reverse Termination Fee, or (B) pursue any damages payable pursuant to the
last sentence of _Section 8.02_. Upon payment of the Reverse Termination Fee
by or on behalf of Purchaser pursuant to _Section 8.01(c)_, (1) except with
respect to the provisions of the Surviving Provisions, no Purchaser Related
Party or Financing Source shall have any liability or obligation relating to
or arising out of (including as a result of any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement relating to or arising out of, or the
termination of) this Agreement, any other Ancillary Agreement (including the
Debt Commitment Letter) or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, and (2) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any
Proceeding pending in connection with this Agreement, any other Ancillary
Agreement (including the Debt Commitment Letter) or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, to the extent maintained by Seller or any of
its affiliates, against Purchaser, to be dismissed with prejudice and without
liability of any party for costs, fees or expenses, promptly following the
payment of any such amounts. For purposes hereof, " _Theory of Liability_ "
shall mean any claims, obligations, liabilities, causes of action, actions or
Proceedings (in each case, whether in contract or in tort, at law or in
equity, or pursuant to law) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise
under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to,
this Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement (including the Debt Commitment
Letter), or the negotiation, execution, performance, termination or breach
(whether intentional, willful, negligent or otherwise) of this Agreement or
any other Ancillary Agreement (including the Debt Commitment Letter),
including any representation or warranty made in, or other oral or written
information, statement or communication made or provided in connection with,
or as an inducement to enter into, this Agreement or any other Ancillary
Agreement (including the Debt Commitment Letter), and including theories of
equity, agency, control, instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single
business enterprise, piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization or
otherwise. The parties acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding anything
expressed or implied in this Agreement or elsewhere, in no event shall (a)
Purchaser be required to pay the Reverse Termination Fee on more than one
occasion, (b) Purchaser be required to pay the Reverse Termination Fee and any
amounts pursuant to the last sentence of _Section 8.02_ (other than with
respect to the Surviving Provisions), or (c) both an award of specific
performance pursuant to _Section 12.14(b)_ be satisfied resulting in actual
payment of the Purchase Price to Seller and the Reverse Termination Fee be
paid.

 



 

8.02 _Effect of Termination._ If this Agreement is terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby are abandoned as described in _Section
8.01_, this Agreement

 



      
 

 



 

will become null and void and of no further force and effect, except for the
provisions of (i) _Section 5.03_ relating to the obligation of Purchaser to
keep confidential certain information and data obtained by it from Seller or
Sellers representatives, (ii) _Section 8.01_ and this _Section 8.02_,
(iii) _Section 11.01 _relating to publicity, and (iv) _Article XII_ (the "
_Surviving Provisions_ "). Except as expressly set forth in _Section
8.01(e)_, nothing in _Section 8.01_ or this _Section 8.02_ will be deemed to
release any party from any Liability for any breach that is both willful and
material by such party of the terms, conditions or other provisions of this
Agreement or, prior to termination of this Agreement, to impair the right of
any party to compel specific performance by the other party of its obligations
under this Agreement in accordance with _Section 12.14_.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX 
_INDEMNIFICATION_**

 



 

9.01 _Indemnification by Seller._ Subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 9.04_, from and after the Closing, Seller will indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Purchaser and each of its affiliates and each of their
respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents and
representatives (the " _Purchaser Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all
claims, losses, damages, liabilities, obligations or expenses, including
reasonable legal fees and expenses and reasonable amounts paid in
investigation, defense or settlement of the foregoing (collectively, "
_Losses_ "), suffered or incurred by such Purchaser Indemnitee (without
duplication for any Loss for which indemnification may be provided under more
than one provision of this _Section 9.01_) to the extent arising or resulting
from any of the following:

 



 

(a) any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty of Seller
contained in (i) this Agreement or (ii) the certificate delivered pursuant to
_Section 7.02(e)_;

 



 

(b) any breach of any covenant or other agreement of Seller contained in this
Agreement;

 



 

(c) any Retained Liability; and

 



 

(d) any fees, expenses or other payments incurred or owed by Seller or its
affiliates to any agent, broker, investment banker or other firm or person
retained or employed by it in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



 

9.02 _Indemnification by Purchaser._ Subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 9.04_, from and after the Closing, Purchaser will indemnify, defend
and hold harmless Seller and each of its affiliates and each of their
respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents and
representatives (the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all
Losses suffered or incurred by such Seller Indemnitee (without duplication for
any Loss for which indemnification may be provided under more than one
provision of this _Section 9.02_) to the extent arising or resulting from any
of the following:

 



 

(a) any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty of
Purchaser contained in (i) this Agreement or (ii) the certificate delivered
pursuant to _Section 7.03(d)_;

 



      
 

 



 

(b) any breach of any covenant or other agreement of Purchaser contained in
this Agreement;

 



 

(c) any Assumed Liability; and

 



 

(d) any fees, expenses or other payments incurred or owed by Purchaser or its
affiliates to any agent, broker, investment banker or other firm or person
retained or employed by it in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



 

9.03 _Indemnification Procedures._ (a) _Procedures Relating to
Indemnification of Third Party Claims._ If any party (the " _Indemnified
Party_ ") receives written notice of the commencement of any Proceeding or the
assertion of any claim by a third party or the imposition of any penalty or
assessment for which indemnity may be sought under _Sections 9.01_ or _9.02_
(a " _Third Party Claim_ "), and such Indemnified Party intends to seek
indemnity pursuant to this _Article IX_, the Indemnified Party will promptly
provide the other party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") with written notice of
such Third Party Claim, stating the nature, basis and the amount thereof, to
the extent known, along with copies of the relevant notices and documents
(including court papers, if any) evidencing such Third Party Claim and the
basis for indemnification sought and otherwise in reasonable detail. Failure
of the Indemnified Party to give such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying
Party from liability on account of this indemnification, except if and to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby. The
Indemnifying Party will have 45 days from receipt of any such notice of a
Third Party Claim to give notice to assume the defense thereof; provided that
the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of a Third
Party Claim that seeks the imposition of criminal penalties or other sanctions
(other than the payment of money) that would be reasonably expected to
materially and adversely affect the Business. If notice to the effect set
forth in the immediately preceding sentence is given by the Indemnifying
Party, the Indemnifying Party will have the right to assume the defense of the
Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice,
which counsel must be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. So long
as the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim in
accordance herewith and is fulfilling its obligations with respect thereto,
(i) the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and
expense and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, it being
understood that the Indemnifying Party will control such defense, (ii) the
Indemnified Party will not file any papers, admit any liability with respect
to, or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to or otherwise compromise or discharge the Third Party Claim without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, (iii) the Indemnifying
Party will not (A) admit to any wrongdoing or (B) consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim,
in each case, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (such
written consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and (iv) all the
Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof as
reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party, including the retention and
(upon the Indemnifying Partys request) the furnishing to the Indemnifying
Party of records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third
Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material furnished
hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party will consent to any judgment or agree to any
settlement, compromise or discharge with respect to a Third Party Claim that
the

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnifying Party may recommend and that by its terms only involves money
damages and not equitable relief and obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay
the full amount of the liability in connection with such Third Party Claim,
which releases the Indemnified Party completely in connection with such Third
Party Claim. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will not file any papers, admit any
liability or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
with respect to, or otherwise compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party. The parties will
use reasonable best efforts to minimize Losses from Third Party Claims and
will act in good faith in responding to, defending against, settling or
otherwise dealing with such claims. The parties will also cooperate in any
such defense and give each other reasonable access to all information relevant
thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, whether or not the Indemnifying Party has
assumed the defense, such Indemnifying Party will not be obligated to
indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder for any judgment consented to, any
settlement entered into, without the Indemnifying Partys prior written
consent.

 



 

(b) _Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims._ The Indemnified Party will
promptly provide the Indemnifying Party with written notice of its discovery
of any matter giving rise to a claim of indemnity pursuant to this _Article
IX_ that does not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought
to be collected from the Indemnified Party, with such written notice stating
the nature, basis and the amount thereof, to the extent known, along with
copies of the relevant notices and documents (including court papers, if any)
evidencing such matter and the basis for indemnification sought and otherwise
in reasonable detail. The failure so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability on account of this
indemnification, except only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
actually prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party will have 60 days from
receipt of any such written notice to give notice of dispute of the claim to
the Indemnified Party, which notice shall state in reasonable detail the
reason for such dispute. The Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate and
assist the Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of any claim for
indemnity by the Indemnified Party and in otherwise resolving such matters.
Such assistance and cooperation will include providing reasonable access, in a
manner that does not unreasonably disrupt the normal operation of the business
of the Indemnified Party, to and copies of information, records and documents
relating to such matters, furnishing employees to assist in the investigation,
defense and resolution of such matters and providing legal and business
assistance with respect to such matters.

 



 

9.04 _Limitations on Indemnification._ (a) Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this _Article IX_, (i) Seller will not be liable, pursuant to
_Section 9.01(a)_, and Purchaser will not be liable, pursuant to _Section
9.02(a)_, for any indemnifiable Losses suffered by any Purchaser Indemnitee or
Seller Indemnitee, as applicable, arising out of a breach of any
representation or warranty of Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, herein
unless a claim therefor is asserted in writing before the end of the
applicable survival period pursuant to _Section 9.04(b)_, failing which such
claim will be waived and extinguished, (ii) Seller will not be liable,
pursuant to _Section 9.01(a)_, for (A) any Losses suffered by any Purchaser
Indemnitee unless the aggregate of all Losses suffered by the Purchaser
Indemnitees exceeds, on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to $7,650,000 (the
" _Deductible_ "), and then Seller will only be liable to the extent of any
such excess, or (B) any individual items or series of related items where the
Loss relating thereto is less than $100,000 (the " _Mini-Basket_ "), and such
items will

 



      
 

 



 

not be aggregated for purposes of the immediately preceding clause (A), (iii)
Purchaser will not be liable, pursuant to _Section 9.02(a)_, for (A) any
Losses suffered by any Seller Indemnitee unless the aggregate of all Losses
suffered by the Seller Indemnitees exceeds, on a cumulative basis, an amount
equal to the Deductible, and then Seller will only be liable to the extent of
any such excess, or (B) any individual items or series of related items where
the Loss relating thereto is less than the Mini-Basket, and such items will
not be aggregated for purposes of the immediately preceding clause (A), (iv)
the aggregate liability of Seller hereunder, pursuant to _Section 9.01(a)_,
for Losses suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitees will in no event exceed
$95,625,000 (the " _Cap_ "), (v) the aggregate liability of Purchaser
hereunder, pursuant to _Section 9.02(a)_, for Losses suffered by the Seller
Indemnitees will in no event exceed the Cap, and (vi) neither party hereto
will be liable to the other party for punitive damages or any damages that are
not reasonably foreseeable and proximate consequences of such breach (in each
case other than those paid or payable to third parties with respect to Third
Party Claims) claimed by such other party resulting from such first partys
breach of its representations, warranties or covenants hereunder or otherwise
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. In
no event will Seller be obligated to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees or
any other person with respect to any matter to the extent that such matter was
specifically taken into account as a reserve in the final determination of the
Closing Inventory Amounts; _provided_ that the limitations in foregoing
_clauses (i) to (v)_ shall not apply to claims of, or causes of action
arising from, the Specified Representations or intentional fraud by the
Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(b) The representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement
and in any document delivered in connection herewith will survive the Closing
solely for purposes of this _Article IX_ as follows: (i) the representations
and warranties set forth in _Section 3.10_ and _Section 3.14(b)_ will
survive until sixty (60) days after the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations, (ii) the Specified Representations (other than those set forth
in Section 3.10) will survive until the 20th anniversary of the Closing Date,
(iii) all other representations and warranties in _Article III_ and _Article
IV_ will survive for eighteen months following the Closing, (iv) the covenant
in _Section 5.02_ will not survive the Closing and (v) the other covenants
set forth herein will survive the Closing to the extent, if any, provided
pursuant to the terms thereof.

 



 

(c) Purchaser and Seller will cooperate with each other with respect to
resolving any Loss with respect to which one party is obligated to indemnify
the other party hereunder, including by using commercially reasonable efforts
to mitigate any such Loss; _provided_ , _however_ , that this sentence shall
not require any party hereto to initiate or pursue litigation or other claims
against third parties (other than taking the relevant administrative steps to
file for or make ordinary course claims under insurance policies, "pass
through" warranties or other indemnification or reimbursement Contracts from
third parties) in respect of such Loss. Subject to the other terms of this
_Article IX_, the costs and expenses of such mitigation efforts shall be
included in the Losses for which the Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification hereunder.

 



 

(d) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that (i) other than the representations
and warranties of Seller specifically contained in _Article III_ of this
Agreement, the certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 7.02(e)_ and any
representations and warranties expressly set forth

 



      
 

 



 

in the Transition Services Agreement, the Co-Manufacturing Agreement or the
Intellectual Property License, none of Seller, any of its affiliates or any
other person has made any representation or warranty either expressed or
implied (A) with respect to the Business, the Transferred Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities or the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary
Agreements or (B) as to the accuracy or completeness of any information
regarding the Business, the Transferred Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the
transactions contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary Agreements furnished or
made available to Purchaser and its representatives and (ii) no Purchaser
Indemnitee will have any claim or right to indemnification pursuant to this
_Article IX_ and none of Seller, any of its affiliates or any other person
will have or be subject to any Liability to any Purchaser Indemnitee or any
other person with respect to any information, documents or materials furnished
by Seller, any of its affiliates or any of their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents or advisors to Purchaser, including the
Confidential Information Memorandum dated May 2015, the Due Diligence
Assistance Report dated June 18, 2015 prepared by KPMG LLP and any
information, documents or materials made available to Purchaser and its
representatives in certain "data rooms", management presentations or any other
form in expectation of the transactions contemplated hereby or by the
Ancillary Agreements (it being understood that this clause (ii) does not
supersede or otherwise affect the representations and warranties of Seller
specifically contained in _Article III_ of this Agreement, the certificate
delivered pursuant to _Section 7.02(e)_ or any representations and
warranties expressly set forth in the Transition Services Agreement, the Co-
Manufacturing Agreement or the Intellectual Property License). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that, except as expressly set forth in _Article III_ of this Agreement, the
certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 7.02(e)_ or in any representations
and warranties expressly set forth in the Transition Services Agreement, the
Co-Manufacturing Agreement or the Intellectual Property License, neither
Seller nor any of the Seller Parties has made or makes any representations or
warranties relating to the maintenance, repair, condition, design, performance
or marketability of any Transferred Asset, including merchantability or
fitness for a particular purpose.

 



 

(e) Each of Purchaser and Seller further acknowledges and agrees that, should
the Closing occur, the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser Indemnitees
and Seller Indemnitees with respect to any and all claims relating to this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, the Business, the Transferred Assets, the
Excluded Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the Retained Liabilities or the
transactions contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary Agreements (other than
(i) claims of, or causes of action arising from, intentional fraud of the
other party, (ii) claims for injunctive relief or specific performance in
accordance with _Section 12.14_, and (iii) any remedies expressly provided
for in the Transition Services Agreement, the Co-Manufacturing Agreement or
the Intellectual Property License) will be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this _Article IX_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, but without limiting any remedies expressly provided for in the Co-
Manufacturing Agreement, in no event will the aggregate liability of Seller
and its affiliates or the aggregate liability (in addition to the Purchase
Price) of Purchaser and its affiliates, on the other hand, under, arising from
or in connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements (other than the
Co-Manufacturing Agreement) or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, regardless of Theory of Liability asserted,
exceed an amount equal to the Purchase Price actually received by Seller and
its affiliates.

 



       
 

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, with
respect to any Losses that are indemnifiable by Seller under this Agreement
arising under any Environmental Law or otherwise relating to Hazardous
Materials or other environmental matters: (i) Seller will have the right, but
not the obligation, to manage and assume the control of any investigation,
cleanup or other responsive or remedial action (" _Remedial Action_ ")
associated with any such Losses ( _provided_ that Seller will provide
Purchaser with a reasonable opportunity to comment on all work plans relating
to any such Remedial Action and Seller will consider incorporating such
comments in good faith), (ii) Purchaser will provide Seller and its
consultants with access to the Transferred Real Property that may be
reasonably necessary in connection with such management and control and (iii)
no Purchaser Indemnitee will have any right to indemnification for such Losses
to the extent such Losses (A) are not required to or exceed the cost to comply
with the minimum applicable requirements under applicable Environmental Law in
effect as of the Closing (including, in the case of any Remedial Action, the
minimum applicable cleanup standards and the use of commercially reasonable
risk-based remedies, engineering controls and land use restrictions, taking
into account the continued operation of the property for commercial or
industrial purposes, as used as of the Closing; provided, however, that the
application of such remedies, controls and restrictions satisfy the
requirements of all applicable Environmental Laws and common law
interpretations thereof and any applicable Judgment) or (B) (1) arise from or
relate to any contribution to or exacerbation of such Losses by Purchaser or
its affiliates on or after the Closing Date, (2) are caused by (but not simply
revealed in connection with) any change in use of, closure of or cessation of
operations at any of the Transferred Real Property on or after the Closing
Date, (3) arise from or relate to any investigation, sampling, remedial action
or reporting to any Governmental Entity on or after the Closing Date unless
such investigation, sampling, remedial action or reporting is required by
applicable Environmental Law or common law interpretation thereof or any
applicable Judgment, (4) arise from or relate to any maintenance, repair,
replacement or upgrade of any Equipment, part or other Transferred Asset that
has reached the end of its useful life or (5) arise from or relate to any
maintenance, repair, removal or abatement of asbestos at or in any facility or
building materials unless such maintenance, repair, removal or abatement is
required by applicable Environmental Law or common law interpretation thereof
or any applicable Judgment.

 



 

9.05 _Calculation of Indemnity Payments._ The amount of any Loss for which
indemnification is provided under this _Article IX _will be net of any
amounts actually received by the Indemnified Party under third party insurance
policies and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually
received by the Indemnified Party in each case with respect to such Loss. In
addition, the amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under
this _Article IX _will be net of any Tax benefit actually realized (in the
form of a cash refund or reduction in cash Taxes otherwise payable) as a
result of such Loss by the Indemnified Party in the taxable year such Loss is
incurred or the immediately succeeding taxable year. In computing the amount
of any such Tax cost or Tax benefit, the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to
recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before
recognizing any item arising from the receipt of any indemnity payment
hereunder or the incurrence or payment of any indemnified amount. In computing
the amount of any such Tax benefit actually realized, such Tax benefit shall
be net of any Tax detriment arising from the receipt of any indemnification
payment. Upon making any indemnification payment under this _Article IX_, the
Indemnifying Party will, to the extent of such indemnification payment, be

 



      
 

 



 

subrogated to all rights of Indemnified Party against any third person in
respect of the Loss to which the indemnification payment related. Without
limiting the generality or effect of any other provision hereof, each such
Indemnified Party will duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably
necessary to evidence and perfect the above-described subrogation rights.

 



 

9.06 _Effect of Materiality Qualifiers_ _._ For purposes of calculating the
amount of Losses incurred out of or relating to any breach of a representation
or warranty, and for purposes of determining whether or not a breach has
occurred, Materiality Qualifiers shall be disregarded.

 



 

9.07 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification_ _._ For all Tax purposes, Purchaser
and Seller agree to treat (and will cause each of their respective affiliates
to treat) any indemnity payment under this Agreement as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price unless a final determination by the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service (the " _IRS_ ") (which determination will include the execution of an
IRS Form 870, Form 870-AD or successor forms) or the applicable Taxing
Authority provides otherwise.

 



 

 **ARTICLE X 
_TAX MATTERS_**

 



 

10.01 _Allocation of Certain Taxes_. In the case of any Straddle Period, (a)
Property Taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be equal to the amount of
such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that
is in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of
days in the entire Straddle Period, and will be a Retained Liability, and (b)
Property Taxes for the Post-Closing Tax Period will be equal to the amount of
such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period in the
Post-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in
the entire Straddle Period, and will be an Assumed Liability. The party that
has the primary obligation to do so under Applicable Law will file any Tax
Return that is required to be filed in respect of Taxes described in this
_Section 10.01_, and such party will pay the Taxes shown on such Tax Return
and provide a copy of such Tax Return to the other party. To the extent any
portion of such Taxes paid by Purchaser (or any refund of Taxes received by
Purchaser) is allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, or any portion of such
Taxes paid by Seller (or any refund of Taxes received by Seller) is allocable
to the Post-Closing Tax Period, Purchaser or Seller (as applicable) will pay
to the other party such proportionate amount promptly after the payment of
such Taxes (or the receipt of any such refund).

 



 

10.02 _Tax Matters._ (a) At least 14 business days before the Closing, Seller
will provide Purchaser with a proposed allocation of the total consideration
(including Liabilities assumed, to the extent appropriate under Applicable
Law) among (i) each of Seller and each of the Seller Parties and (ii) among
the Transferred Assets (collectively, the " _Preliminary Allocation_ "). If
Purchaser does not agree with the Preliminary Allocation prepared by Seller,
Seller and Purchaser will use good faith efforts to agree on a revised
Preliminary Allocation before the Closing Date. If the parties cannot agree on
the Preliminary Allocation prior to the Closing, the Preliminary Allocation as
prepared by Seller shall be used for allocating

 



      
 

 



 

the total consideration pursuant to this Agreement at the Closing. The amounts
determined under this _Section 10.02(a)_ will be used for all relevant
purposes at Closing, including the allocation of payment of the Purchase Price
between Seller Parties and calculation of Transfer Taxes required to be
collected on the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) Within 45 calendar days after the Closing, Seller will provide Purchaser a
proposed allocation (the " _Asset Allocation_ ") prepared in consultation with
Purchaser and on a separate basis and for each of Seller and each of the
Seller Parties, and in accordance with Section 1060 of the Revenue Code, the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and any similar provision of
Applicable Law, of the total consideration (including Liabilities assumed, to
the extent appropriate under Applicable Law) among the Transferred Assets.
Within 40 calendar days of receipt of the Asset Allocation, the Purchaser will
either (i) consent to such Asset Allocation or (ii) notify Seller in writing
that Purchaser objects to one or more items reflected in the Asset Allocation.
In the event of any such objection, Seller and Purchaser will negotiate in
good faith to resolve such dispute. If Seller and Purchaser agree on the Asset
Allocation (including any revised Asset Allocation), then such agreed Asset
Allocation will become final and binding upon the parties. If Seller and
Purchaser are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to the Allocation
within 90 calendar days after the delivery of the Asset Allocation to
Purchaser, then either party may submit such dispute to be resolved by an
impartial nationally recognized firm of independent certified public
accountants mutually appointed by Purchaser and Seller, and such resolution
(and the resulting Asset Allocation) will be final and binding upon the
Parties. The fees and expenses of such accounting firm will be borne equally
by Purchaser and Seller.

 



 

(c) The Parties agree for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the combined
effect of this Agreement and the Intellectual Property License shall be
characterized as the retention by Seller of all economic benefits to the
Licensed Intellectual Property in the Territory (as those terms are defined
the Intellectual Property License), and the value of the Transferred Assets
shall not include the value of the Licensed Intellectual Property in the
Territory. Accordingly, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, no portion of
the Purchase Price, under section 1060 of the Revenue Code, shall be allocated
to the Licensed Intellectual Property in the Territory. In addition, for
greater certainty, no amount shall be allocated to the obligations of the
Seller pursuant to _Section 11.08_ (Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation).

 



 

(d) Any adjustments to the Purchase Price will be reflected in an updated
Asset Allocation schedule and further allocated in accordance with the
agreement or resolution reached as set forth in _Section 10.02(b)_.

 



 

(e) Seller (and its affiliates) and Purchaser (and its affiliates) shall (i)
file all Tax Returns, including IRS Form 8594 (and any similar forms under
applicable state, local or foreign Law) consistent with the final versions of
the Asset Allocation described in this _Section 10.02_, and (ii) not take any
position in any income Tax audit or examination that is inconsistent with the
with such final versions of the Asset Allocation.

 



 

10.03 _Transfer Taxes_. (a) Seller and Purchaser will cooperate in timely
making all filings, returns, reports, elections and forms as may be required
in connection with either partys payment of Transfer Taxes. Seller and
Purchaser, as appropriate, will execute and

 



      
 

 



 

deliver, and Seller will cause each of the Seller Parties, as appropriate, to
execute and deliver, all instruments and certificates reasonably necessary to
enable the other party to comply with any filing requirements relating to any
such Transfer Taxes.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing (and thereafter in connection with any subsequent
Transfer Tax payments that may be due), the Purchaser and Seller shall
cooperate in good faith to jointly identify those Transfer Taxes (including
value-added or similar taxes) or portion thereof for which the Purchaser would
reasonably be expected to benefit from a refund or credit after the Closing,
all of which Transfer Taxes shall be paid solely by the Purchaser. Purchaser
and Seller will each be responsible for 50% of all other Transfer Taxes not
addressed by the immediately preceding sentence. Any adjustment to any such
Transfer Taxes (including any refund or additional amounts due as a result of
the final Asset Allocation) shall be allocated in accordance with the
foregoing. Any Transfer Taxes due on the Closing Date will be paid by
Purchaser on the Closing Date, and Seller will reimburse Purchaser for
Sellers portion of such Transfer Taxes at the Closing. Subject to the first
sentence of this _Section 10.03(b)_, any Transfer Taxes due after the Closing
Date will be paid by the party assessed by the applicable Taxing Authority for
such Transfer Taxes, and the other party will, within 5 business days of
receiving documentation of the payment thereof, reimburse the paying party for
such non-paying partys portion of such Transfer Taxes. Each of Seller and
Purchaser will use, and each will cause the Seller Parties or Purchaser
Parties (as applicable) to use, reasonable efforts to avail itself of any
available exemptions from any such Transfer Taxes, and to cooperate with the
other party in providing any information and documentation that may be
necessary to obtain such exemption. Purchaser and Seller agree to treat (and
will cause each of their respective affiliates to treat) any payment of
Transfer Taxes (or any portion thereof) made by Seller and/or Purchaser under
this _Section 10.03(b)_, without being the liable party in accordance with
Law, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

 



 

10.04 _Cooperation_. Seller and Purchaser agree to retain all records relating
to the finances and Taxes of the Transferred Assets for all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods until the expiration of the statutes of limitation (including any
extensions thereof) for the taxable period or periods to which such records
relate. Purchaser and Seller agree to provide each other with such information
and assistance as is reasonably necessary, including access to records and
personnel, for the preparation of any Tax Returns or for the defense of any
Tax claim or assessment, whether in connection with an audit or otherwise.
Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in obtaining any clearance certificates
or similar documents from any applicable Taxing Authority that are required or
permitted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

10.05 _Certain Elections_

 



 

(a) At the request of any Seller Party, Purchaser or the applicable Purchaser
Party will duly and timely make and file the following tax elections jointly
with the appropriate Seller Party in prescribed or other acceptable form and
within the prescribed time limits, (i) an election pursuant to section 56.4 of
the Income Tax Act (Canada); and/or (ii) an election pursuant to subsection
20(24) of the Income Tax Act (Canada).

 



      
 

 



 

(b) If applicable (as determined by the appropriate Seller Party and the
appropriate Purchaser Party), the appropriate Seller Party and the appropriate
Purchaser Party will jointly elect upon Closing, in prescribed manner and form
pursuant to Section 167 of the Excise Tax Act (Canada) that no tax be payable
pursuant to Section 167(1) of the Excise Tax Act (Canada) with respect to the
purchase and sale of the Transferred Assets hereunder. If applicable, (as
determined by the appropriate Seller Party and the appropriate Purchaser
Party), the appropriate Seller Party and the appropriate Purchaser Party will
jointly elect upon Closing, in prescribed manner and form pursuant to any
corresponding provisions of any Canadian provincial legislation imposing a
similar value added or multi-stage tax with respect to the purchase and sale
of the Transferred Assets hereunder. The appropriate Purchaser Party shall
timely file the said election form(s). The appropriate Purchaser Party agrees
to indemnify and save harmless the appropriate Seller Party from and against
any and all Tax and associated costs (including any reasonable legal fees to
investigate and/or dispute such assessment) which may become payable or
remittable by, or assessed against, the appropriate Seller Party if it is
ultimately determined that any such election is not applicable.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XI 
_ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_**

 



 

11.01 _Publicity._ From the date of this Agreement through the Closing, no
public release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated hereby
will be issued by any party without the prior consent of the other party
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as such
release or announcement may be required by Applicable Law or the rules or
regulations of any United States or foreign securities exchange, in which case
the party required to make the release or announcement will, to the extent
practicable, use commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other party
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such

affiliates may make one or more releases or announcements (including filing
this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement with the U.S. Securities Exchange
Commission or other foreign securities exchange) in connection with the
execution of this Agreement, so long as such party permits the other party
reasonable notice and time to review any such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance and (b) each of the parties may make internal
announcements to their respective employees that in each case are consistent
with the parties prior public disclosures regarding the transactions
contemplated hereby. Seller acknowledges that Purchasers affiliates may be
required to disclose the material terms of this Agreement in, and file a copy
of this Agreement as an attachment to, a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with

other materials, including any internet or other electronic communications
vehicles, to delete all references to the Excluded Marks and otherwise
discontinue use of the Excluded Marks except as otherwise permitted by this
_Section 11.02_; _provided_ , _however_ , that that the foregoing shall not
restrict Purchaser, any of its affiliates, or the Business from (a) for a
period of 180 days after the Closing, continuing to distribute

 



      
 

 



 

product literature relating to the Business that uses any of the Excluded

that such Inventory bears one or more of the Excluded Marks. In no event will
Purchaser, any of its affiliates or the Business use any of the Excluded Marks
after the Closing in any manner or for any purpose different from the use of
such Excluded Marks by Seller and the Seller Parties during the 90-day period
preceding the Closing.

representatives reasonable access to the personnel, properties, books,
Contracts, commitments and records relating to the Business, for any
reasonable business purpose, including in respect of litigation, insurance

breach any duty of confidentiality owed to any person whether such duty arises
contractually, statutorily or otherwise.

promptly following receipt of notice of any such offset by a customer
(together with supporting documentation). From and after the Closing, Seller

certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the
event of any Proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b)
acknowledges that it and the other party hereto have been induced to enter
into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this _Section 12.12_.

 



 

12.13 _Amendments._ This Agreement may be amended, modified, superseded or
canceled and any of the provisions hereof may be waived only by an instrument
in writing signed by an officer of each of the parties hereto or, in the case
of a waiver, by or on behalf of the party waiving compliance; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that _Sections 8.01(e)_ , _12.02_ , _12.09_ , _12.10, 12.12_ and
_12.14_ hereof and this _Section 12.13_ may not be amended, modified,
superseded, canceled or waived in any manner materially adverse to the rights
of the Financing Sources thereunder without the prior written consent of the
Financing Sources.

 



 

12.14 _Specific Enforcement_ _._ (a) The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at
law if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Subject to
_Section 12.14(b),_ it is accordingly agreed that the parties will be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the provisions of this Agreement (including the
obligation to consummate the Acquisition) in any court of the State of
Delaware located in New Castle County or any federal court sitting in the
State of Delaware located in New Castle County, this being in addition

 



      
 

 



 

to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, whether
pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein to the contrary, prior to
the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.01_,
but without limiting the right of Seller to seek payment of the Reverse
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.01(c)_ (subject to the limitations set
forth in _Section 12.14(c)_ below) or to seek a Judgment of specific
performance of Purchasers other obligations under this Agreement (including
_Section 5.05_), Seller (but only Seller and none of its affiliates or any
other Person) shall be entitled to seek a Judgment of specific performance
against Purchaser to fund and consummate the Acquisition, in each case, if and
only if each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (A) all of the
conditions to Purchasers obligations set forth in Section 7.01 and Section
7.02 have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by law) waived (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to such conditions being reasonably capable of being satisfied at
the Closing) and (B) either the Financing or Alternative Financing has been
funded or is reasonably capable being funded at the Closing in accordance with
its terms (taking into account the provisions of _Section 5.05_).

 



 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, (i) in no event shall Seller or any of its affiliates or
any person claiming by, through or on behalf of any of them have any rights or
claims against any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, any
other Ancillary Agreement, including the Debt Commitment Letter, or the
Financing, provided, that nothing herein shall be construed to limit Sellers
rights under _Section 12.14(b)_, (ii) while Seller may pursue both a grant of
specific performance as and only to the extent expressly permitted by this
_Section 12.14_ and the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 8.01(c)_, under no circumstances shall Seller be permitted or
entitled to receive both effective specific performance actually resulting in
the Closing and any portion of the Reverse Termination Fee and (iii) in the
event that Seller requests that the Reverse Termination Fee be paid pursuant
to _Section 8.01(c)_ and the Reverse Termination Fee is paid pursuant to and
in accordance with the terms of _Section 8.01(c)_, Seller shall not be
entitled to enforce any provision of this Agreement (other than the Surviving
Provisions) or to seek any specific performance of, or any injunctive or
similar relief to prevent any breaches or threatened breaches of, any
provision of any Ancillary Agreement by Purchaser.
