validly appointed, and/or succeed Deutsche Bank or the appropriate Seller,
as custodian, trustee, fiduciary, custodian agent or successor of Deutsche

in any Client Contract (other than Deutsche Bank or an Affiliate) or of any
Governmental Authority is required to be obtained and has not been obtained as

or approval of such parties or of a Governmental Authority has not been
obtained or as otherwise provided in the Servicing Agreement, shall be subject
to the Servicing Agreement (and each such Client Contract shall be identified
on Exhibit A thereto) and shall not be assigned or novated until such time as
all necessary consents and approvals are obtained or as otherwise provided in
the Servicing Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that such servicing shall
not be deemed to constitute an assignment or novation of any such Client
Contract.



(b) Notwithstanding anything in Section 2.02(a) to the contrary, the Purchased
Assets shall exclude the following assets and properties owned by Deutsche
Bank and the Sellers (the " _Excluded Assets_ "):

covenant or agreement, or for any claim of indemnification, contained in

from and after the Closing, to the extent that such breach or claim arises out
of or by virtue of Deutsche BankÂ’s or a SellerÂ’s performance or
nonperformance thereunder on or prior to the Closing, it being understood
that, as between the Parties hereto (for themselves and as nominees of the
Sellers and the Purchasing Subsidiaries, as applicable), the foregoing shall
apply notwithstanding any provision which may be contained in, or any form of
consent to the assignment of, any such lease, contract, license, commitment,
agreement, or arrangement which by its terms imposes such Liabilities upon
the Purchaser or a Purchasing Subsidiary and which assignment is accepted by
the Purchaser or a Purchasing Subsidiary notwithstanding the presence of such
a provision.



SECTION 2.04. _Purchase Price; Allocation of Purchase Price_. (a) The
aggregate consideration payable for the Shares and the Purchased Assets shall
consist of the sum of (A) the Premium (as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.10),
_plus_ (B) the product of (1) Final Book Value multiplied by (2) the Fixed
Exchange Rate, _plus_ (C) the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities
(collectively, the " _Purchase Price_ "). At the Closing the Purchaser shall
pay to Deutsche Bank an amount in cash equal to the sum of (A) the Premium (as
reduced by the delivery of Purchaser Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.11),
_less_ (B) the product of (1) the Holdback Amount multiplied by (2) the Fixed
Exchange Rate, _plus_ (C) the product of (1) the Estimated Book Value
multiplied by (2) the Fixed Exchange Rate (such amount being the " _Closing
Date Cash Payment_ ").

 



(b) The Purchase Price and any subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price
shall be allocated among the Shares and the Purchased Assets in accordance
with Section 1060 of the Code, the Regulations issued thereunder and Schedule
2.04(b) (the " _Allocation Method_ "). Not less than five (5) Business Days
before the Closing Date, Deutsche Bank shall deliver to the Purchaser a
proposed allocation of the Closing Date Cash Payment and each Local Closing
Date Cash Payment, which proposed allocation shall be consistent with Schedule
2.04(b). Except as otherwise required by applicable Law or pursuant to a
"determination" under Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any comparable provision
of state, local, or non-United States law), the Purchaser and Deutsche Bank
agree that the transactions contemplated in this Agreement will be reported
for all Tax purposes in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement,
including Schedule 2.04(b) and the allocation under this Section 2.04(b) (to
the extent agreed to by the Parties pursuant to Section 2.04(c)), and that
neither of them (nor any of their Affiliates) will take any position
inconsistent therewith in any Tax Return, in any refund claim, in any
litigation or otherwise.

 

26 (c) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Deutsche Bank will provide to
the Purchaser a copy of its proposed allocation of the Purchase Price and
each Local Purchase Price among the Purchased Assets and the Shares in a
manner consistent with Schedule 2.04(b) (the " _Proposed Allocation_ "). If
the Purchaser disputes the Proposed Allocation, the Purchaser will give
Deutsche Bank a written notice of such dispute (the " _Allocation Dispute
Notice_ ") within 30 days after receipt of the Proposed Allocation setting
forth the matters in dispute and the specific grounds for such dispute. If
Purchaser does not provide Deutsche Bank with such Allocation Dispute Notice
within such 30 day period, Purchaser will be deemed to have agreed to, and
accepted, the Proposed Allocation. Deutsche Bank and the Purchaser will
endeavor in good faith to resolve any dispute within 30 days after Deutsche
BankÂ’s receipt of the Alloation Dispute Notice. If Deutsche Bank and Purchaser
are unable in good faith to resolve any such dispute with respect to the
Proposed Allocation within 30 days after Deutsche BankÂ’s receipt of the
Allocation Dispute Notice (and in no event later than at least 10 days before
the last day for filing IRS Form 8594 (or any similar form required to be
filed under state, local or non-United States law)), Deutsche Bank and
Purchaser agree to each use its own allocation of the Purchase Price and each
Local Purchase Price among the Purchased Assets and the Shares; provided,
however that each such allocation of Deutsche Bank and Purchaser is
consistent with Schedule 2.04(b). The allocation of any subsequent adjustments
to the Purchase Price or any Local Purchase Price shall be determined in a
manner consistent with this subsection.



(d) In the event that applicable Law requires the allocation of a Local
Purchase Price prior to the dates contemplated by Section 2.04, the Parties
will endeavor in good faith to finalize the allocation of such Local Purchase
Price within the period required by such applicable Law.



(e) Solely for purposes of Sections 2.04(b), (c) and (d), in the event the
Purchaser elects, in accordance with Section 2.11 hereof, to pay the Premium
in the form of a combination of cash and shares of Purchaser Common Stock,
the Purchaser shall notify Deutsche Bank no later than three Business Days
prior to the Closing what portion, if any, of each Local Closing Date Cash
Payment will consist of shares of Purchaser Common Stock.

 



SECTION 2.05. _Closing_. Subject to Section 2.12, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions of this Agreement, the sale and purchase of the Shares and
the Purchased Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities
contemplated by this Agreement shall take place at a closing (the " _Closing_
") to be held at the offices of Shearman and Sterling, 599 Lexington Avenue,
New York, New York at 10:00 a.m. New York City time on the last Business Day
of the month in which all conditions to the obligations of the parties set

to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
those conditions) are satisfied or waived, or at such other place or at such
other time or on such other date as Deutsche Bank and the Purchaser may
mutually agree upon in writing (the day on which the Closing takes place

herein shall be deemed effective as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the
Closing Date).

SECTION 2.08. _Adjustment of Purchase Price_. The Purchase Price and, to
the extent applicable, each Local Purchase Price, shall be subject to
adjustment after the Closing as specified in this Section 2.08:



(a) _Preliminary Closing Statement of Net Assets_. Not less than five (5)
Business Days before the expected Closing Date, Deutsche Bank shall deliver to
the Purchaser a closing statement prepared in accordance with the Valuation
Principles and U.S. GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of
the Assets and Liability Statement, including the exceptions to U.S. GAAP
described in Section 3.07(b), setting forth the expected Operating Balance
Sheet Assets and Operating Balance Sheet Liabilities of the Business as of the
end of the month prior to the month of the expected Closing Date (the "
_Preliminary Closing Statement of Net Assets_ "), which Preliminary Closing
Statement of Net Assets shall be developed in consultation with the Purchaser.

 

30 The statement shall be accompanied by a description of the adjustments
required by the Valuation Principles which were made to arrive at the
Preliminary Statement of Net Assets. For the avoidance of doubt, the Valuation
Principles shall take precedence over U.S. GAAP and consistency with the Asset
and Liability Statement.



(b) _Closing Statement of Net Assets_. As promptly as practicable, but in any
event within 60 days following the Closing Date, Deutsche Bank shall deliver
to the Purchaser a statement prepared in accordance with the Valuation
Principles and U.S. GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of
the Assets and Liability Statement, including the exceptions to U.S. GAAP
described in Section 3.07(b), setting forth the Operating Balance Sheet Assets
and Operating Balance Sheet Liabilities of the Business as of the Closing (the
" _Closing Statement of Net Assets_ "). The Closing Statement of Net Assets
shall be accompanied by a report thereon of the SellerÂ’s Accountants setting
out the results of certain procedures to be reasonably agreed by the Parties
on the balances contained in the Closing Statement of Net Assets. The
Purchaser shall provide Deutsche Bank and its representatives with access to
the books, records and personnel of the DB Entities, the Purchaser and the
Business to the extent necessary to enable Deutsche Bank to prepare the
Closing Statement of Net Assets. The Closing Statement of Net Assets shall be
accompanied by a description of the adjustments required by the Valuation
Principles which were made to arrive at the Closing Statement of Net Assets.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Valuation Principles shall take precedence
over U.S. GAAP and consistency with the Asset and Liability Statement.



(c) _Disputes_. (i) Subject to clause (ii) of this Section 2.08(c), the
Closing Statement of Net Assets delivered by Deutsche Bank to the Purchaser
shall be deemed to be and shall be final, binding and conclusive on the
parties hereto.



(ii) The Purchaser may dispute any item reflected on the Closing Statement of
Net Assets to the extent the net effect of such disputed items in the
aggregate would adjust the Final Book Value by more than the Designated
Amount, but only on the basis that the amounts reflected on the Closing
Statement of Net Assets (A) were not arrived at in accordance with the
Valuation Principles or U.S. GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the
preparation of the Asset and Liability Statement, (B) reflect mathematical or
clerical errors or fraud, or (C) reflect assets or liabilities other than
Operating Balance Sheet Assets or Operating Balance Sheet Liabilities;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser shall have notified Deutsche Bank
in writing of each disputed item, specifying the estimated amount thereof in
dispute and setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis for such dispute,
within 30 days of Deutsche BankÂ’s delivery of the Closing Statement of Net
Assets to the Purchaser. In the event of such a dispute, the Purchaser and
Deutsche Bank shall attempt to reconcile their differences, and any
resolution by them as to any disputed amounts shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the parties hereto. If any such resolution leaves in dispute
amounts the net effect of which in the aggregate would not adjust Final Book
Value by more than the Designated Amount, all such amounts remaining in
dispute shall then be deemed to have been resolved in favor of the Closing
Statement of Net Assets delivered by Deutsche Bank to the Purchaser. If the
Purchaser and Deutsche Bank are unable to reach a resolution as to such
disputed amounts within 20 days after the receipt by Deutsche Bank of the
PurchaserÂ’s written notice of dispute,

 

31 either the Purchaser or Deutsche Bank may submit the items remaining in
dispute (which shall be limited to those items set forth in PurchaserÂ’s
written notice of dispute which have not been resolved by the Parties) for
resolution to Deloitte and Touche (or, if such firm shall decline or is unable
to act or is not, at the time of such submission, independent of both
Deutsche Bank and the Purchaser, to another independent accounting firm of
international reputation mutually acceptable to Deutsche Bank and the
Purchaser or, if they are unable to agree, appointed by Chairman of the
International Accounting Standards Board (or his nominated representative)
(either Deloitte and Touche or such other accounting firm being referred to
herein as the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ ")), which shall, within 30 days
after such submission, determine and report to Deutsche Bank and the
Purchaser upon such remaining disputed items, and such report shall be final,
binding and conclusive on Deutsche Bank and the Purchaser. The fees and
disbursement of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be allocated between
Deutsche Bank and the Purchaser in equal halves.



(d) _Purchase Price Adjustment_. The Closing Statement of Net Assets shall be
deemed final for the purposes of this Section 2.08 upon the earliest of (x)

SECTION 2.11. _Alternative Form of Consideration_. (a) The Purchaser may, at
its option, elect (the " _Stock Election_ ") to pay, and to cause the
Purchasing Subsidiaries to pay, the Premium to Deutsche Bank and the Sellers
at the Closing in the form of a combination of cash and shares of common
stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Purchaser (" _Purchaser Common
Stock_ ") by delivering written notice of such election (the " _Stock Notice_
") to Deutsche Bank no earlier than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the
fifteenth Business Day prior to the expected Closing Date and no later than
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the tenth Business Day prior to the expected
Closing Date. The Purchaser may revoke the Stock Notice by delivering to
Deutsche Bank a written notice of revocation not later than 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the last Business Day preceding the Closing Date. Subject
to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this Section 2.11, if the Purchaser has made the
Stock Election and not validly revoked such election, at the Closing the
Purchaser shall, or shall cause the relevant Purchasing

 

42 Subsidiary to, in lieu of the portion of the Closing Date Cash Payment to be
delivered pursuant to Section 2.07(a) attributable to the Premium, deliver to
Deutsche Bank or the relevant Seller (i) a certificate or certificates for an
aggregate of up to 14.8 million shares, or such lesser number as will result
in the issuance to Deutsche Bank and the Sellers in the aggregate of no more
than 4.9% of the shares of Purchaser Common Stock outstanding after giving
effect to such issuance (the " _Maximum Share Number_ "), of Purchaser Common
Stock (the number of such shares which the Purchaser elects to deliver, which
number shall be set forth in the Stock Notice, is referred to as the " _Share
Number_ "), in definitive form, registered in the name of Deutsche Bank or the
applicable Seller or their designated Affiliate nominee, and bearing a legend
or legends referencing restrictions under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), on transfer of such shares and (ii) cash
in an amount (the " _Cash Amount_ ") equal to the amount by which (A) the
Premium before reduction, exceeds (B) the sum of (1) the product of (x) the
Holdback Amount multiplied by (y) the Fixed Exchange Rate plus (2) the product
of (x) $34.85 (the " _Share Price_ ") multiplied by (y) the Share Number.



(b) The Maximum Share Number and the Share Price shall be appropriately and
equitably adjusted to reflect (i) the payment of any extraordinary
distribution or dividend on shares of Purchaser Common Stock (other than
regular quarterly cash dividends), (ii) any stock split, stock dividend or
combination of such shares or (iii) any consolidation, merger or other event
which results in the conversion or exchange of such shares.



(c) In the event (i) the Purchaser shall have delivered the Stock Notice in
accordance with Section 2.11(a) and not validly revoked such notice, (ii) the
representations and warranties of the Purchaser contained in Sections 5A.01
and 5A.02 that are qualified by "material" or "materiality" shall not have
been true and correct and that are not so qualified shall not have been true
and correct in all material respects, in each case (A) on the date hereof, (B)
at the time of delivery by the Purchaser of the Stock Notice, (C) on the
Closing Date, and (D) each other date between the date hereof and the Closing
Date, and (iii) Deutsche Bank shall have delivered to the Purchaser, no later
than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day following the
date on which the Purchaser delivered the Stock Notice to Deutsche Bank, a
written notice (the " _Alternate Stock Notice_ ") specifying that such notice
is the Alternate Stock Notice, the Purchaser shall, no later than 5:00 p.m.,
New York City time, on the second Business Day following the date on which
Deutsche Bank delivered the Alternate Stock Notice, deliver to Deutsche Bank
either (A) a written notice (the " _Mark-to-Market Notice_ ") specifying that
such notice is the Mark-to-Market Notice or (B) a written notice (the " _All
Cash Notice_ ") specifying that such notice is the All Cash Notice. In the
event the Purchaser shall have delivered the All Cash Notice, the entire
Closing Date Cash Payment shall be payable in cash pursuant to Section 2.04.
In the event the Purchaser shall have delivered the Mark-to-Market Notice, at
the Closing the Purchaser shall, or shall cause the relevant Purchasing
Subsidiaries to, in lieu of the portion of the Closing Date Cash Payment to be
delivered pursuant to Section 2.07(a) attributable to the Premium, deliver to
Deutsche Bank on behalf of itself and the relevant Sellers (x) a certificate
or certificates for an aggregate number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock
equal to the Alternate Share Number, in definitive form, registered in the
name of Deutsche Bank, the relevant Sellers or their designated Affiliate
nominee, and bearing a legend or legends referencing restrictions under the
Securities Act on transfer of such shares and (y) cash in an amount equal to
the Cash Amount. The term " _Alternate Share Number_ " means the quotient,
rounded up to the next whole share, of (i) the product of (A) the Share
Number multiplied by (B) the Share Price, divided by

 

43 (ii) the Market Price; _provided_ that if the Alternate Share Number as so
calculated would result in the issuance to Deutsche Bank and the Sellers, in
the aggregate, of more than 4.9% of the shares of Purchaser Common Stock
outstanding after giving effect to such issuance, (X) the Alternate Share
Number shall equal the number of shares, rounded down to the next whole
number, that would result in the issuance to Deutsche Bank and the Sellers, in
the aggregate, of 4.9% of the shares of Purchaser Common Stock outstanding
after giving effect to such issuance and (Y) the Cash Amount
otherwise payable pursuant to clause (y) of the third sentence of this
Section 2.11(c) shall be increased by an amount equal to the excess of (A) the
product of (w) the Share Number multiplied by (x) the Share Price, over (B)
the product of (y) the Alternate Share Number multiplied by (z) the Market
Price. The term " _Market Price_ " means the average of the daily closing
prices per share of Purchaser Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (as
reported on the consolidated transaction reporting system) for each of the
ten (10) full trading days ending on the second full trading day prior to the
Closing Date.



(d) Under the circumstances described in clauses (i) and (ii) of Section
2.11(c), in the event Deutsche Bank shall not have delivered the Alternate
Stock Notice in accordance with Section 2.11(c) and, in lieu thereof, shall
have delivered to the Purchaser, no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time,
on the third Business Day following the date on which the Purchaser delivered
the Stock Notice to Deutsche Bank, a written notice (the " _Cash Only Notice_
") referencing this Section 2.11(d) and specifying that such notice is the
Cash Only Notice, the Purchaser shall, no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City
time, on the second Business Day following the date on which Deutsche Bank
delivered the Cash Only Notice to the Purchaser, deliver to Deutsche Bank
either (A) a written notice (the " _Cash Payment Notice_ ") specifying that
such notice is the Cash Payment Notice or (B) a written notice (the " _Last
Look Notice_ ") specifying that such notice is the Last Look Notice. In the
event the Purchaser shall have delivered the Cash Payment Notice contemplated
by this Section 2.11(d), the entire Closing Date Cash Payment shall be payable
in cash.

 



(e) In the event the Purchaser shall have delivered the Last Look Notice
contemplated by Section 2.11(d), Deutsche Bank may, at its option, deliver to
the Purchaser no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third
Business Day following the date on which the Purchaser delivered the Last Look
Notice, written notice (the " _Closing Notice_ ") specifying that such notice
is the Closing Notice, in which case at the Closing the Purchaser shall, or
shall cause the relevant Purchasing Subsidiaries to, in lieu of the portion of
the Closing Date Cash Payment to be delivered pursuant to Section
2.07(i) attributable to the Premium, deliver to Deutsche Bank or the relevant
Seller (x) a certificate or certificates for an aggregate number of shares of
Purchaser Common Stock equal to the Alternate Share Number, in definitive
form, registered in the name of Deutsche Bank or the relevant Sellers or
their designated Affiliate nominee, and bearing a legend or legends
referencing restrictions under the Securities Act on transfer of such shares
and (y) cash in an aggregate amount equal to the Cash Amount.



SECTION 2.12. _Deferred Closings_. (a) If as of the Closing (i) there shall
have been issued or entered any Governmental Order that is then in effect and
that has the effect of making the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
illegal or otherwise prohibiting their consummation in any country other than
the United States, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland or the Federal
Republic of Germany (a " _Deferred Closing Jurisdiction_ "), (ii) there shall
be any Law that is then in effect that has the effect of making the
transactions contemplated by

  

44 this Agreement illegal or otherwise prohibiting their consummation in any
Deferred Closing Jurisdiction, or (iii) any Governmental Approvals in respect
of a Deferred Closing Jurisdiction required either (x) to allow the Purchaser
or its Affiliates or Deutsche Bank and its Affiliates to enter into, deliver
or perform their obligations under the Servicing Agreement or the Transition
Support Agreement (including, in respect of Luxembourg, the non-objection by
the applicable regulator in Luxembourg to the transactions contemplated by
such agreements) or (y) for the Purchaser or a Purchasing Subsidiary to
consummate the purchase of the Shares of any DB Entity incorporated or
organized in a Deferred Closing Jurisdiction (the " _Deferred Closing
Governmental Approvals_ ") shall not have been obtained, then the closing of
the transactions contemplated hereby (a " _Deferred Closing_ ") with respect
to the Business in such Deferred Closing Jurisdiction (each a " _Deferred
Business_ ") shall be deferred until the second Business Day following the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 2.12(c) and
Section 2.12(d) (a " _Deferred Closing Date_ ").



(b) The amount of the Closing Date Cash Payment shall be reduced for each
Deferred Business by the product of (i) the Revenue Multiple times the
aggregate annualized revenue of such Deferred Business during the Closing
Measurement Period (the " _Deferred Closing Amount_ ") and (ii) the Fixed
Exchange Rate; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Purchaser makes a Stock
Election and a portion of the Closing Date Cash Payment is paid in Purchaser
Common Stock, Deutsche Bank may elect to reduce the Share Number or the
Alternate Share Number, as the case may be, to reflect the Deferred Closing
Amount rather than reducing the Cash Amount. The Deferred Closing Amount shall
(i) be calculated in a manner consistent with the calculation of all amounts
in Section 2.10, (ii) be jointly determined by Deutsche Bank and the Purchaser
and in a manner consistent with the revenue information by jurisdiction
embodied in Section 3.21(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and (iii) be
consistent with any allocation of the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.04.



(c) The obligation of Deutsche Bank to consummate any Deferred Closing shall

Date, of each of the following conditions:



(i) the covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement to be complied
with by the Purchaser on or before the Deferred Closing solely as they relate
to the Deferred Business shall have been complied with in all material
respects and Deutsche Bank shall have received a certificate from the
Purchaser certifying to such matters and signed by a duly authorized officer
thereof;

Business or Deferred Closing Jurisdiction shall have been obtained and shall
remain in effect; and

contemplated by this Agreement illegal or otherwise prohibiting their
consummation in such Deferred Closing Jurisdiction or (B) be any Law that is
then in effect that has the effect of making the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement illegal or otherwise prohibiting their consummation in such
Deferred Closing Jurisdiction.

 

45 (d) The obligations of the Purchaser to consummate any Deferred Closing shall
be subject to the fulfillment, at or prior to the applicable Deferred Closing
Date, of each of the following conditions:



(i) The covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement to be complied
with by Deutsche Bank on or before the Deferred Closing solely as they relate
to the Deferred Business shall have been complied with in all
material respects and the Purchaser shall have received a certificate from
Deutsche Bank certifying to such matters and signed by two duly authorized
officers thereof;



(ii) All Deferred Closing Governmental Approvals in respect of the Deferred
Business or Deferred Closing Jurisdiction shall have been obtained and
shall remain in effect;



(iii) There shall not (A) have been issued or entered any Governmental
Order that is then in effect and that has the effect of making the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal or otherwise prohibiting
their consummation in such Deferred Closing Jurisdiction or (B) be any Law
that is then in effect that has the effect of making the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement illegal or otherwise prohibiting their
consummation in such Deferred Closing Jurisdiction; and



(iv) Solely with respect to Italy, if Italy is a Deferred Closing
Jurisdiction, (x) neither Deutsche Bank nor any of its Affiliates shall be
subject to any Regulatory Action in Italy that would reasonably be expected
to materially adversely affect the conduct of the Deferred Business after the
Deferred Closing Date in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements (including Deutsche BankÂ’s and the SellersÂ’ provision of
services to the Purchaser and its Affiliates under the Transition Support
Agreement) or that would cause any material adverse financial or operating
consequences to the Purchaser or its Affiliates, and (y) no provision of any
Regulatory Action in Italy shall be, or would be reasonably expected to be,
binding on or become applicable to the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates on
or after the Deferred Closing Date or otherwise have any continuing material
adverse impact on the Business after the Deferred Closing.



(e) At each Deferred Closing, if any, (i) the Purchaser shall pay, or shall
cause the Purchasing Subsidiaries to pay, to Deutsche Bank or, at the election
of Deutsche Bank, the relevant Seller by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the Purchase Price Bank Account an amount in Euros equal
to the Deferred Closing Amount with respect to the applicable Deferred
Business and deliver, or cause the Purchasing Subsidiaries to deliver, to
Deutsche Bank or the relevant Seller any of the documents or other
deliverables required to be delivered pursuant to Section 2.07 to the extent
related to the Deferred Business and not previously delivered to Deutsche Bank
or the relevant Seller at the Closing and (ii) Deutsche Bank shall deliver, or
cause to be delivered, to the Purchaser or the relevant Purchasing Subsidiary
any of the documents or other deliverables required to be delivered pursuant
to Section 2.06 to the extent related to the Deferred Business and not
previously delivered to the Purchaser or the relevant Purchasing Subsidiary
at the Closing.

 

46 (f) In the event of any Deferred Closing, no adjustment shall be made in
respect of any amounts paid pursuant to Section 2.08.



(g) In respect of each Deferred Business, Deutsche Bank and the Purchaser
shall continue to comply, through the applicable Deferred Closing Date, with
all covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement that are required by
their terms to be performed prior to the Closing (including, without
limitation, the covenants of Deutsche Bank contained in Section 5.01 and the
covenants of Purchaser contained in Section 5.04).



(h) Unless the context otherwise clearly requires, references in this
Agreement (excluding references in Section 2.10) to "Closing" or "Closing
Date" shall, with respect to any Deferred Business, be deemed to refer to the
applicable Deferred Closing or Deferred Closing Date, respectively. For the
avoidance of doubt, (i) the Purchaser and the Purchasing Subsidiaries shall
not purchase any Purchased Assets or assume any Liabilities, and shall have
no obligations of indemnity, in respect of any Deferred Business unless and
until such time as a Deferred Closing in respect of such Deferred Business
shall have occurred, and then only to the extent contemplated hereby, and (ii)
Deutsche Bank and the Sellers shall be entitled to all of the economic
benefits, and shall bear all of the economic burdens, in respect of such
Deferred Business prior to the applicable Deferred Closing Date.



SECTION 2.13. _Fixed Assets_. From time to time after the date hereof and
prior to the Closing, Deutsche Bank shall make, with the consent of the
Purchaser (not to be unreasonably withheld), such amendments and
modifications to Section 2.02(a)(iii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule as are
necessary to reflect fixed assets of the Business that have been acquired or
disposed of by Deutsche Bank and the Sellers in accordance with the
provisions of Section 5.01 between the date hereof and the Closing Date. At

ARTICLE III



REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF DEUTSCHE BANK



As an inducement to the Purchaser to enter into this Agreement, except as set
forth on the corresponding Section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (it being
agreed that disclosure under any particular Section of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed adequate for each Section of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule where such disclosure would be applicable to the extent the
applicability of such disclosure to such other Section of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule is readily apparent), Deutsche Bank on its own behalf and
on behalf of each Seller in relation to the Shares and/or Purchased Assets
which the relevant Seller is selling hereby represents and warrants to the
Purchaser, on its own behalf and on behalf of each Purchasing Subsidiary in
relation to the Shares and/or Purchased Assets which the relevant Purchasing
Subsidiary is acquiring, as follows:



SECTION 3.01. _Organization, Authority and Qualification of Deutsche Bank and
Certain Affiliates_. Each of Deutsche Bank, each Seller and each other
Affiliate of Deutsche Bank party to an Ancillary Agreement (a " _DB Affiliate
Party_ ") is a corporation (or similar

 

47 entity) duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing, (if, in each
case, such concept is applicable to such entity) under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation and has all necessary power and authority to
own the Shares and the portion of the Purchased Assets owned by it, to carry
on the Business as currently conducted by it, to enter into this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements to which it is, or will on the Closing Date be,
party, to carry out its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery
by Deutsche Bank of this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to which it
is, or will be on the Closing Date, a party, and by each Seller and DB
Affiliate Party of each Ancillary Agreement to which it is, or will on the
Closing Date be, party, the performance by Deutsche Bank of its obligations
hereunder and thereunder and by each such Seller and DB Affiliate Party of its
obligations thereunder and the consummation by Deutsche Bank, each Seller and
each DB Affiliate Party of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
have been, or in the case of the Sellers and the DB Affiliate Parties will on
the Closing Date be, duly authorized by all requisite action on the part of
Deutsche Bank, each Seller and each Affiliate of Deutsche Bank. This Agreement
and the DeAM Agreement have been, and the other Ancillary Agreements to which
it will on the Closing Date be party will on the Closing Date be, duly
executed and delivered by Deutsche Bank, and each Ancillary Agreement to which
a Seller or a DB Affiliate Party is, or on the Closing Date will be, a party
has been or will on the Closing Date be, duly executed and delivered by each
such Seller and DB Affiliate Party and (assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery by the Purchaser) this Agreement and the DeAM Agreement
constitute, and the other Ancillary Agreements to which it will on the Closing
Date be party will on the Closing Date constitute, the legal, valid and
binding obligations of Deutsche Bank, the Sellers and the DB Affiliate
Parties, as applicable, enforceable against each such Person in accordance
with their terms. No Affiliate of Deutsche Bank other than the Sellers and the
DB Entities engages in any Restricted Business other than the Permitted
Business. 



SECTION 3.02. _Organization, Authority and Qualification of the DB Entities_.
Each DB Entity is a corporation (or similar entity) duly incorporated,
validly existing and (if, in each case, such concept is applicable to such
entity) in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or formation, as the case may be, and has all necessary power
and authority to own, operate or lease the properties and assets now owned,
operated or leased by it and to carry on its business as it has been and is
currently conducted. Each DB Entity is duly licensed or qualified to
do business and (if such concept is applicable) is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the properties owned or leased by it or the operation of
its business makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed would not, in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect. Each of the jurisdictions in which a DB Entity is
qualified to do business is set forth on Section 3.02 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule. Since January 1, 2000, all corporate actions taken by the DB
Entities have been duly authorized, and none of the DB Entities have taken any
action that in any material respect conflicts with, constitutes a material
default under or results in a material violation of the organizational
documents of such DB Entity. True and correct copies of the organizational or
equivalent documents of each DB Entity, each as in effect on the date hereof,
have been delivered by Deutsche Bank to the Purchaser and true and
correct copies of all shareholder, director and committee meeting resolutions
of each DB Entity adopted or taken since January 1, 2000 have previously been
made available to the Purchaser.

 

48 SECTION 3.03. _Capital Stock of the DB Companies; Ownership of the
Shares_. Section 3.03 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth the
authorized capital stock and the number of outstanding shares of each class of
capital stock for each DB Company and the Seller owning such shares of capital
stock (or equivalent). All of the Shares are validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. There are no options, warrants,
convertible securities or other rights, agreements, arrangements or
commitments of any character relating to the capital stock of any DB Company
or obligating any Seller or DB Company to issue or sell any shares of capital
stock (or equivalent) of, or any other interest in, any DB Company. There are
no outstanding contractual obligations of any DB Company to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Shares or to provide funds to, or
make any equity investment in any other Person. The Shares held by Deutsche
Bank and the Sellers constitute all the issued and outstanding capital stock
(or equivalent) of each DB Company and are owned of record and beneficially
solely by Deutsche Bank and the Sellers free and clear of all Encumbrances in
the respective amounts set forth on Section 3.03 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule. Upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and registration (subject to stamping of any relevant conveyance
instrument in appropriate cases) of the Shares in the name of the Purchaser or
the relevant Purchasing Subsidiary in the stock records of the relevant
DB Entity, the Purchaser or the relevant Purchasing Subsidiary, assuming it
shall have purchased the Shares of InterSec Research Corp. for value in good
faith, will own all the issued and outstanding capital stock (or equivalent)
of each DB Company and each of the other Shares free and clear of all
Encumbrances other than those imposed by the applicable securities laws or any
action taken or arrangement made by the Purchaser or its Affiliates
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the DB Entities) and other than those
arising under this Agreement. There are no voting trusts, stockholder
agreements, proxies or other agreements or understandings in effect with
respect to the voting or transfer of any of the Shares.

 



SECTION 3.04. _DB Subsidiaries_. (a) Section 3.04(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule lists, for each Subsidiary of a DB Company (each, a " _DB
Subsidiary_ "), its name, type of entity, jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization, jurisdiction of its residence, its authorized capital stock (or
equivalent), partnership capital or equivalent, the number and type of its
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock, partnership interests or
similar ownership interests and the ownership of such shares, partnership
interests or similar ownership interests. The DB Companies own, directly
or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock (or
equivalent) of each DB Subsidiary, free and clear of all Encumbrances, and all
such shares (or equivalent) are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and free of preemptive rights. There are no options, warrants, convertible
securities or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any
character relating to the capital stock (or equivalent) of the DB Subsidiaries
or obliging the DB Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital stock
(or equivalent) of, or other interest in, a DB Subsidiary.



(b) Other than the DB Subsidiaries, there are no Subsidiaries of the DB
Companies. None of the DB Entities is a member of (nor is any part of its
business conducted through) any partnership nor do any of them directly or
indirectly own any capital stock or other equity interests in any Person
other than (i) the DB Subsidiaries, and (ii) record ownership of the Custodial
Assets.

 

49 SECTION 3.05. _No Conflict_. Assuming that all consents,
approvals, authorizations and other actions described in Section 3.06 have
been obtained and all filings and notifications listed in Section 3.06 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule have been made, the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is
party by Deutsche Bank, each Seller and each DB Affiliate Party do not and
will not (a) violate, conflict with or result in the breach of any provision
of the charter or by-laws (or similar organizational documents) of Deutsche
Bank, any Seller, any DB Entity or any DB Affiliate Party, (b) conflict with
or violate or result in the creation of any Encumbrance upon any of the Shares
or Assets pursuant to any Law or Governmental Order applicable to
(i) Deutsche Bank, the Sellers, the DB Entities or any DB Affiliate Party or
any of their respective assets, properties or businesses, or (ii) the
Purchased Assets, or (c) conflict with, result in any breach of, constitute a
default or violation (or event which with the giving of notice or lapse of
time, or both, would become a default or violation) under, require any consent
or create a penalty or increase Deutsche BankÂ’s, any SellersÂ’, any DB EntityÂ’s
or any DB Affiliate PartyÂ’s payment or performance obligations under, or give
to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration, suspension,
revocation or cancellation of, or result in the creation of any Encumbrance on
any of the Shares or Assets pursuant to any note, bond, mortgage or
indenture, contract, agreement, lease, sublease, license, permit, franchise or
other instrument or arrangement to which Deutsche Bank, any Seller, any DB
Entity or any DB Affiliate Party is a party or by which any of the Assets or
Shares or businesses of the DB Entities is bound or affected, except, in the
case of clauses (b) and (c), as would not in the aggregate have a Material
Adverse Effect.



SECTION 3.06. _Consents and Approvals_. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is
party by Deutsche Bank, each Seller and each DB Affiliate Party do not and
will not require any consent, approval, authorization or other order of,
action by, filing with or notification to any Governmental Authority, except
(a) the Required Regulatory Approvals, (b) where failure to obtain such
consent, approval, authorization or action, or to make such filing or
notification, would not in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect, or
(c) as may be necessary as a result of any facts or circumstances
relating solely to the Purchaser. To Deutsche BankÂ’s knowledge, as of the
date of this Agreement, there are no facts, events, circumstances or
conditions now in existence relating to Deutsche Bank or its Affiliates which
would prevent (i) the licenses referred to in Section 4.03(b) being obtained
in a timely manner, except where the failure to obtain such licenses would not
have an adverse effect on the ability of the Purchaser to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) the Required Regulatory
Approvals being obtained in a timely manner.

the unaudited statements of income for each of the DB Companies for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2001 (the " _DB Companies Income Statements_ "), (ii)

month period ended June 30, 2002 (the " _DB Companies Interim Income

transactions contemplated under this Agreement will not provide
an entitlement to any German Employee for premature termination and/or claims
for severance payment or any other termination pay or benefits under a

3.15(c)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, Deutsche Bank, the DB Entities

Closing Date. Each German Benefit Plan complies with, and has been managed in
accordance with, all applicable Laws, regulations and requirements and has

provide an entitlement to premature retirement, accelerated vesting, or any
other additional benefit that would not have been provided except for the
consummation of such transactions under any German Pension Arrangement,
material retirement arrangement, employment contract or any other German
Benefit Plan. The consummation of the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement will not cause a partial or complete termination of any retirement
arrangement or any other German Benefit Plan or otherwise result in
PurchaserÂ’s, Deutsche BankÂ’s, the DB EntitiesÂ’ or the SellersÂ’ obligations to
fund any benefit obligation sooner than would have been required had the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement not been consummated.

SECTION 3.17. _Regulatory Compliance; Compliance with Laws_. (a) Except for
normal examinations conducted by Governmental Authorities in the ordinary
course of business, there has been no proceeding or, to the knowledge
of Deutsche Bank, investigation or threatened investigation by any
Governmental Authority into the business or operations of Deutsche Bank, the
Sellers, the DB Entities or any Affiliate thereof (including their respective
officers, directors, shareholders, members, partners or employees) since
December 31, 1997 relating to or affecting the Business that materially
adversely affects the conduct of the Business or that would reasonably be
expected to materially adversely affect the conduct of the Business after the
Closing Date. There is no unresolved violation, criticism or exception by any
Governmental Authority with respect to any written report or statement
relating to any examinations of Deutsche Bank, the Sellers, the DB Entities
or any Affiliate thereof that materially adversely affects the conduct of the
Business or that would reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect
the conduct of the Business after the Closing Date. Deutsche Bank has
previously made available to the Purchaser true and complete copies of each
correspondence to or from any Governmental Authority since January 1, 1997 in
connection with or relating to any of the foregoing to the extent disclosure
of such is not prohibited by Law. With respect to any

 

79 examination of all or a portion of the Business by any Governmental Authority
since January 1, 2000 which examination has not resulted in any written
report being issued to Deutsche Bank or any of its Affiliates, there is no
unresolved violation, criticism or exception by any such Governmental
Authority contained in any oral report to a senior officer of Deutsche Bank or
any of its Affiliates that materially adversely affects the conduct of the
Business or that would reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect
the conduct of the Business after the Closing Date.



 

(b) None of Deutsche Bank, the Sellers, the DB Entities or any Affiliate
thereof is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order issued by, or is a

understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or similar
undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or has been since
December 31, 1997, a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or since
December 31, 1997, has adopted any board resolutions at the request of any
Governmental Authority that, in the case of Deutsche Bank, the Sellers or any
Affiliate (other than the DB Entities), would reasonably be expected to
affect in any material respect the conduct of the Business after the Closing
Date or, in the case of the DB Entities, is, or at any time since December 31,
1997 was, effective (each, a " _Deutsche Bank Regulatory Agreement_ "). To
the knowledge of Deutsche Bank, no Governmental Authority has threatened to
subject the Business or any DB Entity to a Deutsche Bank Regulatory Agreement.



SECTION 3.18. _Insurance_. Section 3.18 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
lists the material insurance policies maintained (a) by the DB Entities, or
(b) by Deutsche Bank or its Affiliates specifically for the benefit of the
Business or in respect of the Purchased Assets. Except as would not in the
aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect, all premiums required to be paid
with respect thereto covering all periods up to and including the Closing
Date have been, or shall in the ordinary course be, paid. No notice of
cancellation or termination has been received with respect to any such policy
as of the date hereof, and all such insurance policies are in full force and
effect and will remain in full force and effect up to and including the time
of the Closing (other than those that have been retired or expired in the
ordinary course).



SECTION 3.19. _Intellectual Property_. Section 2.02(a)(v) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule contains (a) a true and correct list of each item of
Transferred Intellectual Property that is registered with any Governmental
Authority by Deutsche Bank, a Seller or a DB Entity or subject to an
application for registration with any Governmental Authority submitted by or
on behalf of any of them (the " _Registered Transferred IP_ ") and for each
item of Registered Transferred IP, sets forth each country in which such
Registered Transferred IP is registered or registrations have been applied for
and (b) the Transferred IP Licenses. Section 3.19 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule contains (i) a true and correct list of each item of Intellectual
Property owned by the DB Entities that is registered with any Governmental
Authority by a DB Entity and (ii) the material Deutsche Bank IP Licenses to
which a DB Entity is a party. To the knowledge of Deutsche Bank, neither
Deutsche Bank nor any Seller has, in the conduct of the Business, nor has any
DB Entity, infringed or misappropriated or violated the Intellectual Property
of any third party, and no unresolved claim has been asserted in writing to
Deutsche Bank, the Sellers or the DB Entities that the DB Entities have
infringed or misappropriated or that the current conduct of the Business
infringes or misappropriates the Intellectual Property of any third party.
With respect to each item of Transferred Intellectual Property or Intellectual
Property owned by any

 

80 DB Entity, Deutsche Bank, a DB Entity or a Seller is the owner of the entire
right, title and interest in and to such Intellectual Property and to the
knowledge of Deutsche Bank, such Person is entitled to use such Intellectual
Property in the continued operation of the Business. With respect to each item
of material Licensed Intellectual Property, Deutsche Bank, a DB Entity or a
Seller has the right to use such Intellectual Property in the continued
operation of the Business in accordance with the terms of the Deutsche Bank IP
License governing such Intellectual Property. With respect to each item of
Transferred Intellectual Property, Deutsche Bank or the applicable Seller has
all necessary power, authority and right to transfer ownership of such
Intellectual Property in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. With
respect to each item of Licensed Retained Intellectual Property, Deutsche
Bank or a Seller has all necessary power, authority and right to license such
Licensed Retained Intellectual Property to the Purchaser in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and the License Agreement. With respect to
each item of Ancillary Intellectual Property, Deutsche Bank or an Affiliate
has the right to use such Ancillary Intellectual Property to provide services
to the Purchaser under the terms of the Transition Support Agreement. The
Transferred Intellectual Property and the Intellectual Property owned by the
DB Entities have not been adjudged invalid or unenforceable in whole or part.
To the knowledge of Deutsche Bank, no Person is engaging in any activity that
infringes the Transferred Intellectual Property or the Intellectual Property
owned by the DB Entities. Each material Transferred IP License and each
material Deutsche Bank IP License to which any DB Entity is a party is valid
and enforceable, is binding on all parties to such license, and is in full
force and effect. None of Deutsche Bank, the Sellers or a DB Entity and to
Deutsche BankÂ’s knowledge, no other party to any material Transferred IP
License or material Deutsche Bank IP License to which any DB Entity is a party
is in material breach thereof or default thereunder. No Transferred
Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property owned by any DB Entity is owned
jointly by more than one Person. The Transferred Intellectual Property, the
Transferred IP Licenses and the Intellectual Property owned by the DB
Entities constitute all of the Deutsche Bank Intellectual Property exclusively
used or held exclusively for use in the Business. All of the Intellectual
Property rights licensed by Deutsche Bank or any Seller to a third party
under the Transferred IP Licenses are included in the Transferred Intellectual
Property or will be provided to the Purchaser on a service bureau basis under
the Transition Support Agreement. Deutsche Bank has made available to the
Purchaser true and correct copies of each Transferred IP License and each
material Deutsche Bank IP License to which any DB Entity is a party.



SECTION 3.20. _Environmental Matters_. Except as would not in the aggregate
have a Material Adverse Effect, none of the DB Entities is in violation of any
Environmental Laws, and no condition exists with respect to the DB Entities
or any Purchased Asset that, with notice or the passage of time, or both, has
resulted or is reasonably likely to result in any Liability under any
Environmental Laws. None of Deutsche Bank, the Sellers or the DB Entities has
received any notice from any Person that the DB Entities or the operation of
any property operated or leased by the DB Entities, or by any of Deutsche Bank
and the Sellers with respect to any Leased Real Property, included in

prompt notice of such request or requirement in order to enable the Purchaser
to seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy (and if the

 

91 Purchaser seeks such order, Deutsche Bank will provide such cooperation as the
Purchaser shall reasonably request) to consult with Deutsche Bank with
respect to the Purchaser taking steps to resist or narrow the scope of such
request or legal process, or waive compliance, in whole or in part, with the
terms of this Section 5.03(b). In the event that such protective order or
other remedy is not obtained or the Purchaser waives such compliance, only
that portion of such non-public information may be disclosed as Deutsche Bank
is advised by counsel is legally required to be disclosed and Deutsche Bank
will use its best efforts to ensure that all such non-public information so
disclosed will be accorded confidential treatment. Deutsche Bank shall request
the return or destruction of any information or documents regarding the
Business that was furnished to third parties in connection with the possible
sale of the Business and, at the PurchaserÂ’s request, shall enforce any
confidentiality or similar agreements that may have been executed by bidders
other than the Purchaser in connection with Deutsche BankÂ’s proposed sale of
the Business.



SECTION 5.04. _Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and Consents_. (a)
Each of the Purchaser and Deutsche Bank shall, and Deutsche Bank shall cause
each of the Sellers to (i) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain promptly
the Required Regulatory Approvals and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain promptly all other authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of
all federal, state and local Governmental Authorities (including by making, or
causing to be made, all appropriate filings of notifications or reports)
necessary for its execution and delivery of, and the performance of its
obligations pursuant to, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by, this Agreement (such authorizations, consents, orders and approvals, "
_Governmental Approvals_ "). Deutsche Bank shall, and shall cause the Sellers
and the DB Entities to, and the Purchaser shall, cooperate in promptly seeking
to obtain the Required Regulatory Approvals and the Governmental Approvals. __



(b) Neither Deutsche Bank nor the Purchaser shall take any action that would
have the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any Required
Regulatory Approvals or Governmental Approvals. Deutsche Bank and the
Purchaser agree to make, or to cause to be made, all appropriate filings of
notifications and reports required to obtain the Required Regulatory Approvals
and the Governmental Approvals promptly after the date of this Agreement and
to supply promptly any additional information and documentary material that
may be requested by Governmental Authorities responsible therefor. As defined
further below, the parties shall cooperate in making any such filings. Except
as would reasonably be expected to have (i) a Material Adverse Effect or (ii)
a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial
condition of the Purchaser (which for this purpose the Parties agree would
include, without limitation, any requirement (A) that the Purchaser or its
Affiliates commit to provide an excessive amount of capital or (B) that would
require the Purchaser, its Affiliates, Deutsche Bank, the Sellers and the
DB Entities to make or commit to make divestitures or take or commit to take
such other actions the combined effect of which on the Purchaser and its
Affiliates and the Business would have or would reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse effect when measured against the business, results of
operations or financial condition of the Business) (any such effect, a "
_Materially Burdensome Effect_ "), the Purchaser agrees to take all steps
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Law that
may be asserted by any Governmental Authority in connection with the Required
Regulatory Approvals and to use its reasonable best efforts to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Governmental

 

92 Approvals, in each case so as to enable the parties to expeditiously close the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including committing to or
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, the sale or
disposition of such of the assets, categories of assets or businesses of the
Purchaser, or of the assets, properties or businesses to be acquired by the
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, or making such other commitments, as
are required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of,
any decree, order, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or other
order in any suit or proceeding, that would otherwise have the effect of
delaying or preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (it being understood and agreed by the Purchaser that no such
action taken by the Purchaser shall entitle the Purchaser to any adjustment
or reduction in the Purchase Price or shall otherwise affect any other
obligation of the Purchaser hereunder); _provided_ , _however_ that the
foregoing shall not limit or restrict the PurchaserÂ’s ability to pursue good
faith efforts to mitigate the effect of any commitment or action requested or
required by any Governmental Authority in connection with the Required
Regulatory Approvals or the Governmental Approvals. In addition, except
as would reasonably be expected to have (i) a Material Adverse Effect or (ii)
a Materially Burdensome Effect, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Purchaser agrees to take all steps necessary to vacate or lift
any order relating to the Required Regulatory Approvals or to use its
reasonable best efforts to vacate or lift any order relating to the
Governmental Approvals that would have the effect of making any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal or otherwise prohibiting
their consummation (it being understood and agreed by the Purchaser that no
such action taken by the Purchaser shall entitle the Purchaser to any
adjustment or reduction in the Purchase Price or shall otherwise affect any
other obligation of the Purchaser hereunder); _provided_ , _however_ that the
foregoing shall not limit or restrict the PurchaserÂ’s ability to pursue good
faith efforts to mitigate the effect of any commitment or action requested or
required by any Governmental Authority in connection with the Required
Regulatory Approvals or the Governmental Approvals.



(c) Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.04, each party to this Agreement
shall promptly notify the other party of any communication it or any of its
Affiliates receives from any Governmental Authority relating to the
matters that are the subject of this Agreement, including any filing,
investigation or inquiry, and, subject to applicable Law, permit the other
party to review in advance any proposed communication by such party to, or
filing by such party with, any Governmental Authority. No party to this
Agreement shall agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it
consults with the other parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Authority, the reasonable opportunity to attend and
participate. Each party to this Agreement will coordinate and cooperate fully
with the other parties in exchanging such information and providing
such assistance as such other party may reasonably request in connection with
the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting
periods under the BHC Act, the HSR Act, the EC Merger Regulation or in
connection with any other regulatory approvals. Each party to this Agreement
will provide the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings or
communications between it or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and
any Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand, with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including with respect to the party hereto making a filing, providing copies
of all such documents to the non-filing party and its advisors prior to
filing (except that neither party hereto shall be under an obligation of any
kind to provide the other party with documents, material or other

 

93 information relating to such partyÂ’s valuation of the Business). The covenants
of the Parties in this Section 5.04 shall survive the Closing until the
fourth anniversary thereof or until such earlier time as all Required
Regulatory Approvals and Governmental Approvals have been obtained or the
PartiesÂ’ obligations with respect thereto have been terminated pursuant to
Section 10.04; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the second anniversary of
the Closing Date, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 5.04, the Purchaser shall not be required to take any action to obtain
any remaining Governmental Approvals other than such actions as are
commercially reasonable.



(d) Each party hereto agrees to cooperate in obtaining any other consents and
approvals that may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including, without limitation, the consents of
landlords to the Sub-Lease Agreements).

 



SECTION 5.05. _Investigation_. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it
has made its own inquiry and investigation into, and, based thereon, has
formed an independent judgment concerning, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities, the Business and the DB Entities. In connection with the
PurchaserÂ’s investigation of the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities,
the Business and the DB Entities, the Purchaser has received from Deutsche
Bank certain projections and other forecasts for the DB Entities, and certain
plan and budget information. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that,
except for representations expressly made or information provided with
respect thereto in this Agreement, Deutsche Bank makes no representation or
warranty with respect to any such projections, forecasts, plans or budgets.



SECTION 5.06. _Use of Names_. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no
interest in or right to use the names "Deutsche Bank", "DB", "db", "Bankers
Trust", "BT", or "Morgan Grenfell", or any confusingly similar derivation or
modification thereof or any trademark, servicemark, trade dress, designs,
slogans, logo (including, without limitation, the blue and white color scheme,
the square box logo, the look and feel prescribed by DBÂ’s style guide and
other logos presently associated with Deutsche Bank or Bankers Trust or any
of their Affiliates), domain name or URL (universal resource locator),
associated therewith (collectively, the " _Retained Names and Marks_ ") is
being transferred to the Purchaser pursuant to the transactions contemplated
hereby. Promptly, and in any event no later than ten Business Days after the
Closing Date, or such longer period of time as may be reasonably required
under the laws and practices in the relevant jurisdiction, the Purchaser
shall, and shall cause each DB Entity to, cease the use of any Retained Names
or Marks in the corporate or legal names of such DB Entities. Subject to the
Transition Support Agreement and the Servicing Agreement, promptly, and in
any event no later than 60 days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall,
and shall cause each DB Entity to, cease any and all other use of any Retained
Names and Marks in connection with the Business and the DB
Entities (including, without limitation, in connection with signage, purchase
orders, promotional material, sales orders, invoices, labels and letterheads).



SECTION 5.07. _Non-Solicitation_. (a) The Purchaser agrees with Deutsche Bank
that, for the period between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of (i)
the Closing Date and (ii) the one year anniversary of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article X hereof, the Purchaser, without, in each case,
the direct participation of Deutsche Bank, will not, directly

 

94 or indirectly, solicit the business with respect to the provision of products
or services provided by the Business to such Person, of any Person known by
the Purchaser to be a Client of the Business, except for (i) Persons who were
clients of the Purchaser or its Affiliates on the date of the Confidentiality
Agreement, (ii) Persons who became clients of the Purchaser or its Affiliates
since the date of the Confidentiality Agreement and prior to the date of this
Agreement the solicitation of whom did not violate the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, or (iii) in response to a bona fide request for
proposal (" _RFP_ ") received from such Client of the Business; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (A) the foregoing will not prohibit a general solicitation to
the industry or public of general advertising, (B) no actions taken in
accordance with Section 5.14 prior to the termination of this Agreement shall
constitute a breach of this Section 5.07(a), and (C) this Section 5.07(a)
shall cease to be of any further force and effect upon the termination of this
Agreement by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 10.01(d) if Deutsche Bank is
in material breach of any of its covenants and agreements under this Agreement
at the time of such termination.



(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article X other than
by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 10.01(d), the Purchaser shall pay to
Deutsche Bank (i) for each Client who became or becomes a client of the
Purchaser or its Affiliates as a result of a breach by the Purchaser of
Section 5.07(a) or as a result of a breach of the Confidentiality Agreement by
the Purchaser prior to the date of this Agreement, an amount in cash equal to
the Affected Revenue in respect of such Client multiplied by two and (ii) for
each other Client who becomes a client of the Purchaser or its Affiliates
after the date hereof, an amount in cash equal to the Affected Revenue in
respect of such Client multiplied by 15%. For the purposes of the foregoing,
" _Affected Revenue_ " in respect of any Client shall mean the Fee Revenue
received by the Purchaser or its Affiliates for the period from the date of
termination of this Agreement through the first anniversary of such
termination date in respect of any new business obtained by the Purchaser or
its Affiliates from such Client from the date of the Confidentiality Agreement
through the first anniversary of the termination of this Agreement, but only
in respect of services within the scope of the Business that were being
provided by Deutsche Bank, a Seller or a DB Entity pursuant to a Client
Contract on the date the Purchaser or its Affiliates obtained such new
business; _provided_ , _however_ , that Affected Revenue shall not include any
amounts received by the Purchaser or its Affiliates for which the Purchaser or
such Affiliates had received an RFP as of the date of this Agreement. 



(c) The Purchaser acknowledges that the covenants of the Purchaser set forth
in this Section 5.07 are an essential element of this Agreement and that, but
for the agreement of the Purchaser to comply with these covenants, Deutsche
Bank would not have entered into this Agreement. The Purchaser acknowledges
that this Section 5.07 constitutes an independent covenant and shall not be
affected by performance or nonperformance of any other provision of this
Agreement by Deutsche Bank. The Purchaser has independently consulted with its
counsel and after such consultation agrees that the covenants set forth in
this Section 5.07 are reasonable and proper.



SECTION 5.08. _Further Action; Assignment in General_. (a) Each of the
parties hereto shall, from time to time, whether before or after the Closing,
take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, do or cause to be done all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law, and execute and
deliver such documents and other papers, as may be required to carry out the
provisions of this Agreement, to satisfy the conditions to the Closing and

 

95 consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as reasonably practicable.



(b) Subject to, and in accordance with, the provisions of any applicable
Ancillary Agreements and the other provisions herein, Deutsche Bank will use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain, and the Purchaser will cooperate in
obtaining, the consent of any party whose consent is required in order to
permit the assignment or novation to the Purchaser or the relevant
Purchasing Subsidiary of the Assigned Contracts, the Transferred IP Licenses
and the Client Contracts pursuant to this Agreement or the consent of any
party to any contract or agreement to which any DB Entity is a party whose
consent to any transaction contemplated by this Agreement is required under
such contract (the " _DB Entity Affected Contracts_ "). Deutsche Bank shall be
responsible for costs and expenses of obtaining any consent (including any
increased payments under the relevant agreement or contract) required to be
obtained in order to assign, novate or enter into any Assigned Contract,
Transferred IP License or Sub-Lease Agreement or in respect of any DB Entity
Affected Contract, provided that (i) Deutsche Bank shall have the right to
control all negotiations with respect thereto, (ii) Deutsche Bank shall only
be responsible for any increased contract costs during the original term of
such contract without regard to any extensions thereof and (iii) any costs or
expenses (including any increased payments under the relevant agreement or
contract during the original term) in connection with renewing, extending or
modifying, in each case at the PurchaserÂ’s request, any such contract or
agreement shall be for the account of the Purchaser.



(c) Subject to and in accordance with the terms of any applicable Ancillary
Agreements, if a consent or approval is required by any third party to any of
the Purchased Assets and is not obtained at or before the Closing or if an
attempted transfer, conveyance or assignment is ineffective or with respect to
any DB Entity Affected Contract or other contract to which a DB Entity is a
party that automatically terminates upon a change in control of the applicable
DB Entity or its parent DB Entity or that by its terms permits the
counterparty to terminate such DB Entity Affected Contract upon such a change
in control and that is so terminated, Deutsche Bank shall, and shall cause
each Seller to, cooperate with the Purchaser in establishing commercially
reasonable alternative arrangements requested by the Purchaser that provide
to the Purchaser and its Affiliates the benefits of such Purchased Assets and
the burden of the related Assumed Liabilities or the benefits and burdens of
the DB Entity Affected Contract, as the case may be; _provided_ , that (i)
any additional costs or expenses incurred in connection with the
implementation of such alternative arrangements shall be borne by Deutsche
Bank, (ii) the Purchaser shall not communicate with any party to such
arrangement (other than Deutsche Bank) with respect to such arrangement prior
to its being put in place, and (C) any costs or expenses (including any
increased payment under the relevant agreement or contract during the original
term) incurred in connection with renewing, extending or modifying, in each
case at the PurchaserÂ’s request, such arrangement shall be for the account of
the Purchaser.



(d) In the event that any time hereafter there shall be identified any item of
Intellectual Property used or held for use exclusively in the Business prior
to the Closing that shall not have been included in the
Transferred Intellectual Property or the Transferred IP Licenses or is not
otherwise owned by a DB Entity or licensed to the Purchaser pursuant to the
License Agreement, in the event such Intellectual Property (i) is Deutsche
Bank Intellectual Property, Deutsche Bank shall, or shall cause its
appropriate Affiliate to, forthwith take such

 

96 action as is necessary transfer such Intellectual Property to the Purchaser or
the applicable Purchasing Subsidiary at the Closing (or, if later identified,
promptly thereafter) or (ii) is a Deutsche Bank IP License, Deutsche Bank
shall cooperate with the Purchaser in establishing commercially reasonable
alternative arrangements requested by the Purchaser that provide to the
Purchaser the right to use such Intellectual Property in its operation of the
Business and its corresponding businesses following the Closing; _provided_ ,
that (A) any additional costs or expenses incurred in connection with the
implementation of such alternative arrangements shall be borne by Deutsche
Bank, (B) the Purchaser shall not communicate with any party to such
arrangement (other than Deutsche Bank) with respect to such arrangement prior
to its being put in place, and (C) any costs or expenses incurred in
connection with renewing, extending or modifying, in each case at the
PurchaserÂ’s request, such arrangement shall be for the account of the
Purchaser. Prior to the Closing, Deutsche Bank shall deliver to the Purchaser
a true and correct copy of each Sub-Agency Contract not included in the
Assigned Contracts.



(e) If, in order to effectively transfer any of the Client Contracts to the
Purchaser hereunder, the Purchaser determines it to be necessary or convenient
for Deutsche Bank or any Affiliate to transfer to the Purchaser or a
Purchasing Subsidiary the rights to a nominee name or other designation held
by a legal entity with no assets other than such name or designation and no
duties or purposes other than duties and purposes ancillary to the Business
and used exclusively in the Business (a " _Nominee Company_ "), then, without
further consideration, upon request of the Purchaser, Deutsche Bank shall, or
shall cause such Seller controlling the same to, transfer all of such rights
in any such entity to the Purchaser or the applicable Purchasing Subsidiary
or, if the Purchaser so elects, such Nominee Company shall be included in the
DB Entities.



(f) In the event any consent or approval of any lessor or other third party
required with respect to any Sub-Lease Agreement contemplated by Section 5.17
is not obtained prior to the Closing, in each case the facility to which
such consent or approval relates shall, at the PurchaserÂ’s election, be
included in the Facilities to be provided to the Serviced Parties pursuant to
Section 2.2 of the Transition Support Agreement and the Service Providers
shall provide the Other Office Services in respect of each such facility in
accordance with Section 2.2 of the Transition Support Agreement; _provided_ ,
that the monthly fees payable by the Service Providers in respect thereof
shall reflect a pass-through of the actual monthly fees paid for the
occupancy of such facilities based on the space occupied by the Purchaser;
_provided_ , _further_ , that Section 2.2(d) of the Transition Support
Agreement shall provide that the Serviced Parties shall be entitled to use
each such additional Facility and to obtain such Other Office Services in
respect thereof until the earlier of the date the applicable Serviced Party
obtains and occupies a satisfactory substitute facility or the expiration date
of the applicable head lease to Deutsche Bank or its applicable Affiliate.
For the purposes of this Section 5.08, the terms "Facilities," "Serviced
Parties," "Service Providers" and "Other Office Services" shall have the
meanings given such terms in the Transition Support Agreement.



SECTION 5.09. _Assigned Contracts_. (a) Promptly (but in any event within 30
days) following the date hereof, Deutsche Bank shall provide to the Purchaser
a list of the Assigned Contracts in effect on the date hereof and shall
provide to the Purchaser a true and complete copy of each such Assigned
Contract. The Purchaser shall have the right to exclude from the Purchased
Assets any such Assigned Contract that was not either listed on Section

 

97 3.12(a) or Section 3.12(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule on the basis that
such Assigned Contract is not of the general type of contract that would
reasonably be expected to be entered into in connection with the operation of
the Business or that its terms and scope diverge in any material respect from
the terms and scope of the Assigned Contracts of similar type made available
to the Purchaser in connection with its evaluation of the Business prior to
the date hereof. Deutsche Bank shall update the list of Assigned Contracts to
reflect the addition of any contracts, licenses, sublicenses, agreements,
leases, commitments (other than Client Contracts) entered into in accordance
with Section 5.01 between the date hereof and the Closing Date and that
constitute Purchased Assets and the deletion of any such items terminated or
disposed of between the date hereof and the Closing Date in accordance with
Section 5.01, and shall deliver such updated list to the Purchaser at least
three Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing, Deutsche
Bank shall deliver to the Purchaser a true and correct copy of each Sub-
Agency Contract not included in the Assigned Contracts.



(b) Promptly (but in any event within 30 days) following the date hereof,
Deutsche Bank shall deliver to the Purchaser a true and correct list of all
Client Contracts in effect on the date hereof. Deutsche Bank shall update such
list to reflect the addition of any Client Contracts entered into following
the date hereof and the deletion of any Client Contracts that have expired or
that shall have otherwise been terminated between the date hereof and the
Closing Date in accordance with Section 5.01, and shall deliver such updated
list to the Purchaser at least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date.
Deutsche Bank shall use all reasonable efforts to deliver to the Purchaser,
prior to the Closing Date, true and complete copies of all Client Contracts,
and with respect to any Client Contracts not so delivered, shall deliver
copies thereof promptly following the Closing Date.



SECTION 5.10. _Ancillary Agreements_. (a) Effective as of the Closing Date,
the Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Purchasing Subsidiaries to, and
Deutsche Bank shall, and shall cause the Sellers to, enter into the
Outsourced-Services Agreement in the form of Exhibit C hereto pursuant to
which, among other things, (i) Deutsche Bank and the Sellers will engage the
Purchaser or its designated Subsidiaries to perform and discharge the
Outsourced Services (as defined in the Servicing Agreement) under such Client
Contract otherwise contemplated by Section 2.02 to be assigned to the
Purchaser or a Purchasing Subsidiary at the Closing and which has not been so
assigned, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and under
such Contract and (ii) all of the economic benefits and burdens under such
Client Contracts shall be transferred to the Purchaser or the Purchasing
Subsidiaries. If the Parties agree that it is necessary or desirable to: (x)
amend the Servicing Agreement; or (y) to enter into a separate servicing
agreement (each a " _Local Servicing Agreement"_ ) in each case, in order to
comply with applicable local Law, or to obtain any necessary consent or
approval of any Governmental Authority or regulatory authority then, the
Parties hereto shall cooperate and negotiate in good faith to agree upon the
terms of such amended Servicing Agreement or Local Servicing Agreements
including the dividing or splitting up of the Servicing Agreement or Local
Servicing Agreements into such number of separate agreements required or
permitted by local Law or regulations and shall enter into, or shall cause the
applicable Sellers and Purchasing Subsidiaries to enter into such
amended Servicing Agreement or Local Servicing Agreement, effective as of the
Closing Date (or Deferred Closing Date, if relevant). To the fullest extent
possible under applicable local Law, the terms of any amended Servicing
Agreement or any Local Servicing Agreement (or, if the Servicing Agreement or
Local Servicing Agreements are divided or split

 

98 up, the totality of the PartiesÂ’ rights and obligations under such
agreements), shall be consistent with the form of Servicing
Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit C with only such amendments,
modifications, and alterations, as are necessary to give effect to the
economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated by the Servicing
Agreement and this Agreement in the relevant jurisdiction. Nothing in this
Section 5.10(a) shall alter the obligations of the Parties pursuant to Section
5.04 of this Agreement. On and after the Closing Date, without the prior
written consent of the Purchaser, Deutsche Bank shall not, and shall cause
the Sellers not to, (i) agree to any reduction in fees, compensation or other
income with respect to any Client Contract subject to the Servicing Agreement,
(ii) amend any Client Contract subject to the Servicing Agreement,
unless such amendment is required under such Client Contract in performance
of the Non-delegable Duties (as defined in the Servicing Agreement), (iii)
consent to removal from, sale, assign or transfer to any third Person,
encumber or otherwise adversely affect their rights under any Client Contract
subject to the Servicing Agreement, except as required under such Client
Contract or applicable Law, or (iv) resign from any appointment as fiduciary,
trustee, custodian, depositary, paying agent, administrative agent, transfer
agent, servicing agent, collateral agent, securities lending agent, accounting
agent or any similar capacity under any Client Contract subject to the
Servicing Agreement except as required under such Client Contract or as
permitted under the Servicing Agreement.



(b) At the Closing, Deutsche Bank and the Purchaser shall enter into the
Transition Support Agreement substantially in the form attached as Exhibit D
hereto; _provided_ , that between the date hereof and the Closing the Parties
shall cooperate and endeavor in good faith to (i) supplement and expand the
Exhibits to such form of agreement (and the Schedules to such Exhibits) to
reflect those additional services as may be necessary or appropriate to permit
the Purchaser to operate the Business from and after the Closing in the manner
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and (ii) include
detailed performance level standards in respect of all services contemplated
to be provided thereunder. With respect to any non-U.S. jurisdiction as to
which the Parties reasonably mutually agree that it is necessary or desirable
for Deutsche Bank or any Seller, on the one hand, and the Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates, on the other hand, to enter into a separate transition support
agreement (each a " _Local Transition Support Agreement_ "), including,
without limitation, in order to comply with applicable local Law or to obtain
any necessary consent or approval of any Governmental Authority, the Parties
hereto shall cooperate and negotiate in good faith to, or to cause such
Seller and such Affiliate of the Purchaser to, enter into such Local
Transition Support Agreement, effective as of the Closing Date. To the fullest
extent possible under applicable local Law, the terms of any Local Transition
Support Agreement shall be consistent with the form of Transition Support
Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit D with only such amendments,
modifications and alterations as are necessary to give effect to the economic
and legal substance of the transactions contemplated by the Transition
Support Agreement and this Agreement in the relevant local jurisdiction or to
optimize either or both the commercial arrangements and the Tax consequences
for the Parties. Nothing in this Section 5.10(b) shall alter the obligations
of the Parties pursuant to Section 5.04 of this Agreement.



(c) Following the date hereof, Deutsche Bank shall cooperate with the
Purchaser and shall endeavor in good faith to ensure that each DeAM Party (as
defined in the DeAM Agreement) and each other third party manager of the DeAM
Clients (as defined in the DeAM Agreement) provides to the Purchaser,
effective as of the Closing, an indemnity for

 

99 liabilities under Environmental Laws with respect to real property held as
Custodial Assets for such clients of a type and scope consistent with local
market practice for third party indemnitees and for liabilities of such type.



SECTION 5.11. _Assumption of Responsibilities for Funds and Separate
Accounts_. Deutsche Bank shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take the
following actions:



(a) _Valuation of Assets_. Deutsche Bank agrees to provide to the Purchaser,
as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than five Business
Days, after the date of this Agreement, a list of all Covered Assets, by Fund
and Separate Account, together with the amortized cost, and ratings, if
applicable, of each such Covered Asset, as of a single date not more than
fifteen Business Days prior to the date of delivery of such list or such
other single date as required under Law or under any applicable Code of
Ethics, as such Code of Ethics may be amended or supplemented after the date
of this Agreement. Deutsche Bank will use its reasonable best efforts to
ensure that, as of the date on which Deutsche Bank provides such list of
Covered Assets to the Purchaser pursuant to this Section 5.11(a) (the "
_Assets Date_ "), the per unit net asset value of each Stable NAV
Fund, calculated based upon the market value of the Covered Assets of the
Stable NAV Fund on the Assets Date, will not be less than 99.90% of the per
unit amortized cost or other stated value of such Stable NAV Fund.



(b) _Operation of Funds and Separate Accounts Prior to the Closing_.



(i) Deutsche Bank agrees that, between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing Date, Deutsche Bank and its Affiliates shall manage the assets of
each Fund and each Separate Account consistent with prior practice. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Deutsche Bank shall, and shall cause
its relevant Affiliates to: (A) except as otherwise consented to by a Client
or as will not result in any financial harm to a Client, manage the assets of
each Fund and each Separate Account in accordance with all investment
restrictions and agreements applicable to the Fund or Separate Account, all
Laws and the requirements of each Lending/Custodial Contract with respect to
the lending of securities or the investment of cash collateral or excess cash
for the applicable Participating Client; and (B) use reasonable best efforts
to invest the assets of each Fund and Separate Account in a manner designed
to avoid capital losses by the Fund or Separate Account. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.11 shall prohibit or otherwise restrict
in any way the operation of the businesses of Deutsche Bank and its
Affiliates other than the Business.



(ii) Deutsche Bank agrees that, between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing Date, Deutsche Bank shall notify the Purchaser, to the extent
permitted by Law and any applicable Code of Ethics, in the event any security
held in any Fund or Separate Account becomes the subject of a credit downgrade
by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.



(iii) Deutsche Bank agrees that, between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing Date, Deutsche Bank shall purchase assets on behalf of the Funds and
the Separate Accounts only from issuers listed on Deutsche BankÂ’s Approved
Issuer List.

 

100 (iv) Effective as of the Closing Date, Deutsche Bank shall, to the extent
permitted by Law and the Lending/Custodial Contracts, use its reasonable best
efforts to provide the Purchaser with the authority to manage the Separate
Accounts.



(c) _Post Closing Date Obligations_.



(i) Deutsche Bank agrees that, from and after the Closing Date, with respect
to each Lending/Custodial Contract with a Participating Client, and until the
earlier of (A) the effective date of the Participating ClientÂ’s consent to
the appointment of Purchaser as (1) trustee, fiduciary, agent or custodian of
such Participating Client, or (2) successor of Deutsche Bank or a Seller under
such Lending/Custodial Contract in accordance with this Agreement (each
such event described in this clause (A) being referred to as a "Novation"),
or (B) the date the Lending/Custodial Contract is terminated, or (C) the date
of termination of the Transition Support Agreement, Deutsche Bank and its
Affiliates shall manage the assets of each Fund consistent with prior
practice. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Deutsche Bank
shall, and shall cause its relevant Affiliates to: (A) except as otherwise
consented to by a Client or as will not result in any financial harm to a
Client, manage the assets of each Fund in accordance with all investment
restrictions and agreements applicable to the Fund, all Laws and the
requirements of each Lending/Custodial Contract with respect to the lending
of securities or the investment of cash collateral or excess cash for the
applicable Participating Client; and (B) use reasonable best efforts to invest
the assets of each Fund in a manner designed to avoid capital losses by the
Fund. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.11 shall
prohibit or otherwise restrict in any way the operation of the businesses of
Deutsche Bank and its Affiliates other than the Business.



(ii) Within five Business Days after the Closing Date, Deutsche Bank shall
deliver to the Purchaser a schedule of Covered Assets for the Separate
Accounts held as of the close of business on such Closing Date, which
schedule shall set forth, as of the close of business on such Closing Date,
the book value, together with the amortized cost, and ratings, if applicable,
of each such Covered Asset. 



(d) _Redemptions and Withdrawals at $1.00 Per Unit or Market_. Upon and after
a Novation: (i) with respect to each Stable NAV Fund, all redemptions or
withdrawals in cash or in kind from the Stable NAV Fund will be effected at
not less than $1.00 per unit; and (ii) all redemptions or withdrawals in cash
or in kind from the Pyramid Cash Plus Fund will be effected at market price
per unit in accordance with the Fund Description and Investment Guidelines for
the Pyramid Cash Plus Fund.



SECTION 5.12. _Overdrafts; Excluding Broker-Dealer Facilities_ (a) From and
after the date hereof, Deutsche Bank shall provide the Purchaser with all
information reasonably requested with respect to the credit policies and
operational credit risk management procedures of the Business other than with
respect to Broker-Dealer Facilities (the " _Business Credit Policy_ "). Prior
to the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall notify Deutsche Bank in writing
of all amendments and modifications to the Business Credit Policy that are
reasonably required by the Purchaser on and after the Closing Date (the
Business Credit Policy, as so amended and modified by the Parties, the "
_Purchaser Credit Policy_ "). From and after the date hereof the

 

101 Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to execute such
documentation and make such other arrangements to ensure that, other than
with respect to Broker-Dealer Facilities, effective as of the Closing: (i) all
counterparty credit risk to which the Business is exposed is managed by the
Parties on and after the Closing Date in accordance with the Purchaser Credit
Policy, (ii) credit exposures including advances of funds to Clients for any
reason made by Deutsche Bank (" _Deutsche Bank Advances_ ") on and after the
Closing Date and in accordance with the Purchaser Credit Policy shall be
solely for the account of the Purchaser (" _Purchaser Â’s Exposures_"), (iii)
Deutsche Bank Advances not incurred in accordance with the Purchaser Credit
Policy shall be solely for the account of Deutsche Bank (" _Deutsche Bank Â’s
Exposures_"), and (iv) the Purchaser shall establish effective as of Closing
and maintain at all times thereafter until the later of (A) the date on which
Conversion is completed and (B) the date on which no Services are provided to
or required by the Serviced Parties pursuant to Section 2.5 of the Transition
Support Agreement, a credit risk indemnity or a standby letter of credit in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Deutsche Bank and
the Purchaser.



(b) After the Closing, the Purchaser Credit Policy shall be subject to (i)
cancellation at the direction of the Purchaser upon reasonable prior notice
in writing and (ii) such amendments as may be reasonably requested from time
to time by the Purchaser. The Service Providers (as defined in the Transition
Support Agreement) shall cooperate with the Serviced Parties (as defined in
the Transition Support Agreement) from time to time in making and implementing
any such amendments; _provided_ , _however_ , that such amendments are not
prohibited by applicable Law and can reasonably be implemented by the Service
Providers in the ordinary course of their businesses.



(c) Deutsche Bank will maintain, solely to the extent of PurchaserÂ’s
Exposures, for the benefit of the Purchaser or the applicable Purchasing
Subsidiary on and after the Closing Date and until the relevant collateral is
transferred to the Purchaser, a first priority perfected security interest in
the collateral pledged by the relevant Clients (including securities, cash and
other pledged assets) to secure PurchaserÂ’s Exposures and, in consultation
with the Purchaser, shall establish appropriate control arrangements with
respect to such collateral remaining in accounts maintained with or through
Deutsche Bank and, if necessary to maintain the first priority perfection of
any such security interest held for the benefit of the Purchaser, establish
separate direct deposit accounts with respect to pledged cash.



SECTION 5.13. _Other Agreements; Notifications_. Until the expiration of the
term of the Transition Support Agreement, Deutsche Bank shall take all action
reasonably necessary to ensure the continued availability from, and provision
by, third parties of those services to be provided to the Purchaser under the
Transition Support Agreement following the Closing.



SECTION 5.14. _Client Contracts; Assignment; Meetings_. (a) Each of the
Parties shall, from and after the date hereof, take all reasonable action to
cooperate with the other Party to develop and execute a joint strategy for
seeking the consent to novation or assignment of each Client Contract
requiring a novation or assignment in order to be assigned or otherwise
transferred to the Purchaser or the relevant Purchasing Subsidiary in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Without limiting the foregoing, Deutsche Bank agrees that as part of such
cooperation, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, it shall make

 

102 available the resources and personnel of the Business (including senior
personnel) to assist the Purchaser in the activities contemplated by this
Section 5.14; _provided_ , _however_ , that Deutsche Bank shall not be
required to take any action that would interfere with the operation of the
Business in the ordinary course or interfere with its ability to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable. From and
after the date hereof until the Closing Date, except as otherwise contemplated
herein, no Party shall make, or cause to be made, any written communication
with any Client in respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby without the prior written consent of the other Party and the Parties
shall cooperate as to the timing and contents of any such communication, and
the Purchaser shall not initiate any contact (whether written or oral) with
any Client with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Prior to the Closing Date, except as prohibited by applicable Law or Client
Contract, each Party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly
report to the other the occurrence and substance of any material oral
communication with, and shall provide to the other Party any written
communication with or from, a Client relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Except as set forth above, the foregoing
provisions shall not prohibit or restrict the ability of Deutsche Bank, the
Sellers or the DB Entities to communicate (including in writing) with Clients
in the ordinary course of business.



(b) Subject to, and in accordance with, the provisions of the applicable
Ancillary Agreements and the other provisions herein, the Parties will use
their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of each Client
to the assignment or novation of the Client Contracts with such Client, where
such consent is required in order to permit such assignment or novation; it
being understood that unless otherwise required herein or in such Ancillary
Agreements, Deutsche Bank shall have no obligation to seek such consent until
after the Closing. Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the
Closing, each Party shall take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action,
do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable, and execute
and deliver such documents and other papers, as may be required, in each case
under applicable Law and each Client Contract, to consummate and make
effective the assignments of Client Contracts contemplated by this Agreement,
as promptly as reasonably practicable.



(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
Deutsche Bank and the Purchaser shall agree on a form (or forms, in each case
appropriate for the applicable jurisdiction) of joint statement by Deutsche
Bank and the Purchaser to each of the Clients (in each case to be reasonably
acceptable to the Parties). To the extent not prohibited by Law or
the applicable Client Contract and subject to any applicable Ancillary
Agreements, in such joint statement (i) Deutsche Bank shall notify the Client
of its sale of the Business, and (ii) Deutsche Bank and the Purchaser shall
recommend that each Client appoint the Purchaser or one of its designated
Subsidiaries as the successor service provider under the applicable Client
Contract. The joint statement shall be delivered by Deutsche Bank to each such
Client as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date. In
addition, Deutsche Bank agrees to cooperate with the Purchaser in arranging a
"webcast" or similar type communications to all Clients, including by
assisting the Purchaser in notifying Clients of such communication, provided
that Deutsche Bank shall have the opportunity to review and approve the
content of any such communication.

 

103 (d) From the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date, Deutsche
Bank shall, and shall cause representatives of the Business to, in
consultation with the Purchaser and subject to applicable Law and any
restrictions contained in the applicable Client Contracts, use its reasonable
best efforts to arrange mutually convenient personal meetings between
representatives of Deutsche Bank, the Purchaser and such Clients upon consent
of the Client (but in any event numbering no more than 150 such Clients)
mutually identified by the Purchaser and Deutsche Bank from time to time
after the date hereof. All such meetings shall be scheduled or at such
mutually convenient times as the parties agree and in no event shall any such
meetings be conducted without a representative of each Party. The Parties
shall, after any such meeting with a Client, consult with each other in good
faith to determine whether, considering the tenor and substance of any such
meeting, a formal solicitation of consent to assignment of the applicable
Client Contract should be sent to such Client prior to the Closing Date (to
be effective no earlier than the Closing). Clients consenting to such meetings
shall be advised that Deutsche Bank and the Purchaser are separate legal
entities and that consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is subject to regulatory approvals.



(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5.14, it is understood
that Deutsche Bank will, after the date hereof and prior to the Closing, seek
the consents to the assignment of Client Contracts as contemplated by the DeAM
Agreement and nothing herein shall affect or modify the PartiesÂ’ obligations
pursuant to the provisions of the DeAM Agreement relating to the solicitation
of consents.



(f) The obligations of Deutsche Bank under this Section 5.14 shall survive the
Closing but shall terminate on the 18-month anniversary of the Closing Date.



SECTION 5.15. _Conversion Plan; Delivery of Custodial Assets; Deposits;
Access; Further Assurances_. (a) The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to
prepare as soon as reasonably practicable a conversion plan reasonably
satisfactory to the Parties setting forth all tasks required to effect the
Conversion as soon as reasonably practicable, with minimal disruption to the
Business.



(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 2.02(a) and 2.03(a) to the
contrary, the Purchaser and the Purchasing Subsidiaries shall not at the
Closing assume Deutsche BankÂ’s and the SellerÂ’s liabilities and obligations
with respect to Deposits carried by Deutsche Bank and the Sellers and no
Custodial Assets held by Deutsche Bank and the Sellers in respect thereof
shall be transferred to the Purchaser or the Purchasing Subsidiaries at the
Closing, except as set forth in this Section 5.15. At the Conversion of any
Client or other account (or if an applicable Client Contract does not permit
such transfer, at such later time as such Client Contract is no longer
subject to the Servicing Agreement), (A) the liabilities and obligations with
respect to Deposits and Commingled Deposits carried in respect thereof shall
be transferred to and assumed by the Purchaser or a Purchasing Subsidiary;
provided that the Purchaser and the Purchasing Subsidiaries shall not be
obligated to assume in the aggregate more than Â€10 billion of such Deposits
and Commingled Deposits; and provided, further, that the Purchaser may in its
sole discretion elect to assume a greater aggregate value of Deposits and
Commingled Deposits and (B) Deutsche Bank shall, and shall cause the Sellers
to, release, transfer and deliver to the Purchaser or the applicable
Purchasing Subsidiary (or as the Purchaser or the relevant Purchasing
Subsidiary may direct) all Custodial Assets held in respect of such assumed
Deposits and

 

104 Commingled Deposits in accordance with Section 5.15(c). All Deposit
liabilities not so assumed shall be subject to the provisions of
the Ancillary Revenue Transfer Agreement.



(c) Subject to Section 5.11 and Section 5.19, from and after the Closing, in
conjunction with each Conversion with respect to a Client or other account (or
if the applicable Client Contract does not permit such transfer, at such later
time as such Contract is no longer subject to the Servicing Agreement),
Deutsche Bank shall, and shall cause the Sellers to, release, transfer and
deliver to the Purchaser or the applicable Purchasing Subsidiary (or as the
Purchaser or the relevant Purchasing Subsidiary may direct) all Custodial
Assets held by them in respect of such Client or other account, directing
such necessary parties, and executing such instruments, assignments,
endorsements and other documents as the Purchaser may prepare, to effect and
complete such transfers as the Purchaser may reasonably request. Deutsche
Bank shall, and shall cause the relevant Sellers to execute such additional
documentation as may be reasonably necessary to facilitate the proper transfer
of the Custodial Assets. Deutsche Bank shall prepare from its records, and
deliver to the Purchaser, accurate and complete schedules of such transferred
Custodial Assets.



(d) Deutsche Bank hereby agrees to deliver to the Purchaser or the applicable
Purchasing Subsidiary, on or following the Closing Date as the Purchaser may
reasonably request, all other Purchased Assets. The cost of any UCC or similar
foreign filings and any registrations in connection therewith shall be borne
by the Purchaser and Deutsche Bank in equal parts. Deutsche Bank shall
promptly comply with all reasonable requests of Clients to transfer Custodial
Assets and Account Documents to the Purchaser. Deutsche Bank shall be
entitled to keep copies (or, if required by Law, originals so long as it
delivers copies thereof to the Purchaser) of all Account Documents. Prior to
the Closing Date, Deutsche Bank shall, and shall cause the Sellers and the DB
Entities to, (i) segregate all Custodial Assets held for the benefit of
Clients from assets not serviced by the Business and (ii) hold such Custodial
Assets in accounts separate and apart from those accounts holding assets not
serviced by the Business. 



(e) Deutsche Bank and the Purchaser shall cooperate in all reasonable respects
to assist one another in transferring data relating to the Assets from
Deutsche Bank to the Purchaser. The records (including computer records),
files and other information in written or recorded form relating to and in
connection with provision of services to Clients in respect of which the
Purchaser or a Purchasing Subsidiary acts as a successor service provider,
shall in all material respects accurately reflect information supplied to the
Business by third parties and all material actions taken by the Business. 



(f) With respect to each Client, Deutsche Bank agrees that, from the date
hereof until such Client notifies Deutsche Bank that a successor service
provider has been appointed under such ClientÂ’s Client Contracts and, if the
Purchaser or a Subsidiary of the Purchaser is appointed as such successor
service provider, then until such time as the Custodial Assets and the
Account Documents are delivered to such party, Deutsche Bank shall (except to
the extent prohibited by Law or the Client Contracts) give the Purchaser and
its officers, directors, employees, agents, accountants, counsel
and representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the
offices, properties, books and records relating to such Client which are in
the possession of Deutsche Bank and the Sellers.

 

105 (g) With respect to each Transferred Employee, Deutsche Bank agrees that,
after the Closing Date, Deutsche Bank shall give (except to the extent
prohibited by Law) the Purchaser and its officers, directors, employees,
agents, accountants, counsel and representatives reasonable access during
normal business hours to the offices, properties, books, records and
personnel files relating to such Transferred Employee in the possession of
Deutsche Bank and the Sellers.



(h) On or after the date that the Purchaser or a Subsidiary of the Purchaser
is appointed successor service provider under any Client Contract, Deutsche
Bank shall promptly refer to the Purchaser any telephone calls, letters,
notices and inquiries relating to such Client Contract. Deutsche Bank will
also promptly transfer and deliver to the Purchaser any cash or other property
which may come into Deutsche BankÂ’s possession or which Deutsche Bank may
receive for the account of any such Client after such date. From time to
time, at the request of the Purchaser and without further consideration,
Deutsche Bank shall, and shall cause the relevant Sellers to, execute,
acknowledge and deliver such documents or instruments and take such other
action as the Purchaser may reasonably request to complete the assignment,
conveyance and transfer of any of the assets, properties, rights or claims
relating to any such Client.



SECTION 5.16. _Termination of Intra-Group Arrangements; Sub-Agency
Agreements_. Except (a) as set forth on Section 5.16 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, (b) as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements, and (c) in respect of Client Contracts and as set forth in Section
5.11, Deutsche Bank shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, immediately
prior to the Closing, execute and deliver such releases, termination
agreements and discharges, in form and substance mutually satisfactory to
Deutsche Bank and the Purchaser, as are necessary to (i) release and discharge
Deutsche Bank and such Affiliates (other than the DB Entities) from any and
all obligations owed (x) to the DB Entities or (y) in connection with the
Business, to Deutsche Bank or any of its Affiliates, (ii) release and
discharge the DB Entities from any and all obligations owed to Deutsche Bank
or any Affiliate thereof (other than the DB Entities) and (iii) terminate all
arrangements, commitments, contracts and understandings among Deutsche Bank
and any Affiliate thereof, which would, absent such termination, constitute
an Asset, an Assumed Liability or a liability of a DB Entity. Prior to the
Closing, Deutsche Bank shall cause the DB Entities to terminate, pursuant to
instruments reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser, each of the Sub-Agency
Agreements to which a DB Entity is a party.



SECTION 5.17. _Subleases_. (a) At the Closing, Deutsche Bank shall, or shall
cause its applicable Affiliate set forth on Schedule 5.17(a)(i) to, and the
Purchaser shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliate set forth on Schedule
5.17(a)(i) to, enter into and deliver agreements (the " _Sub-Lease Agreements_
") to sublease (from Deutsche Bank or such Affiliate of Deutsche Bank to the
Purchaser or such Affiliate of the Purchaser) the premises described on
Schedule 5.17(a)(i), on the terms described in Exhibit E hereto. At the
Closing, Deutsche Bank shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliate set
forth on Schedule 5.17(a)(ii) to, and the Purchaser shall, or shall cause its
applicable Affiliate set forth on Schedule 5.17(a)(ii) to, enter into and
deliver agreements (the " _Lease Agreements_ ") to lease (from Deutsche Bank
or such Affiliate of Deutsche Bank to the Purchaser or such Affiliate of the
Purchaser) the premises described on Schedule 5.17(a)(ii), on the terms
described in Exhibit F hereto.

 

106 (b) Prior to the Closing, Deutsche Bank shall cause (i) The World Markets
Company plc to assign to Deutsche Bank AG Â–London Branch the lease relating
to the World Markets House, Crewe Toll, Edinburgh, (ii) The World Markets
Company plc to assign to Deutche Bank AG Â– London Branch the lease relating to
27 Chancery Lane, London, and (iii) InterSec Research Corporation to assign
to an Affiliate of Deutsche Bank (other than a DB Entity) the lease relating
to the second floor of Kreuzstrasse 39, 8008 Zurich, Switzerland, in each
case, pursuant to instruments reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser.



SECTION 5.18. _Grant of License_. (a) At the Closing, Deutsche Bank
shall cause each of the Sellers and each other Affiliate of Deutsche Bank
that is an owner of any Licensed Retained Intellectual Property set forth on
Section 5.18 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the " _Deutsche
Bank Licensors_ ") to, and the Purchaser shall, enter into a License
Agreement in the form attached as Exhibit G hereto (the " _License Agreement_
") pursuant to which the Deutsche Bank Licensors will grant the Purchaser,
effective at Closing, a worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, perpetual,
royalty free, paid up right and license to use the Licensed Retained
Intellectual Property solely for use in connection with the continued conduct
of the Business by the Purchaser after the Closing Date and in connection
with the ordinary conduct of the corresponding business of the Purchaser. The
License Agreement shall provide that the rights and licenses granted
thereunder may be freely sublicensed, without the prior consent of Deutsche
Bank or any Deutsche Bank Licensor, to any Affiliate of the Purchaser, any
third party but solely to the extent such third party shall use the licensed
intellectual property to support the conduct of the Business operations of the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, or any Person that acquires substantially
all the assets of the Purchaser or of a division of the Purchaser that uses
the licensed intellectual property in the ordinary course of the Business.



(b) At the Closing, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause each applicable
Purchasing Subsidiary to, enter into a License Back Agreement in the form
attached as Exhibit H hereto (the " _License-Back Agreement_ "), pursuant to
which the Purchaser and such Purchasing Subsidiaries will grant to Deutsche
Bank, effective at Closing, a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual,
royalty free, paid up right and license to use the Transferred Intellectual
Property (i) in connection with the provision of services to the Purchaser and
its Affiliates in support of the Business pursuant to the Transition Support
Agreement, and (ii) to the extent currently used as an incidental part of the
then existing (as of the Closing Date) systems of Deutsche Bank (an "
_Incidental Use_ "); _provided_ , that such license for the Incidental Use of
the Transferred Intellectual Property shall include the right to further
develop and use such Intellectual Property in connection with any Incidental
Use but only to the extent that such developed Intellectual Property does not
constitute a material portion of any system of Deutsche Bank with
functionality comparable to any material system of Purchaser used in the
continued conduct of the Business by Purchaser after the Closing Date or in
connection with the ordinary conduct of the corresponding business of
Purchaser. Deutsche Bank may assign or sublicense the license granted under
this Section 5.18(b) to any Affiliate, but such assignment or sublicense will
either (i) be assigned back to Deutsche Bank or any of its Affiliates or (ii)
terminate, as to such Person, upon such Person ceasing to be an Affiliate of
Deutsche Bank or upon a sale of all or substantially all of the business of
such Person.

 

107 SECTION 5.19. _Assumed Broker-Dealer Facilities_. (a) Promptly following
the date hereof (and in any event sufficiently in advance of the 30th day
following the date hereof to allow the Purchaser sufficient time to make a
preliminary credit determination with respect to such Broker-Dealer
Facilities), Deutsche Bank shall, unless prohibited by applicable Law or the
terms of such Broker-Dealer Facility, provide all information reasonably
requested by the Purchaser with respect to each Broker-Dealer Facility listed
on Section 3.21(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. No later than the 30th
day following the date hereof, the Purchaser shall complete a preliminary
credit review with respect to each such Broker-Dealer Facility and shall
notify Deutsche Bank in writing whether it is the PurchaserÂ’s intention, based
on such preliminary review (and subject to the final sentence of this Section
5.19(a)), that such Broker-Dealer Facility be an Assumed Broker-Dealer
Facility (as defined below) (such notice, the " _Assumed Broker-Dealer Notice_
"). With respect to any such intended Assumed Broker-Dealer Facility, if the
Purchaser has identified to Deutsche Bank its desire to amend the terms or to
reduce the maximum available amount of such Broker-Dealer Facility prior to it
becoming an Assumed Broker-Dealer Facility, Deutsche Bank shall, subject to
the final sentence of this Section 5.19(a), cooperate with the Purchaser to,
and use its commercially reasonable efforts to, so effect such changes,
effective as of the Closing. Prior to the Closing Date, Deutsche Bank and the
Purchaser shall cooperate in all reasonable respects to ensure that, if a
Broker-Dealer Facility has been identified by the Purchaser as an intended
Assumed Broker-Dealer Facility (and the Purchaser has not notified Deutsche
Bank in writing that it has reversed its decision with respect to such
intended Assumed Broker-Dealer Facility in accordance with the final sentence
of this Section 5.19(a)) such Assumed Broker-Dealer Facility is assigned or
novated in full to the Purchaser or a Purchasing Subsidiary, (each such
Broker-Dealer Facility, as amended or reduced at the request of the Purchaser
prior to the Closing, being, at Closing, an " _Assumed Broker-Dealer Facility_
"). The Purchaser acknowledges that upon the expiration or termination of any
Assumed Broker-Dealer Facility in accordance with its terms, the Purchaser or
the applicable Purchasing Subsidiary shall be solely responsible for
negotiating and effecting any replacement facility (and, for the avoidance of
doubt, Deutsche Bank and its Affiliates shall not be obligated to renew,
amend or modify any Assumed Broker-Dealer Facility). As soon as possible
following the PurchaserÂ’s delivery of the Assumed Broker-Dealer Notice, and in
any event no later than the 20th Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall notify Deutsche Bank if, as a result of any final credit
review or approval process, a Broker-Dealer Facility identified in the
Assumed Broker-Dealer Notice as an intended Assumed Broker-Dealer Facility, is
to be treated at the Closing Date as an "Excluded Broker-Dealer Facility"
instead.

 



(b) Deutsche Bank will maintain, solely to secure obligations arising under
Assumed Broker-Dealer Facilities after the Closing Date, for the benefit of
the Purchaser or the applicable Purchasing Subsidiary and until the relevant
collateral is transferred to the Purchaser, its existing perfected security
interests in the collateral pledged by the relevant Clients
(including securities, cash and other pledged assets) under such Assumed
Broker-Dealer Facilities and, in consultation with the Purchaser, shall
establish appropriate control arrangements with respect to such collateral
remaining in accounts maintained with or through Deutsche Bank and, if
necessary to maintain the perfection of any such security interest held for
the benefit of the Purchaser or the applicable Purchasing Subsidiary,
establish separate direct deposit accounts with respect to pledged cash. 

 

108 (c) Deutsche Bank and the Purchaser will cooperate in good faith to establish
and maintain from and after the Closing Date appropriate funding mechanisms
for the continued funding of the Assumed Broker-Dealer Facilities by the
Purchaser or the applicable Purchasing Subsidiary on an uninterrupted basis,
including the establishment of one or more funding accounts by the Purchaser
or such Purchasing Subsidiary with Deutsche Bank.



SECTION 5.20.  _Deutsche Bank Non-Competition/Non-Solicitation_. (a) Until
the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, Deutsche Bank shall not, and shall
not permit any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, directly or indirectly,
engage in any Restricted Business, or own, manage, operate, or control, or
participate in the ownership, management or control of, or have (or acquire)
an interest in or assets of, any Person, enterprise or business that engages
in a Restricted Business (other than as a passive investor in less than 5% of
any class of the outstanding capital stock of a publicly-traded corporation).



(b) Until the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, Deutsche Bank shall not,
and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or any of its or
their respective officers, directors, employees or agents to, directly
or indirectly, solicit, encourage or induce any Transferred Employee to leave
the employment of the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (or
any successors thereto) or, until the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date,
hire any of such persons; _provided_ , _however_ , that it shall not be a
violation of this clause (b) to (i) hire any Transferred Employee whose
employment in the Business has been terminated by the Purchaser or its
Affiliates after the Closing Date or (ii) engage in general employment
solicitation activities, such as newspaper advertisements, that are not
directed specifically at employees of the Purchaser or its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates or to hire persons not solicited in violation of this clause (b)
who had not been employees of the Purchaser or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
(or any successors thereto) for a period of at least six months prior to such
hiring.



(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraph (a) above, Deutsche
Bank and its Subsidiaries may: (i) acquire a controlling ownership interest
in, or all or substantially all of the assets or businesses of, any Person
that derived, in the last full calendar year for which financial statements
are available, less than fifty percent (50%) of its aggregate consolidated
revenues from Restricted Business,  _provided_ that the primary purpose of
engaging in any such transaction is not to evade the general prohibitions set
forth in paragraph (a) above; (ii) acquire any other ownership interest in any
Person, and have the right to appoint less than fifty percent of the
directors (or members of a similar body) of any Person, that derived, in the
last full calendar year for which financial statements are available, less
than twenty percent (20%) of its aggregate consolidated revenues
from Restricted Business, _provided_ that the primary purpose of engaging in
any such transaction is not to evade the general prohibitions set forth in
paragraph (a) above; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that Deutsche Bank
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates in which it owns more than 50% of
the equity not to, enter into any preferred arrangement relating to the
Restricted Business with any such Person; (iii) perform its obligations under
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements; (iv) solely as may be necessary
and in the ordinary course of business, hold or acquire, in a fiduciary or
agency capacity for parties that are not Affiliates of Deutsche Bank, or in
connection with extensions of credit in the ordinary course of business to
any non-Affiliate of Deutsche Bank, any interest in any business engaged in a
Restricted Business; and (v) engage in a Permitted Business.

 

109 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
5.20, until the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, Deutsche Bank shall
not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including
without limitation any newly acquired Person) to, directly or indirectly, (A)
solicit Persons who were Clients on the Closing Date with respect to the
provision to such Person of products or services provided by the Business on
the Closing Date other than (1) general solicitations to the industry or
public or general advertising or responses to RFPs from such Persons and (2)
the provision of services to clients and customers of any newly acquired
Person or business existing on the date of the acquisition or (B) otherwise
encourage or induce Persons who were Clients on the Closing Date to reduce,
terminate or otherwise cease to receive products or services provided by the
Business on the Closing Date from Purchaser or its Affiliates.



(e) For purposes of this Section 5.20:



(i) " _Restricted Business_ " means the provision by Deutsche Bank, the DB
Entities and the Sellers (i) any place in the world of global custody
services, master trust/master custody services, benefit payment services,
master trust accounting services, trustee accounting and administration
services, offshore fund administration and custody services (including,
without limitation, trust and depositary services, fund accounting services,
fund administration services, trustee and domiciliary services, transfer
agency services and management company services), fund administration and
accounting services (including, without limitation, custodial services,
trusteeship services, depositary services, pricing services and depotbank
services), performance measurement services and custodial and third party (but
not principal) securities lending services, (ii) of broker/dealer clearing
services in the United States of America, (iii) of local custody services in
the United States of America and the United Kingdom, and (iv) of Agent Fund
Trading Services; _provided_ , _that_ the "Restricted Business" shall not
include: (A) the provision of any services (1) within the scope of (i) and
(iii) above, for issuers of debt, equity, asset-backed and other securities
under various indentures and agreements, and other services provided in the

Agreements, and (B) has not appointed any successor agent, trustee, custodian

nonperformance of any other provision of this Agreement by the Purchaser.
Deutsche Bank acknowledges that the covenants of Deutsche Bank set forth in
this Section 5.20 are an essential element of this Agreement and that, but
for the agreement of Deutsche Bank to comply with these covenants, the
Purchaser would not have entered into this Agreement. Deutsche Bank and the
Purchaser agree that money damages would be an inadequate remedy for any
breach of Section 5.20. Therefore, in the event of a breach or threatened
breach of Section 5.20, the Purchaser may, in addition to other rights and
remedies existing in its favor, apply to any court of competent jurisdiction
for specific performance and/or injunctive or other relief in order to
enforce, or prevent any violations of, the provisions thereof. Deutsche Bank
has independently consulted with its counsel and after such
consulatation agrees that the covenants set forth in this Section 5.20 are
intended to be reasonable and proper in scope, duration and geographical area
and in all other respects. If any such covenant is found to be invalid, void
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction by a final
determination of a court or any other Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction, Deutsche Bank and the Purchaser agree that: (i) such
determination shall not affect the validity or enforceability of (A)
the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other
jurisdiction or (B) the remaining terms and provisions of Section 5.20 in any
situation in any jurisdiction; (ii) the offending term or provision shall be
reformed rather than voided and the court or Governmental Authority making
such determination shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration or
geographical area of any invalid or unenforceable term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or enforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
provision, in order to render the restrictive covenants set forth in Section
5.20 enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law; and (iii)
the restrictive covenants set forth in Section 5.20 shall be enforceable as so
modified.



SECTION 5.21. _Delivery of Closing Revenue Run-Rate Schedule_. Deutsche Bank

months following the Closing Date, documentary evidence in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Deutsche Bank of the actual payment by the

respect of services outside the scope of the Business as a result of a

(including the DB Entities) harmless from and against any Damages suffered by
such Persons in respect of such obligations for which such a substitution has
not been made as of the Closing.



(b) The Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause itself or one

hold Deutsche Bank and its Affiliates harmless from and against any Damages
suffered by such Persons in respect of such obligations for which such a
substitution has not been made as of the Closing.

SECTION 5A.03  _Preparation of Registration Statement; Registration Statement
Procedures_. (a) In the event that the Purchaser shall have delivered any
Purchase Price Shares pursuant to Section 2.11, the Purchaser shall prepare,
and shall, no later than the close of business on the fifteenth day following
the Closing Date, file with the SEC a Registration Statement on such form as
the Purchaser may reasonably deem appropriate (the " _Registration Statement_
") providing for the registration of the sale of the Purchase Price Shares by
Deutsche Bank and any Sellers receiving Purchase Price Shares and, after the
filing of the initial version of the Registration Statement, the Purchaser
shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
such filing, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement through the second anniversary of
the Closing Date or such shorter period as is necessary for Deutsche Bank and
such Sellers to complete the sale of the Purchase Price Shares thereunder
(such period, the " _Effectiveness Period_ ").

 



(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Purchaser
shall be entitled to postpone and delay, for a reasonable period of time, but
in no event more than an aggregate of 60 days during the Effectiveness Period
(a " _Blackout Period_ "), the filing or effectiveness of the Registration
Statement if the Purchaser shall determine that any such filing or the
offering of any Purchase Price Shares would (i) in the good faith judgment of
the Board of Directors of the Purchaser, impede, delay or otherwise interfere
with any pending or contemplated material acquisition,
corporate reorganization or other similar material transaction involving the
Purchaser or (ii) in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the
Purchaser, require disclosure of material non-public information (other than
information relating to an event described in clause (i) above) which, if
disclosed at such time, would be harmful to the best interests of the
Purchaser and its shareholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser
shall give written notice to Deutsche Bank of its determination to postpone
or delay the filing of the Registration Statement. Upon notice by the
Purchaser to Deutsche Bank of any such determination, whether before or
following the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, Deutsche
Bank shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, keep the fact of any
such notice strictly confidential, and during any Blackout Period, promptly
halt any offer, sale, trading or transfer by it or them of any Purchase Price
Shares for the duration of the period set forth in such notice (or until such
Blackout Period shall be earlier terminated in writing by the Purchaser) or
until the end of the Blackout Period, whichever is earlier, and promptly halt
any use, publication, dissemination or distribution of the Registration
Statement, the prospectus included therein, and any amendment or supplement
thereto by it for the duration of the period set forth in such notice (or
until such Blackout Period shall be earlier terminated in writing by the
Purchaser) or until the end of the Blackout Period, whichever is earlier, and,
if so directed by the Purchaser, will deliver to the Purchaser any copies then
in its possession.



(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if at any time
the Purchaser shall obtain a written opinion of legal counsel, which opinion
is reasonably 

 

115 satisfactory in form and substance to Deutsche Bank, to the effect that the
Purchase Price Shares may be publicly offered for sale in the United States
by Deutsche Bank without restriction as to manner of sale and amount of
securities sold and without registration under the Securities Act, the
Purchaser shall no longer be obligated to maintain the Registration
Statement, unless at a later date Deutsche Bank delivers to the Purchaser an
opinion of counsel to Deutsche Bank, which opinion is reasonably satisfactory
in form and substance to counsel to the Purchaser, that registration is
then required as a result of a change in applicable Law.



(d) In connection with the Registration Statement, the Purchaser shall, as
soon as reasonably practicable and to the extent practicable:



(i) furnish without charge to Deutsche Bank such number of copies of the
Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement thereto and the
prospectus included in the Registration Statement as Deutsche Bank may
reasonably request in order to facilitate the public sale or other
disposition of the Purchase Price Shares;



(ii) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments, post-effective amendments
and supplements to the Registration Statement and the prospectus as may be
necessary to maintain the effectiveness of the registration for the
Effectiveness Period and to cause the prospectus (and any amendments or
supplements thereto) to be filed;



(iii) use reasonable best efforts to register or qualify the Purchase Price
Shares under such other securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions in
the United States as are reasonably necessary and keep such registrations or
qualifications in effect for so long as the Registration Statement remains in
effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Purchaser be
required to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in any
jurisdiction where it would not, but for the requirements of this
subparagraph (iii), be required to be so qualified; to take any action that
would subject it to service of process in suits other than those arising out
of the offer and sale of the securities covered by the registration statement,
or to subject itself to taxation in any jurisdiction where it would not
otherwise be obligated to do so, but for this subparagraph (iii);



(iv) use reasonable best efforts to cause the Purchase Price Shares to be
listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or on the principal securities
exchange on which the Purchaser Common Stock is then listed;

 



(v) promptly notify Deutsche Bank after becoming aware thereof, when the
Registration Statement or any related prospectus or any amendment or
supplement thereto has been filed, and, with respect to the Registration
Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective,
(A) of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to
the Registration Statement or the related prospectus, (B) of the issuance by
the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, (C) of the
receipt by the Purchaser of any notification with respect to the suspension
of the qualification of the Purchase Price Shares for sale in any jurisdiction
or (D) within the Effectiveness Period of the happening of any event or the
existence of any fact which makes any statement in the Registration Statement
or any post-effective amendment

 

116 thereto, prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any
document incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect or
which requires the making of any changes in the Registration Statement or
post-effective amendment thereto or any prospectus or amendment or supplement
thereto so that they will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading; and

 



(vi) In the event that the Purchaser would be required, pursuant to Section
5A.03(d)(v), to notify Deutsche Bank of the happening of any event specified
therein, the Purchaser shall, subject to the provisions of Section 5A.03(b)
hereof, as promptly as practicable, prepare and furnish to Deutsche Bank a
reasonable number of copies of a prospectus supplemented or amended so that,
as thereafter delivered to purchasers of Purchase Price Shares that have been
registered pursuant to this Agreement, such prospectus shall not contain an
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Deutsche Bank
agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Purchaser pursuant to
Section 5A.03(d)(v) hereof, Deutsche Bank shall, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates to, forthwith discontinue disposition of the Purchase Price Shares
until it shall have received copies of such amended or supplemented prospectus
and, if so directed by the Purchaser, to destroy or to deliver to the
Purchaser all copies, other than permanent file copies, then in its possession
of the prospectus (prior to such amendment or supplement) covering the
Purchase Price Shares as soon as practicable after Deutsche BankÂ’s receipt of
such notice.



(e) Deutsche Bank shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, furnish
to the Purchaser in writing such information regarding Deutsche Bank and its
Affiliates and its and their officers, directors and shareholders and such
other matters as the Purchaser may from time to time reasonably request in
connection with the Registration Statement and the obtaining of state
securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals. Deutsche Bank shall notify
the Purchaser as promptly as practicable of any inaccuracy or change
in information previously furnished by Deutsche Bank to the Purchaser or of
the occurrence of any event, in either case as a result of which the
prospectus relating to the Purchase Price Shares contains or would contain an
untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and
promptly furnish to the Purchaser any additional information required to
correct and update any previously furnished information or required so that
such prospectus shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.



(f) Deutsche Bank shall bear all agent fees and commissions, underwriting
discounts and commissions, and fees and disbursements of its counsel and
accountants, in connection with the registration of the Purchase Price Shares
pursuant to this Article V-A. The Purchaser shall bear all other fees and
expenses in connection with the Registration Statement, including all
registration, filing and qualification fees, (including SEC filing and the
listing fees of the New York Stock Exchange or any stock exchange on which
the Purchaser Common Stock

 

117 is listed), all printing costs, and all fees and expenses of counsel and
accountants of the Purchaser. 



(g) In order to facilitate any offer, sale, trading or transfer by Deutsche
Bank of any Purchase Price Shares pursuant to the Registration Statement, the
Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to enter into such agreements
(including, if the offering is an underwritten offering, an underwriting
agreement customary in form and scope for underwritten secondary offerings of
the nature contemplated by the Registration Statement) as may be reasonably
requested by Deutsche Bank in connection with such transaction and take all
other actions as are reasonably necessary in connection therewith in order to
expedite or facilitate the offer, sale, trading or transfer of the Purchase
Price Shares by Deutsche Bank and its Affiliates. As amplification of the
foregoing and not in limitation the Purchaser shall use reasonable best
efforts to (A) make such representations and warranties with respect to the
Registration Statement or post-effective amendment or supplement thereto,
prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, and documents incorporated
by reference, if any, to Deutsche Bank and the underwriter, if any, of the
Purchase Price Shares in form, substance and scope as are customarily made by
the Purchaser in connection with offerings of shares of the Purchaser Common
Stock in transactions of such kind; (B) obtain an opinion of counsel in
customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered by such an
opinion, addressed to such underwriter, if any, and to Deutsche Bank; (C)
obtain a "comfort" letter or letters from the independent certified
public accountants who have certified the PurchaserÂ’s most recent audited
financial statements that are incorporated by reference in the Registration
Statement which is addressed to Deutsche Bank and the underwriter, if any,
such letter or letters to be in customary form and covering such matters of
the type customarily covered by "comfort" letters of such type; (D) deliver
such documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by Deutsche
Bank and the underwriter, if any, of the Purchase Price Shares to evidence
compliance with any customary conditions contained in the underwriting
agreement or other agreement entered into by the Purchaser; and (E) arrange
for and participate in, at its own cost, all marketing programs and "road
shows" reasonably requested by Deutsche Bank in connection with the offer,
sale, trading or transfer of the Purchase Price Shares.



(h) Nothing in this Section 5A.03 shall affect or supercede any of the
transfer restrictions contained in Section 5A.04.



SECTION 5A.04 _Restrictions on Transfer_. (a) Except as otherwise provided in
this Section 5A.04, from the Closing Date until the six month anniversary of
the Closing Date (such period, the " _Restricted Period_ "), Deutsche Bank
shall not, and it shall not permit any of its Affiliates to (i) offer, pledge,
sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any
option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase,
lend or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any of the
Purchase Price Shares, or (ii) enter into any swap, short sale or other
arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the
economic consequences of ownership of any of the Purchase Price Shares,
whether any such transaction described in clause (i) or clause (ii) is to be
settled by delivery of the Purchase Price Shares or such other securities, in
cash or otherwise (each such action or transaction described in clause (i) or
(ii), a " _Transfer_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section
5A.04 shall restrict (i) Transfers between or among Deutsche Bank and its
Affiliates as long as the transferee agrees in writing, for the benefit of the
Purchaser to be bound by the

 

118 provisions of this Section 5A.04 or (ii) a Basket Hedge. " _Basket Hedge_ "
means any option, right, warrant, swap, short sale or other arrangement that
transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of
the ownership of a basket of securities that does not include any Purchaser
Common Stock.

 



(b) From and after the Closing, Deutsche Bank agrees that it shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, Transfer any Purchase Price Shares
in any transaction not otherwise prohibited by this Section 5A.04 except (i)
in an underwritten public offering in a manner designed to result in a wide
distribution, (ii) in one or more transactions to any Person or group (within
the meaning of Rule 13d-1 under the Exchange Act) where the aggregate amount
of Purchase Price Shares Transferred to such Person or group does not exceed
1% of the total number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock outstanding, or
(iii) in one or more transactions to any Person specified in Rule
13d-1(b)(1)(ii) promulgated under the Exchange Act that would be eligible
based on such PersonÂ’s status and passive intent with respect to the
ownership, holding and voting of such Purchase Price Shares to report such
PersonÂ’s ownership of Purchase Price Shares on Schedule 13G (assuming such
Person owned a sufficient amount of Purchaser Common Stock to require such
filing).



 

(c) During the period from the three-month anniversary of the Closing Date
until the six-month anniversary of the Closing Date, Deutsche Bank and its
Affiliates shall be permitted, notwithstanding the restrictions contained in
Section 5A.04(a) (but subject to the restrictions contained in Section
5A.04(b)), to Transfer a number of Purchase Price Shares equal to the number
of restricted shares of the Purchaser Common Stock that could be sold for the
account of an affiliate of the Purchaser under the provisions of Rule
144(e)(1) promulgated under the Securities Act during such three month period.



(d) The restrictions on Transfer contained in Section 5A.04(a) and 5A.04(b)
shall terminate and cease to apply in the event that, at any time, the
representations and warranties of the Purchaser set forth in Sections 5A.01
or 5A.02 that are qualified by "material" or "materiality" shall not be true
and correct or that are not so qualified shall not be true and correct in all
material respects; provided that the failure to be true and correct at such
time shall not be solely due to the failure of Deutsche Bank to comply in all
material respects, with the covenants of Deutsche Bank contained in Section
5A.03(e).



SECTION 5A.05 _Indemnification by the Purchaser_. The Purchaser will, and
hereby does, indemnify and hold harmless, Deutsche Bank and its directors,
officers, partners, agents and Affiliates and each other person who
participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of the Purchase Price
Shares, insofar as losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or
proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out
of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any
material fact contained in the Registration Statement under which Purchase
Price Shares held by Deutsche Bank were registered under the Securities Act,
any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained
therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances in
which they were made not misleading, and the Purchaser will reimburse Deutsche
Bank and each such director, officer, partner, agent or Affiliate
and underwriter for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred by
them in

 

119 connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, liability,
action or proceeding; provided, that the Purchaser shall not be liable in any
such case to Deutsche Bank and its directors, officers, partners, agents and
Affiliates or any underwriter to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage,
liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) or expense arises out
of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission made in such Registration Statement, any such
preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or
supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
furnished to the Purchaser through an instrument executed by or on behalf of
such person, as the case may be, specifically stating that it is for use in
the preparation thereof; and provided, further, that the Purchaser shall not
be liable to any person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or
sale of Purchase Price Shares or any other person, if any, who controls such
underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act, in any such case to the
extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding
in respect thereof) or expense arises out of such personÂ’s failure to send or
give a copy of the final prospectus, as the same may be then supplemented or
amended, to the person asserting an untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission at or prior to the written
confirmation of the sale of Purchase Price Shares to such person if such
statement or omission was corrected in such final prospectus so long as such
final prospectus, and any amendments or supplements thereto, have been
furnished to such underwriter. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and
effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of Deutsche Bank
or any such underwriter, director, officer, partner, agent or Affiliate and
shall survive the transfer of such securities by Deutsche Bank. The Purchaser
shall be entitled to receive indemnification and contribution from or on
behalf of underwriters, selling brokers, dealer managers and similar
securities industry professionals participating in the distribution to the
same extent as provided above with respect to information so furnished in
writing by such Persons for inclusion in any prospectus or Registration
Statement.



SECTION 5A.06 _Indemnification by Deutsche Bank_. Deutsche Bank will, and
hereby does, indemnify and hold harmless (in the same manner and to the same
extent as set forth in Section 5A.05) the Purchaser, and each director of the
Purchaser, each officer of the Purchaser and each other person, if any, who
controls the Purchaser within the meaning of the Securities Act, with respect
to any statement or alleged statement in or omission or alleged omission from
such registration statement, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or
summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto,
if such statement or alleged statement or omission or alleged omission was
made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to
the Purchaser through an instrument duly executed by Deutsche Bank
specifically stating that it is for use in the preparation of such
registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary
prospectus, amendment or supplement; provided, however, that the liability
of Deutsche Bank under this Section 5A.06 shall be limited to the amount of
proceeds received by Deutsche Bank and its Affiliates in the offering giving
rise to such liability. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect,
regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Purchaser or any
such director, officer or controlling person and shall survive the transfer of
such securities by Deutsche Bank. The Purchaser shall be entitled to receive
indemnification and contribution from or on behalf of underwriters, selling
brokers, dealer managers and similar securities industry professionals
participating in the distribution to the same extent as provided above with
respect

 

120 to information so furnished in writing by such Persons for inclusion in any
prospectus or Registration Statement.



SECTION 5A.07 _Notices of Claims, etc_. Promptly after receipt by an
indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding
involving a claim referred to in Section 5A.05 or 5A.06, such indemnified
party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an
indemnifying party, give reasonably prompt written notice to the latter of the
commencement of such action or proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not
relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under Section 5A.05 or
5A.06, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually
prejudiced by such failure to give notice. In case any such action is brought
against an indemnified party, unless in such indemnified partyÂ’s reasonable
judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying
parties is reasonably likely to exist in respect of such claim, the
indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and to assume the
defense thereof, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly
notified to the extent that it may wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory
to the indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such
indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof. The
indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal
or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection
with the defense of an indemnifiable action other than reasonable costs of
investigation, unless in the indemnified partyÂ’s reasonable judgment a
conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties arises
in respect of such claim after the assumption of the defense thereof by the
indemnifying party and the indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party
of such indemnified partyÂ’s judgment as to the existing conflict of interest
and the basis therefor; _provided_ , that the indemnifying party shall not, in
connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the
same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one
separate firm of attorneys (in addition to local counsel) at any time for all
indemnified parties. No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement
of any action or proceeding effected without its written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. No indemnifying party shall,
without the written consent of the indemnified party, consent to entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect of such claim or
litigation.



SECTION 5A.08 _Contribution_. If the indemnification provided for in Section
5A.05 or 5A.06 shall be judicially determined (by the entry of final judgment
or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of time to
appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal) to be unavailable to a party
seeking indemnification under Section 5A.05 or 5A.06 hereof in respect of any
loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, then, in
lieu of the amount paid or payable under Section 5A.05 or 5A.06 hereof, the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party under Section 5A.05 or 5A.06
hereof shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and
liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in
connection with investigating the same), (i) in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the
one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other hand, with respect to the
statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or
liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i)
above is not permitted by applicable

 

121 law, in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative
benefits received by the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and
the indemnified party, on the other hand from the offering of the securities
covered by such registration statement. No person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was
not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. In addition, no person shall
be obligated to contribute hereunder any amounts in payment for any settlement
of any action or claim effected without such personÂ’s consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. 



ARTICLE VI



EMPLOYEE MATTERS



SECTION 6.01. _U.S. Employees_. (a) _Offer of Employment; Transfer of U.S. DB
Entity Employees_. (i) Subject to applicable Law and Section 6.17(i), at least
five days prior to the Closing Date and effective as of the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall offer employment, pursuant to a procedure mutually
agreed upon by Purchaser and Deutsche Bank or the Sellers and, except as
otherwise specified in Section 6.01(a)(ii), consistent with the standard terms
and conditions of Purchaser in the ordinary course of hiring employees, to
each of the U.S. Employees, to the extent such employees are employed by the
Business on the date such offer is to become effective (including any
individuals on maternity leave, short-term disability leave or another
approved leave of absence, and excluding individuals who are U.S. DB Entity
Employees (as defined below in Section 6.01(a)(ii)) (each such employee a "
_U.S. Current Employee_ " and collectively the " _U.S. Current Employees_ ")
at a position that is substantially similar to such U.S. Current EmployeeÂ’s
position with the Sellers immediately prior to the Closing Date. Such offer of
employment shall be deemed not to be accepted if the U.S. Current Employee (A)
expressly rejects the offer of employment, (B) does not commence active
employment with Purchaser on the next scheduled work day immediately following
the Closing Date, (C) does not commence active employment with Purchaser (x)
on or prior to the three-month anniversary of the Closing Date, in the
case of a U.S. Current Employee who does not commence active employment with
Purchaser on the next scheduled work day immediately following the Closing
Date due to maternity leave or other approved leave of absence (excluding
military leave and absence due to a vacation, sick or personal day), or (y)
on or prior to the six-month anniversary of the initial date of disability, in
the case of a U.S. Current Employee who does not commence active employment
with Purchaser on the next scheduled work day immediately following the
Closing Date due to an absence from work due to an illness or injury that
lasts more than four scheduled work days (it being understood that a U.S.
Current Employee who, as of the Closing Date, is absent from work due to
an illness or injury of less than four scheduled work days shall commence
employment with Purchaser as of the next scheduled work day immediately
following the Closing Date) or (D) does not commence active employment with
Purchaser within a reasonable time, as shall be determined by Purchaser in
accordance with applicable Law, after the expiration of a military leave of
absence. Purchaser may perform background checks as required by Purchaser in
the ordinary course, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no offer of initial
employment shall be conditioned on the results of the background check,
although it may be conditioned upon the U.S. Current EmployeeÂ’s consenting to,
and cooperating with, such background check. Deutsche Bank, the Sellers and
Purchaser agree that Section

 

122 6.01(a)(i)(C) shall not limit the duration of any maternity leave of a U.S.
Current Employee that begins immediately upon the expiration of an approved
short-term disability leave of such U.S. Current Employee and shall not
prohibit a U.S. Current Employee from becoming a U.S. Transferred Employee
upon expiration of such employeeÂ’s approved maternity leave, _provided_
such maternity leave is no more than three months in duration.



(ii) As of the Closing Date, all U.S. Employees who are employed by a U.S. DB
Entity on the Closing Date (each such employee a " _U.S. DB Entity Employee_ "
and collectively the " _U.S. DB Entity Employees_ ") shall automatically
become employees of an entity that is owned or controlled by Purchaser in a
position that is substantially similar to such U.S. DB Entity EmployeeÂ’s
position with the applicable U.S. DB Entity immediately prior to the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of a U.S. DB Entity Employee
who does not commence active employment with the applicable Purchaser entity
on the next scheduled work day immediately following the Closing Date due to
an absence from work due to an illness or injury that lasts more than
four scheduled work days, such U.S. DB Entity Employee must commence active
employment with Purchaser on or prior to the six-month anniversary of the
initial date of the disability, in order to be considered a U.S. Transferred
Employee.

 



(iii) A U.S. Current Employee who accepts the offer of employment referred to
in Section 6.01(a)(i) and commences active employment with Purchaser or one
of its Affiliates on the date immediately following the Closing Date or within
the periods referred to Sections 6.01(a)(i)(C) and 6.01(a)(i)(D) and all U.S.
DB Entity Employees (other than those who are absent from active employment
with the applicable Purchaser entity on the next scheduled work day
immediately following the Closing Date due to an absence from work due to an
illness or injury that lasts more than four scheduled work days and do not
commence active employment with Purchaser on or prior to the six-month
anniversary of the initial date of the disability) shall be referred to
herein, individually, as a " _U.S. Transferred Employee_ " and collectively as
the " _U.S. Transferred Employees_." For all purposes of this Agreement, a
U.S. Transferred Employee who commences active employment with Purchaser or
one of its Affiliates on the day following the Closing Date (and those who are
absent on such date due to a vacation, sick or personal day) shall be deemed
to commence employment with Purchaser on the Closing Date, and a U.S.
Transferred Employee who does not commence active employment with Purchaser or
one of its Affiliates on the day following the Closing Date shall remain an
employee of Deutsche Bank or the Sellers and shall become an employee of
Purchaser as of the date (if ever) on which such U.S. Transferred EmployeeÂ’s
active employment with Purchaser or one of its Affiliates commences. For
purposes of this Agreement, references to the Closing Date shall be references
to the date of actual commencement of employment with Purchaser or one of its
Affiliates.



(b) _Benefits; Compensation_. Purchaser agrees that following the Closing Date
it shall, or shall cause the applicable U.S. DB Entity to, maintain employee
benefit and compensation (including incentive bonus opportunity) plans,
programs and arrangements for the benefit of the U.S. Transferred Employees
that, when taken as a whole, are at least as favorable as those provided
generally to similarly situated employees of Purchaser or its applicable
Affiliate, provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser agrees that
it shall, or shall cause the applicable U.S. DB Entity, to employ each U.S.
Transferred Employee at a base salary or base wage that is at least the rate
of base salary or wages paid to such U.S. Transferred Employee on the day
immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 

123 (c) _Service Recognition_. Each U.S. Transferred Employee shall
receive credit for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but
not for purposes of benefit accruals, other than for vacation accrual and
severance pay under PurchaserÂ’s severance plan or policy, and not for any
purposes under PurchaserÂ’s post-retirement welfare plans) under any employee
benefit plan (including, without limitation, any "employee benefit plan" as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), program or arrangement established or
maintained by Purchaser (each a " _Purchaser U.S. Benefit Plan_ " and
collectively the " _Purchaser U.S. Benefit Plans_ ") for service accrued or
deemed accrued as of the Closing Date with Deutsche Bank, a U.S. DB Entity, a
Seller and their Affiliates (with such service credit data to be provided to
Purchaser by Deutsche Bank or the Sellers within forty-five (45) days after
the date hereof, _provided_ that requisite consent is obtained from a U.S. DB
Entity Employee employed in the State of Connecticut, if Deutsche Bank and
the Sellers determine that such consent should be obtained); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any
benefit or the funding of any such benefit and shall not be credited if such
service is prior to a specific date before which service would not have been
credited for employees of Purchaser.



(d) _Purchaser U.S. Benefit Plans_. In connection with PurchaserÂ’s obligation
to provide welfare benefits to the U.S. Transferred Employees, Purchaser shall
cause each group health plan of Purchaser and its Affiliates to waive any
pre-existing condition exclusions thereunder with respect to the U.S.
Transferred Employees to the extent that such U.S. Transferred Employees are
enrolled in the applicable group health plan of Deutsche Bank, the U.S. DB
Entities or the Sellers as of the Closing Date and such conditions would have
been waived under the group health plan in which the U.S. Transferred
Employees were participating as of the Closing Date. Purchaser shall also
cause each Purchaser U.S. Benefit Plan to provide credit to U.S. Transferred
Employees for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by
such U.S. Transferred Employees under the group health plan of Deutsche Bank
or the Sellers during the portion of the relevant plan year, including the
Closing Date, in satisfying any applicable co-payment or deductible
requirements under any Purchaser group health plan.



(e) _Employee-Related Obligations and Costs_. (i) Deutsche Bank agrees to
remain obligated for, and shall cause the applicable Sellers to remain
obligated for, expenses in connection with any claim of a U.S. Employee,
arising under the workersÂ’ compensation laws of any state (a " _Worker Â’s
Compensation Claim_") that was incurred on or prior to the Closing Date. (For
purposes of this Article VI, a Seller shall be an applicable Seller and a DB
Entity shall be an applicable DB Entity if such Seller or DB Entity is the
employer of the relevant Business Employees.) Effective as of the day
following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall assume all obligations and
liabilities for all WorkerÂ’s Compensation Claims arising from events occurring
after the Closing Date with respect to any U.S. Transferred Employee. A
WorkerÂ’s Compensation Claim is deemed to be incurred when the facts and
events giving rise to such claim occur.



(ii) Deutsche Bank agrees to remain obligated and shall cause the applicable
Sellers to remain obligated to provide continuation health care coverage
(including the issuance of any required notices), in accordance with Section
4980B of the Code and Sections 601 to 608 of ERISA (" _COBRA_ "), to all U.S.
Employees and their qualified dependents and beneficiaries (A) who incur a
qualifying event on or prior to the Closing Date and (B) to whom Deutsche

 

124 Bank, the U.S. DB Entities or the Sellers are, on the Closing Date, (1)
providing such continuation coverage or (2) under an obligation to provide
such continuation coverage at the election of the U.S. Employee, including
solely as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Purchaser shall have responsibility for any and all obligations under COBRA
with respect to U.S. Transferred Employees and their qualified dependents and
beneficiaries who incur qualifying events after the Closing Date.



(iii) Effective as of the Closing Date and thereafter, Purchaser shall be
responsible for (A) any liability arising under the WARN Act in connection
with the termination of the employment of any U.S. Transferred Employee by
Purchaser after the Closing Date, (B) issuance of any notices required by the
WARN Act with respect to the termination of any U.S. Transferred Employee
after the Closing Date and (C) any obligation with respect to the U.S.
Transferred Employees under any applicable state or local equivalent arising
or accruing after the Closing Date. Purchaser shall indemnify Deutsche Bank
and its Affiliates for any claims or Liabilities of a U.S. Transferred
Employee arising out of or in connection with PurchaserÂ’s failure to comply
with this Section 6.01(e)(iii). Deutsche Bank shall, or shall cause the
Sellers to, be responsible for any liability arising under the WARN Act and
any state or local equivalent in connection with the termination of the
employment of any U.S. Employee on account of a termination of employment on
or prior to the Closing Date, and shall indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates
for any claims or Liabilities arising out of or in connection with Deutsche
Bank or the SellersÂ’ failure to comply with this Section 6.01(e)(iii). Each
of Purchaser or Deutsche Bank and the Sellers, as applicable, shall promptly
communicate and share information with the other party regarding the
termination of employment of U.S. Employees and U.S. Transferred Employees,
as applicable, to the extent that the awareness of such terminations of
employment is necessary in determining such other partyÂ’s duties under the
WARN Act and any state or local equivalent statute.



(f) _Flexible Spending Plans_. Deutsche Bank shall, or shall cause, the U.S.
DB Entities and the Sellers (the " _Transferring Parties_ ") to take all
actions necessary or appropriate so that, effective as of the next Business
Day after the Closing Date, (i) the account balances with respect to the plan
year in which the Closing Date occurs (whether positive or negative) (the "
_Transferred Account Balances_ ") under the Transferring PartiesÂ’ medical,
dependent care, and commuter expense flexible spending reimbursement plans
(collectively the " _Sellers Â’ Flex Plans_") of the U.S. Transferred
Employees who are participants in SellersÂ’ Flex Plans shall be transferred to
one or more comparable plans of Purchaser (collectively, the " _Purchaser Â’s
Flex Plans_"); (ii) the election levels and coverage levels of the
participating U.S. Transferred Employees shall apply under PurchaserÂ’s Flex
Plans in the same manner as under the SellersÂ’ Flex Plans; and (iii) the
participating U.S. Transferred Employees shall be reimbursed from PurchaserÂ’s
Flex Plans for claims incurred at any time during the plan year of the
SellersÂ’ Flex Plans in which the Closing Date occurs which are submitted to
PurchaserÂ’s Flex Plans from and after the Closing Date on the same basis and
the same terms and conditions as under the SellersÂ’ Flex Plans. As soon as
practicable after the Closing Date, and in any event within thirty (30)
Business Days after the amount of the Transferred Account Balances is
determined, Deutsche Bank and the Sellers shall pay Purchaser in cash the net
aggregate amount of the Transferred Account Balances, if such amount is
positive, and Purchaser shall pay Deutsche Bank or the Sellers in cash the
net aggregate amount of the Transferred Account Balances, if such amount is
negative.

 

125 (g) _Cessation of Participation; Retention of Liabilities; Welfare
Claims_. Deutsche Bank agrees and shall cause the applicable Sellers to agree
to continue coverage of the U.S. Transferred Employees under the Deutsche Bank
U.S. Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms through the Closing Date. As
of midnight on the Closing Date, the U.S. Transferred Employees shall cease
active participation in each of the Deutsche Bank U.S. Benefit Plans and shall
cease to accrue benefits under the Deutsche Bank U.S. Benefit Plans. Purchaser
shall not be deemed a successor employer with respect to any Deutsche Bank
U.S. Benefit Plan, Purchaser shall not assume any Deutsche Bank U.S. Benefit
Plan, and no employee benefit plan of Purchaser shall be deemed a successor
plan of a Deutsche Bank U.S. Benefit Plan. Deutsche Bank shall and shall
cause the applicable Sellers to retain all assets and liabilities for the
Transferred Employees under the Deutsche Bank U.S. Benefit Plans, other than
as expressly provided in Section 6.01(f) with respect to SellersÂ’ Flex Plans
and Section 6.01(h) with respect to the Deutsche Bank U.S. Savings Plans.
Deutsche Bank shall and shall cause the applicable Sellers to remain obligated
for all claims for benefits and benefit entitlements under the Deutsche Bank
U.S. Benefit Plans that were earned or accrued by Business Employees through
the Closing Date. With respect to Deutsche Bank U.S. Benefit Plans that
provide welfare benefits, Deutsche Bank agrees and shall cause the applicable
Sellers to agree that U.S. Transferred Employees eligible for reimbursement
of eligible health care and other eligible welfare benefit expenses and
services shall remain eligible for reimbursement of such expenses and services
incurred up to midnight on the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of
such Deutsche Bank U.S. Benefit Plans. An expense or service is deemed to be
incurred, (i) with respect to a health plan claim, when the medical or dental
services are performed; (ii) with respect to hospitalization claims, when the
hospitalization begins; (iii) with respect to a disability claim, when the
injury or illness resulting in such disability occurs; and (iv) with respect
to plans that provide welfare benefits other than medical, dental or
disability benefits, when the event giving rise to such expense or service
occurs.



(h) _Purchaser Â’s U.S. Savings Plan; Deutsche Bank Defined Benefit Plans_.
Purchaser shall permit the plan maintained by Purchaser that is an eligible
retirement plan, pursuant to Section 401(a)(31)(D) of the Code (" _Purchaser
Â’s U.S. Savings Plan_") to accept an "eligible rollover contribution" (within
the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in cash of all or a portion of
the account balance distributed to a U.S. Transferred Employee under any
Deutsche Bank U.S. Benefit Plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code (the " _Deutsche Bank U.S. Savings Plans_ "), subject to Deutsche BankÂ’s
provision of evidence reasonably satisfactory to PurchaserÂ’s U.S. Savings Plan
that the Deutsche Bank U.S. Savings Plans from which the eligible rollover
contribution was transferred is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.
For purposes of this Section 6.01(h), "eligible rollover contribution" shall
include the amount of any unpaid balance of any loan of a U.S. Transferred
Employee under any Deutsche Bank U.S. Savings Plan that permits participant
loans in accordance with (i) Section 408 of ERISA and (ii) the promissory note
executed by such Deutsche Bank U.S. Savings Plan evidencing such loan.
Purchaser shall amend PurchaserÂ’s U.S. Savings Plan effective as of the
Closing Date, to the extent necessary, to permit the rollover of participant
loans as contemplated in this Section 6.01(h). Deutsche Bank shall or shall
cause the applicable Sellers to amend the Deutsche Bank Savings Plans and the
Deutsche Bank defined benefit pension plans in which the U.S. Transferred
Employees participate to vest fully account balances and all accrued benefits
of the U.S. Transferred Employees as of the Closing Date. Purchaser and
Deutsche Bank agree and Deutsche Bank agrees to cause the applicable Sellers
to reasonably

 

126 cooperate to effectuate an orderly transfer of the loans from the Deutsche
Bank U.S. Savings Plans to PurchaserÂ’s U.S. Savings Plan. Purchaser and
Deutsche Bank shall, and Deutsche Bank shall cause the applicable Sellers to,
mutually cooperate and designate human resources personnel whom the other
party may contact to determine the status of the transfer of a U.S.
Transferred EmployeeÂ’s loan to PurchaserÂ’s U.S. Savings Plan. Deutsche Bank
agrees and shall cause the applicable Sellers to agree that if payment on a
loan of a U.S. Transferred Employee becomes delinquent pursuant to the terms
of the applicable Deutsche Bank U.S. Savings Plan, Deutsche Bank should, or
should cause the applicable Sellers to contact the appropriate Purchaser or
Deutsche Bank contact person to determine the status of the transfer of such
loan to PurchaserÂ’s Savings Plan and will not consider the loan to be in
default if such individual provides assurance that the transfer will be
completed in a reasonable period of time, as shall be determined by Deutsche
Bank and the Sellers.



(i) _Retiree Welfare Benefits_. Deutsche Bank shall, and shall cause the
applicable Seller to, provide U.S. Transferred Employees who, as of the
Closing Date (i) have met the eligibility requirements under any Deutsche Bank
post-retirement welfare benefits plan and (ii) are eligible to enroll in such
plan as of the Closing Date, with coverage under such plan upon
their termination of employment from Purchaser or one of its Affiliates (or
at an earlier time as may be elected by any such employee) in accordance with
the Deutsche Bank or a SellerÂ’s post-retirement welfare plan provisions, if
any, as in effect at the time such U.S. Transferred EmployeeÂ’s coverage under
the applicable plan, as amended from time to time, commences; _provided_ that
such U.S. Transferred Employee enrolls in the post-retirement welfare benefits
plan of Deutsche Bank or the Sellers by no later than immediately after
termination of employment from Purchaser or its Affiliates. Deutsche Bank
shall, and shall cause the applicable Sellers to, communicate the foregoing to
eligible U.S. Transferred Employees. 



(j) _Alternative IRS Procedure_. Deutsche Bank agrees and shall cause the
applicable Seller and U.S. DB Entity to agree that, pursuant to the
"Alternative Procedure" (provided in Section 5 of Revenue Procedure 96-60,
1996-2 C.B.399), with respect to filing and furnishing IRS Forms W-2, W-3,
W-4, W-5, and 941, (i) Deutsche Bank shall or shall cause the applicable
Seller or U.S. DB Entity (to the extent applicable) to (A) report on a
"predecessor-successor" basis (as set forth therein) and (B) shall be relieved
from furnishing Forms W-2 to any of the U.S. Transferred Employees and (ii)
Purchaser shall assume the obligations of Deutsche Bank, Sellers and their
Affiliates to furnish such Forms W-2 to any such U.S. Transferred Employees
for the year in which the Closing occurs; _provided_ that, in each case,
Deutsche Bank shall, and shall cause the applicable Seller or U.S. DB Entity
(to the extent applicable) to, cooperate with Purchaser in such transition
procedures by supplying Purchaser with all relevant wage, withholding, and
other relevant information in respect of periods prior to the Closing Date on
a timely basis.



SECTION 6.02. _Automatic Employees_. (a)  _General Rule_. The parties to this
Agreement accept and agree that: (i) the Transfer Provisions apply to the sale
of the Business; and (ii) the rights and obligations arising from the contract
of employment and the employment relationship of each Category 1 Automatic
Employee (as defined below in this Section 6.02(a) who is employed in the
Business immediately prior to the Closing Date (other than rights or
obligations in connection with occupational pension schemes, unless the
Transfer Provisions as they have been implemented in the relevant
jurisdiction apply to transfer such rights and

 

127 obligations) shall transfer to Purchaser at the Closing, unless the Category 1

object to the transfer (such Category 1 Automatic Employees who so transfer
being referred to herein, individually, as a " _Category 1 Automatic
Transferring Employee_ " and collectively as the " _Category 1 Automatic
Transferring Employees_ "). For the purposes of this Article VI, " _Category 1
Automatic Employees_ " shall mean the UK Employees (other than the WM

accept and agree that, despite the sale of the Shares of the DB Entity known
as The World Markets Company Public Limited Company (the " _WM Company_ ") by
Deutsche Bank or the Sellers to Purchaser, the employment (with the Category 2
Automatic EmployeeÂ’s (as defined below) employing company immediately prior to
the Closing (" _Employing Company_ ")) of each Category 2 Automatic Employee

notwithstanding the Closing. For the purposes of this Article VI, " _Category
2 Automatic Employees_ " shall mean those UK Employees who work in the
business of the WM Company (the " _WM Employees_ "), and those Category 2
Automatic Employees who remain employees of their Employing Company through
the Closing shall be referred to herein, individually, as a " _Category 2

(b) _Indemnification Obligations with respect to Automatic Transferring
Employees_. (i) Subject to any other provisions of this Article VI to the
contrary (which take precedence over this Section 6.02(b)(i)), Deutsche Bank
shall indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates and keep Purchaser and its
Affiliates indemnified against any losses, Liabilities, claims and costs
arising out of or in connection with the employment or termination of
employment (" _Employment Losses_ ") by Deutsche Bank, any Seller, or any DB
Entity of any Automatic Transferring Employee during the period prior to the
Closing (other than any Employment Losses which arise as a result of a failure
by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to comply with its or their obligations
in respect of providing information and/or consultation under the Transfer
Provisions or otherwise).



(ii) Subject to any other provisions of this Article VI, to the contrary
(which take precedence over this Section 6.02(b)(ii)), Purchaser shall
indemnify and keep indemnified Deutsche Bank, the Sellers and their Affiliates
against any Employment Losses arising out of or in connection with
the employment or termination of employment of any Automatic Transferring
Employee during the period following the Closing; _provided_ that any payments
by Purchaser or its Affiliates for severance or redundancy benefits (within
the meaning of Section 6.17(a)(v)) required to be paid by Purchaser or its
Affiliates in accordance with Section 6.17(a)(ii), shall be subject to the Â€70
million limit thereof.



(iii) Subject to any other provisions of this Article VI to the contrary
(which take precedence over this Section 6.02(b)(iii)), Purchaser shall
indemnify and keep indemnified Deutsche Bank and its Affiliates against any
Employment Losses which relate to, arise out of or are connected with any
failure by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to comply with its or their

 

128 obligations in respect of providing information and/or consultation under the
Transfer Provisions.



(iv) If any contract of employment or collective agreement of an employee who
is not a Business Employee (or, in respect of a Business Employee who is a
Singapore Employee, who has been misclassified as not being subject to Section
43 of the Singapore Employment Act) (an " _Undisclosed Employee_ ") shall have
transferred to Purchaser as a result of the application of the Transfer
Provisions or Section 43 of the Singapore Employment Act to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Transition Support Agreement (without
prejudice to any other rights or remedies which may be available to Purchaser
or its Affiliates), Purchaser shall remain free, upon becoming aware of the
application of the Transfer Provisions or Section 43 of the Singapore
Employment Act to any such contract of employment or collective agreement, to
terminate such contract or agreement immediately ( _provided_ that the Laws
of the relevant jurisdiction do not prohibit such termination), in which case,
Deutsche Bank shall:



(A) indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates and keep Purchaser and its
Affiliates indemnified against all losses, Liabilities, costs and claims
relating to or arising out of such termination; and



(B) reimburse Purchaser and its Affiliates for all costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, any taxation) incurred in employing such
Undisclosed Employee in respect of his employment on or after the Closing Date
up to the termination of his employment; and



(C) indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates and keep Purchaser and its
Affiliates indemnified in respect of such Undisclosed Employee on the same
terms as Deutsche Bank has indemnified Purchaser and its Affiliates in respect
of an Automatic Employee pursuant to the terms of Section 6.02(b)(i) above.



SECTION 6.03. _Provisions Specific to UK Employees and UK Pension Schemes_.
(a) _Stakeholder Employees_. This Section 6.03(a) applies to UK Employees who
are Category 1 Automatic Transferring Employees or Category 2 Automatic
Transferring Employees and who, immediately prior to the Closing, were members
of the DB Stakeholder Pension Plan or who have been informed in writing that
they will be entitled to employer contributions to that plan on reaching age
25 (the " _Stakeholder Employees_ "). Effective as of the day immediately
following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause the Stakeholder Employees:
(i) to be offered membership in the defined contribution section of
PurchaserÂ’s UK Pension and Life Assurance Scheme on the basis that Purchaser
shall make contributions that are no less favorable than those which currently
apply under the DB Stakeholder Pension Plan; and (ii) to become members of a
scheme which provides benefits payable on death in service on terms which are
no less favorable than currently apply in respect of them under the DB
Stakeholder Life Assurance Scheme.



(b)  _Non-Stakeholder Employees_. Purchaser shall, before or as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, invite each UK Employee who is
a Category 1 Automatic Transferring Employee or a Category 2 Automatic
Transferring Employee, who is not a Stakeholder Employee, to join the defined
contribution section of PurchaserÂ’s UK Pension and

 

129 Life Assurance Scheme with effect from the Closing Date on terms which are the
same as or no less favorable than those in the booklet summarizing the terms
of the defined contribution section of PurchaserÂ’s UK Pension and Life Assurance
Scheme dated August 9, 2002.



(c) _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Notwithstanding anything in this Article
VI to the contrary, Purchaser shall indemnify and keep indemnified Deutsche
Bank, the Sellers and their Affiliates against any liability including costs
and expenses any of them may suffer primarily as a result of Purchaser, WM
Company or any of their Affiliates not offering any UK Employee (including any
UK Employee who, at the Closing Date, is waiting to satisfy the minimum age
requirement of the UK Pension Plan as defined in Section 3.15(d)(v), but
excluding any UK Employee who is a member of the DB (UK) Senior Group Pension
Scheme) access to an occupational pension or life assurance scheme with
effect from the Closing Date that provides benefits which are identical in
every respect to those provided under the UK Pension Plan for such UK Employee
(or would be provided had such UK Employee satisfied the minimum
age requirement of the relevant UK Pension Plan) immediately before the
Closing Date, provided that any payments which Purchaser or its Affiliates
make under this indemnity shall be included in the Â€70 million limitation
referred to in Section 6.17(a)(ii). Deutsche Bank, the Sellers and their
Affiliates shall not, at any time, and shall procure that, prior to the
Closing, WM Company shall not provide to any of the UK Employees or their
representatives any information concerning PurchaserÂ’s intentions in respect
of pension arrangements in relation to the UK Employees following the Closing,
unless that information has first been supplied to Deutsche Bank by Purchaser
(or its legal advisers) in writing. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall comply
with its obligations under Regulation 10(3) of the Transfer Provisions as
implemented in the UK and shall, in particular, provide to Deutsche Bank full
details in writing of the information which it is required to provide under
that Regulation together with any equivalent information relating to UK
Employees who are Category 2 Automatic Employees which Purchaser would be
obliged to supply were the Transfer Provisions applicable at Closing to the
employment of the Category 2 Automatic Employees and shall update that
information in writing to Deutsche Bank without delay should that information
change at any stage prior to the Closing.



(d) _Vesting_. Any UK Employee whose benefit entitlement under the UK Pension
Plan has not fully vested on or before the Closing Date shall be treated by
Deutsche Bank and its Affiliates as if that benefit entitlement had fully
vested in him at the Closing Date.



(e)  _Cooperation_. Deutsche Bank shall, and shall cause the applicable DB
Entities and the applicable Sellers to, undertake to cooperate in allowing
Purchaser and its Affiliates reasonable access to the UK Employees or their
representatives prior to the Closing in order to make any reasonable
communications to them as regards pension arrangements.



(f)  _Settlement Documentation_. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall use
reasonable efforts to cooperate without undue delay with Deutsche Bank, the
Sellers and their applicable Affiliates in preparing any settlement
documentation in respect of the termination of employment of any employee who
is paid in the UK (whether a UK Employee or otherwise) on or prior to, or for
up to six (6) months following the Closing, including specifically being party
to any settlement or compromise agreement entered into in respect of such
termination of employment (provided that Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
shall not be obliged to make any

 

130 payment under the terms of such agreement and that Deutsche Bank shall
reimburse PurchaserÂ’s reasonable legal costs in reaching agreement on the
form of pro forma compromise agreement to be used).



(g)  _Indemnification by Deutsche Bank_. Deutsche Bank shall indemnify and
keep indemnified Purchaser and its Affiliates against all Employment Losses
which relate to or arise out of the dismissal by Deutsche Bank, the DB
Entities or any Seller on or prior to the Closing of any employee who is paid
in the UK but is not a UK Employee and which Purchaser or its Affiliates may
incur pursuant to the Transfer Provisions applying to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Transition Support Agreement.



(h) _Services Agreement_. Deutsche Bank shall procure that the Services
Agreement, dated March 8, 2002, between DB Group Services (UK) Limited ("
_DBGSL_ ") and Deutsche Bank (for itself and on behalf of various others) (the
" _Services Agreement_ ") is amended with effect immediately prior to the
Closing, such that DBGSL ceases to provide the services of any " _Relevant
Employees_ " (as defined in the Services Agreement) to the WM Company under
the terms of the Services Agreement. The parties to this Agreement accept and
agree that: (i) the Transfer Provisions (as implemented in the UK) shall
apply to such amendment of the Services Agreement and (ii) the rights and
obligations arising from the contract of employment and the employment
relationship of each WM Employee who is employed in the Business immediately
prior to such amendment taking effect (other than rights or obligations in
connection with occupational pension schemes) shall transfer immediately prior
to the Closing from DBGSL to the WM Company, unless the WM Employee exercises
a right under the Transfer Provisions to object to the transfer.



SECTION 6.04. _Provisions Specific to German Employees; German Benefit
Plans_. (a) _Consultation and Notification_. (i) Deutsche Bank and Purchaser
shall, and Deutsche Bank shall cause the applicable Sellers to, use reasonable
efforts to cooperate to provide the written notification about the transfer
of employment for the German Employees as legally required by Section 613 a
(5) of the German Civil Code. The parties to this Agreement assume that the
written notification has to be given to each of the German Employees at least
(1) one month prior to the Closing Date. The written information has to
contain particularly: (A) the expected date of the employment transfer, (B)
the reasons for the employment transfer, (C) the legal, economic and
social consequences the employment transfer shall have for the German
Employees, and (D) any changes and any other measures expected by Purchaser
which may affect the German Employees. Purchaser shall indemnify and keep
indemnified Deutsche Bank, the Sellers and their Affiliates from any claims
of the German Employees who become Automatic Transferred Employees, including,
without limitation, claims which relate to, arise out of or are connected with
any failure by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to comply with its or their
obligations in respect of notification to the German Employees as required by
Section 613 a (5) of the German Civil Code. Deutsche Bank shall indemnify and
keep indemnified Purchaser and its Affiliates from any claims or Liabilities
of the German Employees, including, without limitation, claims which relate
to, arise out of or are connected with any failure by Deutsche Bank or any of
its Affiliates to comply with its or their obligations in respect
of notification to the German Employees as required by Section 613 a (5) of
the German Civil Code. Notwithstanding that a joint notification shall be
provided to the German Employees, each party to this Agreement is exclusively
responsible and liable for the completeness and correctness of

 

131 its information material and its input to the joint notification. Purchaser
shall not include any reference in the joint notification to redundancies,
unless such reference is based on a redundancy plan of Purchaser.



(ii) The parties to this Agreement are aware of the fact that the German
Employees are entitled according to Section 613 a (6) of the German Civil Code
to object against the transfer of their employment agreements to
Purchaser. Nevertheless, both parties shall use their reasonable best efforts
to effect that no German Employee will exercise his or her right to object
against the transfer of his or her employment agreement. Purchaser shall
confirm in the joint notification or, as appropriate, shall procure that the
employing entity shall confirm to the German Employees that they will transfer
in compliance with and under observation of Section 613 a of the German Civil
Code. Purchaser shall indemnify and keep indemnified Deutsche Bank, the
Sellers and their Affiliates against any act or omission in contradiction to
the preceding sentence which leads to an objection of the German Employees
against the transfer of their employment. This indemnification includes
without limitation the employment-costs of the objecting German Employees and
all costs in connection with the termination of employment of these objecting
German Employees.



(iii) Deutsche Bank shall, and shall cause the applicable Sellers to,
reimburse Purchaser or its Affiliates for all employment costs (including
taxes and social security contributions) relating to the period of pre-
retirement leave ( _Freistellungsphase_ ) of those German Employees who have
or will have at the Closing Date a pre-retirement part-time arrangement (
_Altersteilzeitvereinbarung_ ).

 



(iv) Deutsche Bank shall remain obligated, and indemnify and hold Purchaser
and its Affiliates harmless, for all payroll liabilities and corresponding
claims (including, without limitation, the satisfaction of the payroll, social
insurance and tax obligations) with respect to the German Employees accrued
through the Closing Date, regardless of whether any such liabilities or
corresponding claims become due before, on or after the Closing. Purchaser
shall assume responsibility, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Deutsche
Bank and its Affiliates, for all payroll obligations (including,
without limitation, all payroll, social insurance and tax obligations) for
the German Transferred Employees in respect of their services with Purchaser
or its Affiliates as of midnight on the Closing Date. To the extent that
Purchaser effects payment of payroll liabilities accrued through the Closing
Date, Deutsche Bank shall reimburse Purchaser or its Affiliates in full.
Concerning the vacation days and time-off claims of the German Transferred
Employees accrued through the Closing Date, Deutsche Bank shall include on
the Preliminary Closing Statement of Net Assets and the Closing Statement of
Net Assets a liability equal to the cash value of the vacation days or time-
off claims (including, without limitation, payroll, social insurance and tax
obligations) in respect of the obligation of Purchaser or its Affiliates,
following Section 613 a (1) of the German Civil Code, to grant these vacation
days and time-off to the German Transferred Employees after the Closing Date.

 



(b) _Treatment of German Pension Obligations_. Deutsche Bank shall, or shall
cause the applicable Sellers to, pay to Purchaser an amount equal to the
value of the pension obligations as of the Closing Date in respect of each
German Transferred Employee (the " _German Pension Amount_ "). Deutsche Bank
shall, or shall cause the applicable Sellers to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Pension Amount to be transferred to Purchaser as

 

132 soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date. Prior to the
Closing Date, Deutsche Bank shall, or shall cause the Sellers to, mandate the
actuary of Deutsche Bank (the " _Deutsche Bank Actuary_ ") to determine the
reserves relating to the pension liabilities as of the Closing Date in
accordance with the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No.
87 on a projected benefit obligation basis based on actuarial assumptions no
less favorable than those used in the actuarial report as of December 31,
2001, previously delivered to Purchaser. The actuarial calculations of the
Deutsche Bank Actuary shall be reviewed for accuracy by, and subject to
the appraisal of, an actuary designated by Purchaser (the " _Purchaser
Actuary_ "). If the Deutsche Bank Actuary and Purchaser Actuary cannot reach
agreement as to the proper determination of the German Pension Amount,
Deutsche Bank and Purchaser shall refer such matter to an actuary at an
independent third-party actuarial firm (which actuary and actuarial firm shall
be mutually agreeable to Deutsche Bank and Purchaser) (the " _Third Actuary_
") for resolution. Promptly, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after
such referral, the Third Actuary shall review the Deutsche Bank ActuaryÂ’s
calculation of the German Pension Amount and Purchaser ActuaryÂ’s objections
and calculations with respect thereto, and shall provide each of Purchaser
and Deutsche Bank, with a written statement of its decision as to the issues
in dispute and the determination of the German Pension Amount. Such
determination shall be final and binding for all purposes. The fees and
expenses of the Deutsche Bank Actuary shall be borne by Deutsche Bank. The
fees and expenses of the Purchaser Actuary shall be borne by Purchaser. The
fees and expenses of the Third Actuary shall be borne equally by Deutsche Bank
and Purchaser.



(c) _Social Facilities and Continued Preferred Access_. Between the date
hereof and the Closing Date, Deutsche Bank shall (and shall cause the
applicable Seller to), and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate, to determine
the commercial feasibility of PurchaserÂ’s use following the Closing Date of
social facilities owned or operated by Deutsche Bank and its Affiliates in
Germany and the permissibility of allowing Transferred Employees continued
access following the Closing Date to services and products typically offered
to employees of Deutsche Bank, the DB Entities or the Sellers at preferred
rates, including but not limited to loans and bank or brokerage accounts, on
terms and conditions as if they were still employed by Deutsche Bank, the DB
Entities or the Sellers.



 

(d) _Additional Indemnity for Undisclosed Employees in Germany_. Deutsche Bank
shall indemnify and keep indemnified Purchaser and its Affiliates for a
period equal to the greater of (i) 12 months and (ii) the ordinary
contractual termination period (the " _Additional Indemnity Period_ ") against
all employment-related costs and claims incurred by Purchaser or its
Affiliates relating to any Undisclosed Employee falling under Section 613 a
of the German Civil Code. In addition, Deutsche Bank shall indemnify and keep
indemnified Purchaser and its Affiliates for costs relating to severance or
redundancy benefits to any Undisclosed Employee who is a German Employee
incurred by Purchaser or its Affiliates in connection with the termination by
Purchaser of any Undisclosed Employee, solely to the extent that such
severance or redundancy benefits are substantially comparable to severance
benefits under the applicable Deutsche Bank severance policy. Deutsche BankÂ’s
obligation to indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates pursuant to this Section
6.04(d) shall extend to Business Employees that Purchaser terminates in
lieu of any Undisclosed Employee due to selection requirements under
applicable Law, provided that (A) in this case, Purchaser shall without undue
delay obtain the prior written consent of Deutsche Bank and (B) the Additional
Indemnity Period shall be extended for a

 

133 period to the greater of (y) the period until Purchaser receives Deutsche
BankÂ’s consent or (z) any prolongation of the termination period caused by
seeking Deutsche BankÂ’s consent.



(e) _Additional Indemnity Related to the Appointment of HR Representatives_.
Purchaser shall indemnify and keep indemnified Deutsche Bank, the Sellers, and
their Affiliates for a period equal to the Additional Indemnity Period for all
employment related costs and claims incurred by Deutsche Bank, the Sellers or
their Affiliates relating to German Employees (the " _Objecting German
Employees_ ") who deny the transfer of their employment to Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates because, on or after the Closing Date, Purchaser or its
Affiliates have not appointed one or several human resources representatives
(the " _HR Representatives_ ") acting towards such German Employees. In
addition, Purchaser shall indemnify and keep indemnified Deutsche Bank, the
Sellers and their Affiliates for costs incurred by Deutsche Bank, the Sellers
or their Affiliates for severance or redundancy benefits in connection with
the termination of employment of any Objecting German Employees, solely to
the extent that such severance or redundancy benefits are substantially
comparable to severance benefits under the applicable Deutsche Bank severance
policy. For purposes of this Section 6.17(e), any payments by Purchaser or its
Affiliates for severance or redundancy benefits (within the meaning of
Section 6.17(a)(v)) required to be paid by Purchaser or its Affiliates in
accordance with Section 6.17(a)(ii), shall be subject to the Â€70 million limit
thereof.

employment agreements. Particularly, written information has to be provided to
the Labour and Mines Inspectorate, the staff delegation, the " _comit e
mixte_" and the unions parties to the collective bargaining agreement within a
reasonable period of time prior to the transfer. The written information has
to contain in particular: (i) the reasons for the employment transfer, (ii)
the legal, economic and social consequences the transfer shall have for the
Luxembourg Employees and (iii) any measures planned with regard to the
Luxembourg Employees. In case measures are to be taken with regard to the
Luxembourg EmployeesÂ’ situation, the Purchaser and Deutsche Bank shall, and
Deutsche Bank shall cause the applicable Sellers to, undertake consultations
and negotiations on the purported measures with the staff delegations, if
any, and worker unions that are part of the collective bargaining agreement in
order to reach an agreement. Purchaser shall indemnify and keep indemnified
Deutsche Bank and its Affiliates from any claims of the Luxembourg Employees,
including, without limitation, claims which relate to, arise out of, or are
connected with, any failure by Purchaser to comply with its obligation in
respect of notification to the Luxembourg Employees as required by Article
36(4) of the Law of May 24, 1989. Deutsche Bank shall indemnify and keep
indemnified Purchaser and its Affiliates from any claims of the Luxembourg
Employees, including, without limitation, claims which relate to, arise out of
or are connected with any failure by Deutsche Bank or the Sellers to comply
with their obligations in respect of notification to the Luxembourg Employees
as required by Article 36(4) of the Law of May 24, 1989. It is hereby intended
that the Closing Date and the transfer of the Luxembourg Employees shall not
be effected in Luxembourg until such information procedures have been
completed.

 

134 (b) _Treatment of Luxembourg Pension Obligations_. Deutsche Bank shall,
or shall cause the applicable Sellers to, pay to Purchaser or one of its
Affiliates an amount equal to the value of the pension obligations as of the
Closing Date in respect of each Luxembourg Transferred Employee (the "
_Luxembourg Pension Amount_ "). Deutsche Bank shall, or shall cause the
Sellers to, use all reasonable efforts to cause the Luxembourg Pension Amount
to be transferred to Purchaser or one of its Affiliates as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing Date, Deutsche Bank
shall, or shall cause the Sellers to, mandate the actuary designated by
Deutsche Bank (the " _Deutsche Bank Luxembourg Actuary_ ") to determine the
reserves relating to the pension liabilities as of the Closing Date in
accordance with the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 87
on a projected benefit obligation basis based on the actuarial assumptions
used to determine the German Pension Amount as provided under Section 6.04(b)
of this Agreement. The actuarial calculations of the Deutsche Bank Luxembourg
Actuary shall be reviewed for accuracy by, and subject to the appraisal of an
actuary designated by Purchaser (" _Purchaser Luxembourg Actuary_ "). If the
Deutsche Bank Luxembourg Actuary and Purchaser Luxembourg Actuary cannot reach
agreement as to the proper determination of the Luxembourg Pension Amount,
Deutsche Bank and Purchaser shall refer such matter to an actuary at an
independent third party actuarial firm mutually agreed on (the " _Luxembourg
Third Actuary_ ") for resolution. The Luxembourg Third Actuary shall provide
Deutsche Bank and Purchaser no later than thirty (30) days after such
referral with a written statement of its decision as to the issues in dispute
and the determination of the Luxembourg Pension Amount, which shall be final
and binding for all purposes. The fees and expenses of the Deutsche Bank
Luxembourg Actuary shall be borne by Deutsche Bank. The fees and expenses of
the Purchaser Luxembourg Actuary shall be borne by Purchaser. The fees and
expenses of the Luxembourg Third Actuary shall be borne equally by Deutsche
Bank and Purchaser.



SECTION 6.07. _Provisions Specific to Italian Employees_. (a) _Notice to
Automatic Employees Â’ Representatives_. Purchaser and Deutsche Bank shall,

to any local binding arrangement if preceding the Closing Date, about the date
and the legal reasons of the transaction as well as about the legal,
economic and social effects of the transaction on the Automatic Employees who

to, provide any information necessary to enable Purchaser to provide the

collective bargaining agreements and internal labor agreements in place at
Deutsche Bank, the DB Entities and the Sellers. Notwithstanding the execution
of this Agreement on the date hereof, the provisions of this Agreement
relating directly or indirectly to the Automatic Employees who are Italian
Employees shall not be binding or effective against such Automatic Employees
until and unless the representatives of such Automatic Employees, as
applicable, are provided with the information required to be provided, and
consulted by Deutsche Bank, the Sellers and Purchaser, as applicable, pursuant
to and in compliance with the Laws of Italy, and instead, this Agreement
shall constitute only an irrevocable binding offer by Purchaser to effectuate
the transfer of the Automatic Employees who are Italian Employees. It is
hereby intended that the Closing and the

 

135 transfer of the Automatic Employees who are Italian Employees shall not be
effected in Italy until such consultation processes have been completed.



(b) _Accrued Severance Indemnities_. For purposes of this Section 6.07(b), the
" _Accrued Severance Indemnities_ " are any and all of the amounts
statutorily due to the Italian Transferred Employees and/or liabilities
statutorily accrued for in the financial statement of Deutsche Bank or a
Seller organized in Italy as of the Closing Date, including, without

the Preliminary Closing Statement of Net Assets and the Closing Statement of
Net Assets of a corresponding liability, in an amount equal to the cash
liability as of the Closing Date in respect of such assumed Accrued Severance
Indemnities. To the extent that such corresponding liability is not properly
and adequately accrued for on the Preliminary Closing Statement of Net Assets
and the Closing Statement of Net Assets, Deutsche Bank shall indemnify and
keep harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates for any and all claims of the
Italian Transferred Employees with respect to the Assumed Severance
Indemnities.

SECTION 6.09. _Ireland Employees_. (a) _General_. As of the Closing Date, and
subject to applicable Law, the Ireland Employees who are employed by an Irish
DB Entity (or its successor entity) on the Closing Date shall remain

controlled by Purchaser on the same terms and conditions as previously
disclosed to Purchaser (other than the terms and conditions with respect to
any plans, programs or arrangements that either (i) provide for benefits or
equity or equity-based awards where such benefits or awards relate to the
equity of Deutsche Bank or any of its Affiliates, including the Ireland
Employee Share Scheme (as defined in Section 6.09(d)), or (ii) are not
sponsored by an Irish DB Entity) on which they are employed immediately prior
to the Closing Date. For purposes hereof, " _Non-Transferring Ireland
Employees_ " shall mean those employees of the Irish DB Entities who are not
Ireland Employees.



(b) _Non-Transferring Ireland Employees_. Deutsche Bank shall, or shall cause
the Irish DB Entities and the Sellers to, deliver, or procure the delivery of,
to Purchaser or its Affiliates, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
date hereof, a listing of the active members, deferred pensioners and
pensioners of the Ireland Pension Schemes and of the members of the Related
Ireland Benefit Schemes and details of the Non-Transferring Ireland Employees
who are members of the Ireland Pension Schemes or the Related Ireland
Benefit Schemes.



(c) _Indemnification in Respect of Non-Transferring Ireland Employees_.
Deutsche Bank agrees to indemnify and keep Purchaser, its Affiliates and the
trustees of the Ireland Pension Schemes (which, for the avoidance of any
doubt, in this Section 6.09(c) includes the trustees of the Ireland Pension
Schemes for the time being and any other person or company appointed from
time to time as a trustee of the Ireland Pension Schemes) indemnified on a
continuing basis against all losses, Liabilities, actions, proceedings,
claims, costs and demands howsoever arising out of (including any
complaints to or determinations made by any undertaking, officeholder or
person which or who is empowered to deal with complaints or

 

136 determinations) or relating in any way to: (i) the provision or non-provision

retirement, superannuation, death or analogous benefits of any nature or
amount to, and/or (ii) the employment, termination of employment or transfer
of employment from the Irish DB Entity to another Deutsche Bank Affiliate
(other than a DB Entity) of, in the case of both clause (i) and clause (ii),
any Non-Transferring Ireland Employee, except to the extent that any actions,
proceedings, claims or demands are provided for under (A) the Ireland Pension
Schemes solely with respect to accrued and vested benefits of the Non-
Transferring Ireland Employees that are fully funded as of the Closing Date or
claims arising directly from negligent or unlawful acts or omissions of
Purchaser or its Affiliates following the Closing Date (and, to the extent
that this indemnity relates to the trustees of the Ireland Pension Schemes,
Purchaser holds the benefits of the indemnity as trustee for the trustees of
the Ireland Pension Schemes and without prejudice to the ability of the
trustees of the Ireland Pension Schemes to enforce this indemnity, the
indemnity may be enforced by Purchaser as trustee for the trustees of the
Ireland Pension Schemes) or (B) the Related Ireland Benefit Schemes (to the
extent that the Related Ireland Benefit Schemes are fully insured).



(d) _Indemnification for the Ireland Employee Share Scheme_. Deutsche Bank
shall indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates on a continuing basis in respect
of and against all losses, Liabilities, actions, proceedings, claims, costs
and demands howsoever arising out of the Irish DB Entity Employee Share

that no negligent or unlawful act or omission on the part of Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates impedes any Ireland Employee from receiving such employeeÂ’s
accrued, allocated and fully funded entitlement under the Ireland Employee
Share Scheme. Effective as of the Closing Date, Deutsche Bank shall, or shall
cause the Sellers or the Irish DB Entity to, amend the Ireland Employee
Share Scheme so that no additional allocation of profit for shares will be
made to Ireland Employees or any other employees of the Irish DB Entity or its
Affiliates under the Ireland Employee Share Scheme.

of the Ireland Pension Schemes are offered membership of a pension scheme or
arrangement to which the Irish DB Entities are not a party and offered
the option of taking a transfer in respect of their accrued entitlements
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be accrued entitlements representing
both employer and employee contributions) under the Ireland Pension Schemes to
that scheme or arrangement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser
consents to this course of action.



SECTION 6.10.  _Switzerland Employees_. As of the Closing Date, the
Switzerland Employees who are employed by a DB Entity on the Closing Date
shall remain employees of the entity that is owned or controlled by Purchaser
in a position that is substantially similar to such Switzerland EmployeeÂ’s
position with the applicable DB Entity immediately prior to the Closing Date.
The provisions of Section 6.12(e) shall apply to the Switzerland Employees on
the same basis that they apply to the Non-Automatic Employees generally. To
the extent that Purchaser or one of its Affiliates is required to assume a
pre-Closing Liability with

 

137 respect to the Switzerland Employees pursuant to applicable Law or upon the
mutual agreement of Deutsche Bank and Purchaser, Purchaser shall be entitled
to receive from Deutsche Bank assets or an accrual on the Preliminary Closing
Statement of Net Assets and the Closing Statement of Net Assets, in an amount
equal to any such Liability, on a basis consistent with the manner in which
asset transfers and accruals on the Preliminary Closing Statement of Net
Assets and the Closing Statement of Net Assets are dealt with in this Article
VI.



SECTION 6.11. _Japan Employees_. (a) _Applicability of Sections 6.12(a)(i) and
(ii) and Section 6.12(e)_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this
Section 6.11, the provisions of Sections 6.12(a)(i) and (ii) and 6.12(e)
shall apply to the Japan Employees on the same basis as they apply to the Non-
Automatic Employees generally.



(b) _Structure of Japan Employee Transfer_. Following the date hereof,
Deutsche Bank shall, or shall cause the applicable Sellers to, seek to obtain
the consent from each of the Japan Employees in writing to their transfer to
the designated Affiliate of Purchaser by way of a voluntary resignation from
Deutsche Bank, the DB Entities or the Sellers (as applicable), on the
condition that they accept the offer of employment from the
designated Affiliate of Purchaser. In connection with such transfer:



(i) Subject to applicable Law and Sections 6.17(i), (j)(i) and (k), the
designated Affiliate of Purchaser shall provide a letter of offer to each
Japan Employee specifying a base salary substantially equivalent to the base
salary that such Japan Employee was earning from Deutsche Bank or the Sellers
(as applicable) immediately prior to the date of employment by the designated
Affiliate of Purchaser and other benefits (including, without limitation,
incentive bonus opportunity, retirement, unemployment and health benefits)
of an equivalent level to those provided by the designated Affiliate of
Purchaser to its employees generally as of the date of commencement of
employment with the designated Affiliate of Purchaser; and



(ii) On the condition that the Japan Employee accepts such offer of employment
from the designated Affiliate of Purchaser and commences employment with the
designated Affiliate of Purchaser (each as determined in accordance with
Sections 6.12(a)(i) and (ii)), such Japan Employee being a " _Japan
Transferred Employee_ " and collectively, the " _Japan Transferred
Employees_." Deutsche Bank shall, or shall cause the applicable Sellers to,
pay to each Japan Transferred Employee on their respective due dates, all
salary and other benefits to which such Japan Transferred Employee is
entitled as of the date of his resignation from Deutsche Bank or its
Affiliates.



SECTION 6.12. _Non-Automatic Employees_. (a) _Offer of Employment_. (i)
Subject to applicable Law (including, without limitation, any applicable
statutory minimum notice period) and Sections 6.17(i), (j)(i) and (k), at
least thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date and effective as of the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall offer employment pursuant to a procedure
mutually agreed upon by Purchaser and Deutsche Bank or the Sellers, to each of
the Australian Employees, Cayman Employees, Jersey Employees, Hong
Kong Employees, Netherlands Employees and Singapore Employees, to the extent
such employees are employed by the Business at the time of such offer
(including any individuals on maternity leave, disability

 

138 or leave of absence) (each such employee a " _Non-Automatic Employee_ " and
collectively the " _Non-Automatic Employees_ ") at a position that is
substantially similar to such Non-Automatic EmployeeÂ’s position with Deutsche
Bank or with the Sellers immediately prior to the Closing Date. Such offer of
employment shall be deemed not to be accepted if the Non-Automatic Employee
(A) expressly rejects the offer of employment, (B) does not commence active
employment with Purchaser on the next business day immediately following the
Closing Date or (C) subject to a provision of applicable Law that would
require otherwise, does not commence active employment with Purchaser or one
of its Affiliates (x) on or prior to the three-month anniversary of the
Closing Date, in the case of a Non-Automatic Employee who does not commence
active employment with Purchaser or one of its Affiliates on the next
scheduled work day immediately following the Closing Date due to maternity
leave or other approved leave of absence (excluding absence due to a vacation,
sick or personal day), or (y) on or prior to the six-month anniversary of the
initial date of disability, in the case of a Non-Automatic Employee who does
not commence active employment with Purchaser or one of its Affiliates on the
next scheduled work day immediately following the Closing Date due to an
absence from work due to an illness or injury that lasts more than four
scheduled work days (it being understood that a Non-Automatic Employee who, as
of the Closing Date, is absent from work due to an illness or injury of less
than four scheduled work days shall commence employment with Purchaser as of
the next scheduled work day immediately following the Closing Date). To the
extent applicable Law requires Purchaser to treat a Non-Automatic Employee who
does not commence active employment with Purchaser or one of its Affiliates
on the day immediately following the Closing Date for a reason specified in
Section 6.12(a)(i)(C) as a Transferred Employee, Purchaser and Deutsche Bank
shall cooperate to ensure that such Transferred Employee is provided with
uninterrupted welfare benefits insurance coverage, including disability
insurance coverage, to the extent such coverage is provided by Deutsche Bank
or the Sellers under an insured arrangement as of the Closing Date, and
Deutsche Bank shall, or shall cause the Sellers to, reimburse Purchaser and
its Affiliates for the cost of any such coverage, to the extent any such
coverage is provided under a self-insured arrangement as of the Closing Date.
Deutsche Bank and Purchaser agree that Section 6.12(a)(i)(C) shall not limit
the duration of any maternity leave of a Non-Automatic Employee that begins
immediately upon the expiration of an approved short-term disability leave of
such Non-Automatic Employee and shall not prohibit a Non-Automatic Employee
from becoming a Non-Automatic Transferred Employee upon expiration of such
employeeÂ’s approved maternity leave, provided such maternity leave is no more
than the statutorily required period or three months in duration, whichever
is longer. Purchaser may perform background checks as required by Purchaser in
the ordinary course, _provided_ , _however_ , that no offer of initial
employment shall be conditioned on the results of the background check,
although it may be conditioned upon the Non-Automatic EmployeeÂ’s consenting
to, and cooperating with, such background check, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law.



(ii) A Non-Automatic Employee who accepts the offer of employment referred to
in Section 6.12(a)(i) and commences active employment with Purchaser on the
date immediately following the Closing Date or within the periods referred to
in Section 6.12(a)(i)(C) shall be referred to herein, individually, as a "
_Non-Automatic Transferred Employee_ " and collectively as the " _Non-
Automatic Transferred Employees_." For all purposes of this Agreement, a Non-
Automatic Transferred Employee who commences active employment with Purchaser
or one of its Affiliates on the day following the Closing Date (and those who
are absent on such date due to a vacation, sick or personal day) shall be
deemed to commence

 

139 employment with Purchaser on the Closing Date, and, except as may otherwise be
required by applicable Law, a Non-Automatic Transferred Employee who does not
actually commence active employment with Purchaser or one of its Affiliates on
the day following the Closing Date shall remain an employee of Deutsche Bank
or the Sellers until the date (if ever) on which active employment
with Purchaser or one of its Affiliates commences and, for purposes of this
Agreement, references to the Closing Date shall be references to the date of
actual commencement of employment with Purchaser or one of its Affiliates.



(b) _Specific Offer Terms for Hong Kong Employees_. At least one month prior
to the Closing Date (or, where reasonably practicable in the period before
the Closing Date, such longer period as might be required under the employment
contracts of the Hong Kong Employees), Purchaser or one of its Affiliates and
Deutsche Bank shall, or Deutsche Bank shall cause the applicable Seller to,
issue a joint letter (in a form mutually agreed upon by Purchaser and Deutsche
Bank), to each of the Hong Kong Employees, giving notice of the Hong Kong
EmployeeÂ’s termination with Deutsche Bank or the applicable Seller and
containing an offer by Purchaser or one of its Affiliates to reengage such
Hong Kong Employee on terms which are no less favorable (when taken as a
whole) than those provided generally to similarly situated employees of
Purchaser or its applicable Affiliate,  _provided_ that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, Purchaser agrees that it shall offer each Hong Kong Employee a
position comparable to that held by such Hong Kong Employee with Deutsche Bank
or a Seller and a base salary or base wage at least equivalent to the rate of
base salary or wages paid to such Hong Kong Employee by Deutsche Bank or a
Seller, in each case on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date, and
containing a statement in relation to such Hong Kong EmployeeÂ’s continuity of
employment. Purchaser shall also permit each Hong Kong Transferred Employee
(as determined in accordance with Sections 6.12(a)(i)(A) through (C) and
6.12(a)(ii)) who was, prior to the Closing Date, eligible to participate in
a discretionary bonus plan operated by Deutsche Bank, to participate in the
applicable discretionary bonus plan of Purchaser or its Affiliates after the
Closing Date. The notice of termination described above shall be served in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the employment contract of each
Hong Kong Employee, unless Deutsche Bank or the Sellers makes a payment in
lieu of notice or part notice to the Hong Kong Employees, or the Hong Kong
Employee agrees to accept shorter notice than that required under his
employment contract. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section
6.12(b), the provisions set forth in Sections 6.12(a) and 6.12(e) shall apply
to the Hong Kong Employees on the same basis as they apply to all other Non-
Automatic Transferred Employees generally.



(c) _Specific Offer Terms for Singapore Employees_. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Deutsche Bank and Purchaser agree that the transfer of
Singapore Employees shall be in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the collective agreements between Deutsche Bank and trade unions in Singapore
(to the extent applicable to any such Singapore Employee). Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Section 6.12(c), the provisions set forth in
Sections 6.12(a) and 6.12(e) shall apply to the Singapore Employees on the
same basis as they apply to all other Non-Automatic Transferred Employees
generally.



(d) _Specific Offer Terms for Cayman Employees_. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, with respect to any Cayman Employee,
PurchaserÂ’s offer of employment pursuant to Section 6.12(a)(i) shall be
contingent upon Deutsche Bank, or its applicable AffiliateÂ’s, termination of
such employee from employment with Deutsche Bank, the

 

140 DB Entities or the Sellers (as applicable). Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Section 6.12(d), the provisions set forth in
Sections 6.12(a) and 6.12(e) shall apply to the Cayman Employees on the same
basis as they apply to all other Non-Automatic Transferred Employees
generally.



(e) _Benefits; Compensation_. (i) Except as otherwise provided in the
provisions of this Article VI that relate to the Business Employees employed
in a particular jurisdiction, the provisions of this Section 6.12(e) shall
apply to all Non-Automatic Transferred Employees. Solely to the extent that
any other provision of this Article VI that relates specifically to the
Business Employees employed in a particular jurisdiction conflicts with any
of the provisions of this Section 6.12(e), such other provision shall prevail,
but shall not limit the application of the non-conflicting provisions of this
Section 6.12(e). Purchaser agrees that as of the day following the Closing
Date it shall maintain employee benefit and compensation (including incentive
bonus opportunity) plans, programs and arrangements for the benefit of the
Non-Automatic Transferred Employees that, when taken as a whole, are at least
as favorable as those provided generally to similarly situated employees of
the applicable Affiliate of Purchaser, provided that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, Purchaser agrees that it shall, or shall cause the applicable
Affiliate, to employ each Non-Automatic Transferred Employee at a base salary
or base wage that is at least the rate of base salary or wages paid to such
Non-Automatic Transferred Employee on the day immediately prior to the Closing
Date.



(ii) With respect to each employee benefit plan, program, scheme or
arrangement of Purchaser or its Affiliates, each Non-Automatic Transferred
Employee shall receive credit for purposes of eligibility to participate and
vesting (but not for purposes of benefit accruals, other than for vacation
accrual, severance pay under the applicable Purchaser severance plan or
policy, and not for any purpose under the applicable Purchaser post-
retirement welfare plans) for service accrued or deemed accrued as of the
Closing Date with Deutsche Bank, the DB Entities, the Sellers or any of their
Affiliates (with such service credit data to be provided to Purchaser by
Deutsche Bank or the Sellers within forty-five (45) days after the date
hereof, _provided_ that requisite consent is obtained from the applicable
jurisdiction, if Deutsche Bank and the Sellers determine that such consent
should be obtained);  _provided_ , _however_ , that such crediting of service
shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such benefit
and shall not be credited if such service is prior to a specific date before
which service would not have been credited for employees of Purchaser or the
applicable Affiliate.



(f) _Pre-Closing Liabilities for Netherlands Transferred Employees_. To the
extent that Purchaser or one of its Affiliates is required to assume a pre-
Closing Liability with respect to the Netherlands Transferred Employees
pursuant to applicable Law or upon the mutual agreement of Deutsche Bank and
Purchaser, Purchaser shall be entitled to receive from Deutsche Bank assets or
an accrual on the Preliminary Closing Statement of Net Assets and the Closing
Statement of Net Assets, in an amount equal to any such Liability, on a basis
consistent with the manner in which asset transfers and accruals on the
Preliminary Closing Statement of Net Assets and the Closing Statement of Net
Assets are dealt with in this Article VI.



SECTION 6.13. _Specific Benefit Terms for Jersey Transferred Employees_.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the terms of this
Section 6.13 shall be the terms governing PurchaserÂ’s provision of benefit
plans to the Jersey Transferred Employees.

 

141 (a) _Treatment of Jersey Pension Schemes and Other Jersey Benefit Plans_. (i)
Effective as of the day immediately following the Closing Date but subject to
the State Street UK Pension and Life Assurance Scheme (the " _UK Scheme_ ")

Closing Date, Purchaser shall or shall cause the Jersey Employees who become
Transferred Employees and immediately prior to the Closing Date were members
of the Jersey Schemes (the " _Transferring Jersey Employees_ "): (A) to be
offered membership in the UK Scheme; and (B) to become members of a scheme
which provides benefits payable on death in service.



(ii) In the event that the UK Scheme is granted Approved Scheme status before
the Closing Date, then Purchaser shall use its reasonable efforts to ensure
that the trustees of the UK Scheme shall accept a transfer payment with
respect to the Transferring Jersey Employees from (A) the Deutsche Bank
Offshore Group Pension Plan in accordance with Sections 6.13(a)(viii) through
(xi) as if the words "Member Transfer Date" were replaced with the words
"Closing Date" and (B) the Deutsche Bank Offshore Group Defined Contribution
Plan in accordance with Sections 6.13(a)(vi) and (vii) as if the
words "Member Transfer Date" were replaced with the words "Closing Date."



(iii) In the event that the Jersey Comptroller of Income Tax does not grant
the UK Scheme Approved Scheme status, and Purchaser is unable to establish
another Approved Scheme before the Closing Date, Sections 6.13(a)(iv) through
(xi) shall apply. If Purchaser is able to establish an Approved Scheme before
the Closing Date, then Section 6.13(a)(ii) shall apply save that the words "UK
Scheme" shall be replaced with the name of the Approved Scheme established by
Purchaser.

 



(iv) Deutsche Bank, the DB Entities and the Sellers hereby undertake:



(A) to procure that, the Transferring Jersey Employees are permitted to remain
members of the relevant Jersey Schemes during the period commencing on the
Closing Date and expiring on the day immediately prior to the day falling

the parties agree in writing (the " _Member Transfer Date_ ");



(B) to procure, that subject to the consent of the Comptroller of Income Tax
being obtained (which consent Deutsche Bank, the DB Entities and the
Sellers shall use reasonable efforts to procure), Purchaser is permitted to
participate in the Jersey Schemes up until the Member Transfer Date;



(C) to procure that until the Member Transfer Date no power or discretion
under the Jersey Schemes is exercised in a way which would or might affect
Purchaser and/or the Transferring Jersey Employees without the written
consent of Purchaser; and

 

142 (D) to indemnify and to keep indemnified and to hold harmless on a continuing
basis Purchaser and its Affiliates against all and any Liability to make any
payment to or in connection with the Jersey Schemes other than to pay
contributions pursuant to Section 6.13(a)(v)(B).



(v) Purchaser hereby undertakes:



(A) as of the Member Transfer Date, to or to cause the Transferring Jersey
Employees: (x) to be offered membership in an Approved Scheme established
by Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Â’s Scheme_") which provides money purchase
benefits; and (y) to become members of a scheme which provides benefits
payable on death in service;



(B) with effect from the Closing Date, to pay or procure the payment to the
Jersey Schemes of the employer contributions which accrue to the Jersey
Schemes up to the Member Transfer Date in respect of the Transferring Jersey
Employees, such contributions to be deemed to be payable at the same rate as
is in force at the date of this Agreement provided that, for the avoidance of
doubt, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not be liable in respect of any
funding deficit in either of the Jersey Schemes; and



(C) to comply with the provisions for the Jersey Schemes up until the Member
Transfer Date.



(vi) _Benefits and Options Under the Deutsche Bank Offshore Group Defined
Contribution Pension Plan (the "Money Purchase Scheme")_. Deutsche Bank
undertakes and shall cause the applicable DB Entity or applicable Sellers to
undertake to Purchaser:



(A) to procure that the Money Purchase Scheme notifies each Jersey
Transferring Employee as soon as practicable after the Member Transfer Date
and in any event within thirty (30) days of the Member Transfer Date of the
options available to him under the Money Purchase Scheme and the funds
accumulated for his benefit under the Money Purchase Scheme and all other
information concerning the Money Purchase Scheme and those options which the
Jersey Transferring Employee may reasonably require in order to make an
informed decision as to which (if any) option to exercise;



(B) to procure that the amount of any transfer value for a Jersey
Transferring Employee shall be an amount calculated in accordance with the
governing Deed and Rules of the Money Purchase Scheme together with any
accrued benefit attributable to that Jersey Transferring Employee up to the
Member Transfer Date;

 



(C) to procure that if a Jersey Transferring Employee requests in writing that
a transfer value be paid to PurchaserÂ’s Scheme in respect of him in a manner
permitted under the governing Deed and Rules of the Money Purchase Scheme, the
Money Purchase Scheme gives effect to that request as soon as

 

143 practicable and in any event within thirty (30) days of that request being
made subject to the Trustee of PurchaserÂ’s Scheme accepting such a transfer;
and



(D) that Purchaser is forthwith on request advised in writing of the
respective amounts of the transfer values for the Jersey Transferring
Employees who elect to become members of PurchaserÂ’s Scheme and is supplied
with such information and evidence as Purchaser may request to
enable Purchaser to verify those amounts.



(vii) Purchaser undertakes to Deutsche Bank, the DB Entities and the Sellers
to use its reasonable efforts to ensure the Trustees of PurchaserÂ’s Scheme
accept a transfer value calculated in accordance with Section 6.13(a)(vi)(B)
from the Money Purchase Scheme in respect of a Jersey Transferring
Employee who becomes a member of PurchaserÂ’s Scheme and that the transfer
value is credited to an account under PurchaserÂ’s Scheme designated to the
Jersey Transferring Employee to be applied to provide money purchase benefits
for or in respect of that Jersey Transferred Employee.



(viii) _Benefits and Options Under the Deutsche Bank Offshore Group Pension
Plan (the "Final Salary Scheme")_. Within thirty (30) days of the Member
Transfer Date, Deutsche Bank shall, or shall cause the applicable DB Entities
or the applicable Sellers to, instruct Deutsche Bank or the DB Entities or
the actuary selected by Sellers (hereinafter referred to as the " _Vendor Â’s
Jersey Actuary_") to determine the transfer value for those Transferring
Jersey Employees who are members of the Final Salary Scheme.
Such determination to be made and communicated for agreement by the actuary
selected by Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Â’s Jersey Actuary_") within sixty (60)
days of the Member Transfer Date and based on mutually agreed assumptions set
out in writing and signed by PurchaserÂ’s Jersey Actuary and the VendorÂ’s
Jersey Actuary (the " _Transfer Value_ "). PurchaserÂ’s Jersey Actuary shall
agree or not agree to the Transfer Value within thirty (30) days of receiving
it from the VendorÂ’s Jersey Actuary, or if later, within sixty (60) days of
receiving such explanation of the VendorÂ’s Jersey ActuaryÂ’s calculations and
such data and information as PurchaserÂ’s Jersey Actuary may reasonably
require. If PurchaserÂ’s Jersey Actuary agrees to the amount of the Transfer
Value, then Deutsche Bank, the DB Entities or the Sellers shall procure that
the VendorÂ’s Jersey Actuary, and Purchaser shall procure that PurchaserÂ’s
Jersey Actuary jointly certify that amount as the Transfer Value. If, however,
the VendorÂ’s Jersey Actuary and PurchaserÂ’s Jersey Actuary fail to agree
within sixty (60) days from the date upon which the VendorÂ’s Jersey Actuary
first submits his findings to PurchaserÂ’s Jersey Actuary as aforesaid, the
matter may, at the option of either Deutsche Bank or Purchaser, be referred to
an independent actuary pursuant to Section 6.13(a)(ix). __  



(ix) Any dispute between the VendorÂ’s Jersey Actuary and PurchaserÂ’s Jersey
Actuary concerning the amount of the Transfer Value or any other matter to be
agreed between them in accordance with this Section 6.13 may, at the option of
either Deutsche Bank, the DB Entities or the Sellers or Purchaser, be referred
to an independent actuary (the " _Jersey Third Actuary_ ") to be appointed by
agreement between Deutsche Bank, the DB Entities or the Sellers and Purchaser
or, in default of agreement within fourteen (14) days from the first
nomination of an actuary by one party to the other, by the President

 

144 for the time being of The Institute of Actuaries (or of any successor body)
on the application of either Deutsche Bank, the DB Entities or the Sellers or
Purchaser. The Jersey Third Actuary shall act as an expert and not as an
arbitrator. His decision shall, save in the event of fraud or manifest error,
be final and binding on the parties and his costs shall be borne by Deutsche
Bank, the DB Entities or the Sellers and Purchaser equally.



(x) Deutsche Bank shall, and shall cause the applicable DB Entity or Seller
to, undertake to Purchaser:



(A) to procure that the Final Salary Scheme notifies each Jersey Transferring
Employee as soon as practicable after the date upon which the amount of the
Transfer Value is certified in accordance with Section 6.13(a)(viii) or
Section 6.13(a)(ix) (the " _Payment Date_ ") and in any event within thirty
(30) days of the Payment Date of the options available to him under the Final
Salary Scheme and the part of the Transfer Value referable to the
Jersey Transferring Employee (the " _JTE Transfer_ ") and all other
information concerning the Final Salary Scheme and those options which the
Jersey Transferring Employee may reasonably require in order to make an
informed decision as to which (if any) option to exercise; and



(B) to procure that if a Jersey Transferring Employee requests in writing
that a JTE Transfer be paid to PurchaserÂ’s Scheme in respect of him, the Final
Salary Scheme gives effect to that request as soon as practicable and in any
event within thirty (30) days of that request being made, subject to the
Trustee of PurchaserÂ’s Scheme accepting such a transfer.



(xi) Purchaser shall use its reasonable efforts to procure, for each of the
Jersey Transferred Employees who become members of PurchaserÂ’s Scheme, that
the Trustees of PurchaserÂ’s Scheme accept a JTE Transfer for each such person
and the applicable JTE Transfer is credited to an account under PurchaserÂ’s
Scheme designated to the Jersey Transferring Employee to be applied to provide
money purchase benefits for or in respect of the Jersey Transferred Employee.



(b) Deutsche Bank undertakes to indemnify Purchaser against all liabilities
and expenses that it may suffer or incur as a result of any claim relating to
events occurring prior to the Closing brought by, or in respect of, a Jersey
Employee who becomes a Transferred Employee, as a result of Deutsche Bank, the
DB Entities or the SellersÂ’ acts or omissions, in each case in respect of any
pension rights, claims or pension benefit for service prior to or on the
Closing Date or, if applicable, the Member Transfer Date.



(c) Deutsche Bank, the applicable DB Entities and the applicable Sellers
undertake to lend all reasonable assistance to Purchaser or its Affiliates in
making communications to the Jersey Employees before and after the Closing
Date.



(d) Deutsche Bank, the applicable DB Entities and the applicable Sellers
undertake not to make representations concerning, nor to discuss, at any
time, the pension

 

145 benefits to be provided by Purchaser or its Affiliates after the Closing Date
without PurchaserÂ’s prior consent in writing.

ceased to be its employee, so that the trustee of the SellersÂ’ MPF Scheme may
notify the Hong Kong Transferred Employee of his rights under the MPFSO in
respect of his accrued benefits under the SellersÂ’ MPF Scheme.



(ii) Purchaser shall establish or nominate a provident fund scheme registered
under the MPFSO to be PurchaserÂ’s MPF Scheme, and will enroll each Hong Kong
Transferred Employee (other than any Hong Kong Transferred Employee who is
not required by the MPFSO to be a member of an MPF Scheme) as a member of
PurchaserÂ’s MPF Scheme in accordance with the MPFSO in respect of service with
Purchaser and its Affiliates following the Closing Date and (in addition to
any contributions to PurchaserÂ’s ORSO Scheme) shall make mandatory
contributions at the level required by the MPFSO in respect of each Hong Kong
Transferred Employee who becomes a member of PurchaserÂ’s MPF Scheme.



SECTION 6.15. _Specific Benefit Terms for Transferred Australian Employees_.
(a) _Purchaser Â’s Obligations to Australian Transferred Employees_.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement and subject to Section
6.15(b) below, Purchaser shall assume Deutsche BankÂ’s and the SellersÂ’
liability for long service leave entitlements and untaken leave entitlements
for Australian Transferred Employees, effective as of the Closing Date, to the
extent those entitlements were not paid out by Deutsche Bank or the Seller
under Section 6.17(C) of this Agreement.



(b) _Deutsche Bank and the Seller Â’s Allowance for Accrued Entitlements_. In
consideration of Purchaser assuming liabilities under Section 6.15(a),
Deutsche Bank shall include the " _Australian Long Service Leave Amount_ " (as
defined below) and the " _Australian Annual Leave Amount_ " (as defined below)
as a liability on the Preliminary Closing Statement of Net Assets and the
Closing Statement of Net Assets.



(c) _Australian Long Service Leave Amount_. The " _Australian Long Service
Leave Amount_ " means the total of accrued long service leave entitlements
including any

 

148 superannuation payable on those entitlements of the Australian Transferred
Employees up to and including the Closing Date, calculated using the
following formula: (i) in the case of an Australian Transferred Employee who
has, or is deemed for the purpose of determining long service leave
entitlement to have, less than T2 years continuous service with Deutsche
Bank, the Sellers or their Affiliates, the amount calculated under the
following formula:



Y x _T1_



T2



where:



Y = the amount which that Australian Transferred Employee would have been
entitled to upon the termination of his employment from Deutsche Bank, a DB
Entity, a Seller or any of their Affiliates in lieu of long service leave,
including any superannuation payable on those entitlements had he on the
Closing Date been employed by Deutsche Bank, a DB Entity, a Seller or any of
their Affiliates for exactly T2 years at then current wage rates and had he
not been re-employed by Purchaser or one of its Affiliates on or after the
Closing Date;



T1 = the number of years of continuous service which that Australian
Transferred Employee has (or is deemed, for the purposes of determining long
service leave entitlement, to have) with Deutsche Bank, a DB Entity or a
Seller as of the Closing Date; and



T2 = the number of years which under the relevant award or long service leave
legislation is the minimum number of years of continuous service which would
entitle that Australian Transferred Employee to be paid money in lieu of long
service leave on having his services terminated by Deutsche Bank, a DB Entity
or a Seller.



(ii) in the case of an Australian Transferred Employee who has, or is deemed
for the purpose of determining long service leave entitlement to have, at
least T2 or more years of continuous service with Deutsche Bank, the DB
Entities, the Sellers or any of their Affiliates, the amount which that
Australian Transferred Employee would have been entitled to be paid in lieu of
long service leave, including any superannuation payable on
those entitlements assuming he were not reemployed by Deutsche Bank, a DB
Entity or a Seller on having his services terminated by Deutsche Bank, a DB
Entity or a Seller.



(d) _Australian Annual Leave Amount_. The " _Australian Annual Leave Amount_ "
means the total monetary value of the annual leave entitlements
(including leave loading) of all Australian Transferred Employees: (i)
accrued as of the Closing Date (including any accrual on the Closing Date);
and (ii) for which payment has not been made to the Australian Non-Automatic
Transferred Employee under Section 6.17(c) of this Agreement.



SECTION 6.16. _Temporarily Retained Employees_. (a) _General_. Purely
for regulatory reasons, the Closing Date in respect of the functions
pertaining to the Temporarily Retained Employees shall be deferred until the
applicable regulatory rules permit functions of

 

149 the Temporarily Retained Employees to transfer to Purchaser or one of its
Affiliates without jeopardizing the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement, with such date to be jointly determined by Deutsche Bank and
Purchaser (the " _TRE Transfer Date_ "). Upon the TRE Transfer Date, the terms
of this Agreement applicable to Business Employees shall apply to
such Temporarily Retained Employees effective as of the TRE Transfer Date.



(b) _Written Consents_. The Temporarily Retained Employees shall be
considered to be Transferred Employees upon transfer of their respective
employment to Purchaser or one of its Affiliates on the day immediately
following the TRE Transfer Date and until such TRE Transfer Date, such
employees will not be considered Transferred Employees. Prior to the Closing
Date, Deutsche Bank shall, or shall cause the applicable Sellers to, secure
written consents from each Temporarily Retained Employee providing that
the Temporarily Retained Employee does not transfer to Purchaser or one of
its Affiliates upon the Closing Date and that he shall transfer to Purchaser
or one of its Affiliates on the day immediately following the TRE Transfer
Date. The consents sought by Deutsche Bank in accordance with the prior
sentence shall include a consent that the Temporarily Retained Employee shall
transfer to Purchaser or one of its Affiliates on the day immediately
following the TRE Transfer Date. Deutsche Bank shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to secure the consent of each Temporarily Retained
Employee. 



(c) _Identification_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof,
Deutsche Bank shall identify or shall cause the applicable Sellers to
identify the Business Employees who shall be Temporarily Retained Employees as
of the Closing Date, and, accordingly, such employees shall, for purposes of
this Agreement, be treated as falling within the definition of Temporarily
Retained Employee for all purposes of this Agreement.



SECTION 6.17. _Covenants Applicable to All Business Employees_. (a)
_Severance_. (i) Subject to the satisfaction of the employment offer
obligation of Purchaser set forth in this Article VI and any other obligations
of Purchaser or its Affiliates set forth in this Article VI (any failure of
which to satisfy would result in an obligation by Deutsche Bank, the Sellers
or its Affiliates to pay severance or redundancy benefits), including, without
limitation, the obligation of Purchaser to indemnify Deutsche Bank and its
Affiliates for certain Liabilities with respect to severance or redundancy
benefits as set forth in Section 6.17(a)(ii), Deutsche Bank and the Sellers
shall remain solely responsible, and Deutsche Bank shall indemnify Purchaser
and its Affiliates for all losses, Liabilities, costs and claims with respect
to severance and redundancy benefits arising as a result of or relating to the
termination of employment of (or objection to transfer under the Transfer
Provisions by) a Business Employee on or prior to the Closing (including any
such Liability that may be imposed on Purchaser as a matter of Law in
jurisdictions other than the United States), whether such benefits arise or
are imposed under applicable Law, the terms of the Deutsche Bank Americas
Severance Pay Plan or any other severance plan, policy or agreement of
Deutsche Bank or its Affiliates, and without regard to whether the Business
Employee accepts or rejects PurchaserÂ’s employment offer or becomes or does
not become a Transferred Employee. In the event a Non-Automatic Employee or
Japan Employee who accepts PurchaserÂ’s offer of employment (and becomes a
Transferred Employee) would nevertheless be entitled to severance benefits
under the terms of a severance plan, policy or agreement of Deutsche Bank or
its Affiliates, Deutsche Bank shall take any reasonable and legally
permissible action to amend such plan, policy or agreement to provide that a
Business

 

150 Employee who accepts PurchaserÂ’s offer is not entitled to severance. In the
event Deutsche Bank does not amend any such severance plan or a Non-Automatic
or Japan Employee who accepts PurchaserÂ’s offer of employment would
nevertheless be entitled to severance benefits under applicable Law, Purchaser
shall cooperate with Deutsche Bank, to the extent commercially reasonable
for Purchaser and its Affiliates (taking into account, among other things,
PurchaserÂ’s desire to employ any such employee in a particular jurisdiction),
to reduce, to the extent possible, the likelihood that Deutsche Bank or its
Affiliates will be obligated to pay severance to such Transferred Employee.
For all purposes under this Agreement, and subject to applicable Law, Deutsche
Bank, the Sellers and their Affiliates and Purchaser and its Affiliates shall
cooperate to take commercially reasonable steps to reduce, to the extent
possible, the likelihood that any of the parties will have to pay severance
benefits to any Business Employee; provided, however, that, in no event, shall
Purchaser or its Affiliates be obligated to change the terms of its proposed
offer of employment, including any term of PurchaserÂ’s or its AffiliateÂ’s
compensation and benefit plans.



(ii) Subject to a maximum limitation of Â€70 million, and the satisfaction by
Deutsche Bank, the Sellers or their Affiliates of any obligations of Deutsche
Bank, the Sellers or their Affiliates set forth in this Article VI (any
failure of which to satisfy would result in an obligation of Purchaser or its
Affiliates to pay severance or redundancy benefits), Purchaser shall remain
solely responsible for and shall indemnify and keep indemnified Deutsche
Bank, the Sellers and their Affiliates for all losses, Liabilities, costs and
claims with respect to:



(A) severance and redundancy benefits relating to the termination of
employment on or after the Closing of any Non-Automatic Employee or any Japan
Employee due to the rejection of the offer of employment from Purchaser by
such employee, if the reason for such rejection is that the benefit plans,
programs, schemes and arrangements of Purchaser or its Affiliates, when taken
as a whole, are not comparable to those of Deutsche Bank, the Sellers or their
Affiliates in which such Non-Automatic Employee or Japan Employee
participated immediately prior to the Closing Date; and



(B) severance and redundancy benefits relating to the termination of
employment by Purchaser or its Affiliates, after the Closing and during the
three (3) year period following the Closing, of any Transferred Employee
performing services for the Business (the " _Terminated Transferred
Employees_ ") or any employee of Purchaser whose primary work function is
associated with the operations of Purchaser that are similar to the Business
and are combined with the operations of the Business on or during the three
(3) year period following the Closing (a " _Terminated Purchaser Employee_ "
and together with the Terminated Transferred Employees, the " _Terminated
Employees_ "), up to a total of 1,500 terminated employees in the aggregate
under this Section 6.17(a)(ii)(B), whether Transferred Employees or Purchaser
employees.



(iii) For purposes of Section 6.17(a)(ii)(A), following the date hereof and
within forty-five (45) days prior to the Closing Date, Deutsche Bank and
Purchaser shall cooperate to assess the comparability, taken as a whole, of
the benefit plans, programs, schemes and arrangements of Purchaser or its
Affiliates in each jurisdiction where there are Non-Automatic Employees and in
Japan, as compared to the benefit plans, programs, schemes and arrangements
of Deutsche Bank and its Affiliates in which such Non-Automatic Employees or

 

151 Japan Employees participate as of the date hereof. Unless Deutsche Bank and
Purchaser have reason to know that the Non-Automatic Employee or Japan
Employee is unable to accept the offer of employment from Purchaser or one of
its Affiliates for reasons that are unrelated to the comparability of the
benefit plans, programs, schemes or arrangements of Purchaser or its
Affiliates to those of Deutsche Bank or its Affiliates, and assuming that the
comparability results for the jurisdiction employing the Non-Automatic
Employee or Japan Employee who is rejecting PurchaserÂ’s offer result in
Deutsche Bank and Purchaser agreeing that the benefits to be provided by
Purchaser or one of its Affiliates are not comparable taken as a whole, to
those provided by Deutsche Bank and its Affiliates (taking into account any
benefit equalization payments offered by Purchaser or its Affiliates), then
for purposes of Section 6.17(a)(ii)(A), it shall be presumed that a rejecting
Non-Automatic Employee or Japan Employee has rejected PurchaserÂ’s offer based
on the lack of comparability of benefits; _provided_ , _however_ , that if a
rejecting Non-Automatic Employee or Japan Employee is retirement eligible
(whether for normal or early retirement), based on the terms and conditions of
the applicable retirement plan or policy in a jurisdiction (or if no such plan
or policy exists, entitlement to statutory benefits) it shall be presumed
that such employee rejected the offer in order to retire and not due to the
lack of comparability of PurchaserÂ’s benefits.



 

(iv) To the extent the losses, Liabilities, costs and claims payable by
Purchaser or its Affiliates under Section 6.02(b)(ii) (solely to the extent
that the losses, Liabilities, costs and claims under such section are for
severance or redundancy benefits), Section 6.03(c), Section 6.04(e) and
Sections 6.17(a)(ii)(A) and (B) in the aggregate exceed Â€70 million, Deutsche
Bank and its Affiliates shall be responsible for and indemnify Purchaser and
their respective Affiliates for 100% of the losses, Liabilities, costs and
claims of Deutsche Bank, Purchaser and their respective Affiliates for
severance and redundancy benefits in excess of Â€70 million, which are
incurred, associated with or in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the event that the number
of Terminated Employees exceeds 1,500, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be
solely responsible, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Deutsche Bank and
its Affiliates, for the severance and redundancy benefits payable to each
additional Terminated Employee (those in excess of the 1,500
person limitation). The foregoing 1,500 person limitation applies only to the
Terminated Employees and shall not prevent Purchaser or its Affiliates from
being indemnified by Deutsche Bank in accordance with this Article VI for
severance and redundancy benefits to other terminated employees who are not
Terminated Employees. Purchaser shall provide Deutsche Bank and the Sellers
with evidence of payment of severance and redundancy benefits that is
reasonably satisfactory to Deutsche Bank for those severance benefits for
which Purchaser is seeking indemnification.



(v) (A) The severance and redundancy benefits to employees whose employment
with Deutsche Bank, the Sellers or their Affiliates is terminated pursuant to
Section 6.17(a)(i) or Section 6.17(a)(ii)(A) shall be in accordance with
either (x) the severance plan or policy of Deutsche Bank, the Sellers or
their Affiliates in effect as of the Closing Date applicable to the
jurisdiction in which the terminated employee to whom the severance and
redundancy benefit is payable is employed as listed on Schedule 6.17(a)(v) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule and previously provided to Purchaser or (y) as
required by the applicable Law of the jurisdiction governing the terminated
employee to whom the severance benefit is payable. To the extent that
severance and redundancy benefits under a Deutsche Bank plan, policy or
agreement are discretionary, Deutsche Bank and Purchaser shall mutually
determine the severance and

 

152 redundancy benefits to be paid, taking into account the past practices of
Deutsche Bank and the Sellers. For all purposes in this Agreement,
the obligation of either party to pay severance and redundancy benefits
includes the obligation to pay any payments during a required notice period.



(B) The severance benefits to employees whose employment with Deutsche Bank,
the Sellers or their Affiliates is terminated pursuant to Section
6.17(a)(ii)(B) who are U.S. Transferred Employees or Terminated Purchaser
Employees employed in the U.S. shall be in accordance with the benefits
provided under the provisions of PurchaserÂ’s U.S. severance plan listed in
Section 4.10 of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule (taking into
account service with Deutsche Bank, the Sellers and their Affiliates, in
accordance with Section 6.01(c)) with changes or modifications that increase
such benefits only in the ordinary course and consistent with past
compensation practices.

 



(C) The severance and redundancy benefits to terminated employees under
Section 6.17(a)(ii)(B) who are Transferred Employees or Terminated Purchaser
Employees, in either case employed outside of the U.S., shall be, depending on
the employeeÂ’s work location, either (x) in accordance with the benefits
provided under the provisions of the applicable Purchaser non-U.S. severance
plan or policy listed in Section 4.10 of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule or
(y) as required by the applicable Law of the jurisdiction governing any
Transferred Employees or Terminated Purchaser Employees employed outside of
the U.S. in relation to redundancy payments or severance payments (taking
into account service with Deutsche Bank, the Sellers and their Affiliates, in
accordance with Section 6.12).



(b) _Payroll, Compensation and Benefit Obligations_. (i) Except as otherwise
provided in this Section 6.17(b), Deutsche Bank agrees, and shall cause the
Sellers and DB Entities to agree, to remain obligated for all payroll and
benefit obligations (including, without limitation, the satisfaction of all
payroll, tax and social insurance or withholding tax obligations) with respect
to the Business Employees due or accrued through the Closing Date, including
any change of control payments or benefits that arise as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Section 2.03(b)(iii) is hereby
confirmed, except to the extent that the employment, compensation and benefit
liabilities and obligations referred to therein represent employment,
compensation and benefit liabilities and obligations (A) under the Ireland
Pension Schemes, the Related Ireland Benefit Schemes, or the Ireland
Employee Share Scheme, which can be satisfied based on the funding levels of
such schemes as of the Closing Date, (B) that have been expressly assumed by
Purchaser pursuant to this Article VI, and for which a corresponding and
adequate accrual on the Preliminary Closing Statement of Net Assets and
Closing Statement of Net Assets has been reflected or sufficient assets have
been transferred to Purchaser or one of its Affiliates, or (C) for which
Purchaser has expressly indemnified Deutsche Bank and its Affiliates pursuant
to this Article VI.



(ii) Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, assume responsibility
for all payroll and benefit obligations (including, without limitation, the
satisfaction of all payroll, tax and social insurance or withholding tax
obligations) for the Transferred Employees with respect to their employment
or services with Purchaser or its Affiliates as of the date immediately
following the Closing Date.

 

153 (iii) Except as expressly provided for in this Article VI, neither Deutsche
Bank, the Sellers nor their Affiliates shall be responsible for losses,
Liabilities, costs or claims of Transferred Employees, in respect of their
employment with or services to Purchaser or its Affiliates following the
Closing Date, under the employee benefit plans of Purchaser or its
Affiliates.



(c) _Vacation Accruals_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law and within
the timeframes permitted by applicable Law, Deutsche Bank shall pay, or shall
cause the Sellers or DB Entities to pay, the Transferred Employees in cash for
any vacation days, paid time-off or other leave entitlements that are
accrued but unused (and not cancelled or forfeited) on or prior to the
Closing Date (" _Accrued Vacation Days_ "). To the extent that the payment of
cash in respect of the Accrued Vacation Days is not permitted by applicable
Law or would not result in Purchaser being released of the obligation to
credit a Transferred Employee for Accrued Vacation Days following the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall credit a Transferred Employee with the Accrued Vacation
Days, subject to the inclusion by Deutsche Bank on the Preliminary Closing
Statement of Net Assets and Closing Statement of Net Assets of a corresponding
liability in an amount equal to the cash liability as of the Closing Date in
respect of such assumed Accrued Vacation Days. 



(d) _Commissions and Bonuses_. (i) Deutsche Bank and the Sellers shall pay to
all Transferred Employees, and remain solely responsible for, all
commissions, bonuses (including all bonuses for a prorated portion of calendar
year 2002) and other remuneration accrued through midnight on the Closing
Date, and shall indemnify and hold Purchaser and its Affiliates harmless for
all such amounts. To the extent that the Closing Date occurs prior to the date
on which Deutsche Bank, the Sellers and the DB Entities pay annual bonuses in
respect of calendar year 2002 (the " _2002 Bonus_ ") to their employees
generally, (A) the ratio of the bonus pool for the Business to the aggregate
bonus pool for the Global Transaction Banking (" _GTB_ ") division of Deutsche
Bank and the Global Technology Operations (" _GTO_ ") division of Deutsche
Bank (the " _Ratio_ ") for calendar year 2002 will be substantially the same
as the Ratio for calendar year 2001, subject to equitable and proportionate
adjustments in such Ratio due to increases or decreases in the GTB or GTO
employee population and in the employee population of the Business Employees;
(B) Deutsche Bank and the Sellers shall determine, in their sole discretion,
those Transferred Employees who are eligible for a 2002 Bonus payment and the
amount of each such payment; and (C) subject to clauses (1) through (3) below,
Purchaser shall pay through PurchaserÂ’s or its AffiliateÂ’s payroll the 2002
Bonus on or before March 31, 2003 to the Transferred Employees in accordance
with the directions provided by Deutsche Bank, provided that (1) the requested
date of payment is not less than fifteen (15) Business Days following the
Closing Date and Purchaser has run at least one payroll in each Transferred
Employee employment location since the Closing Date, (2) Deutsche Bank and the
Sellers have previously transferred the aggregate amount of such 2002 Bonus
payments and all applicable tax and social withholding obligations, including
the employer portion of such obligations, to an account of Purchaser, and (3)
Purchaser has notice of not less than ten (10) Business Days that its
assistance in making such payments is required. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, Deutsche Bank and the Sellers shall pay any
Transferred Employee who has a guaranteed 2002 Bonus such guaranteed amount
and shall indemnify and hold Purchaser harmless for any claims of a
Transferred Employee in respect of any 2002 Bonus guarantee. With respect to
Italian Employees, the payment of any "company premium" for services

 

154 performed in 2002 and, if applicable, a portion of 2003, shall be made by
Deutsche Bank or the Sellers. 



(ii) In the event the Closing Date occurs after January 31, 2003, Deutsche
Bank and the Sellers shall be responsible for prorated bonus payments, if
any, to the Transferred Employees in respect of the period from January 1,
2003 through the Closing Date (the " _2003 Prorated Bonus_ "). Deutsche Bank
and the Sellers agree that (x) the 2003 Prorated Bonus pool for the Business
will be determined in accordance with clauses (A) and (B) of Section
6.17(d)(i), with the term "calendar year 2002" being replaced with the term
"calendar year 2003", the term "calendar year 2001" being replaced with the
term "calendar year 2002" and the term "2002 Bonus" being replaced with the
term "2003 Prorated Bonus"; and (y) the 2003 Prorated Bonus shall be paid in
accordance with and subject to the conditions of clauses (C)(1) through (3)
of Section 6.17(d)(i) above. If Deutsche Bank is required to pay the 2003
Prorated Bonus, Deutsche Bank and Purchaser agree that Purchaser shall, or
shall cause its Affiliates to, advise the designated contact at Deutsche
Bank, by no later than January 15, 2004 of any Transferred Employees whose
employment with Purchaser or one of its Affiliates was terminated during 2003
and the reason for such termination (death, disability, redundancy or other),
solely to the extent that such information was not provided to Deutsche Bank
in accordance with Section 6.17(f). In the event that the Closing Date occurs
prior to January 31, 2002, Deutsche Bank and the Sellers shall have
no responsibility to pay the 2003 Prorated Bonus.



(iii) Purchaser shall indemnify and keep indemnified Deutsche Bank, the
Sellers and their Affiliates for any losses, Liabilities, costs and claims
that they may suffer or incur as a direct result of PurchaserÂ’s failure to
make the payments of the 2002 Bonus or 2003 Prorated Bonus to the
Transferred Employees, in accordance with the allocations made by Deutsche
Bank as communicated to Purchaser, provided that all of the conditions of
clauses (C)(1) through (3) of Section 6.17(d)(i) are satisfied with respect to
the 2002 Bonus and the 2003 Prorated Bonus.



(e) _Retention_. Deutsche Bank shall remain solely responsible, and shall
indemnify and hold Purchaser and its Affiliates harmless, for any and all
payments to Transferred Employees in respect of any retention plan or
agreements of Deutsche Bank, the Sellers or the DB Entities and any retention
agreements pursuant thereto that Deutsche Bank, the Sellers or the DB
Entities entered into with a Transferred Employee on or prior to the Closing
Date. Purchaser shall assist Deutsche Bank and the Sellers in the payment of
retention amounts to the Transferred Employees that are unpaid as of the
Closing Date, subject to the provisions in clauses (C)(1) through (3) of
Section 6.17(d)(i) above, with the words "2002 Bonus payments" being replaced
with the words "retention amounts" and the date "March 31, 2003" being
replaced with "the applicable retention payment date." Except as may otherwise
be expressly agreed to between Deutsche Bank and Purchaser following the date
hereof, neither Deutsche Bank, the Sellers nor their Affiliates shall have
any obligation or responsibility for any retention plan of Purchaser or its
Affiliates or any retention agreement between Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates and a Transferred Employee.



 

(f) _Vesting of Deutsche Bank Equity and Equity-Based Awards_. All outstanding
equity and equity-based awards (the " _DB Equity Awards_ ") granted under the
equity award plans and programs of Deutsche Bank, the Sellers, the DB Entities
or their Affiliates or

 

155 under the retention plans or agreements of Deutsche Bank, the Sellers, the DB
Entities or their Affiliates to Transferred Employees shall continue to vest
(and not be forfeited solely as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) following the Closing Date, in accordance with the terms of
the applicable equity award plan or program and any future amendments thereto
(to the extent permitted by the terms of such plan or program and applicable
Law) and to the extent applicable, in accordance with the terms of the
applicable retention plan or agreement. Purchaser agrees that no later than
fifteen (15) Business Days following the termination of employment of any
Transferred Employee to whom Deutsche Bank, the Sellers, the DB Entities or
its Affiliates granted a DB Equity Award under a retention plan or agreement
of Deutsche Bank, the Sellers, the DB Entities or the Affiliates (as set
forth in the materials provided by Deutsche Bank to Purchaser), Purchaser
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide written notice to Deutsche
Bank and the Sellers of the date on which such Transferred EmployeeÂ’s
employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates terminated, the reason for such
termination (which shall be categorized as due to redundancy, death,
disability or other), provided such termination from the Purchaser or its
Affiliates occurs on or prior to the final retention payment date, as
communicated by Deutsche Bank to Purchaser. Deutsche Bank shall designate one
contact to whom Purchaser shall provide the required information. Deutsche
Bank shall remain solely responsible for the satisfaction of any Liabilities
(including the satisfaction of all payroll tax and social insurance or
withholding tax obligations) in respect of the DB Equity Awards held by the
Transferred Employees. For avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section
6.17(f) do not apply to the Ireland Employee Share Participation Scheme, which
is addressed separately in Section 6.09(c) of this Agreement.



 

(g) _Liabilities Under Deutsche Bank Benefit Plans_. Except as otherwise
provided in this Article VI, including, without limitation, the exception for
negligent or unlawful acts or omissions of Purchaser set forth in the proviso
contained in Section 6.09(d) and the employment, compensation and benefit
liabilities and obligations referenced in Section 6.17(b)(i)(A)-(C), Deutsche
Bank undertakes to indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates against all
Liabilities and expenses that it may suffer or incur in relation to any claim
under the Deutsche Bank Benefit Plans brought by or in respect of any Business
Employee in respect of any period of employment or service with Deutsche Bank
and its Affiliates prior to, or on, the Closing Date.



(h) _Reservation of Rights; No Third Party Rights_. Subject to applicable
Law, nothing contained in this Agreement shall restrict the ability of
Purchaser or its Affiliates to terminate the employment of any Transferred
Employee for any reason at any time after the effective date of his or her
employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates. Subject to applicable Law,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall require Purchaser or its Affiliates
to maintain any specific benefit plan or other compensation or employee
benefit plan, program, policy or practice following the Closing Date. No
provision of this Agreement shall create any third party beneficiary rights in
any Business Employee or any beneficiary or dependent thereof.



(i) _Immigration Status of Business Employees_. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, PurchaserÂ’s or its AffiliatesÂ’ offer of
employment on the Closing Date to a Business Employee whose work immigration,
work paper or visa status is such that it is not legal for the Business
Employee (an " _Expatriate Business Employee_ ") to commence active
employment with Purchaser on the Closing Date shall be conditioned on such
Expatriate Business Employee being able to commence active employment with
Purchaser or its Affiliates

 

156 during the three-month period following the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing
Date and during the three-month period thereafter, Purchaser, Deutsche Bank
and the Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enable any
Expatriate Business Employees to commence active employment with Purchaser or
its Affiliates on the Closing Date or during the three-month period
thereafter, and during the period of up to three months after the Closing
Date, Deutsche Bank and the Sellers shall continue to employ any Expatriate
Business Employees. To the extent that any such immigration, work paper or
visa problems cannot be resolved prior to the three month anniversary of the
Closing Date, PurchaserÂ’s offer of employment to any such Expatriate Business
Employee shall be withdrawn without the need for further action.

 



(j) _Cooperation_. Deutsche Bank, the DB Entities, Sellers and Purchaser shall
each cooperate reasonably to effectuate the provisions and intent of this
Article VI. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Deutsche Bank,
the Sellers, the DB Entities (to the extent applicable) and Purchaser agree
that:



(i) Following the date hereof, Deutsche Bank shall, and shall cause the
Sellers and DB Entities to, provide Purchaser with periodic updates of
Section 3.15(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, and, as soon as
practicable following such times as the disclosure of any such information is
no longer prohibited by the Data Protection Laws, shall provide Purchaser with
the information set forth on Section 3.15(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule on a non-redacted basis. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, Purchaser or one
of its Affiliates shall not be required to offer employment to any Business
Employee, unless Purchaser receives the data requested pursuant to Section
3.15(a) either on the date hereof or within twenty (20) days (or such shorter
period solely to the extent a Business EmployeeÂ’s consent cannot be obtained,
but in no event less than five (5) Business Days) prior to the date offers
must be made by Purchaser or one of its Affiliates pursuant to Section
6.01(a)(i), 6.11 or 6.12 or on the date on which Purchaser or one of its
Affiliates must comply with its information or consultation obligations under
the Transfer Provisions (it being understood that Purchaser shall not be
considered to be in breach of this Article VI or have an indemnity obligation
to Deutsche Bank in respect of PurchaserÂ’s employment offer, information or
consultation obligations, if PurchaserÂ’s failure is due to Deutsche BankÂ’s or
the SellersÂ’ failure to comply with Section 3.15(a) or this Section
6.17(j)(i)).



(ii) Prior to the Closing Date, Deutsche Bank, the DB Entities, the Sellers
and Purchaser shall each cooperate reasonably to communicate information
regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to Business
Employees or their representatives. Deutsche Bank, the DB Entities and the
Sellers undertake to lend all reasonable assistance to Purchaser and
its Affiliates in distributing communications on PurchaserÂ’s behalf to the
Business Employees before the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, Deutsche Bank shall not, and shall cause the Sellers,
the DB Entities and their Affiliates not to, make any representations,
distribute any communications or discuss, at any time, the benefits to be
provided by Purchaser or its Affiliates after the Closing Date without
PurchaserÂ’s prior consent in writing. 

 

157 (iii) Prior to the Closing Date, Deutsche Bank and Purchaser shall, to the
extent permitted under applicable Laws and their respective confidentiality
undertakings, each reasonably cooperate to identify certain other employees of
Deutsche Bank, Sellers and the DB Entities and their Affiliates who
perform support functions for the Business (including those employees who
perform the support functions set forth on Section 6.17(j)(iii) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule) who upon mutual agreement of Purchaser and Deutsche Bank
shall be offered employment by Purchaser or one of its Affiliates effective
as of the Closing Date. To the extent any such additional employees are
mutually agreed upon by Purchaser and Deutsche Bank, Deutsche Bank shall
provide a supplement to, and will add such employeesÂ’ details to, the
appropriate sections of Section 3.15(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.
Upon the addition of any such employee to the supplemental Section 3.15(a) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, for purposes of this Agreement, such employee
shall be considered a Business Employee and shall be treated in a similar
manner as similarly situated Business Employees are treated under this Article
VI.



(iv) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, subject to
the applicable Data Protection Laws, Deutsche Bank shall or shall cause
the applicable Sellers to provide to Purchaser membership data with respect
to Hong Kong Employees, Cayman Employees, Australian Employees, Austrian
Employees, Luxembourg Employees, Switzerland Employees, Netherlands Employees
and Jersey Employees;  _provided_ that Purchaser specifies in writing the
information it seeks.



(k) _Deferred Closing Date_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, PurchaserÂ’s offer of employment to, or offer to continue the
employment of (if required by applicable Law) the Business Employees of a
Deferred Business shall be further conditioned upon the occurrence of the
Deferred Closing with respect to such Deferred Business. For purposes of
Section 6.17(d), the references therein to any calendar year shall be adjusted
to reflect the Deferred Closing Date, and Deutsche BankÂ’s and the SellersÂ’
obligations under Section 6.17(d) shall continue as so adjusted. For purposes
of any accrual, measurement or valuation of benefit entitlements, obligations
or liabilities under this Agreement, the Deferred Closing Date shall be
the relevant date for the determination of any such accrual, measurement or
valuation of such benefits and, to the extent any such valuation requires
actuarial assumptions and the assumptions otherwise set forth in this
Agreement are out of date, Deutsche Bank and Purchaser shall mutually agree
to such assumptions.

Decree No. 472 of December 18, 1997, or (C) pursuant to Section 767A or 767AA
of the UK ICTA, but not including any Taxes arising as a consequence of any
failure by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing Date, the DB Entities) to discharge any primary liability for Taxes
that become due and payable after the Closing Date; provided that Deutsche
Bank and its Affiliates shall not be "primarily liable" as described above in

period commencing on or after the Closing Date, the DB Entities); (vii) with
respect to any period (or portion thereof) that ends on or before the Closing

any liability of any DB Entity for the payment of any amount arising as the

(2) No indemnity shall be provided by Deutsche Bank under this Agreement for
any Taxes (i) resulting from any act, transaction or omission of the DB
Entities or involving

 

159 the Purchased Assets or the Business occurring after the Closing that is not
in the ordinary course of business; (ii) attributable to the PurchaserÂ’s
failure to satisfy any of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement; (iii)
attributable to (A) elections made or, where the making of such election was
(a) taken into account or assumed in computing any provision or reserve for

Affiliates (including the DB Entities), and (B) elections under Sections
338(g) or 338(h)(10) of the Code, (iv) in the case of the United Kingdom or
the Republic of Ireland, attributable to a change in legislation (whether
relating to Taxes or otherwise), court decisions at any level, generally
published practice of any relevant taxing authority, or accounting basis or
policy (or, unless required by applicable Law and not attributable to a change
in Law after the Closing Date, any basis or policy used in calculating Taxes
or preparing Tax Returns) of any DB Entity or relating to the Purchased
Assets or the Business, in any case after the Closing Date; (v) subject to
Schedule 7.08, Taxes for which Deutsche Bank or the Seller is not liable under
Section 7.08; and (vi) any Taxes directly imposed on the Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates, the DB Entities, or with respect to the Purchased Assets or
the Business, for or with respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof)
that begins after the Closing Date, other than as provided for in Section
7.01(a)(1)(vi). The Purchaser shall be responsible for and shall indemnify and
hold Deutsche Bank and its Affiliates harmless against all Taxes imposed on or
payable by the DB Entities or with respect to the Purchased Assets or the
Business and not allocated to Deutsche Bank pursuant to this Section 7.01,
and any Damages arising from or in connection with any breach of the
obligations of the Purchaser under this Article VII (including under Schedule
7.08).



(b) In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a taxable period
that begins before the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date, the
portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion of the taxable period
ending on the Closing Date shall be:



(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related to income
or receipts or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible) including,
without limitation, any transfer or disposition by any of the DB Entities of
any assets (including interests in entities) that will not be acquired by the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement (other than
conveyances pursuant to this Agreement, as provided under Section 7.08), or
the execution of any documents, equal to the amount which would be payable
(after giving effect to amounts arising during the portion of the
taxable year ending on the Closing Date which may be deducted from or offset
against such Taxes) if the taxable period (and the taxable period of any
entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for Tax purposes in which any
DB Entity is a partner) ended on the Closing Date; and



(ii) in the case of other Taxes the amount of such Taxes for the
entire period (after giving effect to amounts which may be deducted from or
offset against such Taxes) (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an
arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period),
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the number of calendar days in the entire period. Any credit or refund
resulting from an overpayment of Taxes shall be prorated based upon the
method

 

160 employed in the immediately preceding sentence. In the case of any Tax based
upon or measured by capital (including net worth or long-term debt) or
intangibles, any amount thereof required to be allocated under this Section
7.01(b) shall be computed by reference to the level of such items on the
Closing Date. All determinations necessary to effect the
foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior
practice of the Sellers of the DB Entities.



(c) Subject to Section 7.04, payment by the indemnifying party of any amount
due under this Section 7.01 shall be made within ten days following written
notice by the indemnified party that payment of such amounts is due, provided
that if the indemnified party is required to make a payment to a Governmental
Authority, the indemnifying party shall not be required to make any payment
earlier than two days before such payment is due. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, if Deutsche Bank receives an assessment or other notice
of Taxes due with respect to any DB Entity for any taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date (other than Taxes of any affiliated, combined,
consolidated or unitary or similar group which included the DB Entities) for
which Deutsche Bank is not responsible, in whole or in part, pursuant to
paragraph (a) of this Section 7.01, then Deutsche Bank shall promptly notify
the Purchaser and the Purchaser shall pay such Taxes, or if Deutsche Bank
pays such Taxes, then the Purchaser or the DB Entities shall pay to Deutsche
Bank the amount of such Taxes for which Deutsche Bank is not responsible
within 5 days following the later of the receipt of notification or payment by
Deutsche Bank. In the case of a Tax that is contested in accordance with the
provisions of Section 7.04, payment of the Tax to the appropriate Governmental
Authority will be considered to be due no earlier than the date a final
determination to such effect is made by the appropriate Governmental
Authority or court.



SECTION 7.02. _Tax Refunds and Tax Benefits_. (a) Any Tax refund, credit or
similar benefit (including any interest paid or credited with respect thereto)
relating to taxable periods or portions thereof ending on or before the
Closing Date that is not reflected as an asset in the final Closing Statement
of Net Assets shall be the property of Deutsche Bank, and if received by the
Purchaser or any DB Entity, shall be paid over promptly to Deutsche Bank. The
Purchaser shall, if Deutsche Bank so requests and at Deutsche BankÂ’s
expense (including, without limitation, allocable Purchaser personnel costs
and overhead charges), cause the relevant entity to file for and use
reasonable best efforts to obtain and expedite the receipt of any refund to
which Deutsche Bank is entitled under this Section 7.02. The Purchaser shall
permit Deutsche Bank to participate in (at Deutsche BankÂ’s expense) the
prosecution of any such refund claim. Any other Tax refund, credit or similar
benefit (including any interest paid or credited with respect thereto) with
respect to the DB Entities or the Business shall be the property of the
Purchaser, and if received by Deutsche Bank or any of its Affiliates or set-
off against any Taxes for which Deutsche Bank is liable by virtue of Section
7.01(a), shall be paid over promptly to the Purchaser.



(b) Any amount otherwise payable by Deutsche Bank under Section 7.01 shall be
reduced by any Tax benefit to the Purchaser, its Affiliates or the DB Entities
that arose in connection with any underlying adjustment resulting in the
obligation of the Purchaser or a DB Entity to pay Taxes or other amounts for
which Deutsche Bank is responsible under Section 7.01 or the payment of such
Taxes (such as a timing adjustment resulting in a Tax deduction for a DB
Entity for a period after the Closing Date), and increased by any Tax cost to
the Purchaser, its

 

161 Affiliates or the DB Entities resulting from the receipt of such payment, and
in each case actually realized through a reduction or increase in Taxes
otherwise payable.



SECTION 7.03. _Tax Covenants_. (a) Subject to Section 7.07, neither the
Purchaser nor any Affiliate of the Purchaser shall amend, refile or otherwise
modify, or cause or permit the DB Entities to amend, refile or otherwise
modify any election or Tax Return relating in whole or in part to the DB
Entities, the Business or any of the Purchased Assets with respect to any
taxable period, or portion thereof, ending on or before the Closing Date
without the prior written consent of Deutsche Bank, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, in each case if doing so could reasonably be expected
to adversely affect Deutsche Bank.



(b) Subject to Section 7.06, Deutsche Bank and its Affiliates shall be
responsible for (i) the collection and appropriate deposit of any withholding
Taxes related to the Business with respect to customer payments occurring in a
taxable period (or portion thereof) that ends on or before the Closing Date
(the "Stub Period Withholding Obligation") and (ii) the filing of any
withholding Tax deposit coupons or any Tax Return and the mailing of any
related notice to any customer relating to the Stub Withholding Obligation
(the "Stub Filing Obligation") and the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be
responsible for the collection and appropriate deposit of any withholding
Taxes other than those that are the subject of the Stub Withholding Obligation
and all filings and mailings in respect of any payment or transaction other
than the Stub Filing Obligation.



SECTION 7.04.  _Contests_. (a) After Closing, the Purchaser shall promptly
notify Deutsche Bank in writing of the proposed assessment or the commencement
of any Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding or of any demand or
claim on the Purchaser or a DB Entity which, if determined adversely to the
taxpayer or after the lapse of time, could reasonably be expected to be
grounds for indemnification by Deutsche Bank under Section 7.01. Such notice
shall contain factual information (to the extent known to the Purchaser or a
DB Entity) describing the asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and
shall include copies of any notice or other document received from any
Governmental Authority in respect of any such asserted Tax liability. If
the Purchaser fails to give Deutsche Bank prompt notice of an asserted Tax
liability as required by this Section 7.04, then Deutsche Bank shall not have
any obligation to indemnify for any loss arising out of such asserted Tax
liability, to the extent the failure to give such notice resulted in a
detriment to Deutsche Bank.



(b) In the case of a Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding (a "
_Contest_ ") that relates to periods ending on or before the Closing Date,
Deutsche Bank shall have the sole right, at its expense, to control the
conduct of such Contest; provided, however, that (i) Deutsche Bank shall
consult with the Purchaser before taking any significant action in connection
with such Contest if such Contest could adversely affect the Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates following the Closing Date, and (ii) Deutsche Bank shall
not settle, compromise or abandon such Contest, if such action would adversely
affect the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, without obtaining the prior
written consent of the Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. 



(c) With respect to periods beginning before the Closing Date and ending after
the Closing Date, the Controlling Party shall have the sole right, at its
expense, to control

 

162 the conduct of such Contest; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) that the
Controlling Party shall provide the Non-controlling Party with a timely and
reasonably detailed account of each phase of the Contest, (ii) the Controlling
Party shall consult with the Non-controlling Party before taking any
significant action in connection with such Contest, (iii) the Controlling
Party shall consult with the Non-controlling Party and offer the Non-
controlling Party an opportunity to comment before submitting any written
materials prepared or furnished in connection with such Contest, (iv) the
Controlling Party shall defend such Contest diligently and in good faith as
if it were the only party in interest in connection with such Contest, (v) the
Non-controlling Party shall be entitled to participate in such Contest, at its
own expense, if such Contest could have an adverse impact on the Non-
controlling Party or any of its Affiliates, and (vi) the Controlling Party
shall not settle, compromise or abandon such Contest without obtaining the
prior written consent of the Non-controlling Party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed, if such settlement, compromise or
abandonment could have an adverse impact on the Non-controlling Party or any
of its Affiliates. " _Controlling Party_ " shall mean whichever of Deutsche
Bank or its Affiliates or the Purchaser or its Affiliates is reasonably
expected to bear the greater Tax liability in connection with a Contest for
periods beginning before and ending after the Closing Date, and "Non-
controlling Party" shall mean whichever of Deutsche Bank or its Affiliates or
the Purchaser or its Affiliates is not the Controlling Party with respect to
such Contest.



(d) The Purchaser shall have the right to control, at its own expense, any
Contest (other than any Contest described in Section 7.04(b) or (c));
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Purchaser shall consult with Deutsche
Bank before taking any significant action in connection with such Contest if
such Contest could adversely affect Deutsche Bank or any of its Affiliates
following the Closing Date, and (ii) the Purchaser shall not settle,
compromise or abandon such Contest, if such action would adversely affect
Deutsche Bank or any of its Affiliates, without obtaining the prior written
consent of Deutsche Bank, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.



(e) The Purchaser and Deutsche Bank agree to cooperate, and the Purchaser
agrees to cause the DB Entities to cooperate, in the defense against or
compromise of any claim in any Contest that relates to a taxable period that
ends on or before or includes the Closing Date.



SECTION 7.05. _Preparation of Tax Returns_. (a) Deutsche Bank shall cause the
DB Entities to prepare and file all Tax Returns relating to the DB Entities
for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date. 



(b) The Purchaser shall prepare, or cause the DB Entities to prepare, any Tax
Returns that relate to the DB Entities for taxable periods ending after the
Closing Date, it being understood that all Taxes indicated as due and payable
on such Tax Returns shall be the responsibility of the Purchaser, except for
such Taxes which are the responsibility of Deutsche Bank pursuant to Section
7.01 which Deutsche Bank shall pay in accordance with this Article VII. With
respect to any Tax Return required to be filed with respect to the DB Entities
for a taxable period that includes the Closing Date, the Purchaser agrees to
act in good faith in reporting the Tax items of the DB Entities and not to
cause the DB Entities to claim any deduction, refund, or credit in a manner
inconsistent with a prior taxable period, except as may be required
pursuant to applicable Law or pursuant to a "determination" under Section
1313(a) of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or non-U.S.
law). With respect to any Tax

 

163 Return required to be filed with respect to the DB Entities, after the Closing
Date and as to which Taxes are allocable to Deutsche Bank under Section 7.01
hereof, the Purchaser shall provide Deutsche Bank and its authorized
representative with a copy of such completed Tax Return and a statement (with
which the Purchaser will make available supporting schedules and information)
certifying the amount of Tax shown on such Tax Return that is allocable to
Deutsche Bank pursuant to Article VII hereof at least 30 days prior to the due
date (including any extension thereof) for filing of such Tax Return, and
Deutsche Bank and its authorized representative shall have the right to
review and comment on such Tax Return and statement prior to the filing of
such Tax Return. Deutsche Bank and the Purchaser agree to consult and to
attempt in good faith to resolve any issues arising as a result of the review
of such Tax Return and statement by Deutsche Bank or its authorized
representative.



SECTION 7.06. _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. Deutsche Bank and
the Purchaser shall provide each other with such cooperation and information
as either of them reasonably may request of the other in filing any Tax
Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, determining a liability for
Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes or participating in or conducting any
audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes. Such cooperation and
information shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or
portions thereof, together with related work papers and documents relating to
rulings or other determinations by Governmental Authorities and any other
materials relating to the Purchased Assets or the Business or the DB Entities
(to the extent such documents are available as of the date hereof or become
available hereafter) that might be relevant to Tax matters. Each party shall
make its employees reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide explanations of any documents or information provided hereunder.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.02 hereof but subject to
Section 7.08, each party shall retain all Tax Returns, work papers and all
material records or other documents relating to Tax matters of the DB
Entities, the Purchased Assets, and the Business (to the extent such documents
are available as of the date hereof or become available hereafter) for the
taxable period that includes the Closing Date and for all prior taxable
periods until the later of (a) the expiration of the statute of limitations of
the taxable periods which such Tax Returns and other documents relate, without
regard to extensions except to the extent notified by the other party in
writing of such extensions for the respective Tax periods or (b) eight years
following the due date (without extension) for such Tax Returns; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that a party shall not dispose of any such materials if at least
90 Business Days before the later of the end of either of the periods
described in clauses (a) or (b) the other party has notified the disposing
party of its desire to review such material in which case such other party
shall be given an opportunity, at its cost and expense, to remove and retain
all or any part of such materials. Any information obtained under this Section
7.06 shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in
conducting an audit or other proceeding.



SECTION 7.07. _Group Relief_. Subject to the applicable Law, in respect of
any taxable period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date,
the Purchaser shall cause the Irish DB Entities and the U.K. DB Entity to
surrender to, or as the case may be, accept the surrender from, Deutsche Bank
or any of its Affiliates amounts by way of "group relief" within the meaning
of Section 402 of UK ICTA or sections 420, 420A and 420B of the Taxes
Consolidation Act of 1997 of the Republic of Ireland (as appropriate) to the
extent that Deutsche Bank may, in its absolute discretion, direct in writing
and the company accepting the surrender

 

164 may utilize the same. The amount of group relief available for surrender to or
by the Irish DB Entities or the U.K. DB Entity shall be determined by
Deutsche Bank, subject to applicable Law. Except as provided below, the
company accepting the surrender (the "Claimant Company") shall pay a
percentage, equal to the relevant applicable rate of corporation tax for
the accounting period in question, of the amount surrendered to the company
making the surrender (the "Surrendering Company") in accordance with Deutsche
BankÂ’s normal practice for the timing of such payments and Deutsche Bank in
this regard agrees to act in good faith (but in any event payment shall be
made no later than the date on which the Claimant CompanyÂ’s corporate Tax
Return for the accounting period to which the surrender relates is required to
be filed, or, if later, the date falling five (5) Business Days after demand
by the Surrendering Company); _provided, however_ , that no payment shall be
required to be made by a Claimant Company where (a) the Surrendering Company
is the UK DB Entity and (b) the extent to which the aggregate amount
surrendered (not being losses which are reflected as an asset in the Closing
Statement of Net Assets or taken into account in computing any provision for
Taxes in the Closing Statement of Net Assets) by the UK DB Entity to Deutsche
Bank and its Affiliates pursuant to this Section 7.07 is equal to or less than
the aggregate amount of the increase in the shareholder funds of the UK DB
Entity (whether by way of capital contribution or waiver or forgiveness
of debt by Deutsche Bank or its Affiliates) in the accounting periods of the
UK DB Entity commencing on or after January 1, 2002, but on or before the
Closing Date. Deutsche Bank may mitigate or eliminate any liability it may
have under Section 7.01 by Deutsche Bank surrendering or causing the
surrender to the relevant Irish DB Entity or the U.K. DB Entity of group
relief; _provided_ that where Deutsche Bank elects to do so such DB Entity
shall not be obliged to make any payment for such surrender and Deutsche Bank
shall be absolved from such liability to the extent of the amount of Tax
relieved by any such surrender. Subject to applicable Law, the Purchaser shall
cause the relevant Irish DB Entity or the U.K. DB Entity to make all such
claims and elections, and comply with all procedural requirements in respect
of the making or giving of any claims, elections, returns, or consents as
Deutsche Bank may direct in writing in order to give effect to any such
surrender. If any amount surrendered under this Section 7.07 shall not be
allowed to the Claimant Company, such claims, elections, or returns shall be
amended and any payment for the surrender refunded accordingly.



SECTION 7.08. _Conveyance Taxes_. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision
under this Article VII (including Section 7.08), the following shall apply
with respect to Conveyance Taxes, including, but not limited to, VAT. The
Purchaser shall be liable for, shall hold Deutsche Bank and its Affiliates
harmless against and agrees to pay any Conveyance Taxes. The Purchaser
and Deutsche Bank agree to cooperate in the execution and delivery of all
instruments and certificates necessary to enable Deutsche Bank and/or the
Purchaser to comply with any pre-Closing or post-Closing filing and other
legal requirements with respect to Conveyance Taxes.



(b) _VAT_. (i) In this Agreement, except as otherwise provided herein, the
amount of any payment for a supply of goods or services or the value of any
supply (including the value of any supply referred to in calculating any sum
due under this Agreement) made or deemed to be made by Deutsche Bank or any
Seller pursuant to this Agreement shall be taken to be exclusive of VAT
properly chargeable on the supply and the amount of such VAT shall be paid in
addition to any payment due under this Agreement or, if no payment is due,
shall be paid at the time the supply is made or a proper VAT invoice is
issued whichever is earlier. The

 

165 Parties intend that the Purchased Assets and the Business shall, wherever
possible, be sold as a going concern for the purposes of VAT and, in each
jurisdiction where it considers this possible Deutsche Bank or the relevant
Seller, and the Purchaser or the relevant Purchasing Subsidiary shall use all
reasonable efforts to secure that any applicable conditions are fulfilled so
that the sale of the Purchased Assets and the Business hereunder is properly
treated as neither a supply of goods nor a supply of services for the purposes
of VAT where the jurisdiction in which the Purchased Assets and the Business
are located has given effect to Article 5(8) of the EEC Sixth Directive
(77/388/EEC) or ensure that any similar or analogous treatment or relief is
obtained in other relevant jurisdictions. Deutsche Bank or the relevant Seller
and the Purchaser shall give notice of such sale to any relevant Governmental
Authority as required by applicable Law.



(ii) Except as provided below, Deutsche Bank or the relevant Seller shall
deliver to the Purchaser, but only where required by applicable Law, all the
relevant VAT records relating to the Purchased Assets and the Business. The
Purchaser and, as the case may be, Deutsche Bank or the relevant Seller,
shall undertake to preserve any VAT records relating to the Purchased Assets
and the Business in such a manner and for such period as may be required by
applicable Law and will allow the other party, upon reasonable notice,
reasonable access and copies of such records where reasonably required by
such party for their Tax purposes and will produce information from these
records to the relevant other party and/or any relevant Governmental Authority
if such other parties reasonably require it for their Tax purposes. The
Parties intend, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, that Deutsche Bank
and / or the relevant Seller shall retain the VAT records relating to the
Purchased Assets and the Business located in the United Kingdom (other than
VAT records relating to the Business carried on by the U.K. DB Entity) and the
VAT records relating to the Purchased Assets and the Business located in such
other jurisdictions (other than VAT Records relating to any DB Entity that
is not a member of any VAT group or VAT reporting group) as Deutsche Bank may
notify to the Purchaser in writing ten (10) Business Days before Closing (the
"Retained VAT Records") and accordingly:



(A) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither
Deutsche Bank nor the relevant Seller shall be required to deliver to the
Purchaser any Retained VAT Records; and



(B) Deutsche Bank confirms that where required by applicable Law, it and / or
the relevant Seller shall apply to the relevant Governmental Authority and
obtain a direction that all Retained VAT Records may be retained by Deutsche
Bank and / or the relevant Seller; 



and DB and / or the relevant Seller undertake to preserve those records in
such a manner and for such periods as may be required by applicable Law or
Section 7.06 (whichever is the longer) and, without limitation to the
PurchaserÂ’s rights under Section 7.06, to give to the Purchaser and its
Affiliates and agents from and after the Closing Date reasonable access
during normal business hours to such Retained VAT Records.



(iii) In the event that Deutsche Bank or the relevant Seller decides that the
sale of the Purchased Assets and the Business in a particular jurisdiction
cannot be treated as a going concern (or similar) for the purposes of VAT or
any Governmental Authority determines that

 

166 VAT is chargeable on the sale of any of the Purchased Assets and the Business
hereunder, then Deutsche Bank or the relevant Seller shall immediately notify
the Purchaser of such decision or determination and the Purchaser shall
(against production by Deutsche Bank or the relevant Seller of VAT invoices in
respect thereof) pay the amount of such VAT plus any interest payable
thereon forthwith to Deutsche Bank or the relevant Seller as applicable but
such payment shall be without prejudice to the right of the Purchaser under
this Agreement to call upon Deutsche Bank or the relevant Seller to make or
join an appeal against the aforesaid determination subject to the provisions
of clause (iv) below.



(iv) The Purchaser, after consultation with Deutsche Bank or the relevant
Seller, may, within ten days of notification by Deutsche Bank or the relevant
Seller of a determination having been made by a Governmental Authority,
dispute that determination or request Deutsche Bank or the relevant Seller to
dispute or join with the Purchaser or any other person in disputing that
determination including the making of a formal appeal to any applicable VAT
tribunal or judicial body and/or any such higher court of Law as may be
required to reach a decision on the dispute. The principles set out in
paragraph 11 of Schedule 7.08 shall apply in relation to any such dispute or
appeal.



(v) All VAT payable in respect of goods and services supplied or deemed to be
supplied by Deutsche Bank or the relevant Seller in connection with the
Purchased Assets and the Business prior to Closing, and all interest payable
thereon and penalties attributable thereto, shall be paid to the relevant
Governmental Authority by Deutsche Bank or the relevant Seller, and Deutsche
Bank or the relevant Seller shall be entitled to receive and to retain for
its own benefit all reimbursement or credit for any VAT borne by it on goods
and services supplied to the Business prior to Closing and any payments
received in respect of VAT overpaid prior thereto.



(c) _Adjustment of Purchase Price for Irrecoverable Conveyance Taxes_. The
provisions of Sections 7.08(a) and (b) above are subject to the provisions of
Schedule 7.08.



SECTION 7.09. _Miscellaneous_. (a) For Tax purposes, any reference in this
Agreement to an indemnity in respect of a liability for Tax of, imposed on or
payable by a U.K. DB Entity or an Irish DB Entity are agreed to be construed
as references to a covenant between the Purchaser (for itself and on behalf of
the relevant Purchasing Subsidiary) and Deutsche Bank (for itself and on
behalf of the relevant Sellers) to pay to the relevant Purchasing Subsidiary
party an amount equal to such liability and the parties agree to treat all
indemnity payments made under this Article VII, under any other indemnity
provisions contained in this Agreement, and for any misrepresentations or
breaches of warranties or covenants, as adjustments to the Purchase Price,
unless otherwise required by applicable Law. 



(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Article VII shall be
the sole provisions governing indemnities for Taxes under this Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the indemnification
provisions in this Article VII shall not be subject to the conditions and
limitations set forth in Article IX.



(c) For purposes of this Article VII, all references to the Purchaser, the
Purchasing Subsidiaries, Deutsche Bank, the Sellers and the DB Entities
include successors and

 

167 predecessors and (ii) with respect to any Deferred Closing, any reference to
"Closing" or to "Closing Date" shall be deemed to be a reference to the
Deferred Closing or Deferred Closing Date, respectively.



(d) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
covenants and agreements of the parties hereto contained in this Article VII
shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force and effect until the
expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations for the Taxes in
question (taking into account any extensions or waivers thereof).



(e) Deutsche Bank shall be entitled to make all payments required to be made
pursuant to any intercompany Tax sharing agreement prior to Closing (save in
respect of the Irish DB Entities and the UK DB Entity, which agreements shall
be governed by the provisions of Section 7.07). Except where the provisions
of Section 7.07 apply in respect of the Irish DB Entities and the UK DB
Entity, all intercompany Tax sharing agreements with respect to or involving
the DB Entities shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and will
thereafter have no further effect for any taxable year period, and any
payments required by such Tax sharing agreements will be made prior to the
termination thereof.



(f) Payments by Deutsche Bank under this Article VII shall be limited to the
amount of any Liabilities or Damages that remain after deducting therefrom any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually recovered by the
Purchaser, any DB Entity or any Affiliates of Purchaser from any third party
with respect thereto.



SECTION 7.10. _Section 338(h)(10) Election_. (a) At PurchaserÂ’s election,
Deutsche Bank and the Purchaser shall jointly make (or shall cause their
respective Affiliates jointly to make) timely and irrevocable elections under
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and if permissible, similar elections under any
applicable state or local income tax laws for each U.S. DB Entity with respect
to which such an election is permitted under applicable Law. Deutsche Bank,
the Purchaser and their respective Affiliates shall, report the transactions
consistent with such elections under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code or any
similar state, local or foreign tax provision (the " _Elections_ ") and shall
take no position contrary thereto unless and to the extent required to do so
pursuant to a "determination" (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code or
any similar state, local or foreign tax provision).



(b) The Purchaser shall be responsible for preparing drafts of all forms,
attachments and schedules necessary to effectuate the Elections (including,
without limitation, Internal Revenue Service Form 8023 and any similar forms
under applicable state or local income tax laws (the "Section 338 Forms"). The
Section 338 Forms shall be prepared consistent with the allocation of the
Purchaser Price pursuant to Section 2.04(b). Within 30 calendar days after
making the Election, the Purchaser shall provide to Deutsche Bank a copy of
the relevant Section 338 Forms, for its review. Deutsche Bank and the
Purchaser will endeavor in good faith to resolve any disputes with respect to
the Section 338 Forms. If Deutsche Bank and the Purchaser cannot agree upon
the final form and content of such Section 338 Forms, any disagreement with
respect to such Section 338 Forms shall be resolved within 30 calendar days
(and in no event later than at least 10 calendar days before the last day for
filing such Section 338 Forms) by the Independent Accounting Firm. The Section
338 Forms shall be revised to reflect the resolution of the Independent
Accounting Firm and, once revised, shall be final and

 

168 binding on all Parties without any further adjustment. The costs, expenses and
fees of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Deutsche
Bank and the Purchaser. Once such Section 338 Forms are final and no later
than the last date for filing of such Section 338 Forms, Deutsche Bank and the
Purchaser shall execute such Section 338 Forms, and the Purchaser shall file
such Section 338 Forms with the applicable Governmental Authority.



(c) Purchaser and Deutsche Bank agree that none of them shall, or shall
permit any of their Affiliates to, take any action to modify the Section 338
Forms following the execution thereof, or to modify or revoke the Elections
following the filing of the Section 338 Forms, without the written consent of
the Purchaser and Deutsche Bank, as the case may be.



(d) Except as otherwise required by applicable Law or pursuant to a
"determination" under Section 1313(a) of the Code or any similar provision of
state, local or non-U.S. law). Purchaser and Deutsche Bank shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, file all Tax Returns in a
manner consistent with the information contained in the Section 338 Forms.



(e) On or prior to 15 calendar days before the SellerÂ’s due date of its Tax
Return (without giving effect extensions), Purchaser or the relevant
Purchasing Subsidiary shall pay to the relevant Seller as additional Purchase
Price such amount, if any, as shall equal the excess of (A) the amount of
federal, state and local Taxes incurred as a result of the deemed sale of
assets of the U.S. DB Entities, pursuant to the Election over (B) the amount
of federal, state and local Taxes that would have been incurred by Seller
solely as a result of the transactions in which the Shares actually being
sold were sold without making the Election.

INDEMNIFICATION



SECTION 9.01. _Survival of Representations and Warranties; Exclusive
Remedies_. The representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement or
any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall survive for a period of two
years following the Closing Date. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, from and after the Closing (except in cases of common law fraud),
the sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of any representation or warranty
shall be pursuant to Section 9.02; it being understood that the foregoing
shall not affect

 

171 the availability of indemnification under clauses (i) through (iv) of Section
9.02(a) or under clauses (ii) through (iii) of Section 9.02(b) in the event a
matter for which indemnification is available thereunder may also constitute a
breach of a representation or warranty.



SECTION 9.02. _Indemnification_. (a) From and after the Closing, Deutsche Bank
(acting for itself and on behalf of each Seller in relation to the Shares
and/or Purchased Assets to be sold by the relevant Sellers) shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Purchaser and its Affiliates and their respective
officers, directors, employees and agents and the heirs, executors and assigns
of the foregoing (" _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any
Liabilities, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, disbursements and deficiencies
(including any interest, penalties, legal, accounting and other costs and
expenses incurred in the investigation, collection, prosecution and defense
of any action, suit, proceeding or claim and amounts paid in settlement
thereof and including any of the foregoing related to the enforcement of this
Agreement, but excluding any consequential, indirect or punitive damage
unless such consequential, indirect or punitive damages are awarded against
any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or Deutsche Bank Indemnified Parties
in a third party claim or, with respect to a direct claim, in cases of common
law fraud) (collectively, " _Damages_ ") actually incurred by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties arising from or in connection with (i) any inaccuracy in
any representation or the breach of any warranty of Deutsche Bank under this
Agreement (without giving effect to any limitations or qualifications as to
"materiality" (including the word "material") set forth in the representations
contained in Sections 3.02, 3.05, 3.06, 3.10, 3.11, 3.14, 3.17 or 3.21(c) or
to any limitations or qualifications as to Material Adverse Effect or

Deutsche Bank to duly perform or observe any term, provision, covenant or
agreement to be performed or observed by Deutsche Bank pursuant to this
Agreement, (iii) the Excluded Liabilities or (iv) the Liabilities of the DB
Entities set forth on Schedule 9.02 hereto. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary (but subject to the last sentence of this Section 9.02(a)),
Deutsche Bank shall not be liable for any indemnification pursuant to Section
9.02(a)(i) unless and until the aggregate amount of Damages that would
otherwise be payable pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(i) exceeds Â€15,000,000 (the
" _Deductible Amount_ "), in which case the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to receive only that amount in excess of the Deductible
Amount, provided that the Deductible Amount shall not apply to any inaccuracy
or breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.14(a)
and (b). In calculating the Deductible Amount or Damages hereunder, all
Damages in respect of any Claim or series of related Claims which total less
than Â€25,000 (the " _De Minimis Amount_ ") shall be excluded in their
entirety, and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have no recourse for
such Damages. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the maximum
aggregate liability under Section 9.02(a) (i) shall not exceed 50% of the

Damages actually incurred by the Deutsche Bank Indemnified Parties arising
from or in connection with (i) any inaccuracy in any representation or the
breach of any warranty of the Purchaser under this Agreement (without giving
effect, to any limitations or qualifications as to "materiality" (including
the word "material"), "Material Adverse Effect" or "knowledge" set forth
therein), (ii) the failure of the Purchaser to duly perform or observe any

 

172 term, provision, covenant or agreement to be performed or observed by the
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) the Assumed Liabilities or (iv)
in the event the Purchaser delivers any Purchase Price Shares pursuant to
Section 2.11, the failure of the Registration Statement to have been declared
effective by the close of business on the 90th day following the Closing Date
(or if such day is not a Business Day, by the close of business on the next
succeeding Business Day). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary
(but subject to the last sentence of this Section 9.02(b)), the Purchaser
shall not be liable for any indemnification pursuant to Section 9.02(b)(i)
unless and until the aggregate amount of Damages that would otherwise be
payable pursuant to Section 9.02(b)(i) exceeds the Deductible Amount, in which
case the Deutsche Bank Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to receive only
that amount in excess of the Deductible Amount. In calculating the Deductible
Amount or Damages hereunder, all Damages which individually total less than
the De Minimis Amount shall be excluded in their entirety, and the Deutsche
Bank Indemnified Parties shall have no recourse for such Damages.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (A) the maximum aggregate
liability under Section 9.02(b)(i) shall not exceed 50% of the Purchase Price
and (B) indemnifiable Damages under Section 9.02(b)(iv) shall not be subject

Bank Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification under
Section 9.02(b) in respect of any inaccuracy in any of the representations and
warranties contained in Section 5A.01 and Section 5A.02 unless the Purchaser
shall have delivered any Purchase Price Shares pursuant to Section 2.11, in
which case (i) such indemnification shall be available only to the extent any
further breach of such representations is discovered after the Closing if the
Purchase Price Shares have been delivered pursuant to Section 2.11(c) or
Section 2.11(e) and (ii) indemnifiable Damages shall not exceed, in respect of
each Purchase Price Share so delivered, (A) the Share Price, if Purchase
Price Shares have been delivered pursuant to Section 2.11(a), or (B) the
Market Price, if Purchase Price Shares have been delivered pursuant to Section
2.11(c) or Section 2.11(e).



(d) No action, claim or setoff for Damages under this Section 9.02 shall be
brought or made with respect to claims for Damages resulting from a breach of
any representation or warranty after the date on which such representation or
warranty shall terminate pursuant to Section 9.01 hereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any claim made with reasonable specificity by the party
seeking to be indemnified within the time periods set forth above shall
survive until it is finally and fully resolved.



(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Damages shall be net of
(i) any insurance or other recoveries actually received by the Indemnitee or
its Affiliates in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of
indemnification and (ii) any Tax benefit to the Indemnitee or its Affiliates
arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Damages and increased by
any Tax cost to the Indemnitee or its Affiliates arising from the receipt of
such payment of Damages, and in each case actually realized through a
reduction or increase in Taxes otherwise payable.



SECTION 9.03. _Third Party Claims_. This Section sets forth procedures for
third-party claims. (a) Upon receipt by the party seeking to be indemnified
pursuant to Section 9.02

 

173 (the " _Indemnitee_ ") of notice of any action, suit, proceedings, audit,
claim, demand or assessment (each, a " _Claim_ ") against it which has or is
expected to give rise to a claim for Damages, the Indemnitee shall give prompt
written notice thereof (which shall be within ten days of receipt by the
Indemnitee of such Claim) to the Party from which it seeks to be indemnified
(the " _Indemnitor_ "), indicating the nature of such Claim and the basis
therefor; provided, however, that any delay or failure by the Indemnitee to
give notice to the Indemnitor shall relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations
hereunder only to the extent, if at all, that it is materially prejudiced by
reason of such delay or failure.



(b) The Indemnitor shall have 30 days after receipt of notice to elect, at its
option, to assume the defense of, at its own expense and by its own counsel,
any such Claim. If the Indemnitor shall undertake to compromise or defend any
such Claim, it shall promptly notify the Indemnitee of its intention to do so,
and the Indemnitee agrees to cooperate fully with the Indemnitor and its
counsel in the compromise of, or defense against, any such Claim; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Indemnitor shall not settle any such Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld) unless the relief consists solely of money damages
and includes a provision whereby the plaintiff or claimant in the matter
releases the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or Deutsche Bank Indemnified
Parties, as applicable, from all liability with respect thereto.
Notwithstanding an election to assume the defense of such action or
proceeding, the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel and
to participate in the defense of such action or proceeding, and the Indemnitor
shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel
if (i) the Indemnitee shall have determined in good faith that an actual or
potential conflict of interest makes representation by the same counsel or the
counsel selected by the Indemnitor inappropriate or (ii) the Indemnitor
shall have authorized the Indemnitee to employ separate counsel at the
IndemnitorÂ’s expense. In any event, the Indemnitee and Indemnitor and their
counsel shall cooperate in the defense of any Claim subject to this Article IX
and keep such persons informed of all developments relating to any such
Claims, provide copies of all relevant correspondence and documentation
relating thereto. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
IndemniteeÂ’s cooperation shall be borne by the Indemnitor. In any event, the
Indemnitee shall have the right at its own expense to participate in the
defense of such asserted liability. If the party receiving such notice of
Claim does not elect to defend such third party Claim or does not defend such
third party Claim in good faith, the Indemnitee shall have the right, in
addition to any other right or remedy it may have hereunder, at the
IndemnitorÂ’s expense, to defend such third party Claim; _provided_ , _however_
, that (A) the Indemnitee shall not have any obligation to participate in the
defense of, or defend, any such Claim; (B) the IndemniteeÂ’s defense of or
participation in the defense of any such Claim shall not in any way diminish
or lessen the obligations of the Indemnitor under this Article IX; and (C) so
long as the Indemnitor is defending such third party Claim in good faith, the
Indemnitee shall not settle any claim without the written consent of the
Indemnitor (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld).



SECTION 9.04. _Payments_. Except for third party Claims being defended in
good faith, an Indemnitor shall satisfy its obligations under this Article IX
in respect of a valid claim for indemnification hereunder which is not
contested by the Indemnitor in good faith as promptly as practical but in any
event no later than 45 days after the date on which the notice of such Claim
is given.

 

174 SECTION 9.05. _Certain Matters_. Anything in this Article IX to the
contrary notwithstanding, the rights and obligations of the parties (a) with
respect to indemnification for any and all Tax matters shall be governed by
Article VII and (b) with respect to indemnification for any and all matters
covered by Sections 5A.05 and 5A.06 shall be governed by such Sections.

Purchaser (in the case of termination by Deutsche Bank) or Deutsche Bank (in
the case of termination by the Purchaser) has breached any of its covenants
or agreements or any of its representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement, which breach, individually or in the aggregate, would cause the
conditions set forth in Section 8.01(a) (in the case of a breach by the
Purchaser) or Section 8.02(a) (in the case of a breach by Deutsche Bank) to
not be satisfied, and such breach is not cured within forty-five (45) days

of the other Party contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be

bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or condition shall not be construed as a
waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or
condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition, of this Agreement. The
failure of any Party to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not
constitute a waiver of any of such rights.

179 (c) If an action or non-action of any party which forms part of the

with Laws other than Laws of the State of New York, this requirement shall be
considered by the arbitrators in determining the rights and obligations of the
parties.

 



(d) The seat of arbitration shall be Paris, France.



(e) A party wishing to arbitrate a Dispute shall deliver a written demand for
arbitration to the other party in the manner provided for notices under
Section 11.02 hereof. Each party shall appoint a single arbitrator with 30
days after the receipt by the responding party of such written demand. The two
party appointed arbitrators shall then appoint the third arbitrator, who will

days after the appointment of the second arbitrator, the ICC shall appoint the
third arbitrator.

any award, which by its terms, results in such alteration or modification;
nor to order the termination of this Agreement for any reason other than as
expressly set forth in this Agreement. The arbitral award may include pre-
judgment and/or post-judgment interest, at a rate of interest set in the
discretion of the arbitral tribunal, but not in excess of the rates of pre-
judgment or post-judgment interest, as the case may be, permitted by the Laws
of the State of New York. Any award of money damages shall be stated in
Euros. Any such arbitral award may be confirmed in any court of competent
jurisdiction.



(h) The parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause arbitration
proceedings arising under this Section to proceed in a prompt and cost-
effective manner, avoiding all undue delay and with the intention that the
arbitration award is rendered not more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar
days from the date of the confirmation by the ICC of all of the members of the
arbitral tribunal. The arbitral tribunal shall use its best efforts to make
any award within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days from the date of the
confirmation by the ICC of all of the members of the arbitral tribunal. This
time limit may be extended by agreement of the parties or by the arbitral
tribunal if necessary.



(i) The foregoing provisions of this Section 11.10 shall not preclude any
party from applying for any preliminary or interim injunctive remedies
available from any court of competent jurisdiction where necessary to protect
its rights hereunder, including, without limitation, securing the subsequent
enforcement of any arbitral award made pursuant to the procedures provided in
this Section 11.10. With respect to any action brought pursuant to this
Section 11.10(i) or the last sentence of Section 11.10(g), each of the
parties, on behalf of itself, its affiliates, directors, officers, successors
and assigns, hereby unconditionally and irrevocably: consents to the personal
jurisdiction of the Federal and State courts located in County of New York in
the State of New York (the " _New York Courts_ "); waives any objection to the
jurisdiction 

 

180 of the New York Courts over its or their persons and agrees not to raise any
such objection as a defense in such action brought in the New York Courts;
agrees that the New York Courts are a proper venue for such actions; and
waives any objection to venue of such action being laid in the New York Courts
and agrees not to raise as a defense in such action that the New York Courts
are an improper venue or inconvenient forum.



SECTION 11.11. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different Parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by telecopier
shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this
Agreement.



SECTION 11.12. _Specific Performance_. The Parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement
was not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the Parties
shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to
any other remedy to which it may be entitled, whether at law or equity.



SECTION 11.13. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the Parties hereto hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may
have to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly
arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Parties hereto (a) certifies that
no representative, agent or attorney of any other Party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other Party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it
and the other hereto have been induced to enter this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as applicable, by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 11.13.

 

181 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be executed as
of the date first written above by their respective officers thereunto duly
authorized.

3 5. _New Section 2.14_. The SPA is hereby amended to add the following new Section 2.14: 



SECTION 2.14. _Holdback and Purchase Price True-Up_.

 



(a) The Purchaser may dispute any item reflected on the Final Closing
Revenue Schedule _provided_  that the Purchaser shall have notified Deutsche
Bank in writing of each disputed item, specifying the estimated amount thereof
in dispute and setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis for such
dispute, within 20 Business Days of Deutsche BankÂ’s delivery of the Final
Closing Revenue Schedule to the Purchaser. In the event of such a dispute, the
Purchaser and Deutsche Bank shall attempt to reconcile their differences, and
any resolution by them as to any disputed amounts shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the parties hereto. If the Purchaser and Deutsche Bank are
unable to reach a resolution as to such disputed amounts within 20 Business
Days after the receipt by Deutsche Bank of the PurchaserÂ’s written notice
of dispute, the dispute resolution provisions of Section 2.08(c) of this
Agreement shall apply.



(b ) The Final Closing Revenue Schedule shall be deemed final for the
purposes of this Section 2.14 upon the earliest of (x) the failure of the
Purchaser to notify Deutsche Bank of a dispute within 20 Business Days
of Deutsche BankÂ’s delivery of the Final Closing Revenue Schedule to the
Purchaser, (y) the affirmative indication by the Purchaser that it has no
dispute, (z) the resolution of all disputes pursuant to the dispute resolution
procedures set forth in Section 2.14(a) and Section 2.08(c), as applicable.



( c) Within three Business Days of the Final Closing Revenue Schedule
being deemed final, the following adjustments to the Purchase Price and
payments shall be made:



(i) In the event that the Holdback Amount would be greater if the Final
Closing Total Revenue, instead of the Estimated Closing Total Revenue, were
utilized in the calculation of the Holdback Amount, then the Purchase Price
and, to the extent applicable, each Local Purchase Price, shall be adjusted
downward in an aggregate amount equal to the amount of such difference in
values of the Holdback Amount. Deutsche Bank shall pay the amount of
this difference multiplied by the Fixed Exchange Rate to the Purchaser or the
applicable Purchasing Subsidiary in U.S. Dollars by wire transfer in
immediately available funds. The Holdback Amount shall be increased by the
amount paid by Deutsche Bank pursuant to the preceding sentence.



(ii) In the event that the Holdback Amount would be smaller if the Final
Closing Total Revenue, instead of the Estimated Closing Total Revenue, were
utilized in the calculation of the Holdback Amount, then the Purchase Price
and, to the extent applicable, each Local Purchase 

 

4  Price, shall be adjusted upward in an aggregate amount equal to the amount
of such difference in values of the Holdback Amount. The Purchaser or the
applicable Purchasing Subsidiary shall pay the amount of this difference
multiplied by the Fixed Exchange Rate to Deutsche Bank or the applicable
Seller in U.S. Dollars by wire transfer in immediately available funds. The
Holdback Amount shall be decreased by the amount paid by the Purchaser or the
applicable Purchasing Subsidiary pursuant to the preceding sentence.



(d) In the event that there has been any deferred closing of the
transactions contemplated hereby in any Deferred Closing Jurisdiction which
has not been consummated pursuant to a Deferred Closing as provided in Section
2.12(d) on or before the date on which the Final Closing Revenue Schedule has
been deemed final, the following adjustments and payments shall be made:



(i) The applicable Deferred Closing Amount for each such jurisdiction shall
be recalculated, utilizing the Final Closing Measurement Period in lieu of the
Estimated Closing Measurement Period in the formula provided in Section
2.12(b) (as amended hereby).



(ii) If the aggregate amount of such recalculated Deferred Closing Amounts
is greater than the aggregate amount of corresponding Deferred Closing Amounts
as originally calculated (utilizing the Estimated Closing Measurement Period
in the formula provided in Section 2. 12(b)), then Deutsche Bank shall, or
shall cause the relevant sellers to, pay to the Purchaser or the Purchasing
Subsidiaries by wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount in U.S.
dollars equal to the product of such difference multiplied by the Fixed
Exchange Rate, such payment to be made within three business days following
the date on which the Final Closing Revenue Schedule has been deemed final.



(iii) If the aggregate amount of such recalculated Deferred Closing Amounts
is less than the aggregate amount of corresponding Deferred Closing Amounts as
originally calculated (utilizing the Estimated Closing Measurement Period in
the formula provided in Section 2. 12(b)), then the Purchaser shall, or cause
the applicable Purchasing Subsidiaries to, pay to Deutsche Bank or the
relevant Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
Purchase Price Bank Account an amount in U.S. dollars equal to the product of
such difference multiplied by the Fixed Exchange Rate, such payment to be made
within three business days following the date on which the Final Closing
Revenue Schedule has been deemed final.



(iv) At the subsequent Deferred Closing in respect of any such Deferred
Closing Jurisdiction, the Deferred Closing Amount to be paid 

 

5  pursuant to Section 2.12(e) shall be the Deferred Closing Amount applicable
to such jurisdiction as recalculated pursuant to Section 2.14(d)(i).



(e) Any payments required to be made by Deutsche Bank or one of the
Sellers, on the one hand, or the Purchaser and/or one of the Purchasing
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, pursuant to Sections 2. 14(c), 2. 14(d)(ii),
and 2. 14(d)(iii) shall bear interest from the Closing Date through the date
of payment at the one month Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor) as reported
in _The Wall Street Journal_ on the Closing Date.



6. _Changes to Section 3.07(a) ("Financial Information")_. Section 3.07(a) is hereby amended as follows: 



(a) the words "(other than Deutsche Bank Custodial Services (C.I.)
Limited)" are hereby inserted immediately following the first occurrence of
the words "DB Companies" in clause (i) of the first sentence of Section
3.07(a).



(b) the words "(other than Deutsche Bank Custodial Services (C.I.)
Limited)" are hereby inserted immediately following the first occurrence of
the words "DB Companies" in clause (ii) of the first sentence of Section
3.07(a).



7. _New Section 3. 16(i)_. The SPA is hereby amended to add the following new subsection (i) to Section 3.16, to follow current subsection (h): 



(i) The shares of Deutsche International (Ireland) Limited do not derive
the greater part of their value from (i) land in Ireland, (ii) minerals,
mineral rights or mining rights in Ireland, or (iii) exploration or
exploitation rights on the continental shelf of Ireland, and such shares were
not acquired by the relevant Seller, or any prior holder, in exchange for
shares, debentures or other securities the greater part of the value of which
was so derived.

SECTION 5.21. _Delivery of Closing Revenue Schedules_.

Agreement (a "Covered Broker-Dealer Facility"), if prior to the Closing the
Purchaser has identified to Deutsche Bank its desire to amend the terms or to
reduce the maximum available amount of such Covered Broker-Dealer Facility
prior to it becoming an Assumed Broker-Dealer Facility, Deutsche Bank shall
cooperate with the Purchaser to, and use its commercially reasonable efforts
to, so effect such changes, effective as of Assignment Date (as defined below)
with respect to such Assumed Broker-Dealer Facility. Prior to the applicable
Assignment Date, Deutsche Bank and the Purchaser shall cooperate in
all reasonable respects to ensure that each Covered Broker-Dealer Facility
is, effective as of such Assignment Date, assigned or novated in full to, and
assumed by, the Purchaser or a Purchasing Subsidiary (each such Covered
Broker-Dealer Facility, as amended or reduced at the request of the Purchaser
prior to such Assignment Date, being, at such Assignment Date, an "Assumed
Broker-Dealer Facility"). The Purchaser acknowledges that upon the expiration
or termination of any Assumed Broker-Dealer Facility in accordance with its
terms following the Assignment Date with respect to such Assumed Broker-Dealer
Facility, the Purchaser or the applicable Purchasing Subsidiary shall be
solely responsible for negotiating and effecting any replacement facility
(and, for the avoidance of doubt, Deutsche Bank and its Affiliates shall not
be obligated to renew, amend or modify any Assumed Broker-Dealer Facility).
For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Assignment Date" with respect to
any Assumed Broker-Dealer Facility



 

11 shall mean the ninetieth (90th) day (or if such ninetieth day is not a
Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day) following the Closing Date or
such other date as the Purchaser and Deutsche Bank may agree, it being agreed
that the parties will cooperate in good faith to determine a mutually
acceptable Assignment Date for each Assumed Broker-Dealer Facility taking into
account, among others factors, the Conversion plan with respect to the
affected broker-dealer Clients.



(d) In connection with each assignment or novation of an Assumed Broker-
Dealer Facility pursuant to Section 5.19(c), Deutsche Bank will or will cause
the relevant Seller(s) to, assign its or their perfected security interests
in the collateral pledged by the relevant Client (including securities, cash
and other pledged assets) to secure obligations arising under such Assumed
Broker-Dealer Facility (and, thereafter, will cooperate with the Purchaser or
such Purchasing Subsidiary to ensure such perfected security interests are
maintained until the relevant collateral is transferred to the Purchaser or
such Purchasing Subsidiary) and, in consultation with the Purchaser,
establish appropriate control arrangements with respect to such collateral
remaining in accounts maintained with or through Deutsche Bank or the
Seller(s) (which control arrangements shall include, with respect to each such
Assumed Broker-Dealer Facility, a Control Agreement to be entered into
substantially in the form attached as Exhibit J hereto, with such changes as
Deutsche Bank (or the applicable Seller), the Purchaser (or the applicable
Purchasing Subsidiary) and the applicable Client may agree upon) and, if
necessary to maintain the perfection of any such security interest in such
collateral remaining in accounts maintained with or through Deutsche Bank or
the Sellers, establish separate direct deposit accounts with respect to
pledged cash.



(e) Deutsche Bank and the Purchaser will cooperate in good faith to
establish and maintain appropriate funding mechanisms for the continued
funding of (i) the Covered Broker-Dealer Facilities after the Closing Date
and, for each such Covered Broker-Dealer Facility continuing for so long as
such facility remains a Covered Broker-Dealer Facility and (ii) the Assigned
Broker-Dealer Facilities, from and after the Assignment Date with respect to
each Assumed Broker-Dealer Facility, until such time as Conversion with
respect to such Assigned Broker-Dealer Facility has occurred, in each case by
the Purchaser or the applicable Purchasing Subsidiary on an uninterrupted
basis, including the establishment of one or more funding accounts by the
Purchaser or such Purchasing Subsidiary with Deutsche Bank or the relevant
Seller(s)."

14 17. New Section 6.18. Article VI is hereby amended by adding the following Section 6.18 at the end thereof: 



SECTION 6.18. (a) Deleted Business Employees. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall have no
obligations with respect to the Deleted Business Employees, and Deutsche
Bank, the Sellers and their Affiliates shall remain solely responsible for and
indemnify and keep indemnified Purchaser and its Affiliates with respect to
any losses, Liabilities, costs or claims, arising from or with respect to
the Deleted Business Employees, however arising, whether pursuant to Law,
including without limitation, the Transfer Provisions, as a result of
Purchaser or one of its Affiliates offering any such Business Employee
employment or rescinding any such offer, or otherwise. Purchaser or its
applicable Affiliate shall use its reasonable efforts to reduce any costs
incurred with respect to the Deleted Business Employees as a result of the
enrollment of the Deleted Business Employees in the benefit plans of
Purchaser or its Affiliates; it being understood among the parties hereto that
this may not be possible with respect to all costs incurred. Purchaser,
Deutsche Bank, the Sellers and their Affiliates shall cooperate to ensure that
the Deleted Business Employees understand that they will not commence
employment with Purchaser or one of its Affiliates on or following the Closing
Date and will continue to be employed by the Sellers or one of their
Affiliates on and following the Closing Date. During the two year period
following the Closing Date, Deutsche Bank shall, or shall cause the Sellers
to, provide Purchaser and its Affiliates with notice of the proposed or actual
termination of the employment of a Deleted Business Employee by Deutsche Bank
or the Sellers, so that Purchaser or its Affiliates will have the opportunity
(not the obligation) to offer any such Deleted Business Employee employment
with Purchaser or its Affiliates. To the extent practicable, such notice
shall be provided in advance of the earlier to occur of Deutsche Bank or the
Sellers informing the Deleted Business Employee of his or her termination and
the Deleted Business EmployeeÂ’s last scheduled day of employment.



(b) Reimbursement for Replacement of Deleted Business Employees. During the
period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the second anniversary
thereof, Deutsche Bank shall, or shall cause the Sellers to, reimburse
Purchaser and its Affiliates for (i) the costs incurred by Purchaser or its
Affiliates to replace the Deleted Business Employees; provided, however, that
prior to the retention of any headhunter or other third party by Purchaser or
its Affiliates to assist with the hiring of replacements for the Deleted
Business Employees, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall obtain the prior
written consent of Deutsche Bank, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, and (ii) the incremental costs incurred by Purchaser or its
Affiliates to hire third-party consultants to perform the duties of the
Deleted Business Employees, with such incremental costs measured as the
excess, if any, of the actual cost to Purchaser or its Affiliates of such
third-party consultant over the actual cost that Purchaser or its Affiliates
would have incurred had they been able to employ a Deleted Business Employee
(on the terms set forth in this Agreement with respect to Transferred



 

15 Employees); provided, however, that in the aggregate such third-party
consultants shall be hired to perform functions that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to functions performed by the Deleted Business
Employees taken as a whole. Any reimbursement pursuant to this Section 6.18(b)
shall be made on an after-Tax basis (net of any Tax benefit arising from the
incurrence of any such costs by Purchaser or its Affiliates and increased by
any Tax cost to Purchaser or its Affiliates arising from the receipt of such
reimbursement) and shall be paid to Purchaser or its Affiliates within twenty
(20) Business Days of the delivery to Deutsche Bank or the Sellers of an
invoice setting forth the itemized amounts and purpose(s) of such costs and
including supporting detail.



(c) Singapore Employee Arrangements. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing Date, Deutsche Bank, the Sellers or one of their
Affiliates and Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall take the necessary
action, including the entering into of a secondment agreement in the form
reasonably agreed to between the parties, to ensure that the previously
identified Singapore Transferred Employee has access to the necessary systems,
data and records of Deutsche Bank, the Sellers and their
Affiliates consistent with the terms of the Transition Support Agreement and
in a manner that complies with applicable Law.



(d) Certain Luxembourg Employees. With respect to the two previously
identified Luxembourg Employees, either (i) Deutsche Bank shall or shall
cause the applicable Seller to pay Purchaser or its designated Affiliates a
cash amount or (ii) the Closing Statement of Net Assets shall reflect an
accrual (with the payment of cash or receipt of an accrual to be mutually
agreed among the parties as soon as practicable following the Closing Date),
in either case equal to the lump-sum present value of the pension liability
(on a projected benefit obligation basis) in excess of the statutory maximum
benefit in respect of each such Luxembourg Employee (currently estimated to be
approximately 200,000 Euros in the aggregate).



(e) Australian and UK Secondment Arrangements. As soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing Date, Deutsche Bank, the Sellers or one of
their Affiliates and Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall take the
necessary action to enter into a secondment agreement substantially in the
form agreed to between the parties with respect to the secondment of
employees in the United States, to ensure that the services of the previously
identified Australian Business Employees and the identified UK Business
Employee are available to Purchaser and its Affiliates following the
Closing Date.



18. Changes to Section 9.02 ("Indemnification"). Section 9.02(a) of the SPA is hereby amended to delete the struck text and add the bold underlined text as indicated below: 



"(a) From and after the Closing, Deutsche Bank (acting for itself and on
behalf of each Seller in relation to the Shares and/or Purchased Assets to be
sold by the relevant Sellers) shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Purchaser and its



 

16 Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents and
the heirs, executors and assigns of the foregoing ("Purchaser Indemnified
Parties") from and against any Liabilities, costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
disbursements and deficiencies (including any interest, penalties, legal,
accounting and other costs and expenses incurred in the investigation,
collection, prosecution and defense of any action, suit, proceeding or claim
and amounts paid in settlement thereof and including any of the foregoing
related to the enforcement of this Agreement, but excluding any consequential,
indirect or punitive damage unless such consequential, indirect or punitive
damages are awarded against any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or
Deutsche Bank Indemnified Parties in a third party claim or, with respect to a
direct claim, in cases of common law fraud) (collectively, "Damages") actually
incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties arising from or in connection
with (i) any inaccuracy in any representation or the breach of any warranty of
Deutsche Bank under this Agreement (without giving effect to any limitations
or qualifications as to "materiality" (including the word "material") set
forth in the representations contained in Sections 3.02, 3.05, 3.06, 3.10,
3.11, 3.14, 3.17 or 3.21(c) or to any limitations or qualifications as to
Material Adverse Effect or "knowledge" set forth in any representation or
warranty), (ii) the failure of Deutsche Bank to duly perform or observe any
term, provision, covenant or agreement to be performed or observed by Deutsche
Bank pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) the Excluded Liabilities (iv)
the Liabilities of the DB Entities set forth on Schedule 9.02 hereto, or (v)
any Liabilities related to or arising out of the Chancery Lease (including any
assignment of the Chancery Lease pursuant to Section 5.17(c)) or any related
contracts for maintenance services or other facilities-related services to be
performed at the facility subject to the Chancery Lease. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary (but subject to the last sentence of this
Section 9.02(a)), Deutsche Bank shall not be liable for any indemnification
pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(i) unless and until the aggregate amount of
Damages that would otherwise be payable pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(i) exceeds
Â€15,000,000 (the "Deductible Amount"), in which case the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to receive only that amount in excess of
the Deductible Amount, provided that the Deductible Amount shall not apply to
any inaccuracy or breach of the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3.14(a) and (b). In calculating the Deductible Amount or Damages
hereunder, all Damages in respect of any Claim or series of related Claims
which total less than Â€25,000 (the "De Minimis Amount"), other than
Claims pursuant to clause (v) in the immediately preceding sentence above,
shall be excluded in their entirety, and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
shall have no recourse for such Damages. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, the maximum aggregate liability under Section 9.02(a) (i) shall
not exceed 50% of the Purchase Price."



 

17 19. Changes to Section 7.08(b). The SPA is hereby amended to add the following new Section 7.08(b)(vi): 



"(vi) Deutsche Bank and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith and
attempt to reach agreement with respect to the most appropriate treatment for
German VAT purposes of the Local Purchase Price relating to the portion of
the Business transferred by DB in Germany (the "German Local Purchase Price"),
or any portion thereof, including the characterization of any intangible asset
to which any portion of such Local Purchase Price is attributable. In the
event Deutsche Bank and the Purchaser are unable in good faith to agree upon
the most appropriate treatment of such issues under German VAT law within five
(5) Business Days after the Closing Date (or such extension of time as both
parties may mutually agree), each of Deutsche Bank and the Purchaser shall
have its own legal advisors (including outside counsel as appropriate)
prepare, in writing, its respective position on the German VAT treatment of
such issues in preparation for a meeting between the outside legal advisors,
local finance personnel and departmental heads of tax for each of Deutsche
Bank and the Purchaser to be held within five (5) further Business Days (or
such extension of time as both parties may mutually agree) in Frankfurt, at
which meeting the parties will further attempt in good faith to reach
agreement on the most appropriate German VAT treatment of such issues. In the
event Deutsche Bank and the Purchaser are unable to agree at such meeting,
the senior business management of each of Deutsche Bank and the Purchaser
shall agree upon the resolution of the German VAT issues. As soon as
practicable after an agreement has been reached with respect to the German
VAT treatment of the German Local Purchase Price or any portion thereof,
Deutsche Bank shall deliver to the Purchaser an appropriate and valid VAT
invoice in respect of such payment, which invoice shall reflect the agreed
resolution of the German VAT issues.
