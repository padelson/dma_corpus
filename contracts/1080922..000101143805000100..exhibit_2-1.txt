April 14, 2005 (this "AGREEMENT"), among Stantec Inc., a Canadian corporation
("PARENT"), Stantec Consulting California Inc., a California corporation and
a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("MERGER SUB"), and The Keith Companies,
Inc., a California corporation (the "COMPANY").   WHEREAS, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the
California Corporations Code (the "CCC"), Parent and the Company will enter
into a business combination transaction pursuant to which the Company will
merge with and into Merger Sub (the "MERGER");   WHEREAS, the Board of
Directors of the Company (the "COMPANY BOARD") has (i) determined that the
Merger is consistent with and in furtherance of the long-term business
strategy of the Company and fair to, and in the best interests of, the
Company and its stockholders and has approved and adopted this Agreement and
declared its advisability and approved the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "TRANSACTIONS") and (ii) has recommended
the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company;   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent (the "PARENT BOARD")
has determined that the Merger is consistent with and in furtherance of
the long-term business strategy of Parent and fair to, and in the best
interests of, Parent and its stockholders and has approved and adopted this
Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions ;   WHEREAS, Parent and

reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the United States
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE");   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements herein
contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and

the relevant provisions of the CCC (the date and time of such filing of the
Certificate of Merger (or such later time as may be agreed by each of the
parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of Merger) being the

Merger, a closing (the "CLOSING") shall be held at the offices of the

Article VII.   SECTION 1.03. EFFECT OF THE MERGER. At the Effective Time,
the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of
the CCC. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions,

LAWS. (a) At the Effective Time, subject to Section 6.06, the Articles of
Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective

Incorporation.   (b) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the
Effective Time, and  subject to Section 6.06, at the Effective Time, the By-

2    ARTICLE II   CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES  
SECTION 2.01. CONVERSION OF SECURITIES. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders of any of the following securities:   (a) each share of
common stock, par value US$0.001 per share, of the  Company ("COMPANY COMMON
STOCK," all issued and outstanding shares of  Company Common Stock being
hereinafter collectively referred to as the  "SHARES") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective  Time (other than any Shares to be
cancelled pursuant to Section  2.01(i), substituted for pursuant to Section
2.05 and any Dissenting  Shares (as hereinafter defined)) shall be cancelled
and shall be  converted automatically, subject to Section 2.01 (h) and
Section 2.02,  into the right to receive:   (i) (A) 0.23 common shares,
without par value, of Parent ("PARENT  COMMON STOCK") (the "FIXED RATIO
STOCK") and (B) that number of  shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
US$16.50 divided by the  Average Stock Price (the "FLOATING RATIO Stock" and,
together  with the Fixed Ratio Stock, the "EXCHANGE STOCK"); or   (ii) cash
equal the sum of (A) US$16.50 and (B) the product of (x)  0.23 and (y)
Average Stock Price (the "CASH PAYMENT"); or   (iii) (A) US$11.00, (B) the
Fixed Ratio Stock and (C) that number of  Parent Common Stock equal to
US$5.50 divided by the Average Stock  Price (the "US$5.50 STOCK" and,
together with the Fixed Ratio  Stock, the "MIXED ELECTION STOCK"); or  
(iv) such other combination of shares of Parent Common Stock and cash 
determined in accordance with Section 2.01(e) or Section 2.01(f)  (the
"MERGER CONSIDERATION," which when used herein shall be deemed to
include cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which
a holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e)), in each case upon
surrender by the holder of such share of Company Common Stock of the
Certificate representing such share in accordance with Section 2.02. "AVERAGE
STOCK PRICE" means the simple average of the daily weighted average sales
price of Parent Common Stock on the Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSX"), as
reported by Bloomberg L.P., for each of the 20 consecutive trading days
ending on (and including) the second trading day prior to the Effective Time.
The weighted average sales price for each trading day shall be converted from
Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars at the noon buying rate quoted by the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York on such trading day;   (b) The aggregate
number of shares of Parent Common Stock (the "AGGREGATE  STOCK AMOUNT") to be
issued as Merger Consideration shall be equal to  the product of (i) the
Mixed Election Stock and (ii) the difference of  (A) the number of Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective Time minus (B) the sum of (x)
the number of Shares held by  any Subsidiary of the Company or Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent,  (y) the number of Shares of unvested Company
Restricted Stock and (z)  the number of Dissenting Shares. The
aggregate    3     amount of cash to be paid by Parent as Merger
Consideration (the  "AGGREGATE CASH AMOUNT") shall be equal to the product of
(i) US$11.00  and (ii) the difference of (A) the number of Shares
outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time minus (B) the sum of (x)
the  number of Shares held by any Subsidiary of the Company or Parent or 
any Subsidiary of Parent, (y) the number of Shares of unvested Company 
Restricted Stock and (z) the number of Dissenting Shares. Any right to 
receive cash as all or part of the Merger Consideration shall be  without
interest.   (c) Subject to the allocation and election procedures set forth
in this  Section 2.01, each record holder of Shares immediately prior to
the  Effective Time (other than Shares held by the Company or any 
Subsidiary of the Company or Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent and 
Dissenting Shares) will be entitled to elect to receive:   (i) cash per
Share equal the Cash Payment (a "CASH ELECTION"); or   (ii) the number of
shares, or fraction thereof, of Parent Common Stock  per Share equal to the
Exchange Stock (a "STOCK ELECTION"); or   (iii) the "MIXED CONSIDERATION"
per Share, which consists of US$11.00  in cash and the Mixed Election Stock
(a "MIXED ELECTION", and  together with the Cash Election and the Stock
Election, the  "ELECTIONS");  Each holder shall make the same Election with
respect to all of such holder\'s Shares. All such Elections shall be made on
a form in compliance with the terms of Section 2.02 (a "FORM OF ELECTION").
Holders of record of Shares who hold such shares as nominees, trustees or in
other representative capacities (a "HOLDER REPRESENTATIVE") may submit
multiple Forms of Election, PROVIDED that such Holder Representative
certifies that each such Form of Election covers all the Shares held by such
Holder Representative for a particular beneficial owner. For purposes hereof,
a holder of Company Common Stock who does not make a valid Election prior to
the Election Deadline, including by failure to return the Form of Election to
the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline and as a result of
revocation, shall be deemed to have made a Mixed Election. If Parent or
the Exchange Agent shall determine that any purported Cash Election or
Stock Election was not properly made, such purported Cash Election or Stock
Election shall be deemed to be of no force and effect and the stockholder
making such purported Cash Election or Stock Election shall for purposes
hereof be deemed to have made a Mixed Election.   (d) At the Effective
Time, each Share covered by a Mixed Election (a  "MIXED ELECTION Share")
shall be converted into and exchanged for the  right to receive from Parent
the Mixed Consideration;   (e) At the Effective Time, each Share covered by
a Stock Election (a  "STOCK ELECTION Share") shall be converted into the
right to receive  the Exchange Stock; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, if after taking into
account  the Elections made and deemed made pursuant to Section 2.01(c),
the  number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued as Merger 
Consideration would exceed the Aggregate Stock Amount, then, at the 
Effective Time, each Stock Election Share shall be converted into the  right
to receive:     4     (i) a number of shares (the "PRO RATA NUMBER OF
SHARES") of Parent  Common Stock equal to the quotient determined by (A)
the  difference of the Aggregate Stock Amount minus the number of  shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued in exchange for Mixed  Election Shares,
divided by (B) the number of Stock Election  Shares; and   (ii) an amount
in cash equal to the product of (A) the difference of  (x) the Exchange
Stock, minus (y) the Pro Rata Number of Shares,  multiplied by (B) the
Average Stock Price;   (f) At the Effective Time, each Share covered by a
Cash Election (a "CASH  ELECTION Share") shall be converted into the right to
receive the Cash  Payment; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, if, taking into account the
Elections made  and deemed made pursuant to Section 2.01(c), the amount of
cash to be  paid by Parent as Merger Consideration would exceed the Aggregate
Cash  Amount, then, at the Effective Time, each Cash Election Share shall
be  converted into the right to receive:   (i) an amount in cash (the "PRO
RATA AMOUNT OF CASH") equal to the  quotient determined by (A) the difference
of the Aggregate Cash  Amount minus the amount of cash to be paid in exchange
for Mixed  Election Shares, divided by (B) the number of Cash Election 
Shares; and   (ii) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
quotient  of (A) the difference of (x) the Cash Payment, minus (y) the Pro 
Rata Amount of Cash, divided by (B) the Average Stock Price;   (g) The
Company shall mail the Form of Election to each person who is a  holder of
record of Company Common Stock on the record date for the  Company
Stockholders\' Meeting contemplated by Section 6.02 and shall  use its
reasonable best efforts to make the Form of Election available  to all
persons who become holders of Company Common Stock during the  period between
such record date and the Election Deadline;   (h) To be effective, a Form of
Election must be properly completed and  signed by a record holder of Company
Common Stock and submitted to the  Exchange Agent and accompanied by the
Certificates as to which the  Election is being made. All Certificates so
surrendered shall be  subject to the exchange procedures set forth in Section
2.02. The  Exchange Agent will have the discretion to determine whether Forms
of  Election have been properly completed, signed and submitted or revoked 
and to disregard immaterial defects in Forms of Election. The decision  of
the Exchange Agent in such matters shall be conclusive and binding.  Neither
Parent nor the Exchange Agent will be under any obligation to  notify any
person of any defect in a Form of Election submitted to the  Exchange Agent.
The Exchange Agent shall also make all computations  contemplated by this
Section 2.01 and all such computations shall be  conclusive and binding on
the holders of Company Common Stock absent  manifest error. The Form of
Election and the Certificates must be  received by the Exchange Agent by the
close of business on the last  business day prior to the date on which the
vote with respect to the  adoption and approval of this Agreement and the
approval of the Merger  at the Company Stockholders\' Meeting contemplated by
Section 6.02  hereof is held (the "ELECTION DEADLINE") in order to be    
5    effective. The Exchange Agent shall not accept guarantee of delivery 
of Certificates in lieu of physical delivery of Certificates. An  Election
may be revoked, but only by written notice received by the  Exchange Agent
prior to the Election Deadline. Upon any such  revocation, unless a duly
completed Form of Election, accompanied by a  Certificate, is thereafter
submitted in accordance with this Section  2.01(i), such shares shall be
deemed to be Mixed Election Shares. In  the event that this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to the provisions  hereof and any Certificates have been
transmitted to the Exchange  Agent pursuant to the provisions hereof, such
Certificates shall be  promptly be returned without charge to the person
submitting same;   (i) each Share held in the treasury of the Company and
each Share  owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly 
owned subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately prior to  the
Effective Time shall be cancelled without any conversion  thereof and no
payment or distribution shall be made with respect  thereto; and   (j) each
share of common stock, par value US$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub  issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall  be one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common  stock, par value
US$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation;   (k) Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,  if:   (i) Parent or
the Company receives written notice from its counsel  specified in Article
VII to the effect that such counsel is  unlikely to be able to deliver a tax
opinion required pursuant to  Section 7.02(l) or Section 7.03(e), as the case
may be, on the  date of the Effective Time; and   (ii) instead of
depositing the Aggregate Cash Amount and the Aggregate  Stock Amount in
accordance with Section 2.02(a), Parent deposits,  or causes to be deposited
(including as contemplated by Section  7.02(f)), with the Exchange Agent (as
defined below), for the  benefit of the holders of Shares, for exchange in
accordance with  this Article II through the Exchange Agent, cash in an
amount  equal to US$22.00 per Share,  Parent shall have the right, at its
sole and absolute discretion, to reverse the Merger so that Merger Sub will
merge with and into the Company, such that the separate corporate existence
of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the Surviving
Corporation of the Merger (a "REVERSE-SUBSIDIARY MERGER"). A Reverse-
Subsidiary Merger would not be intended to constitute a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of section 1.368-2(g) of the income tax
regulations promulgated under the Code. In the event Parent effects
the acquisition of the Company pursuant to a Reverse Subsidiary Merger in
accordance with this Section 2.01(k), (x) all references to the "Merger" in
this Agreement and all other related agreements, documents and instruments,
shall be deemed to be to the "Reverse-Subsidiary Merger," all references to
the "Surviving Corporation" shall be deemed to be to the Company, all
references to Merger Consideration shall be deemed to mean US$22.00 per
Share, and this Agreement and (y) the conditions in Section 7.02(l) and
Section 7.03(e) shall be deemed to be waived.     6     SECTION 2.02.
EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES. (a) EXCHANGE AGENT. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited
(including as contemplated by Section 7.02(f)), with such bank or trust
company that may be designated by Parent and is reasonably satisfactory
to the Company (the "EXCHANGE AGENT"), for the benefit of the holders of
Shares, for exchange in accordance with this Article II through the Exchange
Agent, cash equal to the Aggregate Cash Amount and certificates representing
the Aggregate Stock Amount, and cash, from time to time as required to make
payments in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(e) (such
cash and certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred
to as the "EXCHANGE FUND"). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the cash and shares of Parent Common Stock contemplated
to be issued pursuant to Section 2.01. Except as contemplated by Section
2.02(g) hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose.   (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective  Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each person
who  was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled to 
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(a): (i) a  letter
of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall  specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to  the certificates
evidencing such Shares (the "CERTIFICATES") shall  pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange  Agent) and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the  Certificates pursuant to such
letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to  the Exchange Agent of a Certificate
for cancellation, together with  such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in  accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as  may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder
of such  Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the 
Merger Consideration, and any dividends or other distributions to  which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c), and the  Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event  of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the  transfer records of the
Company the Merger Consideration and any  dividends or other distributions to
which such holder is entitled  pursuant to Section 2.02(c) may be issued to a
transferee if the  Certificate representing such Shares is presented to the
Exchange  Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect  such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer
taxes  have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 
2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at all times after the  Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive upon such  surrender the Merger
Consideration, and any dividends or other  distributions to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section  2.02(c). The Merger Consideration (plus any
dividends or other  distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to Section  2.02(c)) shall be delivered to each former stockholder of the
Company  by the Exchange Agent as promptly as practicable following
surrender  of a Certificate and a duly executed letter of transmittal.  
(c) DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES OF PARENT COMMON  STOCK.
No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the  Effective
Time with respect to the Parent Common Stock with a record  date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any  unsurrendered Certificate
with respect to the shares of Parent Common  Stock represented thereby, and
no cash payment shall be paid to any  such holder pursuant to Section 2.01(a)
or 2.02(e), until the holder  of such Certificate shall surrender such
Certificate. Subject to the  effect of escheat, tax or other applicable Laws
(as defined in Section  3.05(a)), following    7     surrender of any
such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder  of the certificates
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock  issued as part of the
Merger Consideration in exchange therefor, (i)  promptly, the amount of any
cash payable with respect to a fractional  share of Parent Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant  to Section 2.02(e) and the amount of
dividends or other distributions  with a record date after the Effective Time
and theretofore paid with  respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock, and (ii) at the  appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other  distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior 
to surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable  with
respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.   (d) NO FURTHER RIGHTS
IN COMPANY COMMON STOCK. The Merger Consideration  issued upon surrender of a
Certificate in accordance with the terms of  this Article II (including, with
respect to Shares, any cash paid  pursuant to Section 2.02(c) or (e)) shall
be deemed to have been  issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining
to the Shares  formerly represented by such Certificate.   (e) NO
FRACTIONAL SHARES. No certificates or scrip representing fractional  shares
of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for  exchange of
Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not  entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any other rights of a  shareholder of Parent. Each
holder of a fractional share interest  shall be paid an amount in cash
(without interest and subject to the  amount of any withholding taxes as
contemplated in Section 2.02(i))  equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) such fractional share  interest to which such holder (after
taking into account all  fractional share interests then held by such holder)
would otherwise  be entitled by (ii) the simple average of the daily weighted
average  sales price of Parent Common Stock on the TSX, as reported by 
Bloomberg L.P., for each of the 20 consecutive trading days ending on  (and
including) the second trading day prior to the Effective Time  (the weighted
average sales price for each trading day shall be  converted from Canadian
dollars to U.S. dollars at the noon buying  rate quoted by the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York on such trading  day). As promptly as practicable
after the determination of the amount  of cash, if any, to be paid to holders
of fractional share interests,  the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent,
and Parent shall deposit  such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause
the Exchange Agent  to forward payments to such holders of fractional share
interests  subject to and in accordance with the terms of Sections 2.02(b)
and  (c).   (f) ADJUSTMENTS TO MERGER CONSIDERATION. The Merger
Consideration shall be  adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any
stock split,  reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend
or  distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or 
Company Common Stock), extraordinary cash dividends, reorganization, 
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or  other
like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company  Common Stock
occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the  Effective Time.  
(g) TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that 
remains undistributed to the holders of the Company Common Stock for  twelve
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent,  upon demand,
and any holders of the Shares who have not theretofore  complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for  the Merger
Consideration, and any dividends or other distributions  with respect to the
Parent     8     Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.02(c).  Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by
holders of  Shares as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as
such  amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any 
government entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,  become
the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest  of any
person previously entitled thereto.   (h) NO LIABILITY. None of the Exchange
Agent, Parent or the Surviving  Corporation shall be liable to any holder of
Shares for any such  Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto), or cash  delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property,  escheat or similar Law.   (i) WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Each of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall  be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise  payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Shares such  amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the  making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state,  local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld  by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such 
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement  as
having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which  such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation  or Parent,
as the case may be.   (j) LOST CERTIFICATES. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or  destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the person  claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if  required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a 
bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may  direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it  with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in  exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger  Consideration, and any dividends or
other distributions to which the  holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.02(c), subject to  Section 2.02(g).   SECTION 2.03. STOCK
TRANSFER BOOKS. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after
the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates
presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be exchanged
for the Merger Consideration, and any dividends or other distributions to
which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c).  
SECTION 2.04. COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS. At the Effective Time, all options
to purchase Company Common Stock, whether or not exercisable and whether or
not vested (the "COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS"), outstanding under the Company\'s
Amended and Restated 1994 Stock Incentive Plan, in each case as such may have
been amended, supplemented or modified (collectively, the "COMPANY STOCK
OPTION PLANS") shall be cancelled without further rights. At least 20 days
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall offer to purchase each Company
Stock Option which as of the Effective Time would be unexercisable and
unvested (the "UNVESTED OPTIONS"), at a price equal to the Cash Payment less
the exercise price of such     9    Unvested Option ( the "OPTION
CONSIDERATION"), which offer to purchase shall be conditional upon the
approval of this Agreement by the Stockholders of the Company and the
satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions hereunder. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall have deposited, or shall have caused to
be deposited with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of holders of the
Unvested Options that surrender such Unvested Options for purchase by the
Company for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.04, cash equal to the
aggregate Option Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as
the "OPTION EXCHANGE Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions, deliver the cash contemplated to be delivered to
the holders of the Unvested Options pursuant to this Section 2.04 out of the
Option Exchange Fund. The Option Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose.   SECTION 2.05. COMPANY RESTRICTED STOCK. At the Effective
Time, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that is unvested or is subject to a repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition under the Company Stock Option Plans or any
applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with the
Company ("COMPANY RESTRICTED STOCK") shall be substituted with Exchange
Stock, which shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including,
without limitation, vesting conditions) as such Company Restricted Stock,
except that current references to the Company shall, after the Effective
Time, mean Parent.   SECTION 2.06. [RESERVED].   SECTION 2.07. DISSENTING
SHARES. (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any
Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and held by a holder (a "DISSENTING SHAREHOLDER") who has not voted in
favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has dissented in
accordance with Chapter 13 of the CCC ("DISSENTING SHARES") as well as any
Shares (a "POTENTIAL DISSENTING SHARES") held by a holder (a "POTENTIAL
DISSENTING SHAREHOLDER") that are not voted in favor of the Merger but that
have not dissented in accordance with Chapter 13 of the CCC, shall not be
converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with
Section 2.01, but shall represent and become the right to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due such Dissenting Shareholder or
Potential Dissenting Shareholder pursuant to the laws of the State of
California, unless and until such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or
otherwise loses such holder\'s right to dissent under Chapter 13 of the
CCC. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or withdraws
or otherwise loses such holder\'s right to dissent, such former Dissenting
Shares or Potential Dissenting Shares held by such holder shall be treated as
if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into a right to receive,
upon surrender as provided above, such holders ratable portion of the Merger
Consideration, without any interest or dividends thereon, in accordance with
Section 2.01. In this Agreement, references to "Dissenting Shareholders"
shall be deemed to include Potential Dissenting Shareholders and references
to "Dissenting Shares" shall be deemed to include Potential Dissenting
Shares.   (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands
for  appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and 
any other instruments served pursuant to the CCC and received by the  Company
and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and  proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the CCC. The    10      Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,  make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to  settle or settle any
such demands.   SECTION 2.08. [RESERVED]   SECTION 2.09. AFFILIATES.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Merger Consideration
shall be delivered to a person who may be deemed an "affiliate" of the
Company in accordance with Section 6.08 hereof for purposes of Rule 145 under
the Securities Act until such person has executed and delivered to Parent an
executed copy of the affiliate letter contemplated in Section 6.08
hereof.   ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY  
As an inducement to Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement,
the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that,
except as disclosed in the Company\'s Disclosure Schedule, which has been
prepared by the Company and delivered to Parent and Merger Sub concurrently
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the "COMPANY DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE"), or in the Company\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2004 (as filed with the SEC on March 10, 2005), Current
Reports on Form 8-K (as filed with the SEC on February 10, 2005 and February
14, 2005) and Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A (as filed with the
SEC on April 12, 2005), to the Company\'s knowledge:   SECTION 3.01.
ORGANIZATION AND QUALIFICATION; SUBSIDIARIES. (a) Each of the Company and
each subsidiary of the Company (each a "SUBSIDIARY") is a corporation or
limited liability company, as the case may be, duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its organization and has the requisite corporate or other power and authority
and all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except
where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing or to have
such power, authority and governmental approvals would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in
Section 9.03(a)). Each of the Company and each Subsidiary is duly qualified
or licensed as a foreign corporation or limited liability company, as the
case may be, to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction
where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except for such failures to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.   (b) A true and complete list of all the Subsidiaries,
together with the  jurisdiction of incorporation of each Subsidiary and the
percentage of  the outstanding capital stock of each Subsidiary owned by the
Company  and each other Subsidiary, is set forth in Section 3.01(b) of the 
Company Disclosure Schedule. Except as disclosed in Section 3.01(b) of  the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not directly or  indirectly own
any equity or similar interest in, or any interest  convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for any    11     equity or similar
interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint  venture or other business
association or entity.   SECTION 3.02. ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BY-
LAWS. The Company has heretofore made available to Parent a complete and
correct copy of the Articles of Incorporation and the By-laws or equivalent
organizational documents, each as amended to date, of the Company. Such
Articles of Incorporation, By-laws or equivalent organizational documents are
in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in
violation of any of the provisions of its Articles of Incorporation, By-laws
or equivalent organizational documents. The Company has heretofore provided
to the Parent the minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors of the
Company and any committee thereof in respect of meetings of the Board of
Directors and such committees held since January 1, 2002 through the date
hereof for which minutes have been prepared and approved.   SECTION 3.03.
CAPITALIZATION. (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of
(i) 100,000,000 Shares and (ii) 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par
value $0.001 per share ("COMPANY PREFERRED STOCK"). As of April 2, 2005, (i)
7,985,085 Shares were issued and outstanding, all of which are validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable, (ii) no Shares are held in the treasury
of the Company, (iii) no Shares are held by the Subsidiaries, and
(iv) 230,995 Shares are reserved for future issuance pursuant to outstanding
Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock and other purchase rights
(the "COMPANY STOCK AWARDS") granted pursuant to the Company Stock Option
Plans. As of the date of this Agreement, no shares of Company Preferred Stock
are issued and outstanding. Except as set forth in this Section 3.03 there
are no options, warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements or
commitments of any character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock
of the Company or any Subsidiary or obligating the Company or any Subsidiary
to issue or sell any shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests
in, the Company or any Subsidiary. As of April 2, 2005, there were (x)
265,510 outstanding Unvested Options exercisable for an aggregate of 265,510
Shares at a weighted average exercise price of US$12.27 per Share, and (y)
512,026 Company Stock Options (excluding Unvested Options), exercisable for
an aggregate of 512,026 Shares at a weighted average exercise price of
US$8.23 per Share. As of the date of this Agreement, there were 117,668
Shares of unvested Company Restricted Stock. The Company has made available
to Parent accurate and complete copies of all Company Stock Option Plans
pursuant to which Company has granted the Company Stock Awards that are
currently outstanding and the form of all stock award agreements evidencing
such Company Stock Awards. All Shares subject to issuance as aforesaid, upon
issuance on the terms and conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to
which they are issuable, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable. There are no outstanding contractual obligations of the
Company or any Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
Shares or any capital stock of any Subsidiary or to provide funds to, or make
any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in,
any Subsidiary or any other person. All outstanding Shares, all outstanding
Company Stock Awards, and all outstanding shares of capital stock of each
subsidiary of the Company have been issued and granted in compliance with (i)
all applicable securities laws and other applicable Laws (as defined below)
and (ii) all requirements set forth in applicable contracts.    
12     (b) Each outstanding share of capital stock of each Subsidiary is
duly  authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and each 
such share is owned by the Company or another Subsidiary free and  clear of
all security interests, liens, claims, pledges, options,  rights of first
refusal, agreements, limitations on the Company\'s or  any Subsidiary\'s
voting rights, charges and other encumbrances of any  nature whatsoever.  
SECTION 3.04. AUTHORITY RELATIVE TO THIS AGREEMENT. The Company has
all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and
the consummation by the Company of the Transactions have been duly and
validly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the Transactions (other than, with respect to the
Merger, the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a
majority of the then-outstanding Shares and the filing and recordation of
appropriate merger documents as required by the CCC). This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms (except as may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights
of creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies). No state
takeover statute is applicable to the Merger or the Transactions.   SECTION
3.05. NO CONFLICT; REQUIRED FILINGS AND CONSENTS. (a) The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and the performance of this
Agreement by the Company will not, (i) conflict with or violate the Articles
of Incorporation or By-laws or any equivalent organizational documents of the
Company or any Subsidiary, (ii) conflict with or violate any United States or
non-United States statute, law, ordinance, regulation, rule, code, executive
order, injunction, judgment, decree or other order ("LAW") applicable to the
Company or any Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of the Company or
any Subsidiary is bound or affected, or (iii) result in any breach of or
constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time
or both, would become a default) under, or give to others any right of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a lien or other encumbrance on any property or asset of the
Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to, any Material Contract (as defined
below), except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such
conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do
not,  and the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not,
require  any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with
or  notification to, any United States federal, state, county or local or 
other foreign government, governmental, regulatory or administrative 
authority, agency, instrumentality or commission or any court,  tribunal, or
judicial or arbitral body (a "GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY"),  except (i) for
applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act,  state securities or
"blue sky" laws ("BLUE SKY LAWS"), the pre-merger  notification requirements
of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust  Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the
"HSR ACT") and filing and  recordation of appropriate merger documents as
required by the CCC,  and (ii) where the failure to obtain such consents,
approvals,  authorizations or permits, or to     13     make such
filings or notifications, would not, individually or in the  aggregate,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material  Adverse
Effect.   SECTION 3.06. PERMITS; COMPLIANCE. Each of the Company and the
Subsidiaries is in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations,
licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions, consents, certificates,
approvals and orders of any Governmental Authority necessary for each of the
Company or the Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate its properties or to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted (the "COMPANY Permits"),
except where the failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation of, any
of the Company Permits would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, no
suspension or cancellation of any of the Company Permits is pending or
threatened, except where the failure to have, or the suspension or
cancellation of, any of the Company Permits would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary is in conflict with, or in default, breach or violation of,
(a) any Law applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary or by which any
property or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary is bound or affected, or
(b) any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license,
Company Permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which the
Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or
any Subsidiary or any property or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary is
bound, except for any such conflicts, defaults, breaches or violations that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   SECTION 3.07. SEC FILINGS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. (a) The Company
has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be filed by it with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") since December 31, 2004,
and has heretofore previously made available to Parent, in the form filed
with the SEC, (i) its Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended
December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively, (ii) all proxy statements
relating to the Company\'s meetings of stockholders (whether annual or
special) held since May 20, 2003 and (iii) all other forms, reports and other
registration statements filed by the Company with the SEC since December 31,
2004 (the forms, reports and other documents referred to in clauses (i),
(ii), (iii) and (iv) above being, collectively, the "COMPANY SEC REPORTS").
The Company SEC Reports (i) complied in all material respects with either the
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "SECURITIES
ACT"), or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "EXCHANGE
ACT"), as the case may be, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, and (ii) did not, at the time they were filed, or, if amended, as
of the date of such amendment, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that to the
extent information as of a later date conflicts with information of an
earlier date, the information of such later date shall be deemed to
modify such earlier information. No Subsidiary is required to file any form,
report or other document with the SEC.   (b) Each of the consolidated
financial statements (including, in each  case, any notes thereto) contained
in the Company SEC Reports was  prepared in accordance with United States
generally accepted  accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent
basis (except  that unaudited financial statements are subject to year-end
audit  adjustments and may not contain notes in full compliance with GAAP) 
throughout the periods indicated (except as may be    14     indicated
in the notes thereto) and each fairly presents, in all  material respects,
the consolidated financial position, results of  operations and cash flows of
the Company and its consolidated  Subsidiaries as at the respective dates
thereof and for the respective  periods indicated therein.   (c) Except as
and to the extent set forth on, or reserved against, the  consolidated
balance sheet of the Company and the Subsidiaries as at  December 31, 2004,
including the notes thereto (the "2004 BALANCE  SHEET"), neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary has any liability or  obligation of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or  otherwise), except for liabilities and
obligations, incurred in the  ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice since  December 31, 2004, which have not had, individually or
in the  aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (d) The Company has
responded to all comments or requests received from  the SEC or the staff of
the SEC since January 1, 2002 and the SEC or  the staff of the SEC, as the
case may be, has not made any  supplemental comments or requests with respect
to the matters  described therein.   (e) The Company has timely filed all
certifications and statements  required by (x) Rule 13a-14 or Rule 15d-14
under the Exchange Act or  (y) 18 U.S.C. Section 1350 (Section 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of  2002) with respect to any Company SEC Report. The
Company maintains  disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15
or Rule  15d-15 under the Exchange Act; such controls and procedures are 
effective to ensure that all material information concerning the  Company and
its Subsidiaries is made known on a timely basis to the  individuals
responsible for the preparation of the Company\'s SEC  filings.   (f) The
Company maintains and will continue to maintain books and records  in
accordance with GAAP, in all material respects and to the extent  that GAAP
is applicable to the maintenance of books and records. The  Company and its
Subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting  controls sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance that (i)  transactions are executed in
accordance with management\'s general or  specific authorizations, (ii)
transactions are recorded as necessary  to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP,  (iii) access to assets is permitted only
in accordance with  management\'s general or specific authorization and (iv)
the recorded  accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets
at  reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to 
any differences.   (g) Accounts receivable, book debts and other debts due
or accruing to the  Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, reflected
on the 2004  Balance Sheet or arising thereafter, have arisen, in all
material  respects, from BONA FIDE, arm\'s length transactions between
unrelated  parties in the ordinary course of business consistent with past 
practice and, subject to an allowance for doubtful accounts that has  been
reflected on the books and records of the Company and its  Subsidiaries, as
applicable, in accordance with GAAP and the  regulations of the SEC, which
are collectible without setoff or  counterclaim, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate,  have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   (h) Accounts payable of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a  whole, reflected on the 2004 Balance Sheet or arising thereafter are,  in
all material respects, the result of     15     bona fide transactions
in the ordinary course of business and have  been paid or are not yet due or
payable. Since the date of the 2004  Balance Sheet, the Company and its
Subsidiaries have not altered in  any material respects their practices for
the payment of such accounts  payable, including the timing of such payment,
except as would not,  individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse  Effect.   (i) The work in progress reflected on the 2004
Balance Sheet was owned by  the Company and its Subsidiaries on December 31,
2004. The value of  such work in progress at December 31, 2004 has been
recorded  appropriately and represents work in progress that can be invoiced
and  collected in the ordinary course of business, except as would not, 
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse 
Effect.   (j) The Company and its Subsidiaries have appropriately accrued
project  liabilities on its financial statements in accordance with GAAP,
in  all material respects.   (k) The Company and its Subsidiaries have
appropriately deferred the  recognition of revenues on projects where amounts
have been invoiced  in advance of the underlying work having been completed
in accordance  with GAAP, in all material respects.   SECTION 3.08. ABSENCE
OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. Since December 31, 2004, except as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement (a) the Company and the Subsidiaries have
conducted their businesses in all material respects only in the ordinary
course and in a manner consistent with past practice, and (b) there has not
been any Company Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 3.09. ABSENCE OF
LITIGATION. Except as set forth in Section 3.09 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there is no (i) litigation, suit, claim, action, proceeding or
investigation (an "ACTION") pending or threatened against the Company or any
Subsidiary, or any property or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary, before
any Governmental Authority, or (ii) material property or asset of the Company
or any Subsidiary that is subject to any continuing order of, consent decree,
settlement agreement or other similar written agreement with, or continuing
investigation by, any Governmental Authority, or any order, writ, judgment,
injunction, decree, determination or award of any Governmental Authority
that, in each case, would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 3.10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. (a) Section
3.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists (i) all employee benefit
plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")) and all other material employment benefit
agreements or arrangements including, without limitation, all bonus, stock
option, stock purchase, restricted stock, incentive, deferred compensation,
retiree medical or life insurance, supplemental retirement, severance or
other benefit plans, programs or arrangements, and employment, termination,
severance or other contracts or agreements to which the Company or any
Subsidiary is a party, which are maintained, contributed to or sponsored by
the Company or any Subsidiary for the benefit of any current or former
employee, officer or director of the Company or any Subsidiary, (ii) each
employee benefit plan for which the Company or any   
16     Subsidiary could incur liability under Section 4069 of ERISA in
the event such plan has been or were to be terminated, (iii) any plan in
respect of which the Company or any Subsidiary could incur liability under
Section 4212(c) of ERISA (collectively, the "PLANS"). Neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary has any express or implied commitment, whether legally
enforceable or not, (i) to create, incur liability with respect to or cause
to exist any other Plan, or (ii) to modify, change or terminate any Plan,
other than with respect to a modification, change or termination required by
ERISA, the Code or this Agreement.   (b) None of the Plans is a
multiemployer plan (within the meaning of  Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA) (a "MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN") or a  single employer pension plan (within
the meaning of Section  4001(a)(15) of ERISA) for which the Company or any
Subsidiary could  incur liability under Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA (a
"MULTIPLE  EMPLOYER PLAN"). None of the Plans (i) obligates the Company or
any  Subsidiary to pay separation, severance, termination or similar-type 
benefits solely or partially as a result of any transaction  contemplated by
this Agreement, or (ii) obligates the Company or any  Subsidiary to make any
payment or provide any benefit as a result of a  "change in control", within
the meaning of such term under Section  280G of the Code. None of the Plans
provides for or promises retiree  medical, disability or life insurance
benefits to any current or  former employee, officer or director of the
Company or any Subsidiary.   (c) Each Plan is now and always has been
operated in all material respects  in accordance with its terms and the
requirements of all applicable  Laws including, without limitation, ERISA and
the Code. The Company  and the Subsidiaries have performed all obligations
required to be  performed by them under, are not in any respect in default
under or in  violation of, and have no knowledge of any default or violation
by any  party to, any Plan. No Action is pending or threatened with respect
to  any Plan (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course) and  no
fact or event exists that could reasonably be expected to give rise  to any
such Action. The Company and the Subsidiaries are in compliance  with the
applicable requirements of Section 4980(B) of the Code, with  respect to each
Plan that is a "group health plan", as such term is  defined in Section
5000(b)(1) of the Code.   (d) Each Plan that is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the  Code or Section 401(k) of the Code has timely
received a favorable  determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service
(the "IRS")  covering all of the provisions applicable to the Plan for
which  determination letters are currently available that the Plan is so 
qualified and each trust established in connection with any Plan which  is
intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section  501(a) of
the Code has received a determination letter from the IRS  that it is so
exempt, and no fact or event has occurred since the date  of such
determination letter or letters from the IRS to adversely  affect the
qualified status of any such Plan or the exempt status of  any such trust.
Each Plan that is intended to be qualified under  Section 401(a) of the Code
has been submitted to the IRS for a  determination that "GUST" amendments
have been appropriately made  prior to the end of the GUST remedial period.
Each Plan that is  intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code

of the  Economic Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act, and such amendments 
were effective prior to the applicable amendment deadline.   (e) There has
not been any prohibited transaction (within the meaning of  Section 406 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any  Plan. Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary has incurred any  liability under, arising out of
or by operation of     17     Title IV of ERISA (other than liability
for premiums to the Pension  Benefit Guaranty Corporation arising in the
ordinary course),  including, without limitation, any liability in connection
with (i)  the termination or reorganization of any employee benefit plan
subject  to Title IV of ERISA, or (ii) the withdrawal from any
Multiemployer  Plan or Multiple Employer Plan, and no fact or event exists
which  could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such liability.  
(f) All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made with  respect
to any Plan have been made on or before their due dates. All  such
contributions have been fully deducted for income tax purposes  and no such
deduction has been challenged or disallowed by any  Governmental Authority

each Non-U.S. Benefit  Plan required by law or by the terms of such Non-U.S.
Benefit  Plan have been made, or, if applicable, accrued in accordance  with
normal accounting practices, and a pro rata contribution for  the period
prior to and including the date of this Agreement has  been made or
accrued;   (ii) the fair market value of the assets of each funded
Non-U.S.  Benefit Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Non-U.S. 
Benefit Plan funded through insurance or the book reserve  established for
any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan, together with any  accrued contributions, is
sufficient to procure or provide for  the benefits determined on any ongoing
basis (actual or  contingent) accrued to the date of this Agreement with
respect to  all current and former participants under such Non-U.S. Benefit 
Plan according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most  recently
used to determine employer contributions to such  Non-U.S. Benefit Plan, and
no Transaction shall cause such assets  or insurance obligations to be less
than such benefit  obligations; and   (iii) each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan
required to be registered has been  registered and has been maintained in
good standing with  applicable regulatory authorities. Each Non-U.S. Benefit
Plan has  been operated in full compliance with all applicable non-United 
States laws.   SECTION 3.11. LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT MATTERS. (a) Except as set

employment or employment practices, for any reason,  including, without
limitation, age, gender, race, religion or other  legally protected category,
which has been asserted or is now pending  or threatened before the United

Property (the "LEASES") are valid, binding and in full force and effect and
there is not, under any such Leases, any existing material default

or both, would constitute a default) by the Company or any Subsidiary.  
(b) There are no material contractual or material legal restrictions that 
preclude or restrict the ability to use any real property leased by  the
Company or any Subsidiary for the purposes for which it is  currently being

or any Subsidiary other  than those that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a  Company Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 3.13.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (a) the conduct of the business of
the Company and the Subsidiaries as currently conducted does not infringe
upon or misappropriate the Intellectual Property rights of any third party,

the business of the Company and the Subsidiaries as currently conducted
infringes upon or may infringe upon or misappropriates the Intellectual
Property Rights of any third party; (b) with respect to each item of
Intellectual Property owned by the Company or a Subsidiary and material to

to include in income any adjustment pursuant to Section 481 of the Code by
reason of a voluntary change in accounting method initiated by the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries, and the IRS has not initiated or proposed any such
adjustment or change in accounting method, in either case which adjustment or
change would have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor

Forms, dated as of March 30, 2005, March 31, 2004 and May 15, 2003, (ii) the
Management Information Circular for Annual and Special Meeting, May 10, 2005;
and (iii) the 2004, 2003 and 2002 Annual Reports (the form, reports and other
documents referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) being collectively, the
"PARENT REPORTS"). The Parent Reports (i) complied in all material respects
with the requirements of the Alberta Securities Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and (ii) did not, at the time they were
filed, or, if amended, as of the date of such amendment, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, except that to the extent information as of a later date
conflicts with information of an earlier date, the information of such later
date shall be deemed to modify such earlier information. No subsidiary of
Parent is required to file any form, report or other document with the
ASC.   (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in
each  case, any notes thereto) contained in the Parent Reports was prepared 
in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles 
("CANADIAN GAAP") applied on a consistent basis (except that unaudited 
financial statements are subject to year-end audit adjustments and may  not
contain notes in full compliance with Canadian GAAP) throughout  the periods
indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes  thereto) and each fairly
presents, in all material respects, the  consolidated financial position,
results of operations and cash flows  of Parent and its consolidated
subsidiaries as at the respective dates  thereof and for the respective
periods indicated therein.   (c) Except as and to the extent set forth on,
or reserved against, the  consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its
consolidated subsidiaries  as at December 31, 2004, including the notes
thereto (the "PARENT 2004  BALANCE SHEET"), neither the Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has  any liability or obligation of any nature (whether accrued,
absolute,  contingent or otherwise), except for liabilities and
obligations,  incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past  practice since December 31, 2004, which have not had, individually or 
in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   (d) Parent has
responded to all comments or requests received from the ASC  or the staff of
the ASC since January 1, 2002 and the ASC or the staff  of the ASC, as the
case may be, has not made any supplemental comments  or requests with respect
to the matters described therein.   (e) Parent maintains and will continue
to maintain a system of accounting  established and administered in
accordance with Canadian GAAP, in all  material respects and to the extent
Canadian GAAP is applicable to a  system of accounting. Parent and its
subsidiaries maintain a system of  internal accounting controls sufficient to
provide reasonable  assurance that    27     (i) transactions are
executed in accordance with management\'s general  or specific
authorizations, (ii) transactions are recorded as  necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity  with Canadian GAAP, (iii)
access to assets is permitted only in  accordance with management\'s general
or specific authorization and  (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is
compared with the  existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate
action is  taken with respect to any differences.   (f) Accounts
receivable, book debts and other debts due or accruing to  Parent and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and reflected on the  Parent 2004 Balance
Sheet or arising thereafter, have arisen, in al  material respects, from BONA
FIDE, arm\'s length transactions between  unrelated parties in the ordinary
course of business consistent with  past practice and, subject to an
allowance for doubtful accounts that  has been reflected on the books and
records of the Parent and its  subsidiaries, as applicable, in accordance
with Canadian GAAP and the  regulations of the ASC, which are collectible
without setoff or  counterclaim, except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate,  have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   (g) Accounts payable
of Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,  reflected on the Parent
2004 Balance Sheet or arising thereafter are,  in all material respects, the
result of BONA FIDE transactions in the  ordinary course of business and have
been paid or are not yet due or  payable. Since the date of the Parent 2004
Balance Sheet, Parent and  its subsidiaries have not altered in any material
respects their  practices for the payment of such accounts payable, including
the  timing of such payment, except as would not, individually or in the 
aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   (h) The work in progress
reflected on the Parent 2004 Balance Sheet was  owned by Parent and its
subsidiaries on December 31, 2004. The value  of such work in progress at
December 31, 2004 has been recorded  appropriately and represents work in
progress that can be invoiced and  collected in the ordinary course of
business, except as would not,  individually or in the aggregate, have a
Parent Material Adverse  Effect.   (i) Parent and its Subsidiaries have
appropriately accrued project  liabilities on its financial statements in
accordance with Canadian  GAAP, in all material respects.   (j) Parent and
its Subsidiaries have appropriately deferred the  recognition of revenues on
projects where amounts have been invoiced  in advance of the underlying work
having been completed in accordance  with Canadian GAAP, in all material
respects.   SECTION 4.08. ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. Since
December 31, 2004 or as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, (a) Parent
has conducted its business only in the ordinary course and in a manner
consistent with past practice, and (b) there has not been any Parent Material
Adverse Effect.   SECTION 4.09. ABSENCE OF LITIGATION. Except as
specifically disclosed in any Parent Report filed prior to the date of this
Agreement, there is no Action pending or threatened against Parent or Merger
Sub, or any property or asset of Parent or Merger Sub, before any
Governmental Authority that (a) individually or in the aggregate, has had or
would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (b) seeks to materially delay
or prevent the consummation of the     28    Merger. Neither Parent
nor Merger Sub nor any material property or asset of Parent or Merger Sub is
subject to any continuing order of, consent decree, settlement agreement or
other similar written agreement with, or continuing investigation by, any
Governmental Authority that would, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 4.10. STOCKHOLDER VOTE. The sole
stockholder of Merger Sub has approved this Agreement and the consummation of
the Transactions. No vote of the stockholders of Parent is required by Law,
Parent\'s Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws or otherwise in order for
Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions.   SECTION 4.11.
OPERATIONS OF MERGER SUB. Merger Sub is a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent, was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions,
has engaged in no other business activities and has conducted its operations
only as contemplated by this Agreement.   SECTION 4.12. TAXES. Parent and
its subsidiaries have filed all Canadian federal, provincial, local and non-
Canadian Tax returns and reports required to be filed by them and have paid
and discharged all Taxes required to be paid or discharged, other than such
payments as are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings. All
such Tax returns are true, accurate and complete. Neither the Canada Revenue
Agency nor any other Canadian or non-Canadian taxing authority or agency is
now asserting or threatening to assert against Parent or any subsidiary any
deficiency or claim for any Taxes or interest thereon or penalties in
connection therewith. Neither Parent nor any subsidiary has granted any
waiver of any statute of limitations with respect to, or any extension of
a period for the assessment of, any Tax. The accruals and reserves for
Taxes reflected in the Parent 2004 Balance Sheet are adequate to cover all
Taxes accruable through such date (including interest and penalties, if any,
thereon) in accordance with Canadian GAAP. There are no Tax liens upon any
property or assets of Parent or any of the subsidiaries except liens for
current Taxes not yet delinquent. Neither Parent nor any of its affiliates
has taken or agreed to take any action that would prevent the Merger from
qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. Parent is not aware of any agreement, plan or other circumstance that
would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Neither Parent nor any of its
subsidiaries has been required to include in income any adjustment by reason
of a voluntary change in accounting method initiated by Parent or any of its
subsidiaries, and the Canada Revenue Agency has not initiated or proposed any
such adjustment or change in accounting method, in either case, which
adjustment or change would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION
4.13. BOARD APPROVAL. The board of directors of each of Parent and Merger
Sub, by resolutions duly adopted by unanimous vote of those voting at
a meeting duly called and held and not subsequently rescinded or modified in
any way, has (i) determined that this Agreement and the Merger are fair and
in the best interests of Parent and Merger Sub and their respective
stockholders, (ii) approved this Agreement and Merger, and (iii) in the case
of the board of directors of the Parent, have approved the registration of
the Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Transactions
under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the listing of the Parent
Common Stock for trading on the U.S. Exchange.     29     SECTION
4.14. [Reserved].   SECTION 4.15. OWNERSHIP OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK. As of
the date hereof, neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries, owns any
Shares.   SECTION 4.16. BROKERS. No broker, finder or investment banker is
entitled to any brokerage, finder\'s or other fee or commission in connection
with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent
or Merger Sub.   SECTION 4.17. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (a)
the conduct of the business of Parent and its subsidiaries as currently
conducted does not infringe upon or misappropriate the Intellectual Property
rights of any third party, and no claim has been asserted to Parent that the
conduct of the business of Parent and its subsidiaries as currently conducted
infringes upon or may infringe upon or misappropriates the Intellectual
Property Rights of any third party; (b) with respect to each item of
Intellectual Property owned by Parent or a subsidiary of Parent and material
to the business, financial condition or results of operations of Parent and
its subsidiaries taken as a whole ("PARENT OWNED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY"),
Parent or a subsidiary of Parent is the owner of the entire right, title and
interest in and to such Parent Owned Intellectual Property and is entitled to
use such Parent Owned Intellectual Property in the continued operation of its
respective business; (c) with respect to each item of Intellectual Property
licensed to Parent or a subsidiary of Parent that is material to the business
of Parent and its subsidiaries as currently conducted ("PARENT LICENSED
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY"), Parent or a subsidiary of Parent has the right to
use such Parent Licensed Intellectual Property in the continued operation of
its business in accordance with the terms of the license agreement governing
such Parent Licensed Intellectual Property; and (d) Parent Owned Intellectual
Property is valid and enforceable, and has not been adjudged invalid or
unenforceable in whole or in part.   SECTION 4.18. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.
Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect, (a) neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries has violated
or is in violation of any Environmental Law; (b) none of the properties
currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by Parent or any subsidiary
of Parent (including, without limitation, soils and surface and ground
waters) are contaminated with any Hazardous Substance; (c) neither Parent nor
any of its subsidiaries is actually, potentially or allegedly liable for any
off-site contamination by Hazardous Substances; (d) neither Parent nor any of
its subsidiaries is actually, potentially or allegedly liable under any
Environmental Law (including, without limitation, pending or threatened
liens); (e) each of Parent and its subsidiaries has all
Environmental Permits; and (f) each of the Parent and its subsidiaries is in
compliance with its Environmental Permits; and (g) neither the execution of
this Agreement nor the consummation of the Merger will require any
investigation, remediation or other action with respect to Hazardous
Substances, or any notice to or consent of Governmental Authorities or third
parties, pursuant to any applicable Environmental Law or Environmental
Permit.     30     ARTICLE V   CONDUCT OF BUSINESS PENDING THE

CONFIDENTIALITY. (a) Except pursuant to applicable Law, from the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall (and shall
cause their respective subsidiaries to): (i) provide to the other party (and
the other party\'s officers, directors, employees, accountants, consultants,
legal counsel, agents and other representatives, collectively,
"REPRESENTATIVES") access at reasonable times upon prior notice to the
officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and other facilities of such
party and its subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof; and (ii)

properties, contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel and other aspects of
such party and its subsidiaries as the other party or its Representatives may

TRANSACTIONS. (a) The Company agrees that neither it nor any Subsidiary nor
any of the directors, officers or employees of it or any Subsidiary will, and
that it will not authorize or knowingly permit its or its Subsidiaries\'
agents, advisors and other representatives (including, without limitation,
any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any
Subsidiary) to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage
(including by way of furnishing nonpublic information), or take any other
action to facilitate the making of any proposal or offer (including, without
limitation, any proposal or offer to its stockholders) that constitutes, or
may reasonably be expected to lead to, a Competing    35    Transaction
(as defined below), or (ii) enter into or maintain or continue discussions or
negotiations with any person or entity in furtherance of such inquiries or to
obtain a proposal or offer for a Competing Transaction, or (iii) agree to,
approve, endorse or recommend any Competing Transaction or enter into any
letter of intent or other contract, agreement or commitment contemplating
or otherwise relating to any Competing Transaction. The Company shall notify
Parent as promptly as practicable (and in any event within two (2) days after
any director or executive officer of the Company attains knowledge thereof),
orally and promptly thereafter in writing, if any proposal or offer, or any
inquiry or contact with any person with respect thereto, regarding a
Competing Transaction is made, specifying the material terms and conditions
thereof and the identity of the party making such proposal or offer or
inquiry or contact (including material amendments or proposed material
amendments). The Company shall provide Parent with 48 hours prior notice (or
such lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of the Company Board)
of any meeting of the Company Board at which the Company Board is reasonably
expected to consider any Competing Transaction. The Company immediately shall
cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations
with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to a Competing
Transaction. The Company shall not release any third party from, or waive any
provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a
party.   (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.04,
the  Company Board may furnish information to, and enter into discussions 
with, a person who has made an unsolicited, written, bona fide  proposal or
offer regarding a Competing Transaction, if the Company  Board has (i)
determined, in its good faith judgment (after having  received the advice of
a financial advisor of nationally recognized  reputation), that such proposal
or offer constitutes a Superior  Proposal (as defined below), (ii)
determined, in its good faith  judgment after consultation with independent
legal counsel (who may be  the Company\'s regularly engaged independent legal
counsel), that, in  light of such Superior Proposal, the failure to furnish
such  information or enter into discussions would cause the members of the 
Company Board of Directors to breach their fiduciary duties to the  Company
and its stockholders under applicable Law, (iii) provided  written notice to
Parent of its intent to furnish information or enter  into discussions with
such person at least three (3) business days  prior to taking any such
action, and (iv) obtained from such person an  executed confidentiality
agreement on terms no less favorable to the  Company than those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement (it  being understood that such confidentiality
agreement and any related  agreements shall not include any provision calling
for any exclusive  right to negotiate with such party or having the effect of
prohibiting  the Company from satisfying its obligations under this
Agreement).   (c) Except as set forth in this Section 6.04(c), neither the
Company Board  nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or modify, or propose
to  withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the 
Company Recommendation (a "CHANGE IN THE COMPANY RECOMMENDATION") or  approve
or recommend, or cause or permit the Company to enter into any  letter of
intent, agreement or obligation with respect to, any  Competing Transaction.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company  Board determines, in its good
faith judgment prior to the time of the  Company Stockholders\' Meeting and
after consultation with independent  legal counsel (who may be the Company\'s
regularly engaged independent  legal counsel), that a failure to make a
Change in the Company  Recommendation would cause the members of the Company
Board of  Directors to breach their fiduciary duties to the Company and its 
stockholders    36     under applicable Law, the Company Board may (i)
recommend a Superior  Proposal or (ii) terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(g),  but only (A) after providing written notice to Parent (a
"NOTICE OF  SUPERIOR PROPOSAL") advising Parent that the Company Board has 
received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and  conditions
of such Superior Proposal and identifying the person making  such Superior
Proposal and indicating that the Company Board intends  to effect a Change in
the Company Recommendation and the manner in  which it intends (or may
intend) to do so, and (B) if Parent does not,  within three (3) business days
of Parent\'s receipt of the Notice of  Superior Proposal, make an offer that
the Company Board determines, in  its good faith judgment (after having

SEVERABILITY. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or public policy,
all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order
that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.   SECTION 9.05. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENT.
This Agreement and the Support Agreement constitute the entire agreement
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede,
except as set forth in Sections 6.03(b), all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned
(whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of law or otherwise), except that
Parent and Merger Sub may assign all or any of their rights and obligations
hereunder to any affiliate of Parent, PROVIDED that no such assignment shall
relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder if such assignee
does not perform such obligations.   SECTION 9.06. PARTIES IN INTEREST. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party
hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or    54    implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.  
SECTION 9.07. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall
be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any
other remedy at law or equity.   SECTION 9.08. GOVERNING LAW. This
Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of
the State of New York applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed
in that State (other than those provisions set forth herein that are required
to be governed by the CCC). All actions and proceedings arising out of or
relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively in any
New York state or federal court. The parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any New York state or federal court for the purpose
of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any
party hereto, and (b) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of
motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not
subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its
property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is
brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper,
or that this Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by any
of the above-named courts.   SECTION 9.09. HEADINGS. The descriptive
headings contained in this Agreement are included for convenience of
reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement.   SECTION 9.10. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be
executed and delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.   SECTION
9.11. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law any right it may have to a trial
by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of,
under or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. Each of the
parties hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any
other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other
party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing
waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other hereto have been induced to
enter into this Agreement and the Transactions, as applicable, by, among
other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section
9.11.    55      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have caused this Agreement to be executed as of the date first
written above by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized.

AFFILIATES OF THE COMPANY   [___] [_], 2005   Stantec Inc. 10160 - 112
Street Edmonton, Alberta T5K 2L6 Canada  Ladies and Gentlemen:   I have
been advised that as of the date of this letter I may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of The Keith Companies, Inc., (the "COMPANY"), as the
term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule
145 of the rules and regulations (the "RULES AND REGULATIONS") of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "COMMISSION") under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the "ACT"). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement
and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of April 14, 2005 (the
"MERGER AGREEMENT"), among Stantec Inc., a Canadian corporation ("PARENT"),
Stantec Consulting California Inc. a California corporation ("MERGER SUB"),
and the Company, the Company will be merged with and into Merger Sub (the
"MERGER"). Capitalized terms used in this letter agreement without definition
shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Merger Agreement.   As a
result of the Merger, I may receive shares of common stock, without par
value, of Parent (the "PARENT SHARES"). I would receive such Parent Shares in
exchange for shares (or upon exercise of options for shares) owned by me
of common stock, par value US$ per share, of the Company (the "COMPANY
SHARES").   I represent, warrant and covenant to Parent that in the event I
receive any Parent Shares as a result of the Merger:   A. I shall not make
any sale, transfer or other disposition of the Parent  Shares in violation of
the Act or the Rules and Regulations.   B. I have carefully read this letter
and the Merger Agreement and  discussed the requirements of such documents
and other applicable  limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer or
otherwise dispose of  the Parent Shares, to the extent I felt necessary, with
my counsel or  counsel for the Company.   C. I have been advised that the
issuance of the Parent Shares to me  pursuant to the Merger has been
registered with the Commission under  the Act on a Registration Statement on
Form F-4. However, I have also  been advised that, because at the time the
Merger is submitted for a  vote of the shareholders of the Company, (a) I may
be deemed to be an  affiliate of the Company and (b) the distribution by me
of the Parent  Shares has not been registered under the Act, I may not sell,
transfer  or otherwise dispose of the Parent Shares issued to me in the
Merger  unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition       is
made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule  145
promulgated by the Commission under the Act, (ii) such sale,  transfer or
other disposition has been registered under the Act or  (iii) in the opinion
of counsel reasonably acceptable to Parent, such  sale, transfer or other
disposition is otherwise exempt from  registration under the Act.   D. I
understand that Parent is under no obligation to register the sale,  transfer
or other disposition of the Parent Shares by me or on my  behalf under the
Act or, except as provided in paragraph 2(A) below,  to take any other action
necessary in order to make compliance with an  exemption from such
registration available.   E. I understand that there will be placed on the
certificates for the  Parent Shares issued to me, or any substitutions
therefor, a legend  stating in substance:   "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS
CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A  TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER
THE SECURITIES  ACT OF 1933 APPLIES. THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS
CERTIFICATE  MAY ONLY BE TRANSFERRED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF AN 
AGREEMENT DATED [______], 2005 BETWEEN THE REGISTERED HOLDER  HEREOF AND
PARENT, A COPY OF WHICH AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT THE  PRINCIPAL OFFICES OF
PARENT."   F. I understand that unless a sale or transfer is made in
conformity with  the provisions of Rule 145, or pursuant to a registration
statement,  Parent reserves the right to put the following legend on the 
certificates issued to my transferee:   "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS
CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN  REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND
WERE ACQUIRED  FROM A PERSON WHO RECEIVED SUCH SHARES IN A TRANSACTION TO
WHICH  RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 APPLIES.  THE
SHARES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED BY THE HOLDER NOT WITH A VIEW TO,  OR FOR RESALE IN
CONNECTION WITH, ANY DISTRIBUTION THEREOF WITHIN  THE MEANING OF THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND MAY NOT BE SOLD,  PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED
EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN  EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF
THE SECURITIES  ACT OF 1933."   G. Execution of this letter should not be
considered an admission on my  part that I am an "affiliate" of the Company
as described in the first  paragraph of this letter, nor as a waiver of any
rights I may have to  object to any claim that I am such an affiliate on or
after the date  of this letter.     2       Very truly
yours,     -------------------------------------  Name:     Agreed
