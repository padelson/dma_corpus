ARTICLE 1

  

THE MERGER

  

  

1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware ("DGCL"), at the Effective Time, (i) the Merger Sub
will be merged with and into the Company in accordance with the provisions of
Section 251 of the DGCL, and the separate existence of the Merger Sub shall
cease, and (ii) the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation") in the Merger and shall continue its corporate existence under
the DGCL as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

  

 

  

1.2 Closing. The consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions (the
"Closing") will take place at the offices of DLA Piper LLP (US), 203 North
LaSalle Street, Suite 1900, Chicago, Illinois 60601-1293, as soon as
practicable after satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in
Article 7 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions), but in no event later than three (3) Business Days thereafter, or
at such other time and place as Parent and the Company may agree in writing
(the "Closing Date").

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

1.3 Effective Time. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as
soon as practicable during the Closing, the Merger Sub and the Company shall
cause the Merger to be consummated by filing all necessary documentation,
including a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time that the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or
at such later time as is agreed to by the parties hereto and specified in the
Certificate of Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective is
herein referred to as the "Effective Time").

  

  

1.4 Effects of the Merger.

  

  

(a) The Merger will have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, at the Effective Time, all properties, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company and the Merger Sub will vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, Liabilities and duties of the Company and the
Merger Sub, in each case, will become debts, Liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation except for the Excluded Assets and Liabilities.

  

  

(b) At the Effective Time, the Company's Charter, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, will be amended and restated to conform to the
articles of incorporation of the Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

  

  

(c) The directors of the Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and will hold
office from the Effective Time until their respective successors are duly
elected or appointed and qualified in the manner provided in the articles of
incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or as otherwise
provided by Law.

  

  

(d) The officers of the Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and will hold office
from the Effective Time until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified in the manner provided in the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or as otherwise provided
by Law.

  

  

(e) At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company will be amended and
restated to conform to the bylaws of the Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

  

 

  

1.5 Conversion of Company Stock in Merger.

  

  

(a) As of the Effective Time, each share of Senior Series A Preferred Stock
issued and outstanding (other than shares of Senior Series A Preferred Stock
to be cancelled in accordance with Section 1.5(e), and any Dissenting Shares)
immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, the Merger Sub, the Company or the
Shareholders, will be cancelled and extinguished, and each such share of
Senior Series A Preferred Stock will be converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to the Senior Series A Preferred Stock Per Share
Consideration and each holder of a Certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such outstanding shares of Senior Series A
Preferred Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Senior Series A
Preferred Per Share Consideration therefor, without any interest thereon, upon
the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.4. The amount
of cash each Shareholder is entitled to receive for the shares of Senior
Series A Preferred Stock held by such Shareholder will be rounded to the
nearest cent and computed after aggregating cash amounts for all shares of
Senior Series A Preferred Stock held by such Shareholder.

(b) As of the Effective Time, each share of Senior Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding (other than shares of Senior Preferred Stock to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 1.5(e), and any Dissenting Shares) immediately prior
to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Parent, the Merger Sub, the Company or the Shareholders, will be
cancelled and extinguished, and each such share of Senior Preferred Stock will
be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Senior
Preferred Stock Per Share Consideration and each holder of a Certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such outstanding
shares of Senior Preferred Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Senior
Preferred Stock Per Share Consideration therefor, without any interest
thereon, upon the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section
2.4. The amount of cash each Shareholder is entitled to receive for the shares
of Senior Preferred Stock held by such Shareholder will be rounded to the
nearest cent and computed after aggregating cash amounts for all shares of
Senior Preferred Stock held by such Shareholder.

  

  

(c) As of the Effective Time, each share of Series A Preferred Stock issued
and outstanding (other than shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be cancelled
in accordance with Section 1.5(e), and any Dissenting Shares) immediately
prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, the Merger Sub, the Company or the Shareholders, will be
cancelled and extinguished, and each such share of Series A Preferred Stock
will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the
Series A Preferred Stock Per Share Consideration and each holder of a
Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such
outstanding Series A Preferred Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Series A Preferred Stock Per Share Consideration therefor, without any
interest thereon, upon the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with
Section 2.4. The amount of cash each Shareholder is entitled to receive for
the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such Shareholder will be
rounded to the nearest cent and computed after aggregating cash amounts for
all shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such Shareholder.

  

 

  

(d) As of the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock issued and
outstanding (other than shares of Common Stock to be cancelled in accordance
with Section 1.5(e) hereof, and any Dissenting Shares) immediately prior to
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of Parent, the Merger Sub, the Company or the Shareholders, will be cancelled
and extinguished, and each such share of Common Stock will be converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Common Stock Per Share
Consideration and each holder of a Certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such outstanding shares of Common Stock (other
than Dissenting Shares) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Common Stock Per Share Consideration therefor,
without any interest thereon, upon the surrender of such Certificate in
accordance with Section 2.4. The amount of cash each Shareholder is entitled
to receive for the shares of Common Stock held by such Shareholder will be
rounded to the nearest cent and computed after aggregating cash amounts for
all shares of Common Stock held by such Shareholder.

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) All shares of Company Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and owned by any of Parent, Merger Sub and any
other Subsidiary of Parent and all shares of Company Stock held in the
treasury of the Company or owned by any Subsidiary of the Company shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, any and
all payments to the Shareholders contemplated by this Section 1.5 and the
other provisions of this Agreement shall be made subject to and in accordance
with the terms and conditions, including, without limitation, any priority
rights to payment, set forth in the Company's Third Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation dated as of September 13, 2006, as supplemented
by the Amended and Restated Certificate of Designation of the Senior Preferred
Stock of OF Air Holdings Corporation dated as of July 20, 2007, and as further
supplemented by the Certificate of Designation of the Senior Series A
Preferred Stock of OF Air Holdings Corporation dated as of May 29, 2009
(collectively, the "Company's Charter").

  

  

1.6 Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, each
issued and outstanding share of capital stock of the Merger Sub will be
automatically and without any action on the part of any Person converted into
one validly issued, fully-paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

  

  

1.7 Dissenter's Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Stock (the "Dissenting Shares") which are held by
a Shareholder who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in
writing), who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shareholders"), shall not be
converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the payments
contemplated by Section 1.5, but instead such Dissenting Shareholder shall be
entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time,
such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such Dissenting Shareholder shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such Dissenting Shareholder shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost rights to
appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting Shareholder shall have failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such
Dissenting Shareholder's Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if
they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive,
as of the Effective Time, the payments contemplated by Section 1.5, without
any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of any
written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Stock, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company relating to stockholders' rights of
appraisal, and (b) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
Proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make
any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such
demand for payment or waive any failure by a Shareholder to timely comply with
the requirements of the DGCL to perfect or demand appraisal rights.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Company (i) makes any payment or payments in respect of any
Dissenting Shares in excess of the consideration that otherwise would have
been payable in respect of such shares in accordance with this Agreement or
(ii) incurs any other reasonable costs or expenses, (including specifically,
but without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and expenses in
connection with any action or proceeding or in connection with any
investigation) in respect of any Dissenting Shares (excluding payments for
such shares) (together "Dissenting Share Payments"), Parent shall be entitled
to recover under the terms of Article 9 hereof the amount of such Dissenting
Share Payments without regard to the Deductible Amount.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

1.8 Treatment of Equity Awards. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
terminate the Company Option Plans and cause all outstanding options, stock
appreciation rights and other awards (the "Equity Awards") granted thereunder
to be executed or cancelled. The Company shall take all such actions,
including amending the Company Option Plans, as may be required to facilitate
the foregoing. Payments, if any, made to effectuate the termination of the
Company Option Plans and the cancellation of the Equity Awards shall be
referred to herein as the "Equity Award Payments". For the avoidance of doubt,
no outstanding Equity Awards shall be assumed by Parent.

  

  

1.9 Change of Control Payments. On the Closing Date, the Company shall pay
each employee, consultant and advisor the respective transaction bonus amounts
due and payable to such individual (collectively, the "Change of Control
Payments") as set forth in Section 1.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The
Company shall be responsible for any income or employment tax withholding
required under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law
with respect to the making of the Change of Control Payments. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be timely paid to
the appropriate Governmental Authority and shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to such employee, consultant and
advisor. The Company shall make all payments in accordance with this Section
1.9 on the Closing Date.

PAYMENTS AT CLOSING; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

  

  

2.1 Escrow Agreement. At the Effective Time, Parent, the Shareholder
Representative and the Escrow Agent will execute and deliver the Escrow
Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the "Escrow
Agreement"). Pursuant to the provisions of the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow
Agent will establish an escrow account to hold the Escrow Amount in trust
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement free of any Encumbrance which amount, plus
any interest accrued thereon (collectively, the "Escrow Fund"), will be
payable to the Shareholders less any amounts disbursed for the payment of (i)
indemnification claims asserted pursuant to Article 9 plus any interest
accrued on such amount; and (ii) the Merger Consideration Overpayment Amount
plus any interest accrued on such amount, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

2.2 Payment of Closing Indebtedness and Company Transaction Expenses.

  

  

(a) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall prepare and deliver to Parent (i) a statement setting forth the
Estimated Indebtedness (the "Indebtedness Statement"), (ii) an estimate of the
Closing Cash (the "Estimated Closing Cash"), and (iii) a list of all Company
Transaction Expenses owed to the applicable Representatives of the Company
(the "Transaction Expenses List"). Concurrently with the delivery of the
Indebtedness Statement, and the Transaction Expenses List, the Company shall
provide Parent with (A) customary pay-off letters, in form reasonably
acceptable to Parent, from all holders of the Indebtedness of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, which pay-off letters provide (I) the
amount due, as of the Closing Date, on such Indebtedness and (II) that upon
payment of such amount, such holder of Indebtedness shall release all
Encumbrances securing such Indebtedness and claims against the Company or its
Subsidiaries and their respective assets with respect to such Indebtedness (or
such similar language acceptable to Parent), and (B) wiring instructions for
each Representative of the Company to which Company Transaction Expenses are
to be paid.

  

  

(b) At the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, pay (i) to the applicable holders of the Indebtedness of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, the applicable amounts as
set forth in the Indebtedness Statement; and (ii) to the applicable
Representatives of the Company, the applicable amounts as set forth in the
Transaction Expenses List.

  

  

2.3 Payments at Closing. At the Effective Time, Parent will deposit via wire
transfer (a) the Closing Merger Consideration and the Shareholder
Representative Fund Amount with the Shareholder Representative and (b) the
Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent. Immediately following the Effective Time,
the Shareholder Representative will pay to the Shareholders their Pro Rata
Share of the Closing Merger Consideration, without interest, in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

2.4 Exchange Procedures.

  

  

(a) Subject to Section 2.4(c), the Shareholder Representative shall act as
paying agent in effecting the exchange of cash for certificates which,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represent shares of Company Stock
("Certificates") entitled to payment pursuant to Section 1.5. In furtherance
thereof, the Shareholder Representative agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts from the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date to secure (i) all
Certificates entitled to payment pursuant to Section 1.5 and (ii) the name,
current address and taxpayer identification number of each holder of any
Certificate. In the event the Shareholder Representative is not able to secure
substantially all Certificates from the holders thereof prior to the Closing
Date (together with the current address and taxpayer identification number of
such holders), the Shareholder Representative and Parent agree to negotiate in
good faith toward the execution of a mutually acceptable paying agent
agreement containing ordinary and customary terms. Nonetheless, at the
Effective Time, Parent shall deliver the Closing Merger Consideration to the
Shareholder Representative in accordance with Section 2.3. Subject to the
Shareholder Representative's receipt of the Closing Merger Consideration in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, the Shareholder
Representative shall pay to each Shareholder, upon surrender to the
Shareholder Representative of (a) such Shareholder's Certificate(s), duly
endorsed in blank or accompanied by duly executed stock powers, representing
the number of shares of each class of Company Stock held by such Shareholder
and (b) a letter of transmittal, in form and substance acceptable to the
Shareholder Representative, duly executed by or on behalf of such Shareholder,
the amount of cash to which such Shareholder is entitled under Section 1.5 and
this Article 2. Surrendered Certificates shall forthwith be canceled. After
the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates evidencing ownership of shares
of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Stock, except
as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable law. Until so surrendered
and exchanged, each such Certificate shall represent solely the right to
receive the portion of the Closing Merger Consideration and any additional
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement attributable to such
share of Company Stock formerly represented by such Certificate (subject to
Section 2.4(d)), except with respect to rights applicable to Dissenting
Shares, and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay the holder
thereof the cash to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then, upon the making of an affidavit of such fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, upon the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Shareholder
Representative with respect to such Certificate (provided that, if such Person
is a financial institution or other institutional investor, its own agreement
shall be satisfactory), the Shareholder Representative shall issue, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the portion of the
Closing Merger Consideration and any additional Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to this Agreement attributable to such share of Company Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate.

  

  

(b) Payment of the Merger Consideration shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Stock and
theretofore represented by such Certificates. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the Company Stock that was outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, valid Certificates are presented
to the Surviving Corporation or the Shareholder Representative for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.4.

  

 

  

(c) At any time following the expiration of one hundred twenty (120) days
after the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Shareholder
Representative to deliver to the Surviving Corporation, and, whether or not so
required by Parent, the Shareholder Representative shall be entitled to
deliver to the Surviving Corporation, all (but not less than all) of the
Closing Merger Consideration that had been delivered to the Shareholder
Representative and that has not been disbursed to holders of Certificates;
thereafter, the Shareholder Representative shall have no further obligations
under this Section 2.4 and such holders shall be entitled to look solely to
Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law), only as general creditors thereof, with
respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their
Certificates, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of Parent, the Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Shareholder
Representative shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding any implication to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, prior to delivery of any Closing Merger Consideration to the
Shareholder Representative, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, deduct and withhold from the Closing Merger Consideration
otherwise payable to any holder of Certificates pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any applicable Law; it being agreed
by the parties hereto that the Shareholder Representative, as paying agent for
Parent and the Surviving Corporation, shall have no obligation to make any
such deductions or withholdings and shall have no liability with respect
thereto. Parent shall properly and timely pay to the proper Governmental
Authority any amounts so deducted or withheld. To the extent that amounts are
so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

  

  

2.5 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest Parent with control over, and to vest
the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to, all
assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company
except for the Excluded Assets and Liabilities, the officers and directors of
the Company and the Shareholder Representative will and are hereby authorized
to, in the name of their respective corporations or otherwise, take all such
lawful and necessary action as may be requested by Parent.

  

  

2.6 Merger Consideration Adjustments.

  

  

(a) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall prepare (or cause to be prepared), issue and deliver to Parent its good
faith estimate of: (i) balance sheet of the Company setting forth the assets
and liabilities of the Company as of the Effective Time (the "Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet"), and (ii) the Net Working Capital (the "Estimated Net
Working Capital"). Parent and its Representatives shall have the right to
review and copy the computations and work papers (including accountants' work
papers) and the Company's underlying books and records used in connection with
the Company's computation and preparation of its proposed drafts of the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Net Working Capital. If
Parent disputes the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet (or any portion thereof)
or the Estimated Net Working Capital prior to the Closing, then Parent and the
Company will negotiate in good faith to resolve any such dispute at or prior
to Closing, but the resolution of any such dispute is not a condition to
Closing. Each of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Net
Working Capital shall be prepared in accordance with the methodology and the
accounting principles set forth in Exhibit D (the "Merger Consideration
Adjustment Methodology"). In the event the Estimated Net Working Capital (i)
exceeds the Net Working Capital Target, then the Closing Merger Consideration
shall be increased, dollar for dollar, by the amount that the Estimated Net
Working Capital exceeds the Net Working Capital Target; or (ii) is less than
the Net Working Capital Target, then the Closing Merger Consideration shall be
decreased, dollar for dollar, by the amount that the Net Working Capital
Target exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital (with such adjustment amount
under (i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence immediately above being the
"Working Capital Adjustment Amount").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60) days
following the Closing Date, Parent shall, in good faith, prepare (or cause to
be prepared), issue and deliver to the Shareholder Representative its
proposed: (i) balance sheet of the Company setting forth the assets and
liabilities of the Company as of the Effective Time (as finalized in
accordance with Section 2.6(d), the "Closing Balance Sheet"), (ii) statement
of the calculation of the Net Working Capital (as finalized in accordance with
Section 2.6(d), the "Net Working Capital Statement"), and (iii) statement of
the calculation of the Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount (as finalized in
accordance with Section 2.6(d), the "Adjustment Amount Statement"). The
Shareholder Representative and its Representatives shall have the right to
review and copy the computations and work papers (including accountants' work
papers) and the Surviving Corporation's underlying books and records used in
connection with Parent's computation and preparation of its proposed drafts of
the Closing Balance Sheet, the Net Working Capital Statement and the
Adjustment Amount Statement. Each of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Net
Working Capital Statement and the Adjustment Amount Statement shall be
prepared in accordance with the Merger Consideration Adjustment Methodology.

  

  

(c) Within thirty (30) days following Parent's delivery of its proposed
Closing Balance Sheet, Net Working Capital Statement and Adjustment Amount
Statement, the Shareholder Representative shall, in a written notice to
Parent, either accept Parent's proposed Closing Balance Sheet, Net Working
Capital Statement and Adjustment Amount Statement, or, in the event that the
Shareholder Representative believes that Parent's proposed Closing Balance
Sheet, Net Working Capital Statement and/or Adjustment Amount Statement were
not prepared in accordance with the Merger Consideration Adjustment
Methodology, deliver a notice (a "Dispute Notice") in writing prior to the
expiration of such thirty (30) day period. The Dispute Notice shall describe
in reasonable detail any proposed adjustments to Parent's proposed Closing
Balance Sheet, Net Working Capital Statement and/or Adjustment Amount
Statement which the Shareholder Representative believes should be made and the
basis therefor. If the Shareholder Representative has not delivered such
notice of proposed adjustments within such thirty (30) day period, the
Shareholder Representative will be deemed to have accepted Parent's proposed
Closing Balance Sheet, Net Working Capital Statement and Adjustment Amount
Statement and such statements shall be final, binding, conclusive and non-
appealable.

  

 

  

(d) If the Shareholder Representative delivers a Dispute Notice to Parent in a
timely manner pursuant to Section 2.6(c) above, then the Shareholder
Representative and Parent shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any dispute
over the Shareholder Representative's proposed adjustments to Parent's
proposed Closing Balance Sheet, Net Working Capital Statement and/or
Adjustment Amount Statement, provided that if any such dispute is not fully
resolved within fifteen (15) days following delivery by the Shareholder
Representative of the Dispute Notice (or such longer period as Parent and the
Shareholder Representative may mutually agree in writing), then at the request
of either the Shareholder Representative or Parent, such dispute shall be
submitted to the CPA Firm to resolve any remaining dispute over the
Shareholder Representative's proposed adjustments in accordance with the
Merger Consideration Adjustment Methodology, which resolution shall be final,
binding, conclusive and non-appealable. The CPA Firm shall be instructed to
deliver its written determination not later than the thirtieth (30th) day
after the dispute is referred to the CPA Firm. The CPA Firm shall address only
those items in dispute and may not assign a value greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either party or smaller than the smallest value
for such item claimed by either party. The CPA Firm's fees and expenses shall
be allocated to the Shareholders from the Shareholder Representative Fund
Amount, on the one hand, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation, on the
other hand, based on the inverse of the percentage that the CPA Firm's
determination (before such allocation) bears to the total amount of the total
items in dispute as originally submitted to the CPA Firm. For example, should
the items in dispute total in amount to One Thousand Dollars ($1,000) and the
CPA Firm awards Six Hundred Dollars ($600) in favor of the Shareholder
Representative's position, sixty percent (60%) of the costs of its review
would be borne by Parent and forty percent (40%) of the costs would be borne
by the Shareholders from the Shareholder Representative Fund Amount.

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) The Closing Balance Sheet, the Net Working Capital Statement and the
Adjustment Amount Statement shall become final and binding on all parties upon
the earliest of (i) the Shareholder Representative's delivery of written
notice to Parent of its acceptance of Parent's proposals thereof, (ii) the
Shareholder Representative's failure to deliver a Dispute Notice within the
thirty (30) day period specified in Section 2.6(c) above, (iii) the mutual
written agreement of the Shareholder Representative and Parent with respect to
any of the Shareholder Representative's proposed adjustments to Parent's
proposals thereof, or (iv) the CPA Firm's final resolution of any disputes
submitted to the CPA Firm with respect to the Shareholder Representative's
proposed adjustments to Parent's proposals thereof. For purposes hereof, (A)
the "Final Net Working Capital" shall mean the Net Working Capital as
reflected on the Net Working Capital Statement, (B) the "Final Indebtedness"
shall mean the value of the Indebtedness set forth on the Closing Balance
Sheet and (C) the "Final Closing Cash" shall mean the value of the Closing
Cash set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet, in each case, as deemed final
pursuant to this Section 2.6(e).

  

  

(f) Promptly, but no later than three (3) Business Days after the final
determination of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Net Working Capital Statement
and the Adjustment Amount Statement:

  

 

  

(i) if the Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount is a negative number (the
"Merger Consideration Overpayment Amount"), then Parent and the Shareholder
Representative shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint written
instruction instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute to the Surviving
Corporation out of the Escrow Fund an amount equal to the Merger Consideration
Overpayment Amount plus any accrued interest on such amount.

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

  

  

(ii) if the Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then
Parent and Surviving Corporation shall be, jointly and severally, obligated to
pay to the Shareholder Representative an amount equal to the Merger
Consideration Adjustment Amount, for payment to the Shareholders in accordance
with Section 1.5 and Section 2.4 of this Agreement.

corporation in each jurisdiction in which either the ownership or use of the

it, require such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. Section 3.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists the states in
which the Company and each of its Subsidiaries are qualified to do business as
foreign corporations.

  

  

(b) Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all Subsidiaries

other equity or ownership or proprietary interest in any corporation,
partnership, association, trust, joint venture or other entity.

  

  

(c) The Company has delivered to Parent correct and complete copies of its
certificate of incorporation and bylaws (the "Company Charter Documents") and
correct and complete copies of the certificates of incorporation and bylaws
(or comparable organizational documents) of each of its Subsidiaries (the

delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and any Ancillary
Agreement to which it is a party, and the consummation by the Company of the
Merger, have been duly authorized and approved by the board of directors of
the Company and, except for obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, no
other corporate action on the part of the Company is necessary to authorize
the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and

Company of the Merger.

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

11

required to approve such transactions.

  

  

(c) The Company has duly and validly executed and delivered this Agreement
and, at or prior to the Closing, will have duly and validly executed and
delivered each Ancillary Agreement to which it is a party. Assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and the Merger Sub of this
Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to which each is a party, this
Agreement constitutes, and after the Closing, each Ancillary Agreement to
which the Company is a party will constitute, the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, subject to (i) Laws of general application relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency and the relief of debtors, and (ii) rules of Law governing specific
performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies (the "Bankruptcy
and Equity Exception").

  

  

3.3 No Conflict; Governmental Approvals, Filings and Consents.

  

  

(a) Except as set forth in Section 3.3(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, nor the
consummation or performance by the Company of the Transactions, will (i)
violate any provision of the Company Charter Documents or the Subsidiary
Organizational Documents, (ii) violate or conflict with, or result (with the
giving of notice or lapse of time or both) in a violation of or constitute a

the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or
assets, or (vi) violate, conflict with, impair, result in the cancellation,
suspension, or restriction of any Aviation Authorization, except in the case

Returns, file any amended Tax Return, enter into any closing agreement with
respect to Taxes, settle or compromise any material Tax Claim or surrender any
right to claim a refund of Taxes or obtain any Tax ruling, or waive or extend
the statute of limitations in respect of any material Tax (other than pursuant
to extensions of time to file Tax Returns in the ordinary course of business);

  

  

(q) make any changes in accounting methods or practices (or change an annual
accounting period), except insofar as may be required by a change in GAAP or
applicable Law;

  

  

(r) except in the ordinary course of business, cancel, terminate or take any
action that would reasonably be expected to cause the cancelling or
termination of any insurance policy naming the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a beneficiary or a loss payee, including the non-payment of
premiums that are due and payable; or

  

  

(s) agree, in writing or otherwise, to take any of the foregoing actions.

  

  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall give to Parent,
directly or indirectly, rights to control or direct the operations of the
Company prior to the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of the Agreement,
complete control and supervision of the operation of the Business in the
ordinary course of business.

6.3 Consents and Filings; Reasonable Efforts. Subject to the other provisions
in this Agreement, each party hereto shall each use its commercially
reasonable efforts to perform its respective obligations herein and to take,
or cause to be taken or do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable Law to obtain all regulatory approvals and
satisfy all conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement
and to cause the Transactions to be carried out promptly in accordance with
the terms hereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, within
five (5) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, the Company and
Parent shall each file notifications under the HSR Act in connection with this
Agreement and the Merger (and make any required filings with any applicable
foreign antitrust authorities) and respond as promptly as practicable to any
inquiries received from the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division
of the U.S. Department of Justice or any other Governmental Authority for
additional information or documentation. The fees required in connection with
any filing required under the HSR Act shall be borne equally between Parent
and the Company. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees to use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Transactions and to obtain satisfaction of
the conditions precedent to the consummation of the Transactions (but in no
event shall a party be required to waive any condition precedent to the
Closing), including (a) obtaining all of the necessary actions or nonactions,
waivers, consents and approvals from any Governmental Authority and the making
of all filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an
approval or waiver from, or to avoid a Proceeding by, any Governmental
Authority, (b) obtaining the necessary consents from third parties, (c) the
defending of any Proceedings, whether contemplated hereby, including seeking
to have any stay or temporary restraining Governmental Order vacated or
reversed, and (d) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the Transactions, and to fully carry out the purpose
of, this Agreement. The Company and Parent will supply to each other copies of
all correspondence, filings or communications, including file memoranda
evidencing telephonic conferences, by such party or its Affiliates with any
Governmental Authority or members of its staff, with respect to the
Transactions, except for documents filed pursuant to Item 4(c) of the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Notification and Report Form or communications regarding the
same.

  

  

6.4 Notification. The Company shall promptly notify Parent, and Parent shall
promptly notify the Company, of (a) any notice or other communication received
by such party from any Governmental Authority or Aviation Authority in
connection with the Transactions or from any Person alleging that the consent
of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions, if
the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to
obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, (b) any Proceedings commenced or, to such party's
Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting
such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the Transactions, (c)
the existence of any event or circumstance that could reasonably be expected
to result in any condition to the obligations of the other parties to effect
the Transactions not to be satisfied, (d) the failure of such party to comply
with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which could reasonably be expected
to result in any condition to the obligations of the other parties to effect
the Transactions or (e) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which is likely to cause any representation or
warranty of the Company or the Principal Shareholder contained in this
Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate at the Effective Time; provided, however,
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall not (x)
limit or otherwise affect any remedies available to Parent or (y) constitute
an acknowledgment or admission of a breach of this Agreement; provided,
further, that the Company's unintentional failure to give notice under this
Section 6.4 shall not be deemed a covenant breach, but if such breach remains
uncured as of the Closing, shall constitute only a breach of the underlying
representation or warranty, or covenant, condition or agreement, as the case
may be. No disclosure by the Company or the Principal Shareholder pursuant to
this Section 6.4, however, shall be deemed to amend or supplement the
Disclosure Schedule or prevent or cure any misrepresentations, breach of
warranty or breach of covenant.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

  

6.5 No Solicitation.

  

  

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the Company's and
its Subsidiaries' respective directors, officers, employees, investment
bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, consultants, agents and
other representatives (collectively, "Representatives") to, immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any Person
conducted heretofore with respect to a Takeover Proposal. The Company shall
not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly:

  

  

(i) solicit, initiate, cause, facilitate or encourage (including by way of
furnishing information) any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to, or
that constitute, or that may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover
Proposal;

  

  

(ii) participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations with any third
party regarding any Takeover Proposal;

  

  

(iii) enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of
understanding, merger, acquisition, purchase or joint venture agreement or
other agreement related to any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement in accordance with this Section 6.5(a)); or

  

  

(iv) release or permit the release of any Person from, or waive or permit the
waiver of any provision of or right under, any confidentiality, non-
solicitation, no hire, "standstill" or similar agreement to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or under which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has any rights.

  

  

(b) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
Section 6.5, the Company shall promptly advise Parent in writing if any
proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact is received by, any information is
requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated
or continued with, the Company in respect of any Takeover Proposal, and shall,
in any such notice to Parent, indicate the identity of the Person making such
proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact and the terms and conditions of any
proposals or offers or the nature of any inquiries or contacts; provided,
however, the Company shall have no obligation to provide such notification to
the extent that such notification would violate any confidentiality
obligations of the Company.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

  

6.6 Confidentiality. Each of Parent and the Merger Sub acknowledges that the
information being provided to it in connection with the Transactions is
subject to the terms of that certain letter agreement dated as of July 23,
2010 between Parent and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith
Incorporated (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), the terms of which are
incorporated by reference in this Agreement and which terms will survive until
the Closing, at which time the Confidentiality Agreement will terminate;
provided, however, that if this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior
to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement will continue in full force and
effect. The existence of this Agreement and the other Ancillary Agreements and
the terms hereof (including the exhibits and schedules appended hereto) will
be deemed "Evaluation Material" for purposes of the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

6.7 Shareholder Materials. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
execution of this Agreement, the Company will deliver to all Shareholders
entitled to receive such under the DGCL an information statement, the form of
written consent required pursuant to other provisions of this Agreement and
all information that may be required to be given to the Shareholders pursuant
to the DGCL in connection with the Merger, including (a) the notice required
by Section 228 of the DGCL in relation to the approval of this Agreement by
the Shareholders by written consent and (b) the notice required by the first
sentence of Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL (the "Shareholder Materials"). Prior
to the delivery of the Shareholder Materials, the Company will have given
Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
reasonably final drafts of the Shareholder Materials. The Shareholder
Materials will include the Company Board Recommendation. The Board of
Directors of the Company shall not withdraw, alter, modify, change or revoke
its approval of this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby nor its recommendation to the Shareholders to vote in favor of this
Agreement, and the Transactions. The Principal Shareholder hereby covenants
and agrees that it shall, and shall cause its Affiliates which are
Shareholders to, execute the written consent to approve the Merger.

  

  

6.8 Indemnification of Directors and Officers of the Company.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a prepaid six-year
"tail" policy to provide extended coverage on the directors' and officers'
insurance policies maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries which "tail"
policy shall provide indemnification coverage for current and former
directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries
on terms no less favorable than the terms under the directors' and officers'
insurance policies of the Company and its Subsidiaries in place immediately
prior to the Effective Time. The cost of the foregoing "tail" policy shall be
borne equally by Parent and the Company, with the Company's share of the
policy constituting Company Transaction Expenses.

  

  

(b) The Persons to whom this Section 6.8 applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 6.8. The provisions of this Section 6.8 are
intended to be for the benefit of each such Person and his or her heirs.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

  

6.9 Employee Benefits.

  

  

(a) The Company and any Subsidiary shall cause each of its employees to be
reasonably available for interviews and meetings with management of the Parent
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. In connection with such
interviews and meetings, Parent shall have the right to conduct and complete,
to Parent's satisfaction, background checks (including civil and criminal
public records), reference procedures, and educational and employment
verifications, with respect to any current employee. In this regard, the
Company and any Subsidiary shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
execute and deliver to Parent such consents and other forms, and provide
Parent with such other information, as may be reasonably requested by Parent
in order for it to lawfully conduct such background checks, reference
procedures, and educational and employment verifications. The Company and any
Subsidiary shall exercise their commercially reasonable efforts to have each
of its employees provide any of the foregoing information. The management of
the Company and each Subsidiary shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause their respective employees, to cooperate fully with Parent and its
Representatives, in connection with Parent's due diligence activities referred
to in this Section.

  

  

(b) At least five (5) days prior to the Closing, Parent shall deliver to the
Company a listing of those individuals that it does not wish to employ post-
Closing (the "Non-Continuing Employees"). Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company will provide notice of termination of employment to each such Non-
Continuing Employee, and, unless instructed otherwise by Parent in writing,
provide notice of termination of the consulting relationship to each of the
Company's consultants.

  

  

(c) Parent shall cause the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who
continue in employment with the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
receive full credit for their years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries (and with any predecessor, to the extent such service was
previously credited under the Company Plans by the Company and its
Subsidiaries) under all employee benefit plans, programs, policies and
arrangements made available to such employees on and after the Effective Time
by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Affiliates for purposes of satisfying any waiting period,
eligibility, participation, and vesting requirements and for benefit accrual
purposes solely with respect to severance benefits and vacation, sick leave,
paid-time off accrual and any allocation requirements for employer
contributions under any defined contribution retirement plan for the plan year
in which the Closing occurs; provided that such credit shall not result in
duplication of benefits and such credit shall not apply to equity awards, if
any, granted to such continuing employees. Parent also agrees to take
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that continuing employees (and, as
applicable their dependents) receive credit for any co-payments, co-insurance,
deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses incurred under any Company Plan that
constitutes a group health plan (as defined in Section 4980B of the Code) for
purposes of satisfying any co-payment, co-insurance, deductible and out-of-
pocket expense limits or requirements under the group health plans made
available to such employees on and after the Effective Time by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates
as if such amounts had been paid under such plans.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
recognize and honor all unused paid time off accrued by employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time to the extent such paid
time off is accurately accrued and reflected in the Financial Statements.

  

  

(e) Nothing in the Agreement shall create any obligation on the part of Parent
to continue the employment of any employee for any period following the
Closing Date, nor does anything in this Agreement create any obligation on the
part of Parent to maintain any particular benefit plan, program or arrangement
post-Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall be responsible for
any and all costs including, without limitation, any severance, any earned but
unpaid bonus, any accrued but unused vacation time and any accrued but unused
paid time off, incurred by the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the termination of any
employee of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the consummation of the Transactions or after
the Closing Date other than the Change of Control Payments and the Excluded
Assets and Liabilities which shall be the responsibility of the Shareholders.

  

  

6.10 Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) The Shareholder Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and
file or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns for the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, and their Subsidiaries for all Tax periods ending
on or prior to the Closing Date which are originally due on or before the
Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
the Company's or the Subsidiary's past practices, in each case, unless such
treatment does not have sufficient legal support to avoid the imposition of
penalties, fines, or similar amounts and only to the extent permitted by
applicable Law. Such Tax Returns shall be provided to Parent for its review
and comment as soon as reasonably practicable and not later than fifteen (15)
days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns (including extensions),
and Parent shall be entitled to propose in writing to the Shareholder
Representative any reasonable changes to such Tax Returns within five (5) days
following the delivery to it of such Tax Returns. The Shareholder
Representative shall consider in good faith the comments of Parent with
respect to such Tax Returns prior to filing. Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be
filed, all Tax Returns for the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, and their Subsidiaries (i) for all Tax periods ending on or prior
to the Closing Date which are due after the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing
Periods") and (ii) for all Tax periods which begin on or before the Closing
Date and end after the Closing Date ("Straddle Periods"). Such Tax Returns
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the Company's or the
Subsidiary's past practices, in each case, unless such treatment does not have
sufficient legal support to avoid the imposition of penalties, fines, or
similar amounts and only to the extent permitted by applicable Law. Such Tax
Returns shall be provided to the Shareholder Representative for its review and
comment as soon as reasonably practicable and not later than fifteen (15) days
(or, in the case of income Tax Returns, thirty (30) days) prior to the due
date for filing such Tax Returns (including extensions), and the Shareholder
Representative shall be entitled to propose to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation any reasonable changes to such Tax Returns. The Shareholder
Representative shall provide Parent and the Surviving Corporation with a
written description of the items, if any, in such Tax Returns that it intends
to dispute within five (5) days (or, in the case of income Tax Returns,
fifteen (15) days) following the delivery to it of such Tax Returns. If the
Shareholder Representative does not deliver to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation its dispute (described in the previous sentence) within such five
(5) day (or, in the case of income Tax Returns, fifteen (15) day) period, then
the relevant Tax Return shall be deemed to be finally determined and Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to file such Tax Return. If the
Shareholder Representative does deliver its dispute to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation within the requisite time period, the Shareholder Representative,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree to consult and to resolve in good
faith any issue arising as a result of the review of such Tax Returns and to
mutually consent to the filing of such Tax Returns as promptly as possible. In
the event the parties are unable to resolve any dispute within five (5) days
following the delivery of any intention to dispute by the Shareholder
Representative to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the Shareholder
Representative, on one hand, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation, on the
other hand, shall jointly request the CPA Firm to resolve any issue in dispute
at least two (2) days (or, in the case of income Tax Returns, five (5) days)
before the due date of such Tax Return, in order that such Tax Return may be
timely filed. The Shareholders, on one hand, and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, on the other hand, shall each pay one-half of the CPA Firm's fees
and expenses, and the determination of the CPA Firm shall be binding on all
parties.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Within five (5) days of the receipt of written demand from the Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, the Shareholders shall
reimburse the demanding party for all Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for any period ending prior to the Closing Date and for their
portion (as determined under Section 6.10(c)) of all Taxes of the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period, without duplication of any
amount of such Taxes that are taken into account as liabilities on the
Adjustment Amount Statement, The Surviving Corporation shall be responsible
for all Taxes of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries for any period
beginning on or after the Closing Date and for its portion (as determined
under Section 6.10(c)) of all Taxes of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period. Any amounts paid by the Shareholders to
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries under this Section
6.10(b) shall be treated as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration unless
otherwise required by Law.

  

  

(c) The Taxes of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries attributable to any
Straddle Period shall be apportioned between the portion of the Straddle
Period that begins on the first day of the Straddle Period and ends on the
Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Straddle Period"), which portion shall be the
responsibility of the Shareholders, and the portion of the Straddle Period
that begins on the day after the Closing Date and ends on the last day of the
Straddle Period (the "Post-Closing Straddle Period"), which portion shall be
the responsibility of the Surviving Corporation. In the case of income Taxes,
sales and use Taxes, and Taxes based on gross or net receipts or payments, the
portion of the Tax allocated to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period shall equal
the amount that would be payable if the Straddle Period ended on the last day
of the Pre-Closing Straddle Period by means of closing the books and records
of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries as of the last day of the Pre-
Closing Straddle Period, provided that all permitted allowances, exemptions
and deductions that are normally computed on the basis of an entire year or
period (such as depreciation and amortization deductions) shall accrue on a
daily basis and shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and
the Post-Closing Straddle Period in proportion to the number of days in each
such period. In the case of Taxes not described in the immediately preceding
sentence, the portion of the Tax allocated to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period
shall equal the amount of Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by the
ratio of the number of days during the Pre-Closing Straddle Period to the
number of days during the entire Straddle Period. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any penalty, interest, or addition to Tax shall be allocated to the
party that bears the liability for the Tax to which such penalty, interest, or
addition to Tax relates, regardless of when such penalty, interest, or
addition to Tax is assessed.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Shareholder
Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by any other party hereto, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to this Section 6.10 and any Proceeding with respect to Taxes
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other party's request) the provision of records and
information reasonably relevant to the preparation of any Tax Return or to any
such audit, litigation, or other proceeding with respect to Taxes of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree
(i) to retain all books and records in their possession with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to the Company relating to any taxable period beginning
before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations
(including any extension thereof) of the applicable Tax periods, and to abide
by all record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental
Authority, and (ii) to give the Shareholder Representative reasonable written
notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and
records and, if the Shareholder Representative so requests, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall allow the Shareholder Representative to take
possession of such books and records. The Shareholder Representative shall
provide Parent, and Parent shall provide Shareholder Representative, with the
information that each is respectively required to report under Section 6043A
of the Code.

  

  

(e) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not amend any Tax Returns of
the Company or its Subsidiaries for Tax periods (or portions thereof) ending
on or prior to the Closing Date, or file a claim for refund of Taxes
attributable to a Tax period (or a portion thereof) ending on or prior to the
Closing Date, that in either case would increase the Tax Liability of any
Shareholder, without the Shareholder Representative's written consent, which
consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

  

(f) Following the Closing Date, if a Tax Claim is initiated by any
Governmental Authority with respect to Taxes of the Company or its
Subsidiaries for which a Parent Indemnified Party may be entitled to
indemnification under Section 9.1, Parent shall promptly notify the
Shareholder Representative of such Tax Claim, stating the nature and basis of
such Tax Claim and the amount thereof, to the extent known. No failure or
delay of Parent in the performance of the foregoing shall reduce or otherwise
affect the obligations or liabilities of the Shareholders under this
Agreement, except to the extent that such failure precludes the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries from defending against any Tax claim that the
Shareholders are obligated to pay hereunder. Notwithstanding Sections 9.3 and
9.4, for all Tax Claims that relate to a Straddle Period or a Pre-Closing
Period, the Shareholder Representative will have the right, at its option and
at its cost and expense, to participate with representatives of its own
choosing in all stages of such Tax Claim, however, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall control the conduct of all stages of such Tax Claim. Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall not, and shall not permit any of their
Affiliates to, accept any proposed adjustment or enter into any settlement or
agreement in compromise regarding any Tax Claim for which a Parent Indemnified
Party may be entitled to indemnification under Section 9.1 without the express
written consent of the Shareholder Representative (not to be withheld, delayed
or conditioned unreasonably).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(g) Except as set forth in Section 6.10(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
all Tax allocation, Tax sharing, Tax indemnity or similar agreements between
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any other Person shall be
terminated with respect to the Company and each of its Subsidiaries prior to
the Closing Date. After the Closing Date neither the Surviving Corporation nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall be bound by or have any further Liability or
obligation under any such agreement.

  

  

(h) The parties hereto agree to treat the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as a taxable purchase and sale of the stock of the Company for all
U.S. federal and, where possible, applicable state income Tax purposes, to
report the transactions as such for all such Tax purposes, and to take no
action inconsistent with such treatment.

  

  

(i) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration, value-added, stamp
duty, filing recordation and other similar Taxes and related fees (including
any penalties, interest and additions to Tax) ("Transfer Taxes") incurred in
connection with the transactions expressly contemplated hereby shall be borne
equally by Parent and the Shareholders. The Company has no actual knowledge of
any such Transfer Taxes that will likely be incurred in connection with the
transactions expressly contemplated hereby.

  

  

6.11 Excluded Assets and Liabilities.

  

  

(a) The assets, liabilities and expenses of the Company and its Subsidiaries
set forth on Section 6.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
referenced herein as the "Excluded Assets and Liabilities." On or prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Excluded Assets and Liabilities to
be assigned and assumed in their entirety by a newly formed entity controlled
by the Principal Shareholder; provided, however, the Company may, in lieu of
such assignment and assumption, cause any of the liabilities or expenses which
constitute part of the Excluded Assets and Liabilities to be paid in full and
retired as of or prior to the Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of
Article 9, from and after the Closing, each Shareholder shall severally,
solely to the extent of such Shareholder's Pro Rata Share, and not jointly,
indemnify and hold harmless the Parent Indemnified Parties from and against
any and all Losses incurred or suffered by the Parent Indemnified Parties
arising out of, relating to or resulting from the Excluded Assets and
Liabilities.

  

  

(b) The Surviving Corporation and the Parent may elect to lease certain of the
Excluded Assets and Liabilities from the newly formed entity controlled by the
Principal Shareholder for a period of time after Closing. Parent, the
Principal Shareholder and the Company shall work together in good faith to
agree to terms mutually acceptable to the parties to lease certain of the
Excluded Assets and Liabilities after Closing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

6.12 Payment of Indebtedness by Related Parties. Except as expressly provided
in this Agreement, the Company will cause all indebtedness owed to the Company
or any Subsidiary by any Shareholder or director, officer, employee or
Affiliate of the Company or any Subsidiary to be paid in full prior to
Closing. The Shareholders shall be liable for any Tax liabilities resulting
therefrom. The Company shall provide to Parent, prior to Closing, evidence of
such payment to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent.

  

  

6.13 No Transfer. The Principal Shareholder shall not sell, transfer, assign
or hypothecate the shares of Company Stock held by it (except to Parent
pursuant to the terms hereof) without the prior written consent of Parent.

  

  

6.14 Environmental Inspection. The Company hereby consents to Parent
conducting, upon reasonable advance notice to the Company, at Parent's sole
risk and expense, on-site inspections and a Phase One and Phase Two
Environmental Assessment (an "Environmental Assessment") of the Real Property
listed on Section 6.14 to the Company Disclosure Schedule. Parent shall not
conduct any sampling activities without prior notice and consent of the
Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. In connection with
any Environmental Assessment, Parent agrees not to interfere with the normal
operation of the Company and agrees to comply with all requirements and safety
policies of the Company. If Parent or its agents prepares an Environmental
Assessment, Parent will promptly furnish a copy thereof to the Company. The
Parties shall execute a "common undertaking" letter regarding the
confidentiality of environmental assessments where appropriate. In connection
with the granting of such access, Parent represents that it is adequately
insured and, except to the extent caused by the Company's willful misconduct,
Parent waives, releases and agrees to defend and indemnify the Company and its
directors, officers, managers, members, employees, affiliates, agents and
representatives against all claims for injury to, or death of, persons or for
damage to property arising in any way from the access afforded to Parent
hereunder or the activities of Parent. This waiver, release and indemnity by
Parent shall survive termination of this Agreement. Except as set forth in
this Section 6.14, none of Parent, the Merger Sub or any of their respective
Representatives shall perform any on-site environmental investigation or study
without the Company's prior written consent.

  

  

6.15 Lease Renewals, Buyouts, Aircraft Repairs and Other Matters. The parties
will, in good faith and pursuant to terms and conditions mutually acceptable
to the parties, develop a plan to address: (i) the renewal of any aircraft
lease due to expire prior to the Closing, (ii) the exercise of any right to
purchase, or buy-out, any aircraft underlying any aircraft lease of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) the repair of any aircraft prior to
the Closing; and (iv) any matters addressed on Schedule 6.15.

(b) by Parent, if the Company shall have materially breached or failed to
perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements

(d) by Parent, if the Closing has not occurred on or before the Closing Date
Deadline; provided, however, that Parent's right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) will not be available if the failure of Parent
or the Merger Sub to fulfill any of their respective covenants or obligations
under this Agreement caused the failure of the Closing to occur on or before
the Closing Date Deadline;

  

  

(e) by the Company, if the Closing has not occurred on or before the Closing
Date Deadline; provided, however, that the Company's right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) will not be available if the failure

and against any and all Losses incurred or suffered by the Parent Indemnified

and other provisions of this Article 9, from and after the Closing, the

Parties from and against any and all Losses incurred or suffered by the Parent

the Merger Sub contained in Article 5 of this Agreement; or

  

  

(b) the nonfulfillment, nonperformance or other breach of any covenant or
agreement of Parent or the Merger Sub contained in this Agreement.

  

  

9.4 Claim Procedure.

  

  

(a) A party entitled to indemnification hereunder (the "Indemnified Party")
shall promptly give written notice (the "Claim Notice") to the party obligated
to provide indemnification hereunder (the "Indemnifying Party") after (i)
becoming aware of a Loss for which the Indemnified Party intends to seek
indemnification, or (ii) receipt by the Indemnified Party of notice of any
claim or the commencement of any Proceeding against it by a Person other than
an Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Claim") which may result in a Loss for
which the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder. The
Claim Notice shall describe the Loss and/or the asserted Liability in
reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary) of
the Loss and/or asserted Liability that has been or may be suffered by the
Indemnified Party. Except as provided in Section 9.5 below, the failure to
provide a Claim Notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
Liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party, except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the defense of such Third Party Claim
is prejudiced by the Indemnifying Party's failure to give such Claim Notice.

  

  

(b) Within fifteen (15) days after receipt of a Claim Notice relating to a
claim other than a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall deliver to
the Indemnified Party a written response in which the Indemnifying Party will
either: (i) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the
Losses at issue in the Claim Notice; or (ii) dispute the Indemnified Party's
entitlement to indemnification by delivering to the Indemnified Party a
written notice (an "Objection Notice") setting forth in reasonable detail each
disputed item, the basis for each such disputed item and certifying that all
such disputed items are being disputed in good faith. If the Indemnifying
Party delivers an Objection Notice to the Indemnified Party within fifteen
(15) days after delivery of the Claim Notice, then the dispute may be resolved
by any legally available means consistent with the provisions of Section
10.10.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) If any Parent Indemnified Party is the Indemnified Party with respect to
any claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article 9, the parties will
contemporaneously deliver to the Escrow Agent copies of each Claim Notice and
Objection Notice in connection with such claim.

  

  

9.5 Third Party Claims.

  

  

(a) Any Indemnifying Party will have the right to contest, and defend the
Indemnified Party against, any Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party so long as the Indemnifying
Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing within fifteen (15) days after
the Indemnified Party has given a Claim Notice that, subject to the limits set
forth in this Article 9, the Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified
Party from and against the Losses the Indemnified Party may suffer with
respect to the Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Third
Party Claim concerns FAA matters or otherwise would cause the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent to cease operations for a
period of time, then the Surviving Corporation as the Indemnified Party may
defend against such Third Party Claim in any manner it reasonably may deem
appropriate, including the consent to the entry of a settlement agreement
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (the "Third-Party
Claim Carve-Out"); provided, that the settlement agreement by its terms (i)
obligates the Indemnified Party to pay the full amount of any Liability and
Loss in connection with such Third Party Claim, and (ii) unconditionally
releases the Indemnifying Party from any and all Liability in connection with
such Third Party Claim.

  

  

(b) Subject the Third-Party Claim Carve Out, so long as the Indemnifying Party
is conducting the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section
9.5(a) above: (i) the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its
sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim,
(ii) the Indemnified Party will not consent to the entry of any Governmental
Order or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be
withheld, delayed or conditioned unreasonably), and (iii) the Indemnifying
Party will not consent to the entry of any Governmental Order or enter into
any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be withheld, delayed or conditioned
unreasonably).

  

  

(c) In the event the Indemnifying Party does not conduct the defense in
accordance with Section 9.5(a) above, the Indemnified Party may defend against
the Third Party Claim in any manner it reasonably may deem appropriate;
provided, however, that (i) the Indemnifying Party may participate in such
defense at its own expense, and (ii) the Indemnified Party will not consent to
the entry of any Governmental Order or enter into any settlement with respect
to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party (not to be withheld, delayed or conditioned unreasonably).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

  

9.6 Survival.

  

  

(a) All representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and the
Company Closing Certificate will expire eighteen (18) months following the
Closing Date; provided, however that the Company Special Representations shall
survive indefinitely, the representations and warranties contained in Section
3.15 (Tax Matters), Section 3.16 (Employee Benefit Matters) and Section 3.18
(Environmental Matters) shall expire on the date thirty (30) days following
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations and the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.21(b) (Governmental
Authorizations) shall expire on the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date
(collectively, the "Indemnification Period"). No party shall have any
Liability with respect to claims first asserted in connection with any
representation or warranty after expiration of the applicable Indemnification
Period. The covenants and other obligations of the parties contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall continue in full force and
effect after the Closing until they are otherwise terminated in accordance
with their respective terms.

  

  

(b) If an Indemnified Party delivers to an Indemnifying Party, before
expiration of the applicable Indemnification Period, a Claim Notice based upon
a breach of any such representation or warranty, then the applicable
representation or warranty will survive until, but only for purposes of, the
resolution of the matter covered by such notice. If the Proceeding or written
claim with respect to which such notice has been given is definitively
withdrawn or resolved in favor of the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party
will promptly so notify the Indemnifying Party.

  

  

9.7 Limitations on Liability. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary or any right or remedy available under any Law:

  

  

(a) The Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 9.1(a) or 9.2(a) unless the aggregate amount of Losses
indemnifiable under Section 9.1(a) and 9.2(a) exceeds an amount equal to One
Million Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,700,000) (the "Deductible Amount")
and, then, only to the extent of such excess; provided, that the foregoing
limitation shall not be deemed to apply to any inaccuracy in or breach of any
Company Special Representation, Section 3.15 (Tax Matters), Section 3.18
(Environmental Matters) and Section 3.21(d) (Governmental Authorizations)
(collectively, the "Fundamental Representations"). The Company Indemnified
Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.3(a)
unless the aggregate amount of Losses indemnifiable under Section 9.3(a)
exceeds the Deductible Amount and, then, only to the extent of such excess.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere herein, the
aggregate of any indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 9.1(a) and
Section 9.2(a) shall not exceed the amount of the Escrow Fund and the sole
recourse for the Parent Indemnified Parties to recover Losses for which they
may be entitled under this Article 9 will be to set off, recover and retain
such Losses from the Escrow Fund; provided, however, that the foregoing
limitation shall not apply to any inaccuracy in or breach of any Company
Special Representation, any Fundamental Representation or Section 3.16
(Employee Benefits); provided, further, that the aggregate indemnification
obligations pursuant to Section 9.1(a) and Section 9.2(a) with respect to the
Company Special Representations, the Fundamental Representations, Section 3.16
(Employee Benefits) and pursuant to Sections 9.1(b)-(g) and Section 9.2(b)
shall not exceed the aggregate Merger Consideration paid to the Shareholders
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Except in the case of indemnification
obligations under Section 9.1(a) or Section 9.2(a) with respect to the Company
Special Representations, the Fundamental Representations, Section 3.16
(Employee Benefits) and pursuant to Sections 9.1(b)-(g) and Section 9.2(b), no
Shareholder shall have any Liability whatsoever to the Parent Indemnified
Parties except to the extent of such Shareholder's interest in the Escrow
Fund. In the case of indemnification obligations under Section 9.1(a) or
Section 9.2(a) with respect to the Company Special Representations, the
Fundamental Representations, Section 3.16 (Employee Benefits) and pursuant to
Sections 9.1(b)-(g) and Section 9.2(b), no Shareholder shall have any
Liability whatsoever to the Parent Indemnified Parties except to the extent of
such Shareholder's Pro Rata Share. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained elsewhere herein, under no circumstances shall any Shareholder have
Liability to the Parent Indemnified Parties in excess of such Shareholder's
Pro Rata Share.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOLLOWING THE CLOSING
PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER OR ANY
OF THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, ANY MEASURE OF DAMAGES BASED ON
DIMINUTION IN VALUE OR BASED ON ANY MULTIPLE OF EARNINGS OR EBITDA OR SIMILAR
CONCEPT, PUNITIVE OR INDIRECT DAMAGES EXCEPT FOR ANY SUCH DAMAGES THAT ARE
RECOVERED BY THIRD PERSONS IN CONNECTION WITH LOSSES INDEMNIFIED HEREUNDER.

  

  

(d) No Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification for any Loss
for which the Indemnified Parties have otherwise been fully compensated
pursuant to the adjustments to the amount of the Merger Consideration,
including the Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount.

  

  

(e) For the purposes of this Article 9 only, solely when determining the
amount of Losses suffered by an Indemnified Party as a result of any breach,
inaccuracy or failure, any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
given or made by the Company or the Principal Shareholder that is qualified or
limited in scope as to materiality, Material Adverse Effect (including the
definition of Material Contracts) or Knowledge, such representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement shall be deemed to be made or given without such
qualification or limitation.

  

  

(f) The Shareholders shall not have any right of contribution, indemnification
or right of advancement from the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent
with respect to any Loss claimed by an Indemnified Party.

  

  

9.8 Mitigation of Damages. Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses, including by maintaining insurance
coverage with respect to the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

  

  

9.9 Indemnification as Exclusive Remedy. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to the contrary or any right or remedy
available under any Law, except for any specific additional remedies provided
for in any Ancillary Agreement, in the case of fraud or intentional or willful
breach of this Agreement, the indemnification provided in this Article 9 shall
be the sole and exclusive post-Closing remedy available to the Parent
Indemnified Parties with respect to matters of any kind or nature arising
under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or otherwise in connection
with the Merger or the Transactions or relating to the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' businesses, assets or ownership, operation, management, use or
control of their respective facilities, and the Parent Indemnified Parties
shall not pursue or seek to pursue any other remedy with respect to such
matters.

  

  

9.10 Net Losses and Subrogation. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, the amount of any Losses for which an Indemnified Party may be
entitled to indemnification under this Article 9 shall be reduced to the
extent of (i) any insurance proceeds which the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates actually receive with respect to such Losses (including those from
affiliated insurance companies), net of any identifiable increase in the
annual insurance premium of said insurance policies for the subsequent five
(5) year period directly resulting from the filing and collection of such
insurance claim, and (ii) any Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates prior to the indemnity payment net of any Tax
detriment actually suffered by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates
(including loss of depreciable basis), in each case, arising from the facts or
circumstances giving rise to such Losses and from any adjustment to the Merger
Consideration on account of any indemnification under this Article 9. If any
such proceeds are received by an Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates
with respect to any Losses after payment has been made to the Indemnified
Party with respect thereto, the Indemnified Party shall promptly pay back, or
cause its appropriate Affiliates to pay back, the amount of such proceeds (up
to the amount received by the Indemnified Party with respect to such Losses).
No Indemnified Party shall be obligated to make a claim for insurance recovery
if there is a reasonable risk that such Indemnified Party will become
uninsurable for any risks as a result of such claim. The Shareholder
Representative and the Shareholders waive any rights to claim subrogation to
any rights of any and all Indemnified Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing
or anything to the contrary contained herein, but subject to Section 9.8, in
no event shall an Indemnified Party be required to pursue any insurer or other
third party with indemnification obligations or any other person responsible
therefor as a condition to an Indemnified Party's right to receive its
indemnification benefit under this Article 9.

  

  

9.11 Tax Treatment. Indemnification payments made pursuant to this Article 9
shall be treated by the parties for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the
Merger Consideration unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

ARTICLE 10

  

GENERAL PROVISIONS

  

  

10.1 Shareholder Representative.

  

  

(a) By virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of the
Shareholders other than the Company Shareholder Approval, from and after the
Effective Time, the Shareholder Representative shall act as agent and
attorney-in-fact on behalf of the Shareholders for purposes of (i) taking
action or receiving notice pursuant to Article 9 and the Escrow Agreement,
(ii) taking action or receiving notice in connection with the Merger
Consideration Adjustment Amount pursuant to Section 2.6 and the Escrow
Agreement, (iii) taking any and all actions and making any and all decisions
required or permitted to be taken by the Shareholder Representative under this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and (iv) exercising such rights, power and
authority as are incidental hereto (including the right, power and authority
to retain attorneys, accountants and other advisors to assist it in the
performance of its duties hereunder). The Shareholder Representative shall
have the ability and power to execute and deliver all instruments,
certificates and other documents of every kind incident to the foregoing and
all right, power and authority to act on behalf of the Shareholders in
connection herewith. Both Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deal exclusively with the Shareholder Representative on all
matters relating to Section 2.6, Article 9 and the Escrow Agreement. If the
then-current Shareholder Representative shall resign its position or be unable
to fulfill its responsibilities as agent of the Shareholders, then the
Shareholders holding, immediately prior to the Closing, a majority of the
Common Shares Outstanding shall select a successor shareholder representative.
Any such successor shall become the "Shareholder Representative" for purposes
of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement; and no such resignation of the
then-current Shareholder Representative shall be effective as to the then-
current Shareholder Representative until the new Shareholder Representative
shall accept such appointment.

  

  

(b) The Shareholder Representative will receive no compensation for services
as the Shareholder Representative but shall be entitled to the payment of all
of its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred (including
the costs, expenses and disbursements incurred in connection with retaining
outside counsel) in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder
and pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

(c) Parent shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to a bank designated by
the Shareholder Representative, in cash, the sum of $150,000 (the "Shareholder
Representative Fund Amount"), which shall be available from time to time to
the Shareholder Representative solely in connection with the provisions of
Section 10.1(b). The Shareholder Representative shall maintain the Shareholder
Representative Fund Amount in a segregated account.

  

  

(d) From time to time after the Effective Time, the Shareholder Representative
may distribute to the Shareholders, in accordance with Section 1.5 of this
Agreement, such portion of such sum from the Shareholder Representative Fund
Amount as the Shareholder Representative reasonably determines will not be
needed for the payment of future costs and expenses. Any portion of such sum
remaining after the final resolution of all claims asserted against, or
asserted by or on behalf of, the Shareholders hereunder or under the Escrow
Agreement and the final distribution to the Shareholders of all monies that
are or could be distributable to them hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement
shall be distributed to the Shareholders in accordance with Section 1.5 of
this Agreement. All fees and expenses incurred by the Shareholder
Representative in excess of the Shareholder Representative Fund Amount shall
be paid from any funds otherwise due to the Shareholders (including from the
Escrow Fund to the extent such amount is payable to the Shareholders in
accordance with Section 2.1) in proportion to the conversion methodology set
forth in Section 1.5 of this Agreement and if no funds are available from the
Escrow Fund, then directly from the Shareholders in proportion to their Pro
Rata Share.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Any indemnification payments owed to a Shareholder Indemnified Party
pursuant to Article 9 will be effected by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Shareholder Representative.
All indemnification payments to be received by the Shareholder Indemnified
Parties in accordance with Article 9 will be allocated among the Shareholders
in proportion to the conversion methodology set forth in Section 1.5 of this
Agreement.

  

  

(f) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder Representative,
including but not limited to an amendment, extension or waiver of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 10.3 and Section 10.4 hereof, shall constitute a
decision of the Shareholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon
the Shareholders; and Parent and the Surviving Corporation may rely upon any
such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder Representative
as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholders. Parent
and the Surviving Corporation are hereby relieved from any liability to any
Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Shareholder Representative.

  

  

10.2 Notices. All notices and other communications under this Agreement must
be in writing and are deemed duly delivered when (a) delivered if delivered
personally or by nationally recognized overnight courier service (costs
prepaid), (b) sent by facsimile with confirmation of transmission by the
transmitting equipment (or, the first Business Day following such transmission
if the date of transmission is not a Business Day) or (c) received or rejected

10.3 Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified except in a written document signed by each party to be bound by the
amendment and that identifies itself as an amendment to this Agreement. For
purposes of this Section 10.3, the Shareholders (including the Principal
Shareholder) agree that any amendment of this Agreement signed by the
Shareholder Representative is binding upon and effective against each
Shareholder regardless of whether or not such Shareholder has in fact signed
such amendment.

  

  

10.4 Waiver. Except as otherwise provided in Article 9, the failure of a party
at any time or times to require performance of any provision hereof or claim
damages with respect thereto shall in no manner affect its right at a later
time to enforce the same. No waiver by a party of any condition or of any
breach of any term, covenant, representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement shall be effective unless in writing, and no waiver in any one or
more instances shall be deemed to be a further or continuing waiver of any
such condition or breach in other instances or a waiver of any other condition
or breach of any other term, covenant, representation or warranty. For
purposes of this Section 10.4, the Shareholders (including the Principal
Shareholder) agree that any extension or waiver signed by the Shareholder
Representative shall be binding upon and effective against all Shareholders
whether or not they have signed such extension or waiver.

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

  

10.5 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries. Neither this Agreement
nor any of the terms or provisions hereof are binding upon or enforceable
against any party hereto unless and until the same is executed by all of the
parties hereto. This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements, the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule
and the Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement, and
supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof and (b) except for the provisions of Section 6.8, are not
intended to and shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto
any rights or remedies hereunder.

  

  

10.6 Assignment and Successors. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties except that Parent may assign its rights and
delegate its obligations hereunder to its Affiliates as long as Parent remains
ultimately liable for all of Parent's obligations hereunder. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this
Section 10.6 shall be null and void.

  

  

10.7 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other
terms, provisions and conditions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain
in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the
Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

  

  

10.8 Interpretation. The language used in this Agreement is the language
chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted for or against any party because that party or
its attorney drafted the provision.

  

  

10.9 Governing Law. The laws of the State of Delaware (without giving effect
to its conflicts of law principles) govern this Agreement and all matters
arising out of or relating to this Agreement and any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including its negotiation, execution, validity,
interpretation, construction, performance and enforcement.

  

 

  

10.10 Jurisdiction. Except as specifically provided in Sections 2.6(d) and
6.10(a), the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware (or any federal
court sitting in the State of Delaware) over any Proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and
each party hereto hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such
action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such courts. The parties
hereto hereby irrevocably waive any objection which they may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any Proceeding brought in such court or any
claim that such Proceeding brought in such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a judgment in such
Proceeding may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or
in any other manner provided by Law. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably consents to process being served by any party to this Agreement in
any Proceeding by delivery of a copy thereof in accordance with the provisions
of Section 10.2. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably waives any and all right
to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  

  

10.11 Counterparts. The parties may execute this Agreement in multiple
counterparts, each of which constitutes an original as against the party that
signed it, and all of which together constitute one agreement. This Agreement
is effective upon delivery of one executed counterpart from each party to the
other parties. The signatures of all parties need not appear on the same
counterpart. The delivery of signed counterparts by facsimile or email
transmission that includes a copy of the sending party's signature is as
effective as signing and delivering the counterpart in person.

  

  

10.12 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the
Shareholders shall pay all Expenses incurred on their or the Company's behalf
in connection with the Transactions, including the HSR filing fee payable in
accordance with Section 6.3, and Parent shall pay all Expenses incurred on its
or the Merger Sub's behalf in connection with the Transactions. As used herein
"Expenses" shall include all out-of-pocket expenses (including all fees and
expenses of outside counsel, investment bankers, experts and consultants to a
party hereto) incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection with or
related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and
performance of this Agreement and all other matters relating to the
consummation of the Merger and the Transactions. If this Agreement is
terminated, the obligation of each party to pay its own Expenses will be
subject to any rights of such party arising from any breach of this Agreement
by another party. The parties agree that any Tax benefit arising from the
payment of the Company Transaction Expenses shall be allocated to the Pre-
Closing Periods for all Tax and financial reporting purposes.

  

  

10.13 Publicity. Prior to the Effective Time, no public announcement or other
publicity regarding the existence of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Agreements or their contents or the Transactions shall be made by any party or
any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives without the prior
written agreement of the other parties as to form, content, timing and manner
of distribution or publication. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Section 10.13 shall prevent any party or its Affiliates or any other Person
from (a) making any public announcement or disclosure required by Law or the
rules of any stock exchange, (b) disclosing this Agreement or any of the
Ancillary Agreements or their contents or the Transactions to (i) current and
future Representatives of such party and its Affiliates, and (ii) current and
potential lenders to, investors in and purchasers of such party and its
Affiliates, or (c) enforcing its rights hereunder.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

 

  

  

10.14 Materiality; Disclosure Schedules. As used in this Agreement, unless the
context would require otherwise, the terms "material" or "material to the
Company" and the concept of the "material" nature of an effect upon the
Company shall be measured relative to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole. However, in an effort to achieve clarity and avoid any
misunderstanding, there have been included in the Schedules (and may be
included elsewhere in this Agreement) items which are not "material" within
the meaning of the immediately preceding sentence, and such inclusion shall
not be deemed to be an agreement or representation by the Company that such
items are "material" or to further define the meaning of such term for
purposes of this Agreement. Disclosure of any item in the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed to be a disclosure made with respect to each other
Section in the Company Disclosure Schedule to which the relevance of such
disclosure is readily apparent on its face. Neither the specification of any
Dollar amount or any item or matter in any provision of this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item or matter in the Company Disclosure Schedule is
intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item or
matter so specified or included, or other items or matters, are or are not
material, and no party shall use the fact of the specification of any such
amount or the specification or inclusion of any such item or matter in any
dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any item or matter is
or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. Neither the specification
of any item or matter in any provision of this Agreement nor the inclusion of
any specific item or matter in the Company Disclosure Schedule is intended to
imply that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in
the ordinary course of business, and no party shall use the fact of the
specification or the inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or
controversy between the parties as to whether any item or matter is or is not
in the ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement.

  

  

10.15 Disclaimer of Warranties. Except for the representations and warranties
expressly contained in this Agreement (which includes the Company Disclosure
Schedule) and the Ancillary Agreements, neither the Company or the Principal
Shareholder nor any other Person makes any express or implied representation
or warranty on behalf of the Company or the Principal Shareholder. The Company
and the Principal Shareholder hereby disclaim any such other representation or
warranty, whether by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, the Principal
Shareholder or any of their respective Representatives or any other Person,
notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to Parent, the Merger Sub or any
other Person of any documentation or other written or oral information by the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries, the Principal Shareholder or any of their
respective Representatives or any other Person, and neither the Company or the
Principal Shareholder nor any other Person will have or be subject to any
liability or indemnification obligation to Parent, the Merger Sub or any other
Person resulting from such delivery or disclosure, or Parent's or the Merger
Sub's use, of any such documentation or other information (including any
information, documents, projections, forecasts or other material made
available to Parent or the Merger Sub in certain "data rooms", management
presentations or other written materials provided to Parent in connection with
the Transactions).

  

  

10.16 Construction. Any reference in this Agreement to an "Article,"
"Section," "Exhibit" or "Schedule" refers to the corresponding Article,
Section, Exhibit or Schedule of or to this Agreement, unless the context
indicates otherwise. The table of contents and the headings of Articles and
Sections are provided for convenience only and are not intended to affect the
construction or interpretation of this Agreement. All words used in this
Agreement should be construed to be of such gender or number as the
circumstances require. The term "including" means "including without
limitation" and is intended by way of example and not limitation. Any
reference to a statute is deemed also to refer to any amendments or successor
legislation, and all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as in
effect at the relevant time. Any reference to a Contract or other document as
of a given date means the Contract or other document as amended, supplemented
and modified from time to time through such date.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

  

  

10.17 Time is of the Essence. With regard to all dates and time periods set
forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

  

  

10.18 Payments in United States Dollars. Except as otherwise provided herein,
(a) all references contained in this Agreement or in any Exhibit or Schedule
referred to herein to dollars or "$" shall mean United States Dollars and (b)
all payments pursuant hereto shall be made by wire transfer in United States
Dollars in immediately available funds without any set-off, deduction or
counterclaim whatsoever.

  

  

10.19 Waiver of Conflict. Each party hereto acknowledges that DLA Piper LLP
(US) ("DLA"), counsel for the Company, has in the past performed, is now
performing and may continue to perform legal services for certain of the
Shareholders and that, upon the Closing, DLA's representation of the Company
(but not such represented Shareholders) shall terminate. Accordingly, each
party to this Agreement hereby acknowledges that DLA may continue to represent
such represented Shareholders (and, if applicable, other Persons) in any and
all matters whether or not related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, including any matters that are or may become adverse to
the interests of Parent, the Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation and
including claims arising under this Agreement. Effective upon the Closing,
each of Parent, the Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation, on its own
behalf, hereby waives any actual or potential conflict of interest that exists
or that may exist (including any conflict that exists or may arise by virtue
of DLA's possession of any information concerning the Surviving Corporation)
as a result of DLA's representation of such Shareholders or any other Person
in any matter, including any matter that is or may become adverse to the
interests of Parent, the Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, including
any claims arising under this Agreement.
