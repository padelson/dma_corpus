TRANSACTION AGREEMENT

  

 TRANSACTION AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") dated as of October 19, 2009 between Invesco Ltd., a Bermuda corporation ("Buyer"), and Morgan Stanley, a Delaware corporation ("Seller").

  

W I T N E S S E T H :

  

 WHEREAS, Seller owns, directly or indirectly, the Van Kampen Business and desires to sell the Van Kampen Business to Buyer, and Buyer desires to purchase the Van Kampen Business from Seller, pursuant to (i) a merger of Van Kampen Parent with and into Merger Subsidiary and (ii) a sale and purchase of the Purchased Assets, in each case upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth and pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger; and

  

 WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (a "368 Reorganization"), and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code, unless Seller exercises an Alternative Transaction Structure Election pursuant to Section 7.11;

  

 ACCORDINGLY, in consideration of the promises and of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

  

ARTICLE 1 
DEFINITIONS

  

 Section 1.01 _. Definitions._ (A) As used herein, the following terms have the following meanings:

  

 "2010 Compensation Accrual" means the accrued amount (reflecting the period from January 1, 2010 through the day before the Closing Date) in respect of any Liabilities in respect of cash based bonus awards to be granted by Buyer in the ordinary course of business pursuant to the 2010 Incentive Compensation Programs.

  

 "40 Act Fund" means any Fund registered under the Investment Company Act.

  

 "40 Act Management Fund" means any 40 Act Fund other than a UIT Fund.

  

 "Adjusted Assets Under Management" as of any date means the sum, for any Client investment management account (excluding, for purposes of this

   ##### 

  

    

Agreement, UIT Fund accounts) in question as of such date, of the amount,
expressed in U.S. dollars, of assets under management of the Van Kampen
Business for each such account as of such date valued as follows: 

  

 (a) for purposes of calculating the Base Revenue Run-Rate as of the Base Date, in the same manner as provided for the calculation of base investment management fees payable in respect of each such Client account pursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory Arrangements applicable to such account; and 

  

 (b) for purposes of calculating the Closing Revenue Run-Rate as of the Closing Measurement Date or as of the Closing Date, as applicable, as the amount calculated pursuant to subsection (a) above, (i) increased by a positive amount equal to additions, contributions and reinvestments actually funded to such account after the Base Date and on or prior to the Closing Measurement Date or the Closing Date, as applicable, (ii) increased with respect to any new accounts opened after the Base Date and on or prior to the Closing Measurement Date or the Closing Date, as applicable, and any additions to such new accounts prior to the Closing Measurement Date or the Closing Date, as applicable, by the amount of additions, contributions and reinvestments actually funded to such account after the Base Date and on or prior to the Closing Measurement Date or the Closing Date, as applicable, (iii) decreased by terminations, withdrawals, redemptions and repurchases actually funded out of each such account after the Base Date and prior to the Closing Measurement Date or the Closing Date, as applicable, and (iv) decreased by the amount of any Contingent Account to the extent provided in the definition thereof; 

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , in the case of both clauses (a) and (b) hereof
(other than clauses (D), (E) and (F) below, which shall relate solely to
clause (b)): 

   

       | (A)  |   | additions, contributions and reinvestments shall
be taken into account only when actually funded and withdrawals, redemptions
and repurchases shall be taken into account when they are actually funded out
of such account;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (B)  |   | any assets under management for any account for which
the Person in question acts as investment adviser and sub-adviser shall
be counted only once;  
      
    | (C)  |   | any assets under management for any set of accounts
one of which invests in the other shall be counted only once if the Person
in question or an Affiliate thereof acts as investment adviser to both,
except to the extent that an investment management fee is payable to one or
more Persons in respect of each such multiple account (unless, in this
latter case, the investment management fees on such assets that are so
payable are otherwise aggregated  
   

  ##### 

 

  

     |   |   | for purposes of calculating the Revenue Run-Rate for
one such account);  
---|---|---|--- 
  
     | (D)  |   | to the extent any addition, contribution,
reinvestment, withdrawal, redemption or repurchase after the Base Date is
made in a currency other than U.S. dollars, for purposes of clause (b)
hereof, such amount shall be converted to U.S. dollars at the currency
exchange rate on the date of any such contribution, reinvestment, withdrawal,
redemption or repurchase;  
      
    | (E)  |   | for the avoidance of doubt, the calculation of
Adjusted Assets Under Management shall be made in a manner that excludes any
increase or decrease in assets under management resulting from market
appreciation or depreciation or currency fluctuations (except to the extent
covered by clause (D) above) from and after the Base Date (or in the case of
an account established after the Base Date, after the date such account
is established);  
      
    | (F)  |   | in the event of a Fund Change Announcement in respect
of any Fund or Client, then Adjusted Assets Under Management for any such
Fund or Client shall be deemed to be fixed at the amount thereof
immediately prior to any such announcement rather than as of the Closing
Measurement Date or Closing Date;  
      
    | (G)  |   | the Adjusted Assets under Management of all of

 Section 2.05 _. Closing Revenue Run-Rate Purchase Price Adjustment._  

  

 (a) If the Closing Revenue Run-Rate is less than 0.85 multiplied by the Base Revenue Run-Rate, then the Aggregate Purchase Price shall be reduced as follows: 

   

 (i) the Aggregate Cash Consideration shall be reduced by an amount (the "Cash Reduction Amount") equal to (x) the Closing Revenue Run-Rate Purchase Price Reduction  _multiplied by_ (y) one-third; and 

   

 (ii) the Aggregate Equity Consideration shall be reduced by a number of shares (the "Equity Reduction Amount") equal to the quotient (rounded to the nearest whole share) of (A) the Closing Revenue Run-Rate Purchase Price Reduction _minus_ the Cash Reduction Amount over (B) the Buyer Signing Price; 

  

 (b) If the Closing Revenue Run-Rate is greater than 1.15 _multiplied by_ the Base Revenue Run-Rate, then the Aggregate Purchase Price shall be increased as follows: 

   ##### 

  

   

 (i) the Aggregate Cash Consideration shall be increased by an amount (the "Cash Increase Amount") equal to (x) the Closing Revenue Run-Rate Purchase Price Increase  _multiplied by_ (y) one-third; and 

   

 (ii) the Aggregate Equity Consideration shall be increased by a number of shares (the "Equity Increase Amount") equal to the quotient (rounded to the nearest whole share) of (A) the Closing Revenue Run-Rate Purchase Price Increase minus the Cash Increase Amount over (B) the Buyer Signing Price. 

  

 (c) Any adjustment resulting from the application of this Section 2.05 is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Revenue Run-Rate Purchase Price Adjustment". 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.05 or in Section 2.06, unless Seller exercises an Alternative Transaction Structure Election pursuant to Section 7.11, Buyer and Seller agree that (i) any Cash Increase Amount or Cash Reduction Amount, as the case may be, shall be allocated to the Purchased Assets (as opposed to the Transferred Entities), to the extent that any corresponding increase or reduction in the Aggregate Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 2.05 or to Section 2.06, as the case may be, is attributable to such Purchased Assets as determined pursuant to Section 2.05(e), and (ii) the remainder of such Cash Increase Amount or Cash Reduction Amount, if any, along with any Equity Increase Amount or Equity Reduction Amount, shall be allocated to the Transferred Entities; _provided that_ , if any increase or reduction in the Aggregate Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.05 or 2.06, as the case may be, that is attributable to such Purchased Assets as determined pursuant to Section 2.05(e), exceeds the amount of the corresponding Cash Increase Amount or Cash Reduction Amount, as the case may be (such excess, the "Excess Section 2.05(d) Amount"), then (x) the Cash Increase Amount or Cash Reduction Amount, as the case may be, shall be increased by an amount equal to such Excess Section 2.05(d) Amount, and (y) the Equity Increase Amount or Equity Reduction Amount shall be reduced by a number of shares equal to the quotient (rounded to the nearest whole share) of (A) such Excess Section 2.05(d) Amount over (B) the Buyer Signing Price. 

  

 (e) The portion of any increase in the Aggregate Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 2.05 or to Section 2.06, as the case may be, that is attributable to the Purchased Assets shall be equal to a fraction, the numerator of which is (i) the excess, if any, of the Closing Revenue Run-Rate over the Base Revenue Run-Rate, determined in each case taking into account only the Purchased Assets, and (ii) the denominator of which is the excess of the Closing Revenue Run-Rate over the Base Revenue Run-Rate. The portion of any reduction in the Aggregate Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 2.05 or to Section 2.06, as the case may be, that is attributable to the Purchased Assets shall be equal to a fraction, the numerator of which is (i) the excess, if any, of the Base Revenue Run-Rate over the Closing Revenue Run-Rate, determined in each case 

   ##### 

  

    

taking into account only the Purchased Assets, and (ii) the denominator of
which is the excess of the Base Revenue Run-Rate over the Closing Revenue
Run-Rate. In the case that any fraction calculated under this Section 2.05(e)
is greater than 1, such fraction shall be deemed to equal 1. 

  

 Section 2.06 _. True-Up._ (a) Upon the expiration of the True-Up Period, the parties shall recalculate the Closing Revenue-Run Rate Purchase Price Adjustment as of the Closing Date, except that the Adjusted Assets Under Management with respect to the Contingent Accounts shall be included in the calculation of such recalculated Closing Revenue Run-Rate Purchase Price Adjustment: 

   

 (i) in the case of any Contingent Account pursuant to clause (a)(i) of the definition thereof that (A) has satisfied any Assignment Requirements applicable to such account not later than the final day of the True-Up Period or (B) (i) has not terminated the Investment Advisory Arrangement (or has, on or before the final day of the True-Up Period (and, in the case of a New Advisory Contract with the Van Kampen Business, after Closing), entered into a New Advisory Contract with the Van Kampen Business, Buyer or any of its Affiliates on terms substantially comparable (but having the same advisory and same aggregate non-advisory fees) to those of the applicable Existing Advisory Contract) and (ii) continues to be a Client of the Van Kampen Business, Buyer or any of its Affiliates on the final day of the True-Up Period (unless, in the case of this clause (B), Buyer or its applicable Affiliate will be required to terminate such Investment Advisory Arrangement due to the failure to satisfy the Assignment Requirements by such final day), to the extent of the amount by which (x) the reduction made to Adjusted Assets Under Management in respect of any such Contingent Account for purposes of the original calculation of the Closing Revenue Run-Rate (assuming that calculation had been done as of the Closing Date) exceeds (y) the amount of the redemptions, withdrawals or terminations that actually occur with respect to such account prior to the final day of the True-Up Period; 

   

 (ii) in the case of any Contingent Account solely pursuant to clause (a)(ii) of the definition thereof that has satisfied any Assignment Requirements applicable to such account not later than the final day of the True-Up Period, to the extent of the reduction made to Adjusted Assets Under Management in respect of any such Contingent Account for purposes of the original calculation of the Closing Revenue Run-Rate (assuming that calculation had been done as of the Closing Date); 

   

 (iii) in the case of any Contingent Account pursuant to clause (a)(iii) or (b) of the definition thereof, to the extent of amounts actually funded in the account not later than the final day of the True-Up Period; and 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iv) in the case of any Contingent Account relating to a Fund with respect to which a Fund Change Announcement has occurred, and assuming, in the case of any Fund Change Announcement relating to a portfolio management team change for the Funds set forth on Exhibit C, that such Fund has satisfied any Assignment Requirements, to the extent of the full amount of such Contingent Account. 

  

 (b) If such recalculation yields: 

   

 (i) a reduced Closing Revenue Run-Rate Purchase Price Reduction, an increased Closing Revenue Run-Rate Purchase Price Increase or an amount that would give rise for the first time to a Closing Revenue Run-Rate Purchase Price Increase, then Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount that is equal to the amount of such reduction to the Closing Revenue Run-Rate Purchase Price Reduction, the amount of such increase to the Closing Revenue Run-Rate Purchase Price Increase or the amount of such Closing Revenue Run-Rate Purchase Price Increase (as applicable) as soon as is reasonably practicable after, but in any event within three Business Days of, the date upon which the recalculation described in this Section 2.06(b)(i) is made, with such payment increasing the Aggregate Cash Consideration and the Aggregate Equity Consideration in the manner described in Section 2.05(b); or 

   

 (ii) an increased Closing Revenue Run-Rate Purchase Price Reduction, a reduced Closing Revenue Run-Rate Purchase Price Increase or an amount that would give rise for the first time to a Closing Revenue Run-Rate Purchase Price Reduction, then Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount that is equal to the amount of such increase to the Closing Revenue Run-Rate Purchase Price Reduction, the amount of such reduction to the Closing Revenue Run-Rate Purchase Price Increase or the amount of the Closing Revenue Run-Rate Purchase Price Reduction (as applicable) as soon as is reasonably practicable after, but in any event within three Business Days of, the date upon which the recalculation described in this Section 2.06(b)(ii) is made, with such payment reducing the Aggregate Cash Consideration and the Aggregate Equity Consideration in the manner described in Section 2.05(b). 

  

 (c) Any reduction or increase in the Aggregate Cash Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.06 shall be payable in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account of Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, with a bank designated by such receiving party. Any reduction or increase in the Aggregate Equity Consideration shall be payable by delivering to Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, stock certificates representing such adjustment to the Aggregate Equity Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.06 (with the number of shares of Buyer Stock to be delivered calculated based on the Buyer Signing Price) or, if the Aggregate Equity Consideration is uncertificated, other appropriate evidence of ownership reasonably acceptable to such receiving party. 

   ##### 

 

  

 (d) For purposes of this Section 2.06, all references to the Closing Measurement Date included in the definitions of Adjusted Assets Under Management and Closing Revenue Run-Rate shall be deemed references to the Closing Date.

  

 Section 2.07 _. Allocation of Purchase Price._ (a) Buyer and Seller agree that (i) the Asset Consideration shall consist solely of a portion of the Aggregate Cash Consideration, (ii) the Merger Consideration shall consist solely of the Aggregate Equity Consideration and (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 7.09(b), the consideration for the sale of the Van Kampen Seed Capital of the Van Kampen Seeded Funds shall consist solely of an amount of cash equal to the Van Kampen Seed Capital Closing NAV for the Van Kampen Seeded Funds, which amount shall consist of a portion of the Aggregate Cash Consideration. Exhibit I attached hereto sets forth the parties allocation of the Aggregate Cash Consideration and the Aggregate Equity Consideration in accordance with the preceding sentence.

  

 (b) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than 60 days, after the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a statement (the "Allocation Statement") allocating the Asset Consideration (plus Assumed Liabilities, to the extent properly taken into account under Section 1060 of the Code) among the Purchased Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code. If within 20 days after the delivery of the Allocation Statement Seller notifies Buyer in writing that Seller objects to the allocation set forth in the Allocation Statement, Buyer and Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to resolve such dispute within 30 days. In the event that Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve such dispute within 30 days, Buyer and Seller shall jointly cause the Accounting Referee to resolve the disputed items. Upon resolution of the disputed items, the allocation reflected on the Allocation Statement shall be adjusted to reflect such resolution. The costs, fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller.

  

 (c) Seller and Buyer agree to (i) be bound by the final Allocation Statement and (ii) act in accordance with the final allocation in the preparation, filing and audit of any Tax return (including filing Form 8594 with its federal income Tax return for the taxable year that includes the date of the Closing).

  

 (d) If an adjustment is made with respect to the Aggregate Purchase Price pursuant to any of Sections 2.06, 2.07, 2.08 or 11.02, Exhibit I and the Allocation Statement shall be adjusted as mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller (and, in the case of the Allocation Statement, in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code), using the procedures set forth in Section 2.07(b), _mutatis mutandis_.

  

 (e) Not later than 60 days prior to the filing of their respective Forms 8594 relating to this transaction, each party shall deliver to the other party a copy of its Form 8594.

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 2.08 _. Assignment of Contracts and Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Purchased Asset or any right thereunder if an attempted or actual assignment, without the consent of a third party, would constitute a breach or in any way adversely affect the rights of Buyer or Seller thereunder. Seller will use reasonable best efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, on or prior to the Closing Date, the consent of the other parties to any such Purchased Asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder for the assignment thereof to Buyer as Buyer may request. Buyer will cooperate with Seller, at no additional cost to Buyer, in such manner as may reasonably be requested in connection therewith. If such consent is not obtained on or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall continue to use reasonable best efforts to obtain any such consent for a period of 90 days after the Closing Date, and in the event that any such consent is not obtained by the Closing Date, or if an attempted assignment thereof would be ineffective or would adversely affect the rights of Seller thereunder so that Buyer would not in fact receive all such rights, Seller and Buyer will cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement (a "Work-around") under which Buyer would obtain the benefits and assume the obligations thereunder in accordance with this Agreement, including sub-contracting, sub-licensing, or sub-leasing to Buyer, or under which Seller would enforce for the benefit of Buyer, with Buyer assuming Sellers obligations to the extent Buyer would have been responsible therefor if such consent had been obtained and to the extent Buyer or its Affiliates receive the benefits thereof, any and all rights of Seller against a third party thereto. Seller will promptly pay to Buyer when received all monies received by Seller under any Purchased Asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 2.08 shall not apply to any Contracts that are subject to Section 7.05. 

  

 Section 2.09 _. Certain Adjustments._ If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, the outstanding shares of capital stock of Buyer shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of any reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or reverse stock split, combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period or other similar change in capitalization, the Aggregate Equity Consideration shall be appropriately and proportionately adjusted. 

  

 Section 2.10 _. Post-Closing Cash Cap._ (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, unless Seller exercises an Alternative Transaction Structure Election pursuant to Section 7.11, to the extent that any cash payment otherwise required to be made by Buyer to Seller under this Agreement after the Closing would result in the Aggregate Post-Closing Buyer Cash Payments being in excess of the Post-Closing Cash Cap (any such excess, an "Excess Post-Closing Buyer Cash Payment"), then: 

   ##### 

  

   

 (i) Buyer shall not be required under this Agreement to make such Excess Post-Closing Buyer Cash Payment to Seller, and 

   

 (ii) in lieu thereof, Buyer shall (x) pay to Seller in cash an amount equal to 60% of such Excess Post-Closing Buyer Cash Payment, and (y) deliver to Seller a number of shares of Buyer Stock equal to the quotient (rounded down to the next whole share) of (A) 40% of such Excess Post-Closing Buyer Cash Payment over (B) the Buyer COI Price; _provided_ that to the extent delivery of the Buyer Stock pursuant to this clause (ii) would cause Sellers beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d of the Exchange Act) of Buyer Stock to exceed the Common Stock Cap, Buyer shall deliver to Seller (x) the maximum number of shares of Buyer Stock that can be owned by Seller without Sellers and its Affiliates collective ownership exceeding the Common Stock Cap plus (y) a number of shares of Equivalent Buyer Preferred Stock that is convertible into the number of shares of Buyer Stock that would have been delivered absent this proviso less the number of shares of Buyer Stock referred to in clause (x). 

  

 (b) For purposes of this Agreement, 

   

 (i) "Aggregate Post-Closing Buyer Cash Payments" means, at any time, the aggregate amount of cash payments previously made or to be made at such time by Buyer to Seller after the Closing. 

   

 (ii) "Buyer COI Price" means $22.75. 

   

 (iii) "Merger Consideration Percentage" means 66.755%. 

   

 (iv) "Post-Closing Cash Cap" means the value determined for X, expressed in dollars, where: 

 

       |   |   |   |   
---|---|---|---|--- 
    

X 

  |   | =   |   | ((A * B) / .40)  (A * B)  C  
  



  |   |   |   |   
  

and

  |   |   |   |   
  



  |   |   |   |   
  

A 

  |   | =   |   | the Buyer COI Price;  
  



  |   |   |   |   
  

B 

  |   | =   |   | the excess of (i) the product of the Aggregate
Equity Consideration, prior to any adjustment to such number pursuant to
this Agreement, and the Merger Consideration Percentage, over (ii) the amount
of any reduction (expressed as a number of shares) in the Aggregate Equity
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.05 or 2.06(b); and  
   

    ##### 

 

  

       |   |   |   |   
---|---|---|---|---

the Merger Consideration Percentage.

 Subject to Section 13.11, except as set forth in the Seller Disclosure Schedule, Seller represents and warrants to Buyer as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as follows:

  

 Section 3.01 _. Organization and Qualification._ Seller and each of its Subsidiaries that owns Purchased Assets is a legal entity duly organized or incorporated, validly existing and, to the extent such concept is relevant in the applicable jurisdiction, in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization or incorporation. To the extent relating to the Van Kampen Business or the ability of Seller to enter into or consummate the transactions contemplated hereby: (i) Seller and each of its Subsidiaries that owns Purchased Assets has the requisite corporate or other similar power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as conducted as of the date of this Agreement and to own, lease and operate all of its properties and assets, in all material respects as conducted, owned, leased or operated as of the date of this Agreement; and (ii) Seller and each of its Subsidiaries that owns Purchased Assets is duly qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the character or location of the properties and assets owned, leased or operated by it makes such qualification necessary other than any failure to be so qualified that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Van Kampen Material Adverse Effect. Seller has made available to Buyer prior to the date of this Agreement complete and correct copies of the Organizational Documents of Seller and each of its Subsidiaries that owns Purchased Assets as in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

Buyer Stock or Equivalent Buyer Preferred Stock, as the case may be, 
_provided_ that the primary purpose of any such transaction is not to avoid
the provisions of this Agreement and that the successor or surviving Person
to such a merger, amalgamation, plan of arrangement or consolidation or
similar business combination transaction, if not Seller, expressly assumes
all obligations of Seller under this Agreement. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term Transfer shall include the sale of an Affiliate of Seller
or Sellers interest in an Affiliate which owns any Buyer Stock or Equivalent
Buyer Preferred Stock, as the case may be, unless such Transfer is in
connection with a merger, amalgamation, plan of arrangement or consolidation
or similar business combination transaction referred to in the first proviso
of the previous sentence. 

  

 (c) Any certificates for shares of the Aggregate Equity Consideration issued pursuant to this Agreement or issued subsequent to the Closing Date as a result of any transfer of such shares or any stock dividend, stock split or other recapitalization shall bear a legend or legends (and appropriate comparable notations or other arrangements will be made with respect to any uncertificated shares) referencing restrictions on transfer of such shares under the Securities Act and under this Agreement which legend shall state in substance: 

   

"The securities evidenced by this certificate have been issued and sold
without registration under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act"), or the securities laws of any state of the
United States (a "State Act") in reliance upon certain exemptions
from registration under said acts. The securities evidenced by this
certificate cannot be sold, assigned or otherwise transferred within the
United States unless such sale, assignment or other transfer is (1) made
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act
and in accordance with each applicable State Act or (2) exempt from, or not
subject to, the Securities Act and each applicable State Act. If the proposed
sale, assignment or other transfer within the United States will be made
pursuant to clause (2) above, the holder must, prior to such
sale, assignment or other transfer, furnish to the issuer
such certifications, legal opinions and other information as the issuer may
reasonably require to determine that such sale, assignment or other transfer
is being made in accordance with such clause. 

   ##### 

  

   

The securities evidenced by this certificate are subject to restrictions on
transfer set forth in a Transaction Agreement dated October 19, 2009 between
Morgan Stanley and Invesco Ltd." 

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holder of any certificate(s) for shares of
the Aggregate Equity Consideration shall be entitled to receive from Buyer
new certificates for a like number of shares not bearing such legend (or the
elimination or termination of such notations or arrangements) upon the
request of such holder at (x) such time as such restrictions are no longer
applicable, and (y) with respect to the restriction on transfer of such
shares under the Securities Act, delivery of an opinion of counsel to such
holder, which opinion is reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the
Buyer and its counsel, that the restriction referenced in such legend (or such
notations or arrangements) is no longer required for purposes of applicable
securities Law. 

   

 Section 5.04 _. Standstill._ (a) Subject to Section 5.04(b), from the Closing Date until the second anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Standstill Period"), Seller shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries (or any successor to Seller, whether by merger, consolidation, share exchange or other business combination transaction), directly or indirectly, to, without Buyers prior written consent, (i) acquire, agree to acquire, propose or offer to acquire, or facilitate the acquisition or ownership of, any Buyer Stock, other than as provided for in this Agreement, or any other securities or assets of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) deposit any shares of Buyer Stock in a voting trust or similar arrangement or subject any shares of Buyer Stock to any voting agreement, pooling arrangement or similar arrangement, or grant any proxy with respect to any shares of Buyer Stock to any Person or "group" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than Buyer or a Person specified by Buyer in a proxy card provided to Seller by or on behalf of Buyer), (iii) enter, agree to enter, propose or offer to enter into or facilitate any merger, business combination, recapitalization, restructuring, change in control transaction or other extraordinary transaction involving the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, (iv) make, or in any way participate or engage in, any "solicitation" of "proxies" (as such terms are used in the proxy rules of the SEC) to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of, any voting securities of Buyer or its Subsidiaries, (v) call, or seek to call, a meeting of the shareholders of Buyer or initiate any shareholder proposal for action by shareholders of Buyer, (vi) form, join or in any way participate in a "group" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) with respect to any voting securities of Buyer, (vii) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to Control or influence the management or the policies of Buyer, (viii) disclose any intention, plan or arrangement prohibited by, or inconsistent with, the foregoing or (ix) advise, assist or encourage or enter into any discussions, negotiations, agreements or arrangements with any other persons in connection with the foregoing. Seller further agrees that, during the Standstill Period, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates (nor any Person acting on behalf of or in concert with Seller or any of its Affiliates) shall, without the written consent 

   ##### 

 

  

of Buyer, (x) request Buyer, directly or indirectly, to amend or waive any
provision of this Section 5.04(a) (including this sentence) or (y) take any
action that might require Buyer to make a public announcement regarding the
possibility of a business combination, merger or other type of transaction
described in this Section 5.04(a) with Seller or any of its Affiliates

 Section 5.05 _. Non-Solicitation of Alternative Transactions._ (a) Unless and until this Agreement will have been terminated in accordance with its terms, Seller shall not, and Seller shall cause its Affiliates not to, and shall cause its and its Affiliates officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants or other agents or advisors not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or take any action to facilitate or encourage the submission of any proposal to acquire or purchase any capital stock of, or merger consolidation, combination, sale of assets, reorganization or similar transaction involving the Transferred Entities or the Van Kampen Business, (ii) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with or authorize any financial advisor or other Person to solicit or participate in discussions or negotiations with, furnish any non-public information relating to the Van Kampen Business (other than as to the existence of these provisions) or afford access to the business, employees, properties, assets, books or records of the Van Kampen Business to, otherwise knowingly cooperate in any way with, or knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by any Person other than Buyer and its Affiliates to make such a proposal, (iii) enter into any agreement with any party other than the Buyer and its Affiliates with respect to such a proposal, or (iv) authorize any of the foregoing actions.

  

 (b) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, to immediately terminate and cause to be terminated any and all existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than Buyer and its Affiliates) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing actions described in Section 5.04(a). Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, enforce their respective rights under, and shall not, release any third party from, the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any agreement to which Seller or its Affiliates is a party with respect to a potential sale of capital stock of, or merger, consolidation, combination, sale of assets, reorganization or similar transaction involving the Transferred Entities or the Van Kampen Business and shall promptly take all steps necessary to terminate any approval that may have been heretofore given under any such provisions authorizing any such third party to make any proposal regarding the foregoing.

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 5.06 _. Resignations._ On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller will deliver to Buyer the resignations (with effect as of Closing) from their positions with any Transferred Entity of all officers of any Transferred Entity who will be employed by Seller or any of its Affiliates after the Closing Date. 

  

 Section 5.07 _. Non-Solicit._ (a) In order to induce Buyer to enter into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Seller hereby covenants and agrees that from the date hereof until the second anniversary of the Closing Date, it will not, and it shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, solicit (including through internal job postings) or hire, or assist in the hiring of, or otherwise engage or assist in engaging any employee of the Van Kampen Business as of the Closing Date; _provided_ that, solely with respect to the two-year period after the Closing Date (and not the period prior thereto) general, non-targeted advertising (other than through internal job postings) or the use of an independent search firm that contacts employees of the Van Kampen Business without direction or advice by Seller or its Subsidiaries shall not be deemed to be direct or indirect solicitations, and any person not solicited in violation hereof may be hired by Seller; _provided further_ that, during such two-year period, notwithstanding the foregoing proviso, in no event shall Seller or its Subsidiaries hire (i) any Executive Director of any Transferred Entity or the Van Kampen Business who provides distribution services or (ii) any managing director of any Transferred Entity or the Van Kampen Business. The foregoing prohibition shall not apply to any employee whose employment has been terminated by a Transferred Entity, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates after the Closing. 

  

 (b) It is the intent of the parties to this Agreement that the provisions of this Section 5.07 shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the Laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. If any particular provision or portion of this Section 5.07 shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision or portion thereof shall be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to render such provision or portion valid and enforceable, such amendment to apply only with respect to the operation of such provision or portion in the particular jurisdiction in which such adjudication is made. 

  

 (c) The parties acknowledge that damages and remedies at Law for any breach of this Section 5.07 would be inadequate and that Buyer shall be entitled to specific performance and other equitable remedies (including an injunction) and such other relief as a court or tribunal may deem appropriate in addition to any other remedies Buyer may have in the event of a breach of this Section 5.07. 

  

 Section 5.08 _. Regulatory Capital; Other Cash in the Business._ (a) Seller shall take such actions as may be required to ensure that, as of the Closing, and after taking into consideration any dividends or distributions by the Transferred Entities and any settlement of intercompany arrangements, the Broker-Dealer has stockholders equity equal to at least $46 million (and such other cash and cash 

   ##### 

  

    

equivalents as may be required under Section 5.08(c) and referred to in the
last sentence thereof). 

  

 (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Seller shall identify those current assets and current liabilities of the Transferred Entities that can be validly assigned and assumed at the Closing by it or one of its Subsidiaries, and, subject to Buyers agreement as to the current assets being assigned and current liabilities being assumed, Seller and the Transferred Entities shall effect such transaction at the Closing pursuant to an assignment and assumption agreement that is in form and substance acceptable to both Seller and Buyer; _provided_ that the parties understand and agree that the asset described on Section 5.08(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be transferred to Seller or an Affiliate of Seller pursuant to this Section, including the long-term portion thereof (and these items will be excluded for purposes of the calculations required by clauses (iv) and (v) of Section 5.08(c)). Seller and Buyer shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to reach agreement on mechanisms to effect an assignment and assumption of all current assets and current liabilities of the Transferred Entities as of the Closing Date (subject to any regulatory restrictions in relation to the Broker-Dealer). 

  

 (c) Seller shall take such actions as may be required to ensure that, as of the Closing, and after taking into account any dividends or distributions by the Transferred Entities, any settlement of intercompany arrangements, accounts and balances pursuant to Section 7.04 and any assignment of current assets and assumption of current liabilities of the Transferred Entities by Seller or a Subsidiary of Seller that may be effected pursuant to Section 5.08(b), the Transferred Entities hold cash and cash equivalents (except to the extent this calculation results in a negative number) in an amount that is at least equal to (i) $28,000,000 _plus_ (ii) the 2009 Deferred Compensation Amount _plus_ (iii) the 2010 Compensation Accrual _plus_ (iv) an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the current liabilities of the Van Kampen Business reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet over the current assets of the Van Kampen Business reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet (excluding, in the case of this calculation, the entire current portion (if any) of the 2009 Deferred Compensation Amount and the 2010 Compensation Accrual) _minus_ (v) an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the current assets of the Van Kampen Business reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet over the current liabilities of the Van Kampen Business reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet (excluding, in the case of this calculation, the entire current portion (if any) of the 2009 Deferred Compensation Amount and the 2010 Compensation Accrual) _plus_ (vi) an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the long term liabilities of the Van Kampen Business reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet constituting compensation, retirement and/or benefits expenses for the Transferred Employees over the long term liabilities of the Van Kampen Business reflected on the Balance Sheet constituting compensation, retirement and/or benefits expenses for the Transferred Employees (excluding, in the case of this calculation, the entire long-term portion of the 2009 Deferred Compensation Amount and the 2010 Compensation Accrual) but only to the extent such excess 

   ##### 

  

    

results from such long term liabilities of which Seller was aware as of the
date hereof and which would have been required to be reflected on a balance
sheet prepared as of the date hereof in accordance with GAAP; _provided_
that, when calculating the amount of cash and cash equivalents that are
required to be held by the Transferred Entities under this Section 5.08(c) (or
paid to Seller pursuant to the next sentence), all calculations with respect
to the Closing Balance Sheet shall exclude (1) all cash or cash equivalents
required to be retained by the Van Kampen Business pursuant to Section
5.08(a) or this Section 5.08(c), (2) all Tax assets and liabilities
(including deferred Tax assets and liabilities) and (3) the Van Kampen Seed
Capital and the Deferred Assets. Further, if the calculation required by the
prior sentence results in a negative number, then Buyer shall make a payment
in that amount to Seller at Closing. For all purposes of this
Section 5.08(c), the term "Transferred Entities" shall not include the Broker
Dealer, except that, in partial satisfaction of its obligations under this
Section 5.08(c), Seller shall be entitled to leave cash and cash equivalents
with the Broker-Dealer in an aggregate amount that is equal to the portions
of the 2009 Deferred Compensation Amount and the 2010 Compensation Accrual (as
determined in accordance with this Section 5.08 and the definitions thereof)
that have accrued on the balance sheet of the Broker-Dealer in respect
thereof as the date of the Closing Balance Sheet. 

  

 (d) For purposes of the Closing, references above to Closing Balance Sheet shall be deemed references to the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet. Promptly following the finalization of the Closing Balance Sheet pursuant to Section 5.08(e), the cash amount required to be held by the Transferred Entities (or paid to Seller) under Section 5.08(c) shall be re-calculated based on the Closing Balance Sheet. If the cash amount as so re-calculated would result in a greater cash amount being required hereunder to be held by the Transferred Entities, Seller shall promptly pay such difference to Buyer. If the cash amount as so re-calculated would result in a lesser cash amount being required hereunder to be held by the Transferred Entities, Buyer shall promptly pay such difference to Seller. If a payment was made to Seller pursuant to the terms of Section 5.08(c), then payments will be similarly made to Buyer or Seller, as appropriate, based on any such re-calculation. Any payment pursuant to this Section 5.08(d) shall be made at a mutually convenient time and place within 10 days after the finalization of the Closing Balance Sheet, by delivery by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account of such receiving party with a bank designated by such receiving party. The amount of any payment to be made pursuant to this Section shall bear interest from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the Treasury Rate. As used herein, "Treasury Rate" shall mean the applicable interest rate payable on United States Treasury obligations with a maturity date most closely corresponding to the applicable payment period, as of the end of such period. Such interest shall be payable at the same time and in the same manner as the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed. 

   ##### 

 

  

 (e) In connection with the foregoing:

  

 (i) Not later than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Buyer an estimated combined balance sheet of the Van Kampen Business prepared on a basis that the Closing was effective as of the month end prior to the Closing Date (or, in the event the Closing Date is expected to occur in the first five days of a month, the preceding month end) (the "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet"). The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in the same manner as the Closing Balance Sheet, except for the date of such balance sheet and except that the resolution provisions of this Section 5.08(e) shall not apply thereto.

  

 (ii) As promptly as practicable, but no later than 45 days, after the Closing Date, Seller will cause to be prepared and delivered to Buyer the combined balance sheet of the Van Kampen Business prepared on a basis that the Closing was effective as of 11:59 p.m., New York City time on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet"). The Closing Balance Sheet shall present the combined financial position of the Van Kampen Business (for the avoidance of doubt, including the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities) and be prepared on a basis consistent with the Balance Sheet (except excluding the Broker-Dealer) as of 11:59 p.m. on the date immediately preceding the Closing Date which shall, for the avoidance of doubt, include an accrual for the 2009 Deferred Compensation Amount and the 2010 Compensation Accrual. Attached as Section 5.08(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule for illustrative purposes only is a draft Closing Balance Sheet created as if the Closing had occurred as of 11:59 p.m. on June 30, 2009, and calculating the cash amount required to be held by the Transferred Entities under Section 5.08(c) (or paid to Seller) had the Closing occurred on that date.

  

 (iii) If Buyer disagrees with the Closing Balance Sheet delivered pursuant to Section 5.08(e)(ii), Buyer may, within 30 days after delivery of such Closing Balance Sheet and any related documents that Seller reasonably requests in connection with its review of the Closing Balance Sheet, deliver a notice to Seller disagreeing therewith. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify those items or amounts as to which Buyer disagrees, and Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Closing Balance Sheet.

  

 (iv) If a notice of disagreement shall be delivered pursuant to Section 5.08(e)(iii), Buyer and Seller shall, during the 30 days following such delivery, use their reasonable best efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to finalize the Closing Balance Sheet. If, during such period, Buyer and Seller are unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause independent accountants of nationally recognized standing reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and

   ##### 

 

  

Seller (who shall not have any material relationship with Buyer, Seller or any
of their respective Affiliates) (the "Accounting Referee"), promptly to
review this Agreement and the remaining disputed items or amounts for the
purpose of finalizing the Closing Balance Sheet. In making such calculation,
the Accounting Referee shall consider only those items or amounts in the
Closing Balance Sheet as to which Buyer has disagreed. The Accounting Referee
shall deliver to Buyer and Seller, as promptly as practicable (but in all
events no later than 45 days after the matter is referred to the Accounting
Referee), a report setting forth the final Closing Balance Sheet. Such report
shall be final and binding upon Buyer, Seller and their respective Affiliates
and such final Closing Balance Sheet shall be used to calculate the cash
amount required to be held by the Transferred Entities under Section 5.08(b)
(or paid to Seller). The cost of such review and report shall be borne by
Seller and by Buyer in proportion to the relative differences between the
resulting calculations of the cash amount required to be held by the
Transferred Entities (or paid to Seller) under Section 5.08(b) by virtue of
the Closing Balance Sheet as first proposed by Seller pursuant to Section
5.08(e)(ii) and as proposed to be revised by Buyer pursuant to Section
5.08(e)(iii).

  

 (v) Buyer and Seller agree that they will, and agree to cause their respective Affiliates and independent accountants to cooperate and assist in the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and in the conduct of the reviews referred to in this Section 5.08(e), including the making available to the extent necessary of books, records, work papers and personnel.

  

 (f) For the avoidance of doubt, the calculations to be made pursuant to this Section 5.08, and the net purchase price adjustment to be made pursuant to Section 5.08, are not intended to provide an alternate remedy to Article 11 for any breach or alleged breach of the Sellers representations and warranties made pursuant to Article 3.

  

 Section 5.09 _. Trademarks; Tradenames._ Except as otherwise set forth in the IP Matters Agreement, after the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Entities) shall not use (i) any of the Trademarks or Internet domain names owned by one or more of the Transferred Entities or included in the Purchased Assets, including those set forth on Section 3.16(b) or (ii) the "Van Kampen" name or any derivatives thereof.

ARTICLE 6 
 Covenants of Buyer 

   

 Buyer agrees that: 

  

 Section 6.01 _. Conduct of Business of Buyer._ (a) From the date of this Agreement to and through the earlier of the Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, except (i) as set forth in Section 6.01 of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, (ii) as otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) as required by any applicable Law or (iv) as Seller shall otherwise consent in writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, conduct its business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice in all material respects. 

  

 (b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.01(a), from the date of this Agreement to and through the earlier of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, except (i) as set forth in Section 6.01 of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, (ii) as otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) as required by any applicable Law or (iv) as Seller shall otherwise consent in writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, do any of the following: 

   

 (A) other than common stock dividends not in excess of $0.15 per share per quarter, and other than as required by the terms of any preferred security, make any distribution (whether in cash, stock, Equity Rights or property, but not including any distribution that results in an adjustment under Section 2.09) or declare, pay or set aside any dividend with respect to, or purchase or otherwise acquire directly, or indirectly, any equity interest or shares of capital stock of Buyer; 

   

 (B) amend in any material respect any provision of Buyers Organizational Documents in a manner that would adversely affect the benefits, economic or otherwise, of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to Seller; 

   

 (C) merge or consolidate with any Person or adopt a plan of complete or partial liquidation, dissolution, restructuring, recapitalization or other reorganization, but (other than with respect to a liquidation or dissolution) only to the extent any such action or actions would be reasonably expected to prevent, materially delay or impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder; 

   

 (D) enter into any acquisition agreement, or make any acquisition, that would be reasonably expected to prevent, materially 

   ##### 

  

    

delay or impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder; 

   

 (E) take any action that, if taken after the Closing without Sellers consent, would constitute a breach of Section 7.15(a) (it being understood that, for purposes of this Section 6.01(b)(iv)(E), Seller may withhold, condition or delay its consent in its sole discretion); or 

   

 (F) authorize or enter into any Contract or commitment with respect to any of the foregoing. 

  

 Section 6.02 _. Access to Information._ (a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, Buyer will (1) give Seller, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives reasonable access to the offices, properties, personnel, books and records of Buyer and its Subsidiaries, (2) furnish to Seller, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives such financial and operating data and other information relating to Buyer and its Subsidiaries as such Persons may reasonably request and (3) instruct the employees, counsel and financial advisors of Buyer and its Subsidiaries to cooperate with Seller in its investigation of Buyer and its Subsidiaries. Any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.02(a) shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of Buyer and its Subsidiaries. No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.02(a) shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by any party hereunder. 

  

 (b) From and after the Closing Date, upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, Buyer will promptly provide Seller and its agents reasonable access to its books of account, financial and other records (including accountants work papers), information, employees and auditors to the extent reasonably necessary to permit Seller to determine any matter relating to its rights and obligations hereunder or to any period ending on or before the Closing Date; _provided_ that any such access by Seller shall not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of Buyer. No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by any party hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not have access to (i) materials entitled to legal privilege (or which could jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of Buyer or its Affiliates), (ii) personnel records of Buyer or its Subsidiaries relating to individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other information which in Buyers good faith opinion is sensitive or the disclosure of which could subject Buyer or its Subsidiaries to risk of liability or (iii) other information which in Buyers good faith opinion could reasonably be expected to subject Buyer or its Subsidiaries to liability. The parties shall endeavor in good faith to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements, if practicable, in a manner that does not give rise to any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 6.03 _. Trademarks; Tradenames._ Except as otherwise set forth in the IP Matters Agreement, after the Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates shall not, and shall not permit any Transferred Entity or the Van Kampen Business to, use any of Sellers or its Affiliates marks or names, including the marks and names set forth on Section 6.03 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 Section 6.04 _. Use of Confidential Information._ For the avoidance of doubt, after the Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates shall have no right to use or disclose any confidential information, data or other materials of Seller or its Affiliates (including any such information disclosed to Buyer prior to the date of this Agreement for the purposes of evaluating the transactions contemplated hereby), other than any such information, data or materials included in the Purchased Assets or owned by the Transferred Entities (which the parties agree shall include all information relating to the historical, current and prospective Van Kampen Business) except as set forth in Section 7.13(c), and Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to, and to cause its Affiliates to use reasonable efforts to, return to Seller or destroy all such information, data and materials in its possession promptly after the Closing. 

  

 Section 6.05 _. Stock Exchange Listing._ Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Buyer Stock representing the Aggregate Equity Consideration to be listed on the NYSE on or prior to the Closing Date, subject to official notice of issuance. 

  

 Section 6.06 _. Shelf Registration._ (a) Not later than the first Business Day following the Closing Date, but subject to delay for any Scheduled Black-Out Period (in which case within one Business Day after the lapse thereof) or as set forth in Section 6.06(c) (in which case as soon as possible after the lapse of such postponement or suspension in accordance with the terms thereof), Buyer shall file with the SEC either (i) a Shelf Registration Statement or (ii) pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, a prospectus supplement that shall be deemed to be part of an existing Shelf Registration Statement in accordance with Rule 430B under the Securities Act, in each case relating to the offer and sale of all of the Registrable Securities by Seller from time to time in accordance with the methods of distribution elected by Seller and set forth in the Shelf Registration Statement and shall, if such Shelf Registration Statement is not automatically effective, use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as soon as possible after filing. 

  

 (b) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep such Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective under the Securities Act in order to permit the Shelf Prospectus forming a part thereof to be usable by Seller until the earlier of (i) the date as of which all Registrable Securities have been sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement or another Registration Statement filed under the Securities Act (but in no event prior to any applicable period referred to in Section 4(3) of the Securities Act and Rule 174 thereunder), (ii) the date as of which all Registrable Securities have been sold and (iii) the second 

   ##### 

  

    

anniversary of the Closing (such period of effectiveness, the "Shelf Period").
After the termination of the Shelf Period, if Seller otherwise has the right
to require an underwritten offering of Registrable Shares pursuant to clause
(e) below, Seller shall be entitled to require Buyer to file with the SEC
either a new registration statement or a prospectus supplement that forms
part of an existing Shelf Registration Statement (each, a "Demand Registration
Statement") that provides for such underwritten offer and sale of Registrable
Securities (and, if such Demand Registration Statement is not automatically
effective, to use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Demand
Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as
soon as possible after filing) on a basis otherwise consistent with the terms
of this Section 6.06 relating to the Shelf Registration Statement for the
offer and sale of Registrable Securities. Seller shall notify Buyer in
writing of the date that all of its Registrable Securities have been sold.
Buyer shall not be deemed to have used its reasonable best efforts to keep
the Shelf Registration Statement effective during the Shelf Period if Buyer
voluntarily takes any action or omits to take any action that would result in
Seller thereby not being able to offer and sell any Registrable Securities
pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement during the Shelf Period, unless
such action or omission is required by applicable Law and except as set forth
in Section 6.06(c). Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to remain a
"well-known seasoned issuer" (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities
Act) and to not become an "ineligible issuer" (as defined in Rule 405 under
the Securities Act) during the Shelf Period. 

  

 (c) Buyer shall be entitled to postpone (but not more than 2 times in any calendar year) the filing or initial effectiveness of, or suspend the use of, a Shelf Registration Statement or any Demand Registration Statement if Buyer delivers to Seller a certificate signed by both the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Buyer certifying that, in the good faith judgment of Buyer, such registration, offering or use would reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect or materially interfere with any bona fide material financing of Buyer or any material transaction under consideration by Buyer or would require the disclosure of information that has not been, and is not otherwise required to be, disclosed to the public, the premature disclosure of which would materially and adversely affect Buyer. No such postponement or suspension shall exceed 60 consecutive days, no subsequent such postponement or suspension shall commence fewer than 15 days following the expiration of any preceding period, and the aggregate of all such postponements or suspensions shall not exceed 90 days in any 360-day period. 

  

 (d) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to file the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder, and it will take such further action as Seller may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable Seller to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (i) Rule 144 or 144A or Regulation S under the Securities Act, as such Rules may be amended 

   ##### 

  

    

from time to time, or (ii) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by
the SEC. Upon the request of Seller, Buyer will deliver to Seller a written
statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements and, if not,
the specifics thereof. 

  

 (e) In connection with any underwritten offering effected under the Shelf Registration Statement or any Demand Registration Statement (it being understood that no more than three underwritten offerings may be effected, no such offering shall be conducted for securities aggregating less than $100 million in value and no such underwritten offering shall take place during a Scheduled Black-Out Period), (i) Buyer shall be obligated (A) to pay all registration and other offering-related expenses of Buyer (including fees and expenses of its counsel (who shall deliver customary opinions, such as a 10b-5 opinion to Buyer and Seller), SEC filing fees and fees and expenses of Buyers auditors (who shall prepare a customary comfort letter), but not including any fees or expenses of Seller (including its counsel and underwriting discounts)) and (B) Buyer (and Seller, to the extent applicable) shall be obligated to enter into customary underwriting and indemnification agreements in connection with the offering, including standard indemnification and contribution rights in favor of the underwriters and Seller as the registering holder with respect to the Shelf Registration Statement or any Demand Registration Statement, Shelf Prospectus and disclosure package; (ii) at Sellers reasonable request, Buyer shall cause its senior executives to participate, at Sellers expense, in customary investor presentations and "road shows" for a maximum of 3 days of marketing per offering (to be scheduled in a collaborative manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of Buyer; and (iii) at Sellers request, Seller (or an Affiliate designated by Seller) shall act as sole book-runner in any such underwritten offering, and any other underwriters shall be selected by Seller subject to Buyers consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld).

   ##### 

  

    

consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller and Buyer
agree to execute and deliver such other documents, certificates, agreements
and other writings and to take such other actions as may be necessary or
desirable in order to consummate or implement expeditiously the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Such actions shall include (i) preparing

 (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Buyer and Seller shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable. 

  

 (c) Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in connection with the making of all such filings. Seller and Buyer shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to the rules and regulations of any applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and Buyer may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this Section 7.01(c) as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express 

   ##### 

  

    

permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Buyer or
Seller, as the case may be) or its legal counsel. 

  

 Section 7.02 _. Certain Filings._ Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with one another (i) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Government Entity is required, or any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any material Contracts, in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) in taking such actions or making any such filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith and seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

At least two Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement setting out in reasonable detail the calculation of all such intercompany account balances based upon the latest available financial information as of such date and, to the extent requested by Buyer, provide Buyer with supporting documentation to verify the underlying intercompany charges and transactions.

Except (i) to the extent necessary for the provision of any services as contemplated in any Ancillary Agreement, (ii) as set forth on Section 7.04 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or (iii) as otherwise mutually agreed in writing by Seller and Buyer, all Contracts between Seller or its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Van Kampen Business, on the other hand, are hereby terminated effective as of the Closing and without further liability or obligation (contingent or otherwise) thereunder. 

  

 Section 7.05 _. Fund and Advisory Client Consents._  

  

 (a) _Generally_. 

   

 (i) Subject to the specific requirements of Section 7.05(b) through Section 7.05(e), Seller agrees to use, and to cause each of its Affiliates to use, its reasonable best efforts to obtain the consents and approvals necessary to satisfy prior to the Closing Date the Assignment 

   ##### 

  

    

Requirements with respect to each Existing Advisory Contract. Buyer agrees to
use and to cause each of its Subsidiaries to use its reasonable best efforts
to cooperate with Seller and its Affiliates in their efforts so to satisfy
the Assignment Requirements with respect to each Existing Advisory Contract
(and to obtain the "interim" new advisory contracts described in Section
7.05(b)(i)(B)). In the event that any such Assignment Requirements are not
satisfied on or prior to the Closing Date, following the Closing Date, Buyer
and Seller shall use (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to
use) their respective reasonable best efforts to satisfy such Assignment
Requirements as soon as practicable and in any event within 180 days after
the Closing Date. For any Contingent Account (as determined under clause
(a)(ii) or (iii) of such definition) that exists at the Closing Measurement
Date, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Contingent
Account not to terminate the applicable Existing Advisory Contract prior to
the end of the True-Up Period. In the case of (i) Funds (in or outside
the United States) whose Assignment Requirements are to be satisfied by Fund
Mergers and (ii) Clients (in or outside the United States) whose Assignment
Requirements are to be satisfied through the assignment of their Existing
Advisory Contracts to an affiliate of Buyer, or the replacement of their
Existing Advisory Contracts with a New Advisory Contract with an affiliate of
Buyer (including through Closed-End Fund Assignment Arrangements or Client
Assignment Arrangements), Buyer shall, on a timely basis, use
its commercially reasonable best efforts to ensure that (a) with respect to
the Funds described in clause (i), the respective Buyer Funds and the
requisite investment advisers and other service providers thereto are in each
case properly organized and have the requisite regulatory approvals and
registrations to enable the Fund Mergers to occur by Closing and (b) with
respect to the Clients described in clause (ii), the affiliates of Buyer
proposed to be assignees of such Existing Advisory Contracts, or to be parties
to such New Advisory Contracts, have in each case the requisite regulatory
approvals and registrations to permit such assignments or contract
replacements to occur by Closing. 

   

 (ii) Each of Buyer and Seller agrees to provide promptly in writing all information concerning itself and its Affiliates required to be included in the proxy solicitation, or other consent solicitation, materials or government filings contemplated by this Section 7.05 (including the information required for the 40 Act Management Funds proxy statements or the Fund Merger Proxy Statement/Prospectuses under the Exchange Act or the Investment Company Act or under other applicable Laws). Each of Buyer and Seller agrees promptly to correct such information if and to the extent that such information becomes false or misleading in any material respect. 

   

 (iii) From and after the date hereof and until the end of the True-Up Period, Seller and Buyer shall communicate on a regular basis to 

   ##### 

  

    

stay apprised of such efforts to satisfy the Assignment Requirements and,
upon Buyers reasonable request, Seller shall make available to Buyer copies
of all executed client consents and other documents evidencing satisfaction
of applicable Assignment Requirements. 

   

 (iv) Subject to Section 13.03, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of Seller, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates shall have any obligation under this Agreement to pay any money or other consideration beyond a _de minimis_ review charge to any Person that is a party to an Existing Advisory Contract or to initiate any claim or proceeding against any such Person in order to obtain any consent, approval or New Advisory Contract necessary to satisfy any Assignment Requirement. 

   

 (v) With respect to each Client, and subject to the specific requirements of Section 7.05(a)(v)(A) and Section 7.05(a)(v)(B), the parties shall cooperate to make reasonable and appropriate arrangements for the continued provision of investment management services to such Client by the respective Van Kampen Business portfolio management team (provided such team is intended to transfer to Buyer pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby (any such team, a "Transferring Team")) from the Closing Date until the end of the True-Up Period (or such other date as the parties may agree), including pursuant to a Temporary Investment Services Agreement. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, in respect of any services provided under a Temporary Investment Services Agreement (including pursuant to Section 7.05(b)(i)(B)) by a party hereto (or an Affiliate), the other party hereto shall, in a timely manner, reimburse (or cause to be reimbursed) such party (or such Affiliate) for its "Service Costs" (as defined in the Transition Services Agreement; except that for this purpose, (x) "Provider" as used therein will be deemed to mean such party or such Affiliate providing the services under such Temporary Investment Services Agreement and (y) "Services" as used therein will mean the services provided under such Temporary Investment Services Agreement) in providing such services; _provided, however,_ that this sentence shall not apply to any fees or "Service Costs" payable in respect of an "interim" new advisory contract entered into pursuant to Rule 15a-4 under the Investment Company Act if such application would result in a violation of Law. 

   

 (A) With respect to each Client (other than a Non-Consenting Morgan Stanley Client) whose Transferring Team has not converted to Buyers front-office and middle-office platform (i.e., the Charles River system and similar portfolio management or trading systems) and become employees of Buyer (or a Subsidiary of Buyer) by the Closing (or, if later in the case of such a Morgan Stanley-Branded Transferred Client, the date such Client satisfies the respective Assignment Requirements), such 

   ##### 

  

    

Transferring Team shall (to the extent permitted by Law) provide
investment management services to such Client through a Subsidiary of Seller
pursuant to a Temporary Investment Services Agreement from Closing until the
earlier of (i) the date of such conversion and employment of such
Transferring Team and (ii) the end of the True-Up Period (or such earlier
time as may be required by law, including Rule 15a-4 under the Investment
Company Act). Nothing in this Section 7.05(a)(v)(A) shall be construed to
mean that either Buyer or Seller (or any Fund) is required to seek any
approval from the interest holders of a Fund other than in connection with
the consent solicitation process otherwise provided for in this Section
7.05. 

   

 (B) With respect to each Morgan Stanley-Branded Transferred Client that has not satisfied the respective Assignment Requirements as of the Closing Date (a "Non-Consenting Morgan Stanley Client"), the parties shall cooperate to make reasonable and appropriate arrangements for the continued provision of investment management services to such Client by the respective Transferring Team (notwithstanding that, at the Closing Date, such team may transfer to Buyer) until the end of the Delegation Period. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except in the case of 40 Act Management Funds (for which provision in this regard is made by Section 7.05(b)(i)(B)), the parties shall, in a timely manner, take the actions reasonably necessary, and in accordance with the requirements of Law, to permit Buyer (or its Affiliates) and Seller (or its Affiliates) each to act, pursuant to a Temporary Investment Services Agreement, as delegated investment manager, or as sub-advisor or in a similar capacity (any such arrangement, a "Delegation Arrangement") with respect to a Non-Consenting Morgan Stanley Client during the Delegation Period to the extent reasonably necessary or convenient to permit the respective Transferring Team to continue to provide investment management services with respect to such Client, including to the extent required (i) by notifying such Client (and, in the case of a Fund, the interest holders thereof) of such Delegation Arrangements as part of the consent solicitation process provided for in this Section 7.05 and (ii) prior to Closing, making any necessary regulatory filings and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals to reflect and implement such Delegation Arrangements. Nothing in this Section 7.05(a)(v)(B) shall be construed to mean that either Buyer or Seller (or any Fund) is required to seek any approval from the interest holders of a Fund other than in connection with the consent solicitation process otherwise provided for in this Section 7.05. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) _ 40 Act Management Funds. _With respect to each 40 Act Management Fund: 

   

 (i) Seller agrees to use, and to cause each of its Affiliates to use, reasonable best efforts to obtain (A) the consents and approvals (including such approvals by the board of directors or trustees and shareholders of such 40 Act Management Fund) for (1) in the case of an open-end 40 Act Management Fund that is not a Sub-Advised Fund, a Fund Merger, (2)in the case of a closed-end 40 Act Management Fund that is not a Sub-Advised Fund, a Closed-End Fund Assignment Arrangement and (3) in the case of a 40 Act Management Fund that is a Sub-Advised Fund, a New Advisory Contract on terms substantially comparable (but having the same advisory and same aggregate non-advisory fees) to those of the applicable Existing Advisory Contract in effect as of the date hereof, in each case in accordance with the requirements of applicable Law, including Section 15 of the Investment Company Act, to the extent necessary to satisfy the Assignment Requirements with respect to the Existing Advisory Contract for such 40 Act Management Fund and (B) all required approvals by the board of directors or trustees of such 40 Act Management Fund of an "interim" new advisory contract pursuant to Rule 15a-4 thereunder (but only to the extent (1) all required consents and approvals for such Fund Merger or Closed-End Fund Assignment Arrangement or New Advisory Contract (in the case of a Sub-Advised Fund), as the case may be, are not obtained prior to Closing and/or (2) necessary to implement the intent of Section 7.05(a)(v)), it being understood that with respect to such "interim" new advisory contract for each 40 Act Management Fund that is a Morgan Stanley-Branded Transferred Client, a Subsidiary of Seller shall be named as primary investment adviser and a Subsidiary of Buyer shall be named as sub-adviser pursuant to a Temporary Investment Services Agreement. 

   

 (ii) Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such 40 Act Management Fund (to the extent shareholder consent shall be required for such Fund Merger, Closed-End Fund Assignment Arrangement or New Advisory Contract, as the case may be) to call a special meeting of the shareholders of such 40 Act Management Fund to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement for purposes of obtaining the requisite approval of such shareholders for such Fund Merger, Closed-End Fund Assignment Arrangement or New Advisory Contract (in the case of a Sub-Advised Fund), as the case may be. In connection therewith, (A) with respect to (1) each 40 Act Management Fund that is a Sub-Advised Fund (but, in the case of Sub-Advised Funds, only to the extent such shareholder approval is required by Law) or is not an open-end fund, Seller will use (or will cause an Affiliate to use) its reasonable best efforts to cause each such 40 Act Management Fund to prepare and to file with the SEC (to the extent such filing is required) all proxy solicitation materials necessary to comply in all material respects 

   ##### 

  

    

with the applicable provisions of Section 14 of the Exchange Act and Section
20 of the Investment Company Act and (2) each open-end 40 Act Management
Fund that is not a Sub-Advised Fund, Buyer will use (or will cause an
Affiliate to use) its reasonable best efforts to cause the Buyer Fund that is
the party to such 40 Act Management Funds proposed Fund Merger to prepare
and to file with the SEC (to the extent such filing is required) all
securities registrations statements and prospectuses and proxy
solicitation materials necessary to comply in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Securities Act, Section 14 of the Exchange Act
and Section 20 of the Investment Company Act, including a securities
registration statement on SEC Form N-14 (or successor form thereto)
containing a joint proxy statement and prospectus (a "Fund Merger
Proxy Statement/Prospectus"), (B) Seller will use (or will cause an Affiliate
to use) its reasonable best efforts to cause each such 40 Act Management
Fund (1) to mail such proxy solicitation materials (including, as applicable,
a Fund Merger Proxy Statement/Prospectus) to the shareholders of such 40 Act
Management Fund as promptly as practicable after review by the SEC and (2) as
soon as practicable following the mailing of such proxy solicitation
materials, submit, or cause to be submitted, to the shareholders of such 40
Act Management Fund, for a vote at such shareholders meeting, the proposals
described in the first sentence of this Section 7.05(b)(ii). For the
avoidance of doubt, the Existing Advisory Contract of each Morgan Stanley-
Branded Transferred Client that is a 40 Act Management Fund shall be
assigned to Buyer or one of its subsidiaries in the event that the Assignment
Requirements with respect to such Fund have not been satisfied as of Closing,
which purported assignment will have the effect of terminating such Existing
Advisory Contracts and thereby permit the Seller Fund board to
appoint interim adviser(s) pursuant to Rule 15a-4(b)(2) of the Investment
Company Act; _provided_  that such assignment shall be effected (A) with
respect to each such Morgan Stanley-Branded Transferred Client whose
portfolio management team is a Transferring Team, upon Closing, with no
consideration being given to the date by which such team has converted to
Buyers front-office and middle-office platform and become employees of
Buyer (or a Subsidiary of Buyer); (B) with respect to each other such Morgan
Stanley-Branded Transferred Client, at Closing; and (C) at such other time as
the parties may agree. 

   

 (iii) Buyer and Seller agree that consent for any Existing Advisory Contract with a 40 Act Management Fund shall be deemed given for all purposes under this Agreement only if a Fund Merger, Closed-End Fund Assignment Arrangement or New Advisory Contract (in the case of a Sub-Advised Fund), as the case may be, has been approved by the board of such 40 Act Management Fund under Section 7.05(b)(i)(A) and by the shareholders of the applicable Fund in accordance with Section 7.05(b)(ii) and applicable Law (but, in the case of Sub- 

   ##### 

  

    

Advised Funds, only to the extent such shareholder approvals are required by
Law). 

  

 (c) _Other Registered Funds_. With respect to any Fund that is Registered with any Government Entity as an investment fund (or the equivalent) and is not a 40 Act Management Fund, as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, to the extent required by applicable Law or the terms of any Existing Advisory Contract with such Fund, Seller shall (or shall cause an Affiliate to) (i) provide notice (the "Notice") of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to such Fund and, where required by applicable Law, to the investors in such Fund, and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to obtain any approval, consent or other action, if any, that is required from or by the board of directors or other comparable governing body of such Fund, the investors in such Fund or any regulating or self-regulating authority for such Fund, (A) in the case of any such Fund that is not a Japan Fund or a UIT Fund, to effect a Fund Merger, (B) in the case of a Japan Fund, to effect a Client Assignment Arrangement or (C) in the case of any such Fund that is a UIT Fund, so that, after the Closing, the Van Kampen Business may continue to provide services to such UIT Fund in accordance with such Funds Existing Advisory Contract or otherwise on terms substantially comparable (but having the same advisory and same aggregate non-advisory fees) to those of the applicable Existing Advisory Contract in effect on the date hereof. To the extent consistent with applicable Law and SEC and FINRA pronouncements, unless affirmative approval, consent or action is required under the applicable Existing Advisory Contract, such approval, consent or other action may take the form of a so-called implied or negative consent (including such consent obtained pursuant to the process described in clause (y)(2) of the second sentence of Section 7.05(d)). For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that, with respect to the Existing Advisory Contract for a UIT Fund, the consent or approval of the trustee of such Fund shall be sufficient for all purposes under this Agreement. 

  

 (d) _Non-Registered Funds and Advisory Clients_. With respect to any Fund that is not Registered as an investment fund (or the equivalent) with any Government Entity and with respect to any Advisory Client, as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement and to the extent required by applicable Law or the terms of any Existing Advisory Contract with such Fund or such Advisory Client, Seller shall (or shall cause an Affiliate to) (i) provide the Notice to such Fund or Advisory Client and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to obtain any approval, consent or other action that is required from or by such Fund (and, if applicable, its interest holders) or such Advisory Client (A) in the case of any such Client that is not a Morgan Stanley-Branded Transferred Client, so that, as applicable after the Closing, the Van Kampen Business may continue to provide services to such Fund or Advisory Client in accordance with such Funds or such Advisory Clients Existing Advisory Contract or otherwise on terms substantially comparable (but having the same advisory and same aggregate non-advisory fees) to those of the applicable Existing Advisory Contract in effect on the date hereof or (B) in the case of a Morgan Stanley-Branded Transferred 

   ##### 

  

    

Client, to effect a Client Assignment Arrangement. Buyer and Seller agree that
any consent required for any Existing Advisory Contract with a Client (other
than a Fund that is Registered as an investment fund (or the equivalent) with
a Government Entity) to continue after the Closing or to effect a Client
Assignment Arrangement shall be deemed given for all purposes under
this Agreement, (x) if written consent is required under applicable Law or
the respective Existing Advisory Contract, upon receipt of the written
consent requested in the Notice prior to the Closing Date, or (y) if consent
other than written consent is permitted under applicable Law and
the respective Existing Advisory Contract, (1) upon receipt of a written
consent requested in the Notice prior to the Closing Date or (2) if no such
written consent is received, if 45 days (such period expiring at least five
(5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date) shall have passed since the
sending of written notice (the "Negative Consent Notice") to such Client
(which Negative Consent Notice may be included in the Notice) requesting
written consent as aforesaid and informing such Client, to the extent
appropriate: (A) of the intention to complete the transactions contemplated
hereby, which will result in an assignment or a deemed assignment, as the case
may be, of such Clients Existing Advisory Contract (or other consequences
triggering a consent requirement under applicable Law in the case of such
Client); (B) of the Transferred Entities or one of their respective
Affiliates (or a Subsidiary of Buyers, as the case may be) intention to
continue to provide the advisory services pursuant to the Existing Advisory
Contract (or other applicable Client Assignment Arrangement) with such Client
after the Closing if such Client does not terminate such agreement prior to
the Closing; and (C) that the consent of such Client will be deemed to
have been granted if such Client continues to accept such advisory services
for a period of at least 45 days after the sending of the Negative Consent
Notice without termination; _provided_ that in any case under clause (x) or
(y), no consent shall be deemed to have been given for any purpose under this
Agreement if at any time prior to the Closing such Client terminates or
notifies the Van Kampen Business in writing that such Client has not
consented or is terminating its Existing Advisory Contract. 

  

 (e) In connection with the consent solicitation provided for in this Section 7.05, (i) Buyer shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all consent materials be used by Seller or its Affiliates prior to distribution and (ii) Seller shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on each Fund Merger Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Seller and its Affiliates shall promptly upon their receipt make available to Buyer copies of any and all substantive correspondence between it and Clients or representatives or counsel of such Clients relating to the consent solicitation provided for in this Section 7.05. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, with respect to any Fund for which it is contemplated under this Agreement that the Assignment Requirement is to be satisfied by a Fund Merger involving such Fund, in the event that such Funds board of trustees provides the approvals required of it to proceed with the Fund Merger but the respective Buyer Funds 

   ##### 

  

    

board of trustees fails to provide the approvals required of it to proceed
with the Fund Merger in a timely manner, then the parties agree that, with
respect to such Fund, the transactions contemplated hereby will be executed
(and the Assignment Requirement will be satisfied) without a Fund Merger by
obtaining Fund board and shareholder approval under Applicable Law as
necessary to permit such Funds Existing Advisory Contract to be replaced
with a New Advisory Contract with a Subsidiary of Buyer (provided that in the
case of a Morgan Stanley-Branded Transferred Client such New Advisory
Contract shall provide for a Subsidiary of Seller to be named as primary
investment adviser and a Subsidiary of Buyer to be named as sub-adviser). 

  

 Section 7.06 _. Section _ _15(f)_ _._ (a) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are intended to qualify for the treatment described in Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act. In this regard, Buyer shall, and from and after the Closing Date shall, to the extent within its control, cause the Van Kampen Business to comply with the conditions of Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act in respect of each 40 Act Fund, including (i) by ensuring that for a period of three years after the Closing Date, at least 75% of the board of trustees or board of directors (if any), as the case may be, of such 40 Act Fund or any successor thereto (including by reorganization or otherwise) are not "interested persons" (as that term is defined under applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act and interpreted by the SEC) of (A) any investment adviser of such 40 Act Fund after the Closing or (B) the investment adviser of such 40 Act Fund prior to the Closing; and (ii) by not imposing or seeking to impose for a period of two years after the Closing Date, any "unfair burden" (as that term is defined in Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act and interpreted by the SEC) on such 40 Act Fund. 

  

 (b) In complying with Section 7.06(a)(i), Buyer shall, and from and after the Closing Date shall, to the extent within its control, cause the Van Kampen Business to (i) cause any employee, officer, director or agent of Buyer, any Subsidiary of Buyer or any of their respective "affiliated persons" (as that term is defined under applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act and interpreted by the SEC) who shall be a trustee or director of any 40 Act Fund or any successor thereto (including by reorganization or otherwise) to resign when required to maintain the percentage referred to in Section 7.06(a)(i) and (ii) ensure that vacancies on the board of trustees or board of directors, as the case may be, of any such 40 Act Fund or any successor thereto (including by reorganization or otherwise) will be filled by a Person who is not an "interested person" (as that term is defined under applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act and interpreted by the SEC) of such an investment adviser referred to in Section 7.06(a)(i)(A) or (B), who has been selected and proposed for election by a majority of the trustees or directors who are not such interested persons, and who has been elected by shareholders in accordance with Section 16(b) of the Investment Company Act.

 (c) For a period of three years after the Closing Date, Buyer shall not engage, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its Affiliates not to engage, in any transaction that would constitute an "assignment" (as that term is defined under applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act and interpreted by the SEC) to a third party of any Investment Advisory Arrangement between Buyer or any of its Affiliates and any 40 Act Fund, without first obtaining from the counterparty to such transaction a covenant in all material respects comparable to that contained in this Section 7.06. 

  

 (d) None of Buyer or any of its affiliated persons (as that term is defined under applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act and interpreted by the SEC) has, and Buyer shall ensure that no such persons have, any express or implied understanding or arrangement which would reasonably be expected to impose an "unfair burden" (as that term is defined in Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act and interpreted by the SEC) on any 40 Act Fund as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby or which would in any way violate, or otherwise make unavailable to Seller, Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act. 

  

 Section 7.07 _. Certain Post-Closing Filings._ Following the Closing Date, Buyer agrees to cause each Transferred Entity registered with the SEC as an investment adviser promptly to amend its Form ADV and promptly to file such amendment with the SEC and any applicable state authorities, for the purpose of disclosing information about the change in control of such Transferred Entity, and to cause any Transferred Entity that is an investment adviser or commodity trading adviser to make such similar appropriate updates to their respective registration statements or other filings with a Government Entity as may be required by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 (b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, transfer the Van Kampen Seed Capital then owned by Seller or one of its Subsidiaries (except such Van Kampen Seed Capital as is held by the Transferred Entities) to Buyer, and Buyer shall receive the Van Kampen Seed Capital from Seller or such Subsidiaries, free and clear of any Encumbrances, for no additional consideration. 

  

 (c) Seller shall be entitled to withdraw, or otherwise cause to be redeemed, (i) all amounts invested in any Fund or Client account (other than the Van Kampen Seeded Funds) on or before the Closing Date and (ii) all Van Kampen Seed Capital from all Van Kampen Seeded Funds on the Closing Date in excess of the amounts required to be held in each such Van Kampen Seeded Funds and transferred to Buyer pursuant to this Section 7.09.

 (b) any notice or other communication from any Government Entity received by such party in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

  

 (c) any Legal Proceedings commenced relating to such party or its Affiliates that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section 3.08 or Section 4.19 as applicable; 

  

 (d) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement at any time during the term hereof that could reasonably be expected to cause the conditions set forth in Section 10.02(b) or Section 10.03(b) not to be satisfied or that is otherwise material to Buyer or the Van Kampen Business, as the case may be; and 

  

 (e) any failure of that party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; 

 

 _provided_ that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.10
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the
party receiving such notice. 

   

 Section 7.11 _. Alternative Transaction Structure._ The parties hereto agree that if Seller delivers written notice of an election to invoke this Section 7.11 

   ##### 

  

    

either (i) within 90 days after the signing of this Agreement or (ii) at any
time prior to Closing if the condition set forth in either Section 10.02(d)
or Section 10.03(e) cannot be satisfied (in either case, an "Alternative
Transaction Structure Election"), the acquisition of the Transferred Entities
by Buyer from Seller shall not occur by way of the Merger, but rather
shall occur through the purchase by Buyer and sale by Seller of the Van
Kampen Parent common stock for the same consideration that would otherwise
have constituted the Merger Consideration (the "Alternative Transaction
Structure"). In the event of an Alternative Transaction Structure Election by
Seller, the parties agree to enter into an amendment to this Agreement to
implement such Alternative Transaction Structure; _provided_ that such
amendment shall not otherwise alter or affect the rights and obligations of
the parties hereto. For avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that (i) the purchase and sale of the Van Kampen Parent common
stock pursuant to the Alternative Transaction Structure is intended to
constitute a taxable sale of such stock by Seller for U.S. federal income tax
purposes and (ii) no election under Section 338 of the Code (including
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code) shall be made with respect to such sale.

Seller shall retain or assume all obligations and liabilities for the provision of notice or payment in lieu of notice or any applicable penalties with respect to the Van Kampen Business Employees under such worker notification laws arising as a result of actions taken by Seller or its Affiliates on or prior to the Closing Date. Seller (or its applicable Affiliate) shall promptly provide Buyer with such information as is reasonably requested by Buyer in order to determine whether any actions taken by Seller or its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date will, if aggregated with actions that may be taken by Buyer or its Affiliates after the Closing Date, require the provision of notice or payment in lieu of notice to the Transferred Employees. 

  

 Section 7.13 _. Confidentiality._ (a) Prior to the Closing Date and after any termination of this Agreement, (i) Buyer and its Affiliates will hold in confidence, pursuant and subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, all documents and information concerning the Van Kampen Business (including documents and information relating to clients, prospective clients, distributors and strategic business partners) furnished to, or prepared by, Buyer, its Affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and agents and other representatives in connection with the transactions

 (b) From and after the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their officers, directors, employees, consultants, agents and advisors to keep confidential, and not use for its benefit (other than as may be necessary to enforce its rights hereunder, and, in the case of clause (ii) only, as used in the businesses of Seller and its Affiliates, other than the Van Kampen Business) or for the benefit of any other Person, any and all non-public information (including information obtained pursuant to Section 6.02) (i) relating to Buyer and its Affiliates that becomes known to Seller or its Affiliates or its or their officers, directors, employees, consultants, agents or advisors in connection with or as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements or (ii) relating to the Van Kampen Business, including its business and financial condition, that is not generally known or made available to the general public. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the party that receives such confidential information described under Section 7.13(b) (including information obtained pursuant to Section 6.02) or Section 6.04 (such party the "Receiving Party") from the disclosing party (the "Disclosing Party") is requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any such information, (i) the Receiving Party will provide the Disclosing Party with prompt notice of such request so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of Section 7.13(b) or Section 6.04, as applicable, and, if such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or the Disclosing Party waives compliance with the terms of Section 7.13(b) or Section 6.04, as applicable, the Receiving Party may furnish without violation of Section 7.13(b) or Section 6.04, as applicable, that portion (and only that portion) of such non-public information that the Receiving Party, in the opinion of the Receiving Partys counsel, is legally compelled to disclose; _provided_ that the Receiving Party exercises its reasonable best efforts, at the request and expense of the Disclosing Party, to obtain an order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the disclosed information. Non-public information for purposes of Section 7.13(b) and Section 6.04 shall not include information which (i) becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the Receiving Party in breach thereof, (ii) becomes available to the Receiving Party after the Closing Date on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the 

   ##### 

  

    

Disclosing Party or its Affiliates, provided that such source is not known by
the Receiving Party to be bound by any obligation of confidentiality to a
Disclosing Party, its Affiliates or any other Person or (iii) is
independently developed by the Receiving Party or others on its
behalf without reference to or reliance upon any non-public information of
the Disclosing Party. 

  

 Section 7.14 _. Conversion._ The parties will cooperate in respect of the actions contemplated by Exhibit K (the "Conversion Plan") as promptly as practicable. The Parties acknowledge that certain aspects of the integration plan for the integration of the Van Kampen Business into Buyers business as of and after Closing are still being developed (including, human resources, compliance (e.g., regulatory filings, board reporting, compliance monitoring and temporary advisory agreements), finance and accounting and the Japan business), and Seller agrees to cooperate in good faith to assist Buyer in further developing its integration plan and thereby by mutual agreement amending the Conversion Plan in respect thereof. To the extent any matters contemplated in the preceding sentence may be requested by Buyer after the date hereof to constitute Services (as defined in the Transition Services Agreement) (for avoidance of doubt, which shall not include IT, legal and compliance (other than in respect of compliance and legal services to support services to be provided under any Temporary Investment Services Agreement (whether or not pursuant to Rule 15a-4 under the Investment Company Act)), operations, portfolio management, or trading), then such matters shall be mutually agreed upon within 30 days of execution of this Agreement, it being understood that Seller and its Affiliates are under no obligation to provide such Services unless so agreed upon but Seller and its Affiliates will cooperate with Buyer in good faith to determine if such Services can be performed.

 (i) [Reserved] 

   

 (ii) neither party hereto nor its respective Affiliates shall enter into any settlement or consent with respect to a regulatory enforcement matter that would be reasonably likely to cause the other party hereto or any of its Affiliates to suffer regulatory disqualification, suspension of registration or other materially adverse regulatory consequences; and 

   

 (iii) neither party hereto nor its respective Affiliates shall enter into any contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding (i) that limits or otherwise restricts (or purports to limit or restrict) in any material

or competing in any material line of business in any location or with any
Person or (ii) that includes any material exclusive dealing arrangement or
any other material arrangement that grants any material right of first
refusal or material right of first offer or similar material right or that

party hereto or its Affiliates to own, operate, sell, transfer, pledge
or otherwise dispose of any material assets or business. 

  

 (b) From and after the Closing, if Buyer undertakes any action or transaction, including any repurchase of Buyer Stock, at Sellers request, Buyer shall swap (x) a number of shares of Buyer Stock owned by Seller and its Affiliates for (y) a number of shares of Equivalent Buyer Preferred Stock that is convertible into a like number of swapped shares of Buyer Stock, to the minimum extent necessary to reduce Sellers beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d of the Exchange Act) of Buyer Stock such that it does not exceed the Common Stock Cap. 

  

 (c) From and after the Closing until such time as the Distribution Agreement is terminated pursuant to its terms, (i) neither Seller nor its Affiliates shall undertake any action or transaction that would cause Sellers beneficial ownership in Buyer (as determined by Seller based on its reporting and compliance policies and procedures in respect thereof and discussed with Buyer and assuming that beneficial ownership does not distinguish between voting and non-voting stock) to exceed 9.9% in vote or value (the "Sellers Ownership Limit") and (ii) prior to Buyer undertaking any action or transaction, including any repurchase of Buyer Stock, that would be reasonably likely to cause the Sellers Ownership Limit to be exceeded, (x) Buyer shall provide prior written notice to Seller and (y) promptly following receipt of any such notice, Seller shall sell to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase, at a price per share equal to the then current market price, the minimum number of shares of Buyer Stock necessary to reduce Sellers and its Affiliates collective equity ownership, directly or indirectly, in Buyer to not exceed Sellerss Ownership Limit after giving effect to such Buyer proposed action or transaction. For purposes of the foregoing "vote" shall mean the power under the equity to vote in the election of directors of Buyer (whether or not that power is retained by the equity holder, transferred to another party or surrendered) and "value" shall mean the pro rata fair market value of the equity. 

  

 (d) Subject to the restrictions of Section 6.01, from the date hereof until the Closing, Buyer shall not undertake any action or transaction, including any repurchase of Buyer Stock, that would be reasonably likely to cause the Sellers Ownership Limit to be exceeded as of Closing unless (i) Buyer provides prior written notice to Seller of any such action or transaction and (ii) to the extent such action or transaction would cause Sellers Ownership Limit to be exceeded as of Closing, (A) the Aggregate Equity Consideration shall be reduced by the minimum number of shares of Buyer Stock necessary such that Sellers

Ownership Limit will not be exceeded as of Closing and (B) the Aggregate Cash
Consideration shall be increased by an amount equal to the number of shares
determined pursuant to the preceding clause (A) _multiplied by_ the Buyer
Signing Price.

As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof (and in any event no later than 90 days prior to the Closing Date), Seller shall grant Buyer access, at reasonable hours, on reasonable notice and in a manner designed to minimize disruption, to the Dedicated Location to permit Buyer to accomplish the infrastructure and IT build described therein. Buyer shall be responsible for implementing, and shall pay all out-of-pocket costs and expenses for, such infrastructure and IT build. Buyer shall, at its sole cost, restore the Dedicated Location to its condition existing before the work done as contemplated in the prior sentence, as soon as reasonably practicable after the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the termination of such services at the Dedicated Location.

If, in lieu of receiving any such refund, Seller or any Affiliate of Seller elects to reduce a Tax liability with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or increase a Tax asset that can be carried forward to a Post-Closing Tax Period of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller, Seller shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to Buyer the amount of such refund as would otherwise have been obtained in the absence of such election. 

  

 Section 8.03 _. Buyer Tax Covenants._ (a) Buyer covenants that it will not cause or permit the Transferred Entities, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate of Buyer to take any action on the Closing Date other than in the ordinary course of business, including but not limited to the distribution of any dividend or the effectuation of any redemption that could give rise to any Tax liability or reduce any Tax asset of the Seller Group or give rise to any loss of the Seller or the Seller Group under this Agreement. 

  

 (b) Buyer shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to Seller all refunds of Taxes and interest thereon received by Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or the Transferred Entities attributable to Taxes paid by Seller or the Transferred Entities (or any predecessor or Affiliate of Seller) with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

   ##### 

  

    

Tax asset that can be carried forward to a Post-Closing Tax Period, Buyer
shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to Seller the amount of such refund as
would otherwise have been obtained in the absence of such election. 

  

 (c) If Seller owns at least 10% of the voting stock of Buyer during any taxable year, Buyer shall provide Seller such information as Seller may reasonably request to allow Seller to determine its eligibility for, and compute the amount of, any "deemed-paid" credit to which it may be entitled under Section 902 of the Code with respect to any distribution made by Buyer during such taxable year.

Seller shall be obligated to reimburse 50% of all out-of-pocket third party expenses incurred by Buyer in providing such information, provided that Buyer shall not be obligated to, and shall not, incur any such costs unless previously requested or approved by Seller. 

  

 (e) Until such time as Sellers filings under Section 13 of the Exchange Act show that it has ceased to own 10% or more of Iridiums outstanding common stock, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller in writing if Buyer becomes aware of any information that could reasonably lead to the conclusion that Buyer is or will become a "controlled foreign corporation" under Section 957 of the Code. 

  

 (f) Buyer agrees not to take any action between the date of this Agreement and Closing that would reasonably be expected to result in Buyer failing to satisfy the "active trade or business test" with respect to the acquisition of Van Kampen set forth in Treas. Reg. Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(1)(iv). This Section 8.03(f) shall not be applicable if Seller has made an Alternative Transaction Structure Election pursuant to Section 7.11. 

  

 (g) Buyer acknowledges that Seller will enter into a "gain recognition agreement" under Treas. Reg. Section 1.367(a)-8 (a "GRA") with respect to the Merger. Buyer (i) shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, take any actions that would result in the recognition of gain by Seller under the GRA without the prior written consent of Seller, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall be permitted to undertake the transactions contemplated by Exhibit L, and _provided further_ , that this clause (i) shall cease to apply upon the earlier of the end of the Sellers fifth full taxable year following close of the taxable year in which the Closing occurs and such

comply with its reporting obligations in respect of such GRA under Treas.
Reg. Section 1.367(a)-8, and (y) to prepare, on behalf of Van Kampen, the
statement required under Treas. Reg. Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(6), _provided_ ,
that this clause (ii) shall cease to apply upon the earlier of the filing by
Seller of its federal income tax return for the fifth full taxable year

filing by Seller of its federal income tax return for the first taxable year
in which Seller no longer owns any of the Aggregate Equity Consideration.

Alternative Transaction Structure Election pursuant to Section 7.11.

Upon payment of any such Apportioned Obligation, the paying party shall present a statement to the non-paying party setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which the paying party is entitled under this Section 8.05, together with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the amount to be reimbursed. The non-paying party shall make such reimbursement promptly but in no event later than 10 Business Days after the presentation of such statement. Any payment not made within such time shall bear interest at the rate set forth in Section 1.01(a) for each day until paid, retroactive from the date of the presentation of such statement.

 (b) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and shall timely file or cause to be timely filed, all other Tax Returns with respect to the Transferred Entities, and, subject to Section 8.09, shall pay all Taxes shown as due thereon; _provided_ that as to any Tax Return for which Seller may be liable to indemnify Buyer under Section 8.09, (i) such Tax Return shall be prepared in accordance with the past practice of the Transferred Entities unless otherwise required by Law, (ii) Buyer shall deliver any such Tax Return to Seller at least 60 days before it is due, including extensions, (iii) Seller shall have the right to examine and comment on any such Tax Return prior to the filing thereof, and such Tax Return shall not be filed without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (iv) Seller shall either provide such written consent or deliver a notice of objection no later than 50 days before the Tax Return is due.

In addition to the foregoing, after the delivery by Buyer to Seller of any such Tax Return, Buyer and Seller shall work in good faith to agree on a schedule (each such schedule, a "Section 8.06(b) Schedule") of the positions either (i) which Buyer, acting in good faith, would have taken on such Tax Return but for its obligation to prepare such Tax Return in accordance with the past practices of the Transferred Entities or (ii) taken by Buyer on such Tax Return that Seller believes are not consistent with the past practices of the Transferred Entities and are not required by Law or (each such position in clauses (i) and (ii) a "Buyer Proposed Straddle Period Position"), and the corresponding position that is consistent with the past practices of the Transferred Entities and permitted by Law (each such position, a "Corresponding Seller Straddle Period Position").

The costs, fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller. 

  

 (c) Buyer and Seller agree that, to the extent permitted by law and except as they may otherwise agree in writing, the Transferred Entities will treat the Closing Date as the end of the applicable Tax Period for purposes of filing any Tax Return. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) Buyer shall not amend any Tax Return of a Transferred Entity relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period without the consent of Seller.

Buyer and Seller agree to retain or cause to be retained all books and records pertinent to the Transferred Entities and the Purchased Assets until the applicable period for assessment under applicable Law (giving effect to any and all extensions or waivers) has expired, and to abide by or cause the abidance with all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority.

 (c) Each of Buyer and the Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the opinions referred to in Section 10.02(d) and 10.03(e). 

  

 (d) This Section 8.08 shall not be applicable if Seller has made an Alternative Transaction Structure Election pursuant to Section 7.11. 

  

 Section 8.09 _.

Reg. Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of applicable Law) or as a transferee or successor, (iii) Tax or Damages incurred or suffered by Buyer or any of its 

   ##### 

  

    

Affiliates (including, effective upon the Closing, a Transferred Entity),
arising out of a breach of any covenant or agreement of Seller or its
Affiliates contained in this Article 8, (iv) Taxes arising out of or relating
to the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities for or applicable to any Pre-
Closing Period, (v) Tax of Buyer or any Affiliate thereof (including, after
the Closing, any Transferred Entity) arising out of or resulting from the
receipt by Buyer of any reimbursement, payment or contribution (or deemed
contribution) from Seller pursuant to Sections 9.05, 9.06 or 9.07, (vi)
penalties, interest or additions to Tax (but not the underlying Taxes) of
the Transferred Entities attributable to the post-Closing portion of any
Straddle Period incurred as a result of the inclusion of a Corresponding
Seller Straddle Period Position shown on any Section 8.06(b) Schedule in any
Tax Return of a Transferred Entity for a Straddle Period, and
(vii) liabilities, costs, expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable
expenses of investigation and attorneys fees and expenses), arising out of
or incident to the imposition, assessment or assertion of any such Tax,
including those incurred in the contest in good faith in
appropriate proceedings relating to the imposition, assessment or assertion
of any such Tax, in each case incurred or suffered by Buyer, any of its
Affiliates or, effective upon the Closing, the Transferred Entities (the sum
of (i) through (v) being referred to as a "Loss"); _provided_ , _however_
, that Seller shall have no liability for the payment of any Loss
attributable to or resulting from any action described in Section 8.03(a) or
Section 8.08(b) hereof and _provided_ , _further_ , that Seller shall have no
obligation to make any payment pursuant to this Section 8.09 if at the
time the Loss is incurred or suffered by any Transferred Entity, as the case
may be, Buyer no longer owns such Transferred Entity. 

  

 (b) For purposes of this Section 8.09, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Tax period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the portion of such Tax related to the portion of such Tax period ending on and including the Closing Date shall (x) in the case of any Taxes other than gross receipts, sales or use Taxes and Taxes based upon or related to income, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Tax period and (y) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income and any gross receipts, sales or use Tax, be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on and included the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the allocation set forth in the foregoing clause (y) shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice of the Transferred Entities. 

  

 (c) If Sellers indemnification obligation under this Section 8.09 arises in respect of an adjustment which makes allowable to Buyer, any of its Affiliates or, effective upon the Closing, a Transferred Entity any deduction, amortization, exclusion from income or other allowance (a "Tax Benefit") which would not, but for such adjustment, be allowable, then Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the Tax Benefit if, as and when such Tax Benefit is actually realized in 

   ##### 

  

    

cash or a reduction in Taxes otherwise due. For purposes of this Section
8.09(c), the second through eighth sentences of Section 9.07(b) shall apply
_mutatis mutandis_. 

  

 (d) Any payment by Seller pursuant to this Section 8.09 shall be made in immediately available funds at least two Business Days before the date payment of the Taxes to which such payment relates is due, or, if no Tax is payable, not later than 10 days after receipt by Seller of written notice from Buyer stating that any Loss has been paid by Buyer, any of its Affiliates or, effective upon the Closing, a Transferred Entity and the amount thereof and of the indemnity payment requested. 

  

 (e) If any claim or demand for Taxes in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Section 8.09 is asserted in writing against Buyer, any of its Affiliates or, effective upon the Closing, a Transferred Entity, Buyer shall notify Seller of such claim or demand within 10 days of receipt thereof, or such earlier time that would allow Seller to timely respond to such claim or demand, and shall give Seller such information with respect thereto as Seller may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to give such prompt notice shall not relieve Seller of any of its obligations under this Section 8.09, except to the extent that Seller is actually prejudiced thereby. Seller may discharge, at any time, its indemnification obligation under this Section 8.09 by paying to Buyer the amount payable pursuant to this Section 8.09, calculated on the date of such payment. Seller may, at its own expense, participate in and, upon notice to Buyer, assume the defense of any such claim, suit, action, litigation or proceeding (including any Tax audit). If Seller assumes such defense, Seller shall have the sole discretion as to the conduct of such defense and Buyer shall have the right (but not the duty) to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by Seller. Whether or not Seller chooses to defend or prosecute any claim, all of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.09, Buyer agrees that Seller is to have no liability for any Tax resulting from any action referred to in Section 8.03(a) of Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer, or, after the Closing, any Transferred Entity, and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates against (i) any such Tax (together with any interest, penalty, addition to Tax or additional amount), (ii) any Tax or Damages incurred or suffered by Seller or any of its Affiliates, arising out of a breach of any other covenant or agreement of Buyer or its Affiliates contained in this Article 8, (iii) any Tax imposed on any Transferred Entity that is not subject to Sellers indemnification obligation under this Section 8.09 and (iv) any liabilities, costs, expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable expenses of investigation and attorneys fees and expenses), losses, damages, assessments, settlements or judgments arising out of or incident to the imposition, assessment or assertion of any Tax described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above. For purposes of this Section 8.09(f), Sections 8.09(b), (d) and (e) shall apply _mutatis mutandis_.

 Section 8.10 _. Coordination and Survival._ Claims for indemnification with respect to Taxes (other than in respect of any claim for misrepresentation or breach of warranty made by Seller under Section 3.13(e) or Section 3.22(k), which shall be governed exclusively by Article 11) shall be governed by this Article 8 and not Article 11\. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the covenants and agreements contained in this Article 8 and the representation contained in Section 3.13(e) shall survive for ninety (90) days following the full period of all statutes of limitations (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof). 

  

ARTICLE 9 
 Employee Matters and Benefits 

   

 Section 9.01 _. Van Kampen Business Employees._  

  

 (a) _List of Van Kampen Business Employees; Categories of Van Kampen Business Employees_. Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that the list of Van Kampen Business Employees set forth on Section 9.01(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule is comprised of both (i) Van Kampen Business Employees employed by the Transferred Entities (the "Transferred Entity Employees") and (ii) Van Kampen Business Employees not employed by the Transferred Entities who otherwise primarily provide services to the Van Kampen Business (the "Other Included Employees"). Prior to the Closing Date, Seller or its appropriate Affiliate shall transfer the employment of any employee of the Transferred Entities who is not a Van Kampen Business Employee or who is a Leave Recipient to one of its Affiliates other than a Transferred Entity. Buyer shall, upon written notice to Seller, have the unilateral right prior to November 30, 2009, in its sole discretion, except as would be unlawful, to remove any of the Transferred Entity Employees and Other Included Employees that the parties shall have designated as of the date hereof with an asterisk (*) on Section 9.01(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (such employees, the "Potential Van Kampen Business Employees") from the list of Van Kampen Business Employees set forth on Section 9.01(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and, upon Buyers exercise of such right, Seller or its appropriate Affiliate shall, with respect to any Potential Van Kampen Business Employee who is so removed (any such Potential Van Kampen Business Employee, a "Removed Van Kampen Business Employee"), if such Removed Van Kampen Business Employee is employed by a Transferred Entity, transfer the employment of such Removed Van Kampen Business Employee to one of its Affiliates other than a Transferred Entity. For the avoidance of doubt, any Removed Van Kampen Business Employees shall not be treated as Transferred Employees for purposes of this Agreement. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall update Section 9.01(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule to (i) denote which Van Kampen Business Employees are Transferred Entity Employees, which are Other Included Employees and which are Leave Recipients (taking into account the pre-Closing transfers required by the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.01(a)), (ii) delete any such employee who 

   ##### 

  

    

should no longer be a Van Kampen Business Employee because (w) his or her
employment has been or will be prior to the Closing Date terminated (if
applicable, to the extent permitted by Section 5.01(b)(iv)(E)), (x) he or she
has been or will be prior to the Closing Date reassigned (if applicable, to
the extent permitted by Section 5.01(b)(iv)(E)) and, as a result of
such reassignment, he or she is no longer a Transferred Entity Employee or an
Other Included Employee, (y) he or she is a Removed Van Kampen Business
Employee or (z) Seller and Buyer mutually agree to such deletion, and (iii)
add such employees who become Transferred Entity Employees or Other Included
Employees, as the case may be, due to (x) their hire by Seller or its
Affiliates (if applicable, to the extent permitted by Section 5.01(b)(iv)(E))
or (y) the mutual agreement of Seller and Buyer. 

  

 (b) _Updating of Van Kampen Business Employee Information List_. Seller shall provide Buyer, not later than the tenth day of each month prior to the Closing Date, with an updated Van Kampen Business Employee Information List that (i) contains the information required under Section 3.14(j) with respect to each individual whose information was not previously set forth on the Van Kampen Business Employee Information List and who became a Van Kampen Business Employee during the preceding month, either due to his or her hire by Seller or its Affiliates (if applicable, to the extent permitted by Section 5.01(b)(iv)(E)) or due to the mutual agreement of Seller and Buyer and (ii) indicates each individual who was previously set forth on the Van Kampen Business Employee Information List and who is no longer a Van Kampen Business Employee because, during the preceding month, (w) his or her employment was terminated (if applicable, to the extent permitted by Section 5.01(b)(iv)(E)), (x) he or she was reassigned (if applicable, to the extent permitted by Section 5.01(b)(iv)(E)) and, as a result of such reassignment, he or she is no longer a Transferred Entity Employee or an Other Included Employee, (y) he or she is a Removed Van Kampen Business Employee or (z) Seller and Buyer mutually agree that such individual should no longer be set forth on the Van Kampen Business Employee Information List. 

  

 (c) _Continued Employment; Offers of Employment._ Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, (i) continue to, as of the Closing Date, employ each of the Transferred Entity Employees who are employed immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) prior to the Closing Date (subject to Section 9.01(d) with respect to Leave Recipients) make a written offer, or cause one of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) to make a written offer, of employment, commencing as of the Closing Date, to each Other Included Employee. Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in good faith to assist Buyer in its efforts to secure reasonably satisfactory employment arrangements with the Van Kampen Business Employees; _provided_ that such arrangements are consistent with the provisions of this Article 9, including Appendix A to this Agreement with respect to Foreign Employees who primarily work or reside in the United Kingdom and Appendix B to this Agreement with respect to Foreign Employees who primarily work or reside in Japan, and in accordance with applicable Law. Each Van Kampen Business Employee whose employment continues automatically by operation of 

   ##### 

  

    

Law, and each Other Included Employee who accepts Buyers offer of employment
and who continues or commences, as applicable, active employment with Buyer
or one of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, a Transferred Entity)
as of his or her Transfer Date (as defined below), shall be referred to as a
"Transferred Employee." 

  

 (d) _Special Provisions for Leave Recipients._ Buyer also shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, make a written offer of employment to each Van Kampen Business Employee who is not actively employed immediately prior to the Closing Date and who has a right of reinstatement (collectively, "Leave Recipients") on return from any approved leave or absence to the extent (i) Seller or its Affiliates would have been required to reinstate such Leave Recipient pursuant to applicable Law or any applicable Seller policy (pursuant to the terms of such policy as in effect as of the date hereof) and (ii) such Leave Recipient returns to active employment within the 180-day period following the Closing Date or any such longer period required pursuant to applicable Law. A list of Leave Recipients as of not later than five Business Days prior to the date hereof has been provided to Buyer. Such list shall be updated by Seller as of the Closing Date and delivered to Buyer within five Business Days following the Closing Date. Any Leave Recipient who meets the foregoing requirements shall be treated as a Transferred Employee as of 12:01 a.m., New York City time, of the date on which he or she returns to active employment with Buyer or its Affiliates. For the avoidance of doubt, any Leave Recipient to whom Buyer is not required to offer employment pursuant to this Section 9.01(d) shall not be a Transferred Employee for purposes of this Agreement. 

  

 (e) _Transfer Dates._ The employment of Transferred Employees with Buyer or one of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities), as applicable, shall be effective as of 12:01 a.m., New York City time, on the Closing Date; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the employment of Leave Recipients will become effective as provided in Section 9.01(d) above. The date on which a Transferred Employees employment with Buyer or one of its Affiliates, as applicable, becomes effective is hereafter referred to as that Transferred Employees "Transfer Date." 

  

 (f) _Individual Contracts_. Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall assume each employment agreement, offer letter or similar individual Contract of each Transferred Employee that is set forth on Section 9.01(f) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (each, a "Transferred Employee Agreement") as of the applicable Transfer Date. For the avoidance of doubt, each such assumed Transferred Employee Agreement shall be an Assumed Benefit and Compensation Arrangement for all purposes under this Agreement including Buyers obligation to, and to cause its Affiliates to, honor such Transferred Employee Agreement in accordance with its terms pursuant to Section 9.02(j). For the avoidance of doubt, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing Date, the Transferred Entities) shall assume any Liability or obligation of Seller or any of its Affiliates under any Benefit and Compensation Arrangement that is not an 

   ##### 

  

    

Assumed Benefit and Compensation Arrangement pursuant to Buyers assumption of
the Transferred Employee Agreements. 

  

 (g) _Severance_. Seller and its Affiliates (excluding, after the Closing Date, the Transferred Entities) shall be responsible for any Liabilities related to any severance, termination, indemnity, redundancy or any other similar payment (including amounts incurred by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing Date, the Transferred Entities)) with respect to any (i) employee of Seller or its Affiliates who is not a Van Kampen Business Employee, (ii) former employee of the Van Kampen Business or (iii) Removed Van Kampen Business Employee. Except as provided in the following sentence, in no event shall Seller, Buyer or their respective Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) be obligated to pay severance to any Other Included Employee who rejects an offer of employment with Buyer or one of its Affiliate or accepts an offer of employment with Buyer or one of its Affiliates but subsequently refuses to become an employee of Buyer or any of its Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) any (A) Other Included Employee or (B) Leave Recipient who is able to return to active employment does not accept an offer of employment from Buyer or any of its Affiliates on the basis that such offer is conditioned on such employees relocating his or her principal place of employment in excess of 35 miles from its location as of immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) Seller or any of its Affiliates terminates the employment of such employee within 60 days following (A) the Closing Date, in the case of an Other Included Employee, or (B) the date on which such employee is able to return to active employment, in the case of a Leave Recipient, then Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller for any severance or similar payment or benefit that is provided to such employee in connection with such termination. 

  

 Section 9.02 _. Employee Matters._  

  

 (a) _Continuation of Compensation and Benefits_. For a period of one year following each Transferred Employees Transfer Date, Buyer shall provide to (i) such Transferred Employee a base salary or wage rate that is not less than such Transferred Employees base salary or wage rate as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) such Transferred Employee whose employment is terminated without cause by Buyer or any of its Affiliates during such year, payments and benefits in accordance with Buyers Severance Plan, Amended and Restated as of May 1, 2009 (taking into account the provisions of Section 9.02(d)), which payments and benefits shall be conditioned on such Transferred Employees execution and non-revocation of a release of claims against Buyer, Seller and their respective Affiliates, and (iii) the Transferred Employees, collectively, benefits (other than severance payments and benefits) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the benefits (other than severance payments and benefits) provided by Seller and its Affiliates to the Transferred Employees as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyers provision of benefits to the Transferred Employees that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the benefits that are made available 

   ##### 

  

    

to similarly situated employees of Buyer or its Subsidiaries (other than the
Transferred Entities) shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of
this Section 9.02(a)(iii) ( _it being understood_ that participation in such
plans may commence at different times with respect to each such plan and
whether or not such Transferred Employee elects to participate in any such
plan and that in no event shall any closed or frozen plan of Buyer or its
Subsidiaries be taken into account for purposes of determining whether Buyer
has satisfied its obligation pursuant to this Section 9.02(a)(iii)). For the
avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not apply to any incentive or
variable incentive compensation arrangements, the provision of which shall be
governed by Section 9.02(b) and Section 9.02(c). 

  

 (b) _Fiscal Year 2009 Incentive Compensation_. 

   

 (i) Prior to the Closing, Seller or one of its Affiliates shall, subject to approval by the Compensation, Management Development and Succession Committee of Sellers Board of Directors (the "Seller Compensation Committee"), grant to each Van Kampen Business Employee who was designated as a Van Kampen Business Employee not later than November 30, 2009 and who is eligible to participate in any of the 2009 fiscal year incentive and variable incentive compensation plans or arrangements maintained by Seller or any of its Affiliates (each, a "2009 Bonus Plan" and each such Van Kampen Business Employee, a "2009 Bonus Plan Participant") a cash-based long-term incentive compensation award (each, a "2009 Long-Term Incentive Award"), if such 2009 Bonus Plan Participant is eligible to receive a long-term incentive compensation award under any such 2009 Bonus Plan, and a bonus that is paid in cash pursuant to the terms of such 2009 Bonus Plan, if such 2009 Bonus Plan Participant is eligible to receive a cash bonus under any such 2009 Bonus Plan. Such 2009 Long-Term Incentive Awards shall contain the terms set forth in Section 9.02(b)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the "2009 LTI Qualifying Terms"). 

   

 (ii) The aggregate grant date value of the 2009 Long-Term Incentive Awards (such aggregate value, the "2009 LTI Value") shall be the amount determined in accordance with Section 9.02(b)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. The "2009 Deferred Compensation Amount" shall be an amount equal to (A) the 2009 LTI Value, _plus_ (B) the aggregate appreciation, if any, in the value of the 2009 Long-Term Incentive Awards from their respective dates of grant through the Transferred Employees respective Transfer Dates,  _minus_ (C) the aggregate value of the 2009 Long-Term Incentive Awards held by the 2009 Bonus Plan Participants, if any, who do not become Transferred Employees. 

   

 (iii) As soon as practicable following the Seller Compensation Committees approval of the 2009 Long-Term Incentive Awards, Seller shall provide Buyer with written notice that sets forth the terms of such 

   ##### 

  

    

awards, as so approved. If Buyer reasonably and in good faith determines that
such terms are not substantially comparable to the 2009 LTI Qualifying Terms,
then not later than ten Business Days following Sellers notice, Buyer shall
provide Seller with written notice indicating the specific reason(s) for
Buyers determination. 

   

 (iv) If Buyer does not provide Seller with written notice pursuant to Section 9.02(b)(iii), then Seller shall grant the 2009 Long-Term Incentive Awards, as approved pursuant to the first sentence of Section 9.02(b)(iii), and effective upon the Transfer Date applicable to a Transferred Employee, Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall assume such Transferred Employees 2009 Long-Term Incentive Award, which shall be subject to the same vesting and payment terms and have the same cash value (including for the avoidance of doubt any appreciation in such value from the date of grant of such award through such Transferred Employees Transfer Date) as applied to such award immediately prior to such assumption. 

   

 (v) If Buyer provides Seller with written notice pursuant to Section 9.02(b)(iii), then Seller may elect to modify the terms of the 2009 Long-Term Incentive Awards, in which case Seller shall provide Buyer with written notice that sets forth the terms of such awards, as Seller proposes to modify them. If Buyer reasonably and in good faith determines that such terms are not substantially comparable to the 2009 LTI Qualifying Terms, then not later than five Business Days following Sellers notice, Buyer shall provide Seller with written notice indicating the specific reason(s) for Buyers determination. 

   

 (vi) If Buyer does not provide Seller with written notice pursuant to Section 9.02(b)(v), then Seller shall grant the 2009 Long-Term Incentive Awards, as modified pursuant to the first sentence of Section 9.02(b)(v), and effective upon the Transfer Date applicable to a Transferred Employee, Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall assume such Transferred Employees 2009 Long-Term Incentive Award, which shall be subject to the same vesting and payment terms and have the same cash value (including for the avoidance of doubt any appreciation in such value from the date of grant of such award through such Transferred Employees Transfer Date) as applied to such award immediately prior to such assumption. 

   

 (vii) If Buyer determines reasonably and in good faith in accordance with this Section 9.02(b) that the terms of the 2009 Long-Term Incentive Awards (either as approved by the Seller Compensation Committee or as proposed to be modified by Seller following such approval) are not substantially comparable to the 2009 LTI Qualifying Terms or if Seller does not modify the terms of the 2009 Long-Term 

   ##### 

  

    

Incentive Awards after Buyer provides Seller with written notice pursuant to
Section 9.02(b)(iii), then: 

   

 (A) Buyer shall not assume the 2009 Long-Term Incentive Awards, Seller shall retain all liability in respect of such awards and such awards shall not be deemed Assumed Benefit and Compensation Arrangements for purposes of this Agreement; and 

   

 (B) effective upon the Transfer Date applicable to a Transferred Employee, Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall grant to such Transferred Employee a long-term incentive award, which shall be subject to the same vesting and payment terms and such other terms as are set forth on Section 9.02(b)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and have the same cash value (including for the avoidance of doubt any appreciation in such value from the date of grant of such Transferred Employees 2009 Long-Term Incentive Award through such Transferred Employees Transfer Date) in each case as would have applied to such 2009 Long-Term Incentive Award had Buyer or such Affiliate assumed such award pursuant to this Section 9.02(b). 

   

 (viii) Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to effectuate this Section 9.02(b) and Section 9.02(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 (c) _Fiscal Year 2010 Incentive Compensation_. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to establish fiscal year 2010 incentive and variable incentive compensation programs for the Van Kampen Business Employees who are 2009 Bonus Plan Participants (and any other Van Kampen Business Employees mutually selected by Seller and Buyer) which programs are to be generally consistent with the fiscal year 2010 incentive and variable incentive compensation programs established by Buyer in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice with respect to its and its Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred Entities) similarly situated employees. Transferred Employees who are not covered by the immediately preceding sentence shall, with respect to Buyers 2010 fiscal year, be eligible to participate in such fiscal year 2010 incentive and variable incentive compensation programs that are offered to similarly situated employees of Buyer and its Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred Entities) in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice (such programs, together with the programs established pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the "2010 Incentive Compensation Programs"). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, with respect to each Van Kampen Business Employee who as of the date hereof has a "legally binding right" (as defined for purposes of Section 409A of the Code) to compensation payable with respect to fiscal year 2010, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to ensure that the terms and conditions applicable to such compensation are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code, to the 

   ##### 

  

    

extent applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer and its Subsidiaries
shall be responsible for granting all awards under the 2010 Incentive
Compensation Programs to the Transferred Employees and, except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, paying all costs associated with such awards
granted to the Transferred Employees. 

  

 (d) _Credit for Service_. With respect to any employee benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, arrangement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any vacation program or policy) or agreement of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries in which any Transferred Employee becomes a participant, such Transferred Employee shall receive full credit for all purposes for such Transferred Employees service with Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers) to the same extent that such service was recognized as of the Closing Date under an analogous plan of Seller and its Subsidiaries in which the Transferred Employee participated; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply (i) with respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or (ii) to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. Subject to applicable Law and the provisions of this Agreement, after the Closing Date, Buyer expressly reserves the right to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan or program established or maintained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates for the benefit of Transferred Employees in accordance with the terms of such plan or program and applicable Law. 

  

 (e) _Preexisting Conditions; Coordination_. With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries in which any Transferred Employee is eligible to participate after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such Transferred Employees and provide each Transferred Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid and for amounts paid toward any out-of-pocket maximums prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any analogous plans deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan (other than a high deductible health plan with health savings accounts). 

  

 (f) _Vesting Under Seller s __401(k)_ _Plans_. Seller shall fully vest the accounts of the Transferred Employees in the 401(k) savings plans of Seller and its Affiliates (the "Seller 401(k) Plans") (or, in the case of Foreign Employees who become Transferred Employees, the accounts under a comparable Foreign Plan of Seller and its Affiliates). From and after the Closing Date, Seller will assume or retain, as the case may be, and be solely responsible for and will fully perform, pay and discharge, in accordance with their terms, all Liabilities in respect of Van Kampen Business Employees and former employees of the Transferred Entities (and claims by or relating to such Persons) under the Seller 401(k) Plans (or comparable Foreign Plan of Seller and its Affiliates). 

  

 (g) _Retiree Medical._ Seller and its Affiliates shall permit each Transferred Employee who (i) but for the termination of his or her employment 

   ##### 

  

    

with Seller and its Affiliates in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, has or would have, as of his or her Transfer
Date, satisfied the eligibility requirements for benefits under the Benefit
and Compensation Arrangements that provide for retiree medical or retiree
life insurance benefits ("Seller Retiree Welfare Benefits Arrangements")
and (ii) within the time period permitted by the Seller Retiree Welfare
Benefits Arrangements has elected to commence coverage under the Seller
Retiree Welfare Benefits Arrangements, to commence coverage under the Seller
Retiree Welfare Benefits Arrangements after his or her Transfer Date. From
and after the Closing Date, Seller and its Affiliates (excluding the
Transferred Entities) will assume or retain, as the case may be, and be
solely responsible for and will fully perform, pay and discharge, in
accordance with their terms, all Liabilities in respect of Van
Kampen Business Employees and former employees of the Transferred Entities
(and claims by or relating to such Persons) with respect to Seller Retiree
Welfare Benefits Arrangements, whether under the Benefit and Compensation

   #####

to this Agreement to the Van Kampen Business Employees (except with respect
to any Foreign Employees who primarily work or reside in the United Kingdom

 (i) _Party Eligible to Record Tax Deduction_.

For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer or an Affiliate (including, after the Closing, a Transferred Entity) will deduct for tax purposes the compensation expense with respect to each Seller Equity Award held by any such employee who was employed by any Transferred Entity at the time of grant (such Seller Equity Awards, the "Buyer Deductible Seller Equity Awards"), including all dividend equivalent amounts paid to such employee in respect of such Buyer Deductible Seller Equity Awards (such dividend equivalent amounts, the "Buyer Deductible Dividend Equivalent Amounts"), and Seller or an Affiliate (other than, after the Closing, a Transferred Entity) will deduct for tax purposes the compensation expense with respect to each Seller Equity Award held by any such employee who was employed by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than a Transferred Entity) at the time of grant,

 (ii) _Responsibility for Tax Withholding and Reporting Obligations_. 

   

 (A) _Party Responsible for Tax Withholding and Reporting Obligations_.

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained herein, Seller or an Affiliate (other than a Transferred Entity) shall take the action necessary to satisfy all withholding requirements with respect to taxes that become payable due to vesting that occurs on the Transferred Employees respective Transfer Dates (without regard to whether such vesting results in the inclusion of an amount in gross income), which shall include for employees subject to taxation in the U.S. the withholding required under Sections 3121(v) and 3306(r) of the Code, and any such withheld amounts shall be reported by Seller. 

   

 (B) _Cash Transfer from Seller to Buyer for Net Share Settlement_. With respect to each Buyer Deductible Seller Equity Award held by a Van Kampen Business Employee or a former employee of the Van Kampen Business, in each case who was employed by any Transferred Entity at the time of grant, in the event that, at or prior to the time of the exercise, conversion or other settlement of such award, such employee elects net share settlement to satisfy tax withholding, Seller and Buyer agree that Seller shall transfer to Buyer (i) cash, as soon as practicable following such exercise, conversion or other settlement but in no event later than the next applicable regular or special payroll date, in an amount equal to the value of any such shares withheld from

amount of time to fulfill any reporting obligations) any information
regarding such exercise, conversion or other settlement that Buyer is
obligated to report to the IRS in connection therewith. 

   

 (C) _Gross Share Settlement_. If a Van Kampen Business Employee or former employee of the Van Kampen Business, in each case who was employed by any Transferred Entity at the time of grant of a Buyer Deductible Seller Equity Award has not elected net share settlement to satisfy tax withholding as set forth in (B) above (or otherwise incurs a tax liability, such as FICA taxation, imposed upon vesting of a Seller Equity Award that is deferred compensation without regard to whether such vesting results in the inclusion of an amount in gross income), Seller will (i) collect such withholding amount from such employee in a manner approved by Seller and will remit cash, as soon as practicable following exercise, conversion or other settlement of such award but in no event later than the next applicable regular or special payroll date, to Buyer in the amount of any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with such exercise, conversion or other settlement (which amount shall in no event be less than the statutorily required amounts) and (ii) deliver to Buyer on a timely basis ( _i.e.,_ giving Buyer a reasonable amount of time to fulfill any reporting obligations) any information regarding such event that Buyer is obligated to report to the IRS in connection therewith. 

   

 (iii) _Dividend Equivalent Payments_.

 (b) _Allocation of Liabilities_. Seller shall retain liabilities that relate to awards or account balances of deferred cash compensation outstanding under Benefit and Compensation Arrangements immediately prior to the Closing and held by Van Kampen Business Employees and former employees of the Van Kampen Business (such awards and account balances, collectively, the "Cash Deferred Compensation Awards"). 

  

 (c) _Party Eligible to Record Tax Deduction_. With respect to each Cash Deferred Compensation Award, the party that will record the tax deduction with respect to such award will be the employer entity at the time of grant.

Buyer shall be responsible for all tax withholding and reporting obligations that arise in connection with any payments under any Buyer Deductible Cash Deferred Compensation Award. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained herein, Seller or an Affiliate (other than a Transferred Entity) shall take the action necessary to satisfy all withholding requirements with respect to taxes that become payable due to vesting that occurs on the Transferred Employees respective Transfer Dates (without regard to whether such vesting results in the inclusion of an amount in gross income), which shall include for employees subject to taxation in the U.S. the withholding required under Sections 3121(v) and 3306(r) of the Code, and any such withheld amounts shall be reported by Seller.

 (a) _Provision of Withholding and Reporting Information and Information Necessary to Satisfy Accounting Obligations_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Buyers performance of its withholding and reporting obligations under Sections 9.05 and 9.06 shall be subject to Sellers timely and accurate provision of the information necessary for Buyer to satisfy such obligations, including information to satisfy all reporting obligations with respect to compensation that is considered a "deferred compensation arrangement" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Without limiting the foregoing sentence, in the case of Buyers withholding obligations, Seller shall provide Buyer, in advance to the extent possible and in any event no later than the date on which an amount in respect of a Buyer Deductible Seller Equity Award, Buyer Deductible Dividend Equivalent Amount or Buyer Deductible Cash Deferred Compensation Award first becomes includible in the gross income of an applicable employee for income tax purposes, with the following information in respect of a Buyer Deductible Seller Equity Award, Buyer Deductible Dividend Equivalent Amount or Buyer Deductible Cash Deferred Compensation Award: (i) the amount of taxable income in respect of such award exercise, settlement or payment, (ii) the cash value of any shares withheld in the case of awards for which net share settlement was elected; and (iii) the amount of any taxes previously withheld to satisfy tax withholding under Sections 3121(v) and 3306(r) of the Code or corresponding or similar provisions of state Laws.

In the case of Buyers reporting obligations, promptly after the end of the taxable period to which the reporting obligation relates (but in no event later than the date that is five Business Days prior to the reporting deadline without extension), Seller shall provide Buyer with all necessary information for Buyer or its applicable Affiliate to satisfy its reporting obligations. No later than the Closing, Seller shall provide Buyer with detailed information regarding all Buyer Deductible Seller Equity Awards, Buyer Deductible Dividend Equivalent Amounts or Buyer Deductible Cash Deferred Compensation Awards, including without limitation, payment and settlement dates and whether any such arrangement is considered a "deferred compensation arrangement" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, Buyer shall timely provide Seller and its Affiliates with all information necessary to enable Seller to determine whether any Transferred Employee has experienced a "separation from service" (as defined for purposes of Section 409A of the Code)

under any Benefit and Compensation Arrangement (other than an Assumed Benefit
and Compensation Arrangement) in which such Transferred Employee participates
after his or her Transfer Date. 

  

 (b) _Compensation Related Tax Benefit._ In the event that Buyer, any of its Affiliates or, effective upon the Closing, a Transferred Entity actually realizes any tax benefit (determined on a with and without basis), either in cash or as a reduction of Taxes otherwise due as a result of any tax deduction in respect of amounts paid pursuant to the Buyer Deductible Compensatory Arrangements, which, for avoidance of doubt, shall include the tax benefit associated with the use in any future tax year of a net operating loss carryforward, foreign tax credit carryforward or similar item that, but for the existence of such tax deduction in a prior year, would have been used in such prior year (any such tax benefit a "Compensation Related Tax Benefit"), Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to such Compensation Related Tax Benefit (based on the actual Compensation Related Tax Benefit realized in respect of the applicable Buyer Deductible Compensatory Arrangement to which the Compensation Related Tax Benefit relates), as, if, and when such Compensation Related Tax Benefit is actually realized. Within 10 days after the filing of the federal income tax return for or that includes a Transferred Entity for each taxable year ending after the Closing Date (until Buyer and Seller agree in writing that no further payments in respect of Compensation Related Tax Benefits are required to be made by Buyer), Buyer shall provide Seller with a statement setting forth Buyers computation of the Compensation Related Tax Benefit realized by Buyer in such taxable year in reasonable detail. Buyer shall promptly provide to Seller such information as Seller may reasonably request regarding such computation. Within 10 days after receiving such statement, Seller shall either (i) deliver a written notice to Buyer stating that it agrees with such computation, or (ii) deliver a written notice to Buyer stating that it objects to Sellers computation and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such objection(s). In the event that Seller delivers such written notice of objection, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in good faith to try to resolve such dispute. In the event that Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any dispute within 20 days after receipt of such notice from Seller, Buyer and Seller shall jointly cause the Accounting Referee to resolve the dispute within 20 days. The costs, fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller. Within three days after the resolution of such dispute by the parties or the Accounting Referee, or, if Seller delivers a written notice of agreement to Buyer, within three days after the receipt of such notice by Buyer, Buyer shall pay to Seller the Compensation Related Tax Benefit as so determined. Any payment not made within such time shall bear interest at the rate set forth in Section 5.08(d) for each day thereafter until paid. Buyer shall in no event be required to reimburse Seller for any tax benefit that Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing Date, the Transferred Entities) realize in respect of (i) the 2009 Long-Term Incentive Awards, (ii) any cash bonus that is awarded pursuant to the terms of a 2009 Bonus Plan that is not paid by Seller prior to the Closing Date or (iii) any awards granted under the 2010 Incentive Compensation Programs.

 (d) _Timing of Reimbursements to Buyer_. Seller shall reimburse Buyer for any applicable Buyer Paying Agent Costs promptly but in no event later than 10 days after Buyers presentation to Seller of a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the applicable Buyer Paying Agent Costs. Any payment not made within such time shall bear interest at the rate set forth in Section 5.08(d) for each day until paid, retroactive from the date of the presentation of such statement.

  

 (e) _Agreed Tax Treatment of Payments._ Buyer and Seller agree that (i) any payment made (or deemed for federal income tax purposes to have been made) by Seller to Buyer pursuant to Sections 9.05, 9.06 or 9.07(c)(i) shall be treated by both Buyer and Seller for all Tax purposes as a capital contribution by Seller to Van Kampen Parent that, for avoidance of doubt, does not constitute gross income to Buyer, Van Kampen Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, (ii) any payment made by Buyer to Seller pursuant to Section 9.07(b) shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration and (iii) any payment made by Seller to Buyer pursuant to Section 9.07(c)(ii) shall be treated as a payment for services performed by Buyer for Seller.

  

 Section 9.08 _. Additional Provisions Applicable to Seller Equity Awards and Cash Based Deferred Compensation.._

  

 (a) _Indemnity; Offset_. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller for any breach of its obligations under Sections 9.05 and 9.06, and Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer for any breach of its obligations under

under Sections 9.05 and 9.06 in respect of each Seller Equity Award and Cash
Deferred Compensation Award held by a Van Kampen Business Employee or former
employee of the Van Kampen Business, in each case who was employed by such
Transferred Entity at the time of grant of such award, and corresponding
responsibilities of Seller under such sections in respect of Buyer shall
apply in respect of such Transferred Entity. 

  

 (b) _Necessary Agreements; Establishment of Systems._ Seller and Buyer agree to, in each case, as soon as practicable after the date hereof, but in any event, prior to the Closing Date, (i) enter into any necessary agreements regarding the subject matter of Sections 9.05 and 9.06 and (ii) establish any necessary systems and frameworks, in each case, to enable them to fulfill their respective obligations hereunder, including but not limited to compliance with all applicable Laws and regulations regarding the reporting, withholding or remitting of income and social insurance taxes, the transmittal of information, processing and integration of payroll systems and reimbursement of applicable amounts, and further including but not limited to any special arrangements generally consistent with the practices set forth in this Article 9 that may be necessary or mutually desirable in connection with any employee or former employee who was employed by any Transferred Entity at the time of grant of such employees Buyer Deductible Seller Equity Awards or Buyer Deductible Cash Deferred Compensation Awards or at the time of such employees participation in the applicable Legacy Van Kampen Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan (collectively, the "Necessary Arrangements and Systems"). Seller and Buyer shall each, no later than 10 Business Days after the date hereof, designate an individual who will be primarily responsible for establishing or entering into, as the case may be, any such Necessary Arrangements and Systems, overseeing the respective partys obligations under Sections 9.05, 9.06 and 9.07 and having general supervisory authority over the respective partys service providers performing such obligations.

   ##### 

  

    

Awards held by Foreign Employees or non-U.S. employees who were employed by a
Transferred Entity as of the time of grant, but in each case only to the
extent, if any, that an entity domiciled in a non-U.S. jurisdiction is
responsible for any withholding or reporting obligations that arise in
connection with the exercise, conversion or other settlement of such awards,
taking into account the administrative practicality for Buyer; it being
understood that if Buyer does not have a business unit or entity in a
particular non-U.S. jurisdiction it will not be required to fulfill the
withholding and reporting obligations under Sections 9.05(b)(ii)(A),
9.05(b)(iii) and 9.06(d) with respect to such awards. 

  

 Section 9.09 _.

 Section 11.03 _. Third Party Claim Procedures._ (a) The party seeking indemnification under Section 11.02 (the "Indemnified Party") agrees to give prompt notice in writing to the party against whom indemnity is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of any claim or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding by any third party ("Third Party Claim") in respect of which indemnity may be sought under such Section. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such Third Party Claim and the basis for indemnification (taking into account the information then available to the Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. 

  

 (b) Except as provided below, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to control and select counsel (subject to the Indemnified Partys right to reasonably object) for such defense at its expense. 

  

 (c) If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense of any Third Party Claim, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) before entering into any settlement of such Third Party Claim, if the settlement does not release the Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Third Party Claim, the settlement is in excess of the maximum liability set forth in Section 11.02, or the settlement imposes injunctive or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose. The fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume such control, and shall be responsible for the fees and expenses of the Indemnified Partys counsel, if the Indemnifying Party shall have failed, within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of a Notice in respect of the applicable Third Party Claim, to 

   ##### 

  

    

assume the defense of such claim or to notify the Indemnified Party in writing
that it will assume the defense of such claim and (ii) the Indemnifying Party
shall be responsible for the fees and expenses of the Indemnified Partys
counsel if (A) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded
parties) include both such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and
such Indemnified Party shall have been advised in writing by counsel that
there may be one or more legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party
which are not available to, or the assertion of which would be adverse to the
interests of, the Indemnifying Party or (B) the Indemnified Party shall have
been advised in writing by counsel that the assumption of such defense by
the Indemnifying Party would be inappropriate due to an actual or potential
conflict of interest absent representation by the Indemnified Party by its
own counsel ( _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for
the fees and expenses of more than one firm of counsel for all
Indemnified Parties, other than local counsel). 

  

 (d) Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith. 

  

 Section 11.04 _. Direct Claim Procedures._ In the event an Indemnified Party has a claim for indemnity under Section 11.02 against an Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to give prompt notice in writing of such claim to the Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such claim and the basis for indemnification (taking into account the information then available to the Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. 

  

 Section 11.05 _. Calculation of Damages._ (a) The amount of any Damages payable under Section 11.02 by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of (i) any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to be responsible therefor (net of any deductible or any expenses incurred in securing such recovery), and (ii) any Tax benefit arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Damages, but shall be netted against any Damages payable under Section 11.02 by the Indemnifying Party, or repaid by the Indemnified Party, only if, as and when such Tax benefit is actually realized in cash or a reduction in Taxes otherwise due. For purposes of clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, the second through eighth sentences of Section 9.07(b) shall apply _mutatis mutandis._ If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Damages, subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the amount 

   ##### 

  

    

received by the Indemnified Party, net of any deductible or expenses incurred
by such Indemnified Party in collecting such amount. 

  

 (b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 11.02 for any (i) punitive Damages (except to the extent included in any Third Party Claim) or (ii) consequential Damages, including for lost profits, that, in the case of this clause (ii), are remote or not reasonably foreseeable (except to the extent included in any Third Party Claim). 

  

 (c) Each Indemnified Party shall use reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under insurance coverage for any Damages payable under Section 11.02, _provided_ that the expenses of such efforts shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party and such efforts will not limit the timing or amount of Damages payable under Section 11.02 during pendency of such insurance claims. 

  

 Section 11.06 _. Assignment of Claims._ If the Indemnified Party receives any payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages pursuant to Section 11.02 and the Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a part of such Damages from a third party that is not a current or former client, customer, employee, officer or director of Buyer and its Affiliates (a "Potential Contributor") based on the underlying Claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law or contract, assign such of its rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment. 

  

 Section 11.07 _. Exclusivity._ After the Closing, Section 11.02 and Section 13.12 will provide the exclusive remedy for any misrepresentation, breach of warranty, covenant or other agreement (other than those contained in Sections 2.05, 2.06, 5.08 and 8.09) or other claim arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except in the case of common law fraud relating to claims made in respect of the representations or warranties contained herein.

Effect of Termination._ If this Agreement is terminated as permitted by Section 12.01, such termination shall be without liability of either party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the other party to this Agreement; _provided_ that, if such termination shall result from the intentional (i) failure of either party to fulfill a condition to the performance of the obligations of the other party or (ii) failure to perform a covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, such party shall be fully liable for any and all Damages incurred or suffered by the other party as a result of any intentional failure or breach. The provisions of this Section 12.02 and Sections 7.13, 13.03, 13.05, 13.06, 13.07, and 13.09 and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section 12.01.
