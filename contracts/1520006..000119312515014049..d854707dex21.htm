Sheet to the Sole Shareholder, the Sole Shareholder has not delivered to

Operating Surplus or Closing Operating Deficiency, as applicable, as set forth
in or derived from such Closing Date Balance Sheet and Final Interim Statement
shall be deemed final and conclusive and shall be the " _Final Operating
Surplus_ " or " _Final Operating Deficiency_ ," respectively. If the Sole
Shareholder delivers the Objection Notice within such 30-day period,
then Parent and the Sole Shareholder shall endeavor in good faith to resolve
the objections, for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days from the date of
delivery of the Objection Notice. If at the end of the 30-day period there are
any objections that remain in dispute, then the remaining objections in
dispute shall be submitted for resolution to a "big four" accounting firm to
be selected jointly by the Sole Shareholder and Parent within the following
five (5) days or, if the Sole Shareholder and Parent are unable to mutually

relating to such objections as the Referee may request and are available to
that party or its Subsidiaries (or its independent public accountants) and
will be afforded the opportunity to present to the Referee any material
relating to the determination of the matters in dispute and to discuss such
determination with the Referee; (ii) to

 



27  the extent that a value has been assigned to any objection that remains in
dispute, the Referee shall not assign a value to such objection that is
greater than the greatest value for such objection claimed by either party or
less than the smallest value for such objection claimed by either party; (iii)
the determination by the Referee of Final Operating Surplus or Final Operating
Deficiency, as set forth in a written notice delivered to both parties by the
Referee, shall be made in accordance with this Agreement and shall be binding
and conclusive on the parties and shall constitute an arbitral award that is
final, binding and unappealable, absent fraud or manifest error, and upon
which a judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction thereof; and
(iv) the fees and expenses of the Referee shall be paid one-half by Parent and
one-half by the Sole Shareholder.

 

(c) To the extent that the Final Adjustment Amount exceeds the Initial
Adjustment Amount, such excess (the " _Final Adjustment Surplus_ ") shall be
paid in cash by the Sole Shareholder to Parent, in accordance with written
instructions from the Parent, within five (5) days of the determination of the
Final Adjustment Amount. To the extent that the Final Adjustment Amount is
less than the Initial Adjustment Amount, such deficiency (the " _Final
Adjustment Deficiency_ ") shall be paid in cash to Sole Shareholder by the
Parent within five (5) days of the determination of the Final Adjustment
Amount.

ARTICLE IV

 

CERTAIN TITLE DEFECTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS

 

4.1 _Company s Title_. For the sole purpose of determining Title Defects
pursuant to the provisions of  _Section 4.3_, the Company and the Sole
Shareholder warrant to Parent and Merger Subsidiary that, as of the Closing
and Effective Time, the Company owns or will own, directly or indirectly,
Defensible Title to the Oil and Gas Properties. The warranty stated in the
preceding sentence, together with the provisions of _Section 4.3_ , provide
Parents exclusive remedy with respect to any Title Defects or other
deficiency in title with respect to the Oil and Gas Properties.

 

4.2 _Allocated Values_. _Exhibit E_ sets forth the agreed allocation of the
Merger Consideration among the Oil and Gas Properties for purposes of the
Companys title representation in _Section 4.1_ (with respect to any of the
Leases or Wells, such value is referred to as the " _Allocated Value_ "). The
Sole Shareholder has accepted such Allocated Values solely for the purposes
of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, but makes no
representation or warranty as to the accuracy of such values.

 

4.3 _Title Defects_.

 

(a) _Title Defect Notices_.

 

(i) On or before ten (10) Business Days prior to the Target Closing Date (the
" _Pre-Closing Title Claim Date_ "), Parent shall deliver claim notices to
the Sole Shareholder meeting the requirements of this _Section 4.3(a)(i)_
(collectively, the " _Pre-Closing Title Defect Notices_ " and, individually, a
" _Pre-Closing Title Defect Notice_ "), if any, setting forth any matters
which, in Parents reasonable opinion, constitute Title Defects and which
Parent intends to assert as a Title Defect pursuant to this _Section
4.3(a)(i)_ (the " _Pre-Closing_

 



28   _Title Defects_ "). To be effective, each Pre-Closing Title Defect Notice
shall be in writing and shall include (A) a description of the alleged Title
Defect(s), (B) the Wells, Leases or Units and/or other Oil and Gas Properties
affected by the Title Defect (each a " _Title Defect Property_ "), (C) the
Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property, (D) supporting documents
reasonably necessary for the Sole Shareholder to verify the existence of the
alleged Title Defect(s), and (E) the amount by which Parent reasonably
believes the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property is reduced by the
alleged Title Defect(s);  _provided_ , that an alleged failure to comply with
subsections (A) through (E) above shall not cause any such notice to be
invalidated or any Title Defect to be waived if the Pre-Closing Title Defect
Notice is reasonably sufficient to provide notice to the Sole Shareholder of
the existence and general nature of the alleged Title Defects.

(ii) After the Pre-Closing Title Claim Date, but on or before the date that
is sixty (60) days following the Closing Date (or an earlier date, at Parents
election pursuant to the last sentence of this _Section 4.3(a)(ii)_) (the "
_Post-Closing Title Claim Date_ "), Parent shall deliver additional claim
notices to the Sole Shareholder meeting the requirements of this _Section
4.3(a)(ii)_ (collectively, the " _Post-Closing Title Defect Notices_ " and,
individually, a " _Post-Closing Title Defect Notice_ "), if any, setting forth
any matters which, in Parents reasonable opinion, constitute Title Defects
and which Parent intends to assert as a Title Defect pursuant to this
_Section 4.3(ii)_ (a " _Post-Closing Title Defect_ "). To be effective, each
Post-Closing Title Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall include (A) a
description of the alleged Title Defect(s), (B) the Title Defect Property,
(C) the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property, (D) supporting
documents reasonably necessary for the Sole Shareholder to verify the
existence of the alleged Title Defect(s), and (E) the amount by which Parent
estimates in good faith that the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property
is reduced by the alleged Title Defect(s); _provided_ , that an alleged
failure to comply with subsections (A) through (E) above shall not cause
any such notice to be invalidated or any Title Defect to be waived if the
Post-Closing Title Defect Notice is reasonably sufficient to provide notice to
the Sole Shareholder of the existence and general nature of the alleged Title
Defects. At any time following the Closing Date and prior to the Post-Closing
Title Claim Date, Parent may deliver written notice to the Sole Shareholder
that Parent will not deliver any further Post-Closing Title Defect Notices,
and the date of such notice shall be deemed the Post-Closing Title Claim Date
for purposes of this Agreement (including for purposes of determining the
Title Cure Date).

 

(iii) EXCEPT FOR THE SPECIFIED MATTERS, PARENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED
AND RELEASED, AND COVENANTS THAT IT SHALL WAIVE AND RELEASE, ANY AND ALL
TITLE DEFECTS (AND ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO THE MERGER CONSIDERATION ATTRIBUTABLE
THERETO) FOR WHICH THE SOLE SHAREHOLDER HAS NOT RECEIVED ON OR BEFORE THE
POST-CLOSING TITLE CLAIM DATE A VALID PRE-CLOSING TITLE DEFECT NOTICE OR POST-
CLOSING TITLE DEFECT NOTICE, AS APPLICABLE, THAT SATISFIES THE CONDITIONS AND
REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 4.3(a).

 



29 (b) _Right to Cure_.

 

(i) The Sole Shareholder shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
attempt, at its sole cost, to cure or remove to the reasonable satisfaction
of Parent, on or before ninety (90) days after the Post-Closing Title Claim
Date (the " _Title Cure Date_ "), any Title Defects of which it has received a
Pre-Closing Title Defect Notice or Post-Closing Title Defect Notice, as
applicable, if the Sole Shareholder provides written notice to Parent on or
before (A) the Closing Date, with respect to Pre-Closing Title Defects or (B)
the date that is ten (10) Business Days after the Post-Closing Title Claim
Date, with respect to Post-Closing Title Defects, of its intent to cure such
alleged Title Defects. The Sole Shareholders election to cure an alleged
Title Defect shall not constitute a waiver of any of the rights of
Sole Shareholder pursuant to this Article IV, including the Sole
Shareholders right to dispute the existence, nature, or value of such Title
Defect; _provided_ , that the dispute and settlement thereof pursuant to
_Section 4.3(d)_ shall not extend the period for which the Sole Shareholder
has the right to cure any Title Defects pursuant to this _Section 4.3(b)_.
With respect to Pre-Closing Title Defects which the Sole Shareholder has
elected to cure pursuant to this  _Section 4.3(b)_ and that have not been
cured by the Sole Shareholder prior to Closing to the reasonable satisfaction
of Parent, the applicable Title Defect Amounts for such Title Defect
Properties determined in accordance with  _Section 4.3(c)_ (or if there is a
dispute pursuant to _Section 4.3(d)_ with respect to the existence of the
Title Defect or the Title Defect Amount, Parents good faith determination of
the applicable Title Defect Amount) shall be deposited by Parent into the
Escrow Account at Closing as part of the Escrow Amount.

(ii) If, prior to the Title Cure Date, a Pre-Closing Title Defect related to
a Title Defect Property for which the Sole Shareholder has provided notice of
its election to cure pursuant to _Section 4.3(b)_ is waived by Parent or
otherwise cured to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent, then, on the Escrow
Release Date, the Title Defect Amount of such Title Defect Property that was
deposited by Parent into the Escrow Account at Closing pursuant to _Section
4.3(b)_ shall be released to the Sole Shareholder in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement. If, by the Title Cure Date, a Pre-Closing Title
Defect related to a Pre-Closing Title Defect Property for which the Sole
Shareholder has provided notice of its election to cure pursuant to  _Section
4.3(b)_ is not waived by Parent or otherwise cured to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent, then, subject to _Section 4.3(d)_ and any
determination of the Title Arbitrator (if applicable), the Title Defect Amount
of such Title Defect Property that was included in the Escrow Amount pursuant
to _Section 4.3(b)_ shall be included in the Post-Closing Title Adjustment
Amount.

 

(c) _Remedies for Title Defects_.

 

(i) _Closing_. In the event that any Pre-Closing Title Defect is waived by
Parent or cured to Parents reasonable satisfaction prior to Closing, there
shall be no adjustment to the Merger Consideration for such Pre-Closing Title
Defect. With respect to Pre-Closing Title Defects which the Sole Shareholder
has not elected to cure pursuant to _Section 4.3(b)_ and which Title Defect
Amounts are not subject to dispute pursuant to _Section 4.3(d)_, at Closing
there shall be a downward adjustment to the Merger Consideration by the
aggregate amount of all such Title Defect Amounts (net of the
aggregate amount of all agreed Title Benefit Amounts for Pre-Closing Title
Benefits) (such net amount, the " _Agreed Pre-Closing Title Amount_ "), but
only to the extent the Agreed Pre-Closing Title Amount plus the Agreed Pre-
Closing Environmental Amount exceeds the Aggregate Deductible (the " _Pre-
Closing Title_

 



30   _Adjustment Amount_ "), or, if the Agreed Pre-Closing Title Amount plus the
Agreed Pre-Closing Environmental Amount does not exceed the Aggregate
Deductible, there shall be no downward adjustment to the Merger Consideration
therefor and such Agreed Pre-Closing Title Amount shall be used to determine
the Post-Closing Title Adjustment Amount, if any.

 

(ii) _Post-Closing_. In the event that any Post-Closing Title Defect is waived
by Parent or cured to Parents reasonable satisfaction prior to the Title
Cure Date, there shall be no adjustment to the Merger Consideration for such
Post-Closing Title Defect. The " _Post-Closing Title Adjustment Amount_ "
shall be, subject in all respects to  _Section 4.3(c)(iii)_ below, the sum
of (1) all amounts determined pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence,
plus (2) the Agreed Pre-Closing Title Amount (but only if such amount did not
result in a downward adjustment to the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 4.3(c)(i)_ above), plus (3) the aggregate Title Defect Amounts of
all Post-Closing Title Defects which have been finally determined by the
parties pursuant to  _Section 4.3(c)(iv)_ or by the Title Arbitrator
pursuant to _Section 4.3(d)_ (net of the aggregate amount of all finally
determined Title Benefit Amounts for Post-Closing Title Benefits).

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall there
be any reductions to the Merger Consideration or other remedies provided by
the Sole Shareholder pursuant to this _Section 4.3_ for any (i) Title Defects
as to a single Lease or Well or other Oil and Gas Property for which the Title
Defect Amounts do not exceed $5,000 (the " _Title Defect Threshold_ ") or
(ii) Title Defect unless and until the aggregate of (x) the sum of all finally
determined Title Defect Amounts, excluding any Title Defects waived by Parent
in writing, less (y) the sum of all finally determined Title Benefit Amounts,
plus (z) the sum of all Remediation Amounts of all Environmental Conditions
that exceed the Individual Environmental Threshold, in the aggregate,
excluding any Environmental Conditions waived by Parent in writing, exceeds
$2,000,000 (the " _Aggregate Deductible_ "), after which point Parent shall be
entitled to adjustments to the Merger Consideration or other remedies provided
by this _Section 4.3_ only with respect to such aggregate amount in excess
of the Aggregate Deductible; _provided_ , that the Title Defect Threshold and
Aggregate Deductible shall not be taken into account in determining any
reductions to the Merger Consideration or other remedies provided by the Sole
Shareholder pursuant to this _Section 4.3_ for the matters set forth on
_Company Disclosure Schedule 4.3(c)(iii)_ (the " _Specified Matters_ ").

 

(iv) The value of each Title Defect (the " _Title Defect Amount_ ") shall be
determined in accordance with the following methodology, terms and
conditions:

(A) if Parent and the Sole Shareholder agree on the Title Defect Amount, that
amount shall be the Title Defect Amount;

(B) if the Title Defect is a Lien, encumbrance or other charge which is
undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be
the undisputed and liquidated amount of such Lien, encumbrance or other
charge;

(C) if the Title Defect reflects a discrepancy between (A) the Net Revenue
Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest stated
in _Exhibit A-1_ or _Exhibit A-2_, as applicable, to this Agreement for such
Title Defect Property, then

 



31  the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such
Title Defect Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
amount of the Net Revenue Interest decrease and the denominator of which is
the Net Revenue Interest stated in _Exhibit A-1_ or _Exhibit A-2_ to this
Agreement for such Title Defect Property; _provided, however_ , that if the
Title Defect does not affect a Title Defect Property throughout the entire
productive life of the Title Defect Property, the Title Defect Amount shall be
reduced to take into account the applicable time period only;

 

(D) if the Title Defect reflects a discrepancy between (A) the Net Acres for
any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Acres stated in _Exhibit A-1_ for
such Title Defect Property, the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of
the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the amount of the Net Acre decrease and
the denominator of which is the number of Net Acres stated in _Exhibit A-1_
to this Agreement for such Title Defect Property;

(E) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or
charge upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type
not described in clauses (ii), (iii) or (iv) above, the Title Defect Amount
shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Title
Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect Property adversely affected
by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential
economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title Defect
Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by the parties and such
other factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation;

 

(F) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect shall be determined
without duplication of any costs or losses included in another Title Defect
Amount hereunder, or for which Parent otherwise receives credit in the
calculation of Merger Consideration;

(G) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article IV, the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects other than those relating to any Lien upon any given Property shall
not exceed the Allocated Value of such Property.

(d) _Title Dispute Resolution_.

 

(i) The parties shall use Reasonable Efforts to agree on all Title Defects,
Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts. If the
parties are unable to agree by Closing on the existence or amount of a Pre-
Closing Title Defect or a Pre-Closing Title Benefit, then Parents good faith
determination of the Title Defect Amount shall be included in the Escrow
Amount and the Sole Shareholders good faith determination of the Title
Benefit Amounts, as applicable, shall be used to offset any Title Defect
Amounts included in the Escrow Amount. Any disputed Title Defects, Title
Defect Amounts, Title Benefits and Title Benefit Amounts as of the Title Cure
Date shall be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to this
_Section 4.3(d)_.

 

(ii) There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be a title attorney with at
least ten (10) years of experience in oil and gas matters involving
properties in New Mexico,

 



32  as selected by mutual agreement of the parties within fifteen (15) days
after the Closing, and absent such agreement, by the Dallas office of the
American Arbitration Association (the " _Title Arbitrator_ "). The
arbitration proceeding shall be held in Dallas, Texas and shall be conducted
in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the
terms of this _Article IV_. The Title Arbitrators determination shall be made
within twenty (20) days after submission of all matters in dispute (which
submission shall be no later than fifteen (15) days after the Title Cure
Date), and shall be final and binding upon both parties, without right of
appeal, absent fraud or manifest error. In making a determination, the Title
Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in this  _Article IV_ and,
subject to the foregoing, may consider such other matters as in the opinion of
the Title Arbitrator are necessary to make a proper determination. The Title
Arbitrator, however, may not award Parent a greater Title Defect Amount than
the Title Defect Amount claimed by Parent in its Pre-Closing Title Defect
Notice or Post-Closing Title Defect Notice, as applicable, nor may the Title
Arbitrator award the Sole Shareholder a greater Title Benefit Amount than the
Title Benefit Amount claimed by the Sole Shareholder in its Title Benefit
Notice. The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific disputed Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect
Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts submitted by either party and may not award
damages, interest or penalties to either party with respect to any matter.
Each party shall bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its
case. Each of the Sole Shareholder and Parent shall bear one-half of the
costs and expenses of the Title Arbitrator.

(iii) On the Escrow Release Date (A) the aggregate amount by which the Title
Defect Amounts applicable to Pre-Closing Title Defects subject to this
_Section 4.3(d)_, as determined by the Title Arbitrator, are less than the
amount included in the Escrow Amount with respect to such Pre-Closing Title
Defects, shall reduce the Post-Closing Title Adjustment Amount, (B) the
aggregate amount of all Title Defect Amounts applicable to Post-Closing Title
Defects subject to this _Section 4.3(d)_, as determined by the Title
Arbitrator (net of any Title Benefit Amounts determined by the Title
Arbitrator or otherwise agreed after the Closing), shall increase the Post-
Closing Title Adjustment Amount, and (C) the aggregate amount by which the
Title Benefit Amounts, as determined by the Title Arbitrator, are less than
the amount used to offset any Title Defect Amounts applicable to Pre-Closing
Title Defects included in the Escrow Amount at Closing, shall increase to the
Post-Closing Title Adjustment Amount.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Sole Shareholders right to cure any Title
Defect, which shall expire on the Title Cure Date, shall not be extended as a
result of any dispute submitted pursuant to this _Section 4.3(d)_ or any
determination made by the Title Arbitrator and if the Title Defects have not
been cured prior to the Escrow Release Date, the Title Defect
Amounts applicable to such Title Defect Properties shall be included in the
Post-Closing Title Adjustment Amount as a reduction to the Merger
Consideration.

 

(e) Without prejudice to any of the other dates by which performance or the
exercise of rights is due hereunder, or the parties rights or obligations in
respect thereof, the parties hereby acknowledge that, as set forth more fully
in _Section 13.7_ , time is of the essence in performing their obligations and
exercising their rights under this _Section 4.3_.

 



33 4.4 _Environmental Conditions_.

 

(a) _Environmental Condition Notices_.

 

(i) On or before ten (10) Business Days prior to the Target Closing Date (the
" _Pre-Closing Environmental Claim Date_ "), Parent shall deliver claim
notices to the Sole Shareholder meeting the requirements of this _Section
4.4(a)(i)_ (collectively, the " _Pre-Closing Environmental Condition Notices_
" and individually a " _Pre-Closing Environmental Condition Notice_ "), if
any, setting forth any matters which, in Parents reasonable opinion,
constitute Environmental Conditions and which Parent intends to assert as
Environmental Conditions pursuant to this _Section 4.4(a)(i)_ (each, a "
_Pre-Closing Environmental Condition_ "). To be effective, each Pre-Closing
Environmental Condition Notice shall be in writing and shall include (A) a
description of the alleged Environmental Condition, (B) a description of each
Oil and Gas Property or Owned Real Property (or portion thereof) that is
affected by the alleged Environmental Condition, (C) Parents assertion of the
Allocated Value of the portion of the Oil and Gas Properties affected by the
alleged Environmental Condition, (D) supporting documents reasonably necessary
for the Sole Shareholder to verify the existence of the alleged Environmental
Condition and (E) a good faith estimate of the calculation of the Remediation
Amount (itemized in reasonable detail) that Parent asserts is attributable to
such alleged Environmental Condition; _provided_ , that any alleged failure to
comply with clauses (A) through (E) above shall not cause any such notice to
be invalidated or any Environmental Condition to be waived if the
Environmental Condition Notice is reasonably sufficient to provide notice to
the Sole Shareholder of the existence and general nature of the alleged
Environmental Condition.

(ii) After the Pre-Closing Environmental Claim Date, but on or before
the date that is sixty (60) days following the Closing Date (or an earlier
date, at Parents election pursuant to the last sentence of this _Section
4.4(a)(ii)_) (the " _Post-Closing Environmental Claim Date_ "), Parent shall
deliver additional claim notices to the Sole Shareholder meeting the
requirements of this _Section 4.4(a)(ii)_ (collectively, the " _Post-Closing
Environmental Condition Notices_ " and, individually, a " _Post-Closing
Environmental Condition Notice_ "), if any, setting forth any matters which,
in Parents reasonable opinion, constitute Environmental Conditions and which
Parent intends to assert as Environmental Conditions pursuant to this
_Section 4.4(a)(ii)_ (each, a " _Post-Closing Environmental Condition_ "). To
be effective, each Post-Closing Environmental Condition Notice shall be in
writing and shall include (A) a description of the alleged Environmental
Condition, (B) a description of each Oil and Gas Property or Owned Real
Property (or portion thereof) that is affected by the alleged Environmental
Condition, (C) Parents assertion of the Allocated Value of the portion of
the Oil and Gas Properties affected by the alleged Environmental Condition,
(D) supporting documents reasonably necessary for the Sole Shareholder to
verify the existence of the alleged Environmental Condition and (E) a
good faith estimate of the calculation of the Remediation Amount (itemized in
reasonable detail) that Parent asserts is attributable to such alleged
Environmental Condition; _provided_ , that any alleged failure to comply with
clauses (A) through (E) above shall not cause any such notice to be
invalidated or any Environmental Condition to be waived if the Post-Closing
Environmental Condition Notice is reasonably sufficient to provide notice to
the Sole Shareholder of the existence and general nature of the alleged
Environmental Condition; _provided further_ , however, that following any
assertion of a Post-Closing Environmental Condition, Parent shall use
Reasonable Efforts to mitigate any continued effect such Environmental
Condition may have on the Remediation Amount, it being understood that any
amounts paid by Parent in connection with such mitigation shall be added to
the

 



34  Remediation Amount applicable to such Post-Closing Environmental Condition.
For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, a Post-Closing Environmental Condition may include an increase in
the Remediation Amount applicable to a Pre-Closing Environmental Condition. At
any time following the Closing Date and prior to the Post-Closing
Environmental Claim Date (as defined below), Parent may deliver
written notice to the Sole Shareholder that Parent will not deliver any
further Post-Closing Environmental Condition Notices, and the date of such
notice shall be deemed the Post-Closing Environmental Claim Date for purposes
of this Agreement (including for purposes of determining the Environmental
Cure Date).

(b) _Right to Cure_.

 

(i) Subject to the provisions of this _Section 4.4(b)_ and _Section 4.4(c)_,
the Sole Shareholder shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
attempt, at its sole cost, to cure or remediate to the reasonable satisfaction
of Parent, on or before ninety (90) days after the Post-Closing Environmental
Claim Date (the " _Environmental Cure Date_ "), any Environmental Conditions
of which it has received a Pre-Closing Environmental Condition Notice or Post-
Closing Environmental Condition Notice, as applicable, if the Sole Shareholder
provides written notice to Parent on or before (A) the Closing Date, with
respect to Pre-Closing Environmental Conditions, or (B) the date that is ten
(10) Business Days after the Post-Closing Environmental Claim Date, with
respect to Post-Closing Environmental Conditions, of its intent to cure or
remediate such alleged Environmental Conditions. The Sole Shareholders
election to cure or remediate an alleged Environmental Condition shall not
constitute a waiver of any of the rights of the Sole Shareholder pursuant to
this Article IV, including the Sole Shareholders right to dispute the
existence, nature, or value of such Environmental Condition; _provided_ , that
the dispute and settlement thereof pursuant to _Section 4.4(e)_ shall not
extend the period for which the Sole Shareholder has the right to cure any
Environmental Conditions pursuant to this _Section 4.4(b)_. With respect to
any Pre-Closing Environmental Conditions which the Sole Shareholder
has elected to cure pursuant to this _Section 4.4(b)(i)_ and the Sole
Shareholder has not cured prior to Closing to the reasonable satisfaction of
Parent, the parties shall elect one of the remedies under _Section
4.4(c)(i)_. With respect to any Pre-Closing Environmental Condition, if the
parties elect the remedy under _Section 4.4(c)(i)(B)_, this _Section 4.4(b)_
shall not apply to such Pre-Closing Environmental Condition, and if the
parties elect the remedy under _Section 4.4(c)(i)(C)_, Parents good faith
estimate of the applicable Remediation Amount shall be included in the Escrow
Amount at Closing.

 

(ii) If, by the Environmental Cure Date, a Pre-Closing Environmental Condition
for which the Sole Shareholder has provided notice of its election to cure or
remediate pursuant to _Section 4.4(b)(i)_ is waived by Parent or otherwise
cured or remediated to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent, then, the
Remediation Amount of such Environmental Condition Property that
was deposited by Parent into the Escrow Account pursuant to _Section
4.4(b)(i)_ shall be released to the Sole Shareholder on the Escrow Release
Date in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. If, by the
Environmental Cure Date, an Environmental Condition for which the Sole
Shareholder has provided notice of its election to cure or remediate pursuant
to _Section 4.4(b)(i)_ is not waived by Parent or otherwise cured or
remediated to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent, then, subject to
_Section 4.4(e)_ and any determination of the Environmental Arbitrator (if
applicable), the Remediation Amount of such Environmental Condition Property
that was included in the Escrow Amount pursuant to  _Section 4.4(b)(i)_
shall be included in the Post-Closing Environmental Adjustment Amount.

 



35 (c) _Remedies for Environmental Conditions_.

 

(i) In the event that any Environmental Condition timely asserted by Parent in
accordance with _Section 4.4(a)_ is not waived in writing by Parent or cured
or remediated by the Sole Shareholder to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent
prior to Closing (in the event of a Pre-Closing Environmental Condition) or
prior to the Environmental Cure Date (in the event of a Post-Closing
Environmental Condition), then the parties shall cooperate in good faith to
elect one of the following remedies:

(A) subject to the Individual Environmental Threshold and the Aggregate
Deductible, a reduction of the Merger Consideration by the Remediation Amount
as agreed to by the parties or as determined by _Section 4.4(e)_;

 

(B) retention by the Sole Shareholder of the entirety of the Oil and Gas
Property or Owned Real Property that is subject to such Environmental
Condition, in which event the Merger Consideration shall be reduced by an
amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Oil and Gas Property or Owned Real
Property and such associated Oil and Gas Properties shall be deemed
Excluded Assets; or

(C) in the case of a Pre-Closing Environmental Condition, a continued effort
by the Sole Shareholder to attempt to cure or remediate such Environmental
Condition to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent, on or before the
Environmental Cure Date;

In the event the parties cannot agree to any of _Section 4.4(c)(i)(A)_,
_(B)_ , or _(C)_ , then _Section 4.4(c)(i)(B)_ shall be the remedy for an
Environmental Condition. If _Section 4.4(c)(i)(A)_ above is applicable,
Parent shall be deemed to have assumed responsibility for Remediation of such
Environmental Condition and the Sole Shareholder shall not have any
indemnification obligation under _Section 12.2(a)_ for the Remediation of
such Environmental Condition. If  _Section 4.4(c)(i)(B)_ above is
applicable, (x) the Sole Shareholder shall cause the Company to convey the Oil
and Gas Property or Owned Real Property that is the subject of the
Environmental Condition to the Sole Shareholder or one of its designees prior
to Closing (in the case of a Pre-Closing Environmental Condition) or (y)
Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to convey the Oil and Gas Property or
Owned Real Property that is the subject of the Environmental Condition to the
Sole Shareholder or one of its designees within ten (10) Business Days
following any such election (in the case of a Post-Closing Environmental
Condition).

 

(ii) _Closing_. In the event that any Pre-Closing Environmental Condition is
waived by Parent or cured or remediated to Parents reasonable satisfaction
prior to Closing, there shall be no adjustment to the Merger Consideration for
such Pre-Closing Environmental Condition. With respect to Pre-Closing
Environmental Conditions which the Sole Shareholder has not elected to
cure or remediate pursuant to _Section 4.4(b)(i)_ and which Remediation
Amounts are not subject to dispute pursuant to _Section 4.4(e)_, at Closing
there shall be a downward adjustment to the Merger Consideration by the
aggregate amount of all such Remediation Amounts or Allocated Values (as
applicable, pursuant to _Section 4.4(c)(i)(A)_ or _(B)_ above) (such
aggregate amount, the " _Agreed Pre-Closing Environmental Amount_ "),
but only

 



36  to the extent the Agreed Pre-Closing Environmental Amount plus the Agreed
Pre-Closing Title Amount exceeds the Aggregate Deductible (the " _Pre-Closing
Environmental Adjustment Amount_ "), or, if the Agreed Pre-Closing
Environmental Amount plus the Agreed Pre-Closing Title Amount does not exceed
the Aggregate Deductible, there shall be no downward adjustment to the Merger
Consideration therefor and such Agreed Pre-Closing Environmental Amount shall
be used to determine the Post-Closing Environmental Adjustment Amount, if any.

(iii)  _Post-Closing_. In the event that any Post-Closing Environmental
Condition is waived by Parent or cured or remediated to Parents reasonable
satisfaction prior to the Environmental Cure Date, there shall be no
adjustment to the Merger Consideration for such Post-Closing Environmental
Condition. The " _Post-Closing Environmental Adjustment Amount_ " shall be,
subject in all respects to _Section 4.4(c)(iv)_ below, the sum of (1) all
amounts determined pursuant to the last sentence of _Section 4.4(b)(ii)_,
plus (2) the Agreed Pre-Closing Environmental Amount (but only if such amount
did not result in a downward adjustment to the Merger Consideration pursuant
to  _Section 4.4(c)(ii)_ above), plus (3) the aggregate Remediation Amounts
of all Post-Closing Environmental Conditions which have been finally
determined by the parties pursuant to Section 4.4(c)(i)(A) or by the
Environmental Arbitrator pursuant to _Section 4.4(e)_.

(iv) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall there
be any reductions to the Merger Consideration or other remedies provided by
the Sole Shareholder pursuant to this _Section 4.4_ for (i) Environmental
Conditions as to a single facility, Well or other Oil and Gas Property for
which the Remediation Amounts do not exceed $10,000 (" _Individual
Environmental Threshold_ "); and (ii) any Environmental Condition for which
the Remediation Amount exceeds the Individual Environmental Threshold unless
and until the aggregate of (x) the sum of all finally determined Title Defect
Amounts, excluding any Title Defects waived by Parent in writing, less (y) the
sum of all finally determined Title Benefit Amounts, plus (z) the sum of all
Remediation Amounts of all Environmental Conditions that exceed the
Individual Environmental Threshold, in the aggregate, excluding any
Environmental Conditions waived by Parent in writing, exceeds the Aggregate
Deductible, after which point Parent shall be entitled to adjustments to the
Merger Consideration or other remedies provided by this _Section 4.4_ only
with respect to such Environmental Conditions (in excess of the Individual
Environmental Threshold) in excess of the Aggregate Deductible. If the Sole
Shareholder retains any Oil and Gas Property or Owned Real Property pursuant
to _Section 4.4(c)(i)(B)_, the Merger Consideration shall be reduced by the
Allocated Value of such Oil and Gas Property or fair market value of such
Owned Real Property and the Remediation Amount relating to such Oil and Gas
Property or Owned Real Property will not be counted toward the Aggregate
Deductible. The Remediation Amount or Allocated Values, as applicable, with
respect to an Environmental Condition shall be determined without duplication
of any costs or losses included in another Environmental Condition, or for
which Parent otherwise receives credit in the calculation of the Merger
Consideration.

 

(d) _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for Parents remedy for a breach of the
Companys representation contained in  _Section 5.1(p)_, the Sole
Shareholders indemnification obligation in _Section 12.2_ with respect to
such breach, and Parents rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 11.1(b)(i)_, the provisions set forth in _Section 4.4(c)_ shall be
the exclusive right and remedy of Parent with respect to any Environmental
Condition or other

 



37  environmental matter with respect to any of the Oil and Gas Properties;
_provided_ , that Parent shall not be entitled to a remedy for the breach of
the Companys representation contained in _Section 5.1(p),_ and the Sole
Shareholder shall not have an indemnity obligation pursuant to _Section
12.2(a)_ with respect to any such breach, for any Environmental Condition that
Parent asserts in a Pre-Closing Environmental Condition Notice or Post-
Closing Environmental Condition Notice, as applicable; _provided_ , _further_
, that nothing contained herein shall limit Parents indemnification rights
with respect to Oil and Gas Properties deemed to be Excluded Assets pursuant
to _Section 4.4(c)(i)(B)_. SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION 4.4(D),
PARENT RELEASES, REMISES, AND FOREVER DISCHARGES SOLE SHAREHOLDER, ITS
AFFILIATES, AND EACH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE MEMBERS, SHAREHOLDERS, INTEREST
OWNERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, MANAGERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, ADVISORS, AND
REPRESENTATIVES FROM ANY AND ALL SUITS, LEGAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS,
CLAIMS, DEMANDS, DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS, LIABILITIES, INTEREST, OR CAUSES
OF ACTION WHATSOEVER, IN LAW (INCLUDING RIGHTS TO CONTRIBUTION UNDER THE
COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT OF 1990,
AS AMENDED) OR IN EQUITY, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, WHICH PARENT MIGHT NOW OR
SUBSEQUENTLY MAY HAVE, BASED ON, RELATING TO, OR ARISING OUT OF, ANY
ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION OF ANY OIL AND GAS PROPERTY OR OWNED REAL PROPERTY
INCLUDED IN A PRE-CLOSING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION NOTICE OR POST-CLOSING
ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION NOTICE, AS APPLICABLE, OTHER THAN ANY OIL AND GAS
PROPERTIES DEEMED TO BE EXCLUDED ASSETS PURSUANT TO SECTION 4.4(C)(I)(B).

(e) _Environmental Dispute Resolution_.

(i) The parties shall use Reasonable Efforts to agree on all Environmental
Conditions and Remediation Amounts with respect thereto. If the parties are
unable to agree on the existence of, or the Remediation Amount applicable to,
any alleged Environmental Condition, Parents good faith estimate of the
Remediation Amounts associated with any such Pre-Closing Environmental
Conditions in dispute shall be included in the Escrow Amount at Closing. All
Environmental Conditions and/or Remediation Amounts in dispute as of the
Environmental Cure Date shall be exclusively and finally resolved by
arbitration pursuant to this _Section 4.4(e)_.

(ii) There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be an environmental
attorney with at least ten (10) years of experience in environmental matters
involving oil and gas producing properties in New Mexico, as selected by
mutual agreement of the parties within fifteen (15) days after the Closing
Date, and absent such agreement, by the Dallas office of the American
Arbitration Association (the " _Environmental Arbitrator_ "). The arbitration
proceeding shall be held in Dallas, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance
with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this
Article. The Environmental Arbitrators determination shall be made within
twenty (20) days after submission of all matters in dispute (which submission
shall be made within fifteen (15) days following the Environmental Cure Date),
and shall be final and binding upon both parties, without right of appeal,
absent fraud or manifest error. In making 

 



38  a determination, the Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules
set forth in this _Section 4.4_ and, subject to the foregoing, may consider
such other matters as in the opinion of the Environmental Arbitrator are
necessary to make a proper determination. The Environmental Arbitrator,
however, may not award Parent a greater Remediation Amount than the
Remediation Amount claimed by Parent in its applicable Environmental
Condition Notice. The Environmental Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the
limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Environmental Conditions
and/or Remediation Amounts submitted by either party and may not award
damages, interest or penalties to either party with respect to any matter.
Each party shall bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its
case. Each of Parent and Sole Shareholder shall bear one-half of the costs and
expenses of the Environmental Arbitrator.

(iii) On the Escrow Release Date (A) the aggregate amount by which the
Remediation Amounts applicable to Pre-Closing Environmental Conditions
subject to this _Section 4.4(e)_, as determined by the Environmental
Arbitrator, are less than the amount included in the Escrow Amount with
respect to such Pre-Closing Environmental Conditions shall decrease the Post-
Closing Environmental Adjustment Amount and (B) the aggregate amount of all
Remediation Amounts or Allocated Values, as applicable, related to Post-
Closing Environmental Conditions subject to this _Section 4.4(e)_, as
determined by the Environmental Arbitrator, shall increase the Post-Closing
Environmental Adjustment Amount.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Sole Shareholders right to cure or remediate
any Environmental Condition, which shall expire on the Environmental Cure
Date, shall not be extended as a result of any dispute submitted pursuant to
this _Section 4.4(e)_ or any determination made by the Environmental
Arbitrator and if the Environmental Conditions have not been cured prior to
the Escrow Release Date, the Remediation Amount applicable to such Oil and Gas
Property or Owned Real Property shall be released to Parent.

 

(i) _NORM, Wastes and Other Substances_. Without limiting Parents right to
indemnification pursuant to  _Section 12.2_, Parent acknowledges that (A)
the Oil and Gas Properties have been used for exploration, development and
production of oil and gas and that there may be petroleum, produced water,
wastes and other substances or materials located in, on or under the Oil and
Gas Properties or associated with the Oil and Gas Properties, (B) Equipment
included within the Oil and Gas Properties may contain asbestos, NORM, or
other Hazardous Substances, (C) NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside
of wells, materials and equipment as scale, or in other forms and (D) the
Wells, Personal Property, materials and Equipment located on the Oil and Gas
Properties may contain NORM.

 

4.5 _Title Benefits_.

 

(a) _Title Benefit Notices_. On or before the Pre-Closing Title Claim Date or
Post-Closing Title Claim Date, as applicable, the Sole Shareholder shall have
the right, but not the obligation, to deliver claim notices to Parent meeting
the requirements of this _Section 4.5(a)_ (collectively the " _Title Benefit
Notices_ " and individually a " _Title Benefit Notice_ ") setting forth any
Title Benefits which the Sole Shareholder discovers following the date hereof.
To be effective, each Title Benefit Notice shall be in writing and shall
include (i) a description of the alleged Title Benefit(s), (ii) the Wells,
Leases or Units and/or other Oil and Gas Properties affected by the Title
Benefit (each a " _Title Benefit Property_ "), (iii) the Allocated Value of
each 

 



39  Title Benefit Property, (iv) supporting documents reasonably necessary for
Parent to verify the existence of the alleged Title Benefit(s), and (v) the
amount by which the Sole Shareholder reasonably believes the Allocated Value
of each Title Benefit Property is increased by the alleged Title Benefit(s);
_provided_ , that an alleged failure to comply with subsections (i) through
(iv) above shall not cause any such notice to be invalidated or any Title
Benefit to be waived if the Title Benefit Notice is reasonably sufficient to
provide notice to Parent of the existence and general nature of the alleged
Title Benefit. SOLE SHAREHOLDER SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED AND RELEASED,
AND COVENANTS THAT IT SHALL WAIVE AND RELEASE, ANY AND ALL TITLE BENEFITS (AND
ANY OFFSETS TO TITLE DEFECTS ATTRIBUTABLE THERETO) FOR WHICH NO PARTY HAS
RECEIVED ON OR BEFORE THE POST-CLOSING TITLE CLAIM DATE A VALID TITLE BENEFIT
NOTICE THAT SATISFIES THE CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN THIS
SECTION 4.5(a).

(b) _Remedies for Title Benefits_. With respect to each Title Benefit
reported under _Section 4.5(a)_ on or before the Pre-Closing Title Claim Date
(each, a " _Pre-Closing Title Benefit_ "), there shall be an offset to Title
Defect Amounts used to determine the Pre-Closing Title Adjustment Amount
pursuant to _Section 4.3(c)(i)_ by the Title Benefit Amount of such Pre-
Closing Title Benefits. With respect to each Title Benefit reported under
_Section 4.5(a)_ after the Pre-Closing Title Claim Date but on or before the
Post-Closing Title Claim Date (each, a " _Post-Closing Title Benefit_ "),
there shall be an offset to Title Defect Amounts used to determine the Post-
Closing Title Adjustment Amount pursuant to _Section 4.3(c)(ii)_ by the
Title Benefit Amount of such Post-Closing Title Benefits. The value of each
Title Benefit shall be determined as follows (the " _Title Benefit Amount_ "):

 

(i) if Parent and the Sole Shareholder agree in writing upon the Title Benefit
Amount, that amount shall be the Title Benefit Amount;

 

(ii) if the Title Benefit represents a discrepancy between (A) the Net Revenue
Interest for any Title Benefit Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest or
percentage stated with respect to such Title Benefit Property on _Exhibit A-1_
or _Exhibit A-2_, the Title Benefit Amount shall be the product of the
Allocated Value of Title Benefit Property multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest increase and the denominator of
which is the Net Revenue Interest stated on _Exhibit A-1_ or _Exhibit A-2_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Title Benefit does not affect a Title
Benefit Property throughout the entire productive life of the Title Benefit
Property, the Title Benefit Amount shall be reduced to take into account the
applicable time period only;

 

(iii) if a Title Benefit represents a right, circumstance, or condition of a
type not described in subsections (i) or (ii) above, the Title Benefit Amount
shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Title
Benefit Property so affected, the portion of the Title Benefit Property so
affected, the legal effect of the Title Benefit, the potential
discounted economic effect of the Title Benefit over the productive life of
any affected Title Benefit Property, the values placed upon the Title Benefit
by the parties, and such other factors as are necessary to make a proper
evaluation;

 

(iv) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 4, an individual
claim for a Title Benefit shall only generate an offset to Title Defects if
the Title Benefit Amount with respect thereto exceeds $5,000.

 



40 4.6 _Consents_.

 

(a) _Notices_. On or before ten (10) Business Days prior to Closing, the Sole
Shareholder shall deliver a written notice to Parent setting forth each
Third-Party Consent which, as of such date, has not been unconditionally
satisfied or waived. In no event shall there be transferred at Closing any Oil
and Gas Property for which a Third-Party Consent has not been satisfied
and for which transfer is prohibited or a fee is payable (unless such fee has
been paid by the Sole Shareholder) without such Third-Party Consent.

 

(b) _Economic Benefits and Burdens_. Without limiting Parents rights under
this _Section 4.6_, in cases in which the Oil and Gas Property subject to
such an unobtained Third-Party Consent is not a Lease, Well or Unit, and the
Lease(s), Well(s) or Unit(s) to which such Oil and Gas Property relates is
transferred as contemplated herein, but such Oil and Gas Property is not
transferred due to the unwaived Third-Party Consent, Parent and the Sole
Shareholder shall continue after Closing to use Reasonable Efforts to obtain
the Third-Party Consent so that such Oil and Gas Property can be transferred
upon receipt of the consent, and, if permitted pursuant to Applicable Law and
agreement, such Oil and Gas Property shall be held by Sole Shareholder for the
benefit of Parent and Parent shall pay all amounts due thereunder or with
respect thereto, and Parent shall be responsible for the performance of any
obligations under or with respect to such Oil and Gas Property that are
necessary for such performance until the applicable Third-Party Consent is
obtained.

 

(c) _Consent Obtained_. In cases in which the Oil and Gas Property subject to
such a Third-Party Consent requirement is a Lease, Well or Unit and the
Third-Party Consent to the transfer of such Lease, Well or Unit is not
obtained by Closing, Parent may elect to treat the unsatisfied Third-Party
Consent as a Title Defect and exclude such Lease, Well or Unit from the
transactions contemplated hereunder and in which case the Merger
Consideration shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Oil and Gas
Property (and such Oil and Gas Property shall constitute an Excluded Asset,
subject to the remainder of this  _Section 4.6(c)_) by giving the Sole
Shareholder written notice thereof in accordance with _Section 4.3(a)_,
except that such notice may be given on or before the Closing Date. If any
such Third-Party Consent with respect to which an adjustment to the Merger
Consideration is made under this _Section 4.6(c)_ is subsequently received or
waived prior to the date the Final Adjustment Amount is finally determined,
(i) the relevant Lease, Well or Unit, if not previously transferred
hereunder, shall be transferred to the Surviving Company, (ii) such Lease,
Well or Unit shall be no longer treated as an Excluded Asset, (iii) Parent
shall pay or cause to be paid to the Sole Shareholder the amount that the
Merger Consideration was reduced as a result of such Oil and Gas Property, and
(iv) the provisions of this Section shall no longer apply to such Third-Party
Consent. If such Third-Party Consent is not satisfied prior to the date
the Final Adjustment Amount is finally determined, the affected Lease, Well
or Unit shall be deemed to have been deleted from _Exhibits A-1_ and _A-2_
hereto and shall constitute an Excluded Asset.

 

(d) _Transfer Notwithstanding Consent_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, no Oil and Gas Property shall be excluded from Closing as a
result of an unsatisfied or unwaived Third-Party Consent if such Third-Party
Consent requirement does not provide that the transfer of the affected Oil and
Gas Property without satisfaction or waiver of such consent requirement would
be void, or would otherwise impair the affected Oil and Gas Property or the
Sole Shareholders, the Companys or Parents title thereto.

 



41 4.7 _Preferential Purchase Rights_.

 

(a) _Exercise of Preferential Purchase Right_. Any preferential purchase right
must be exercised subject to all terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, on the dates set forth herein. The Merger Consideration payable
under this Agreement for any particular Oil and Gas Property for purposes of
preferential purchase right notices shall be the Allocated Value for such Oil
and Gas Property, adjusted as set forth in this Agreement.

(b) If any preferential right to purchase any Oil and Gas Property is
validly exercised prior to Closing, the Oil and Gas Properties (or portions
thereof) affected thereby shall constitute Excluded Assets and the Merger
Consideration shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Oil and Gas
Properties (or portions thereof), the affected Oil and Gas Properties shall
not be transferred at Closing and the Merger Consideration shall be reduced by
an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Oil and Gas Properties. Should
a third Person fail to validly exercise or waive its preferential right to
purchase as to any portion of the Oil and Gas Properties prior to Closing, and
the time for exercise or waiver has not yet expired, then (i) such Oil and Gas
Properties (or portions thereof) shall not be conveyed at Closing, (ii) the
Closing Cash Merger Consideration shall be reduced by the an amount equal to
the Allocated Value of such Oil and Gas Properties in accordance with _Section
4.3_ as though the affected Oil and Gas Property (or portions thereof) were
subject to a Title Defect; (iii) the affected Oil and Gas Properties (or
portions thereof) shall be subject to _Sections 4.7(c)_ and _4.7(d)_ and (iv)
the Sole Shareholder shall, at its sole expense, continue to use Reasonable
Efforts to obtain the waiver of the preferential purchase right and shall
continue to be responsible for the compliance therewith.

 

(c) Should the holder of a preferential purchase right to purchase any Oil and
Gas Property validly exercise such right after Closing, the affected Oil and
Gas Property (or portions thereof) shall constitute an Excluded Asset, the
Sole Shareholder shall convey the affected Oil and Gas Property to the holder
of such right on the terms and provisions set out in the
applicable preferential right provision and shall be entitled to the
consideration paid by such holder.

(d) In the event that, on or before the date the Final Adjustment Amount is
finally determined, a preferential purchase right with respect to an Oil and
Gas Property excluded from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at
Closing pursuant to _Section 4.7(b)_ above is waived or the time for
exercise of such right has expired pursuant to its terms, then Parent may (but
shall not be obligated to) request that the Sole Shareholder convey or cause
to be conveyed to Parent, effective as of the Effective Time, the affected
Oil and Gas Property on a form of conveyance reasonably satisfactory to the
Sole Shareholder and Parent and Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the
Sole Shareholder the amount that the Merger Consideration was reduced as a
result of such Oil and Gas Property; and

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event
that the exercise of a preferential purchase right, whether before, on or
after Closing, causes title to any other Oil and Gas Property (whether or not
directly affected by such preferential purchase right) to be less than
Defensible Title or otherwise materially impairs the use, operation or
ownership of any Oil and Gas Property, Parent may claim such material
impairment as a Title Defect by giving the Sole Shareholder notice thereof in
accordance with _Section 4.3(a)_, except that such notice may be given on,
before or after the Closing, and Parent shall receive the appropriate
adjustment to the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 4.3(c)_.

 



42 4.8 _Casualty Loss_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, from and after
the Effective Time, if Closing occurs, Parent shall assume all risk of loss
with respect to production of Hydrocarbons through normal depletion or
otherwise (including watering out of any Well, collapsed casing or sand
infiltration of any Well, in each case, not caused by any gross negligence or
willful misconduct on the part of the Company or the Sole Shareholder prior
to the Effective Time) and the depreciation of personal property due to
ordinary wear and tear and, in each case, Parent shall not assert such matters
as Casualty Losses or Title Defects hereunder; _provided_ , that nothing
contained in this _Section 4.8(a)_ shall limit Parents rights and remedies
with respect to Environmental Conditions pursuant to _Section 4.4_.

 

(b) If, after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any
portion of the Oil and Gas Properties is damaged or destroyed by fire or
other casualty or is expropriated or taken in condemnation or under right of
eminent domain (a " _Casualty Loss_ "), this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and the Sole Shareholder shall use Reasonable Efforts to
mitigate the effects of such Casualty Loss, which shall include the
application of all applicable insurance proceeds to the repair or remediation
of the applicable Casualty Loss.

 

(c) In the event of a Casualty Loss that exceeds $100,000 based on the
aggregate Allocated Value of the affected Oil and Gas Properties, Parent
shall nevertheless be required to close the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the parties shall cooperate in good faith to elect one of the
following remedies:

 

(i) the Sole Shareholder shall cause the Oil and Gas Properties affected by
any Casualty Loss to be repaired or restored to at least its condition prior
to such casualty or taking, at the Sole Shareholders sole cost (including the
application of all insurance proceeds applicable to such Casualty Loss), as
promptly as reasonably practicable (which work may extend after the Closing);

(ii) the Merger Consideration shall be reduced by an amount equal to the cost
to repair or restore the Oil and Gas Properties; or

(iii) the affected Oil and Gas Properties shall be deleted from this Agreement
and all exhibits and schedules hereto and shall constitute part of the
Excluded Assets, and the Merger Consideration shall be decreased by the
Allocated Value thereof (in each case, the Sole Shareholder shall retain all
rights to insurance and other claims against third Persons with respect
to the Casualty Loss or taking except to the extent the parties otherwise
agree in writing).

Entity, any Equity Interest in any Company Entity, or any substantial part of
a Company Entitys assets or any merger, business combination or
similar transaction or any other transaction that could impede or preclude
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement being consummated with Parent

Parent will cause such Tax Return (as revised by Parent to incorporate the
Sole Shareholders reasonable comments) to be timely filed and will timely
pay all Taxes shown as due and payable on such Tax Return and will provide a
copy to the Sole Shareholder. The Sole Shareholder shall promptly indemnify
Parent for the portion of such Taxes for which the Sole Shareholder is
liable pursuant to Section 8.4(a).

(e) _Tax Treatment of Certain Items_. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties
hereto intend that, in conformance with Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A), any federal income Tax deductions incurred by the
Company and each Company Subsidiary on the Closing Date related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including Tax deductions arising
out of payment of Company Transaction Expenses) shall be treated as arising in
the Pre-Closing Period.

(f) _Tax Cooperation_. The parties shall cooperate fully as and to the extent
reasonably requested by any other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns and any audit, litigation or other Proceeding (each, a "
_Tax Proceeding_ ") with respect to Taxes imposed on or with respect to the
assets, operations or activities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partys
request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax Proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no party shall be unreasonably required to prepare any document, or
determine any information, not then in its possession in response to a request
under this _Section 8.4(f)_. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section
8.4(f)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall not be
required to furnish to the Sole Shareholder or any other Person any Tax
Returns (or information related thereto) of Parent or any of its Affiliates
(other than the Pre-Closing Combined Tax Returns, Pre-Closing Tax Returns and
Straddle Tax Returns of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or the Surviving
Company). Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.4(f) or elsewhere in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Sole Shareholder shall not be required to
furnish to Parent or any other Person any Tax Returns (or information related
thereto) of the Sole Shareholder or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Company and any Company Subsidiary). For the avoidance of doubt, the Sole
Shareholder shall not be required to provide to Parent any Tax Returns of the
Sole Shareholder Affiliated Group.

 

(g) _Amended Tax Returns_. Unless required by Applicable Law, no amended Tax
Return with respect to a Pre-Closing Period shall be filed by or on behalf of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary without the prior written consent of the
Sole Shareholder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 



78 (h) _Refunds_. If after the Closing Date, Parent or one of its Affiliates
receives a refund (or credit in lieu of a refund) of a Tax of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Period that was borne or paid by
the Company or such Company Subsidiary prior to the Closing Date or paid or
borne by the Sole Shareholder pursuant to _Sections 8.4(c), 8.4(d), 12.2_ or
otherwise in the Agreement, then, within thirty (30) days of receiving such
refund or electing to take a credit in lieu of a refund, Parent shall pay the
amount of such refund or credit to the Sole Shareholder, less any third-party
costs and expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Parent or any of its
Affiliates in obtaining such refund or credit; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the foregoing provision shall not apply to any portion of any refund or
credit that arises as a result of the carryback of Tax items accruing or
otherwise generated in a Post-Closing Period. If the amount of a refund has
been paid to the Sole Shareholder and the applicable Taxing Authority
later requires Parent or any of its Affiliates to repay all or any portion of
the amount of such refund, the amount required to be repaid to the Taxing
Authority (including interest, penalties or other additions imposed by the
Taxing Authority) shall be deemed to be Damage for which the Parent
Indemnified Parties are entitled to full indemnification by the Sole
Shareholder pursuant to _Section 12.2(a)_. For purposes of determining the
portion of any refund or credit of Taxes for a Straddle Period that is
attributable to the Pre-Closing Period, such refund or credit of Taxes shall
be equitably apportioned between the Sole Shareholder and Parent in accordance
with the principles set forth in _Section 8.4(b)_.

 

(i) _Tax Contests_. The Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing upon
receipt prior to the Closing by it or any Company Subsidiary of notice of any
pending or threatened Tax audits, proposals, assessments or reassessments
relating to the income, properties or operations of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. After the Closing, Parent shall have the exclusive right to
represent the interests of the Company Entities in any and all Tax audits,
assessments or administrative or court proceedings relating to Tax Returns of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary for all Pre-Closing Periods
and Straddle Periods; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Sole Shareholder
shall have the right to participate in any such audit, assessment or
proceeding and to employ counsel of its choice for purposes of such
participation to the extent that any such audit, assessment or proceeding
could result in an indemnification claim by any of the Parent Indemnified
Parties. In the event that Parent proposes to compromise or settle any Tax
claim, or consent or agree to any Tax liability, relating to the Company or
any Company Subsidiary that could result in an indemnity payment to the Parent
Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 12.2(a)_, the Sole Shareholder shall
have the right to review and provide its written consent to such proposed
compromise, settlement, consent or agreement. Parent shall not agree or
consent to compromise or settle any issue or claim arising in any such audit,
assessment or Proceeding on a basis that could result in liability of the Sole
Shareholder for indemnification pursuant to _Section 12.2(a)_ unless (i) the
Sole Shareholder consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or
concession, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed or (ii)
Parent agrees in writing to waive its right to be indemnified for any Taxes
that may result from the issue being settled, compromised or conceded. For the
avoidance of doubt, this Section 8.4(i) shall not apply to any audit,
assessment or proceeding relating to Tax Returns of the Sole Shareholder
Affiliated Group, which shall be under the exclusive control of the Sole
Shareholder.

(j)  _Transfer Taxes_. In the event any Transfer Taxes are due, the Sole
Shareholder and Parent shall each be responsible for, and shall pay, 50% of
all Transfer Taxes.

 



79  Parent shall cause to be filed all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation required to be filed by it under Applicable Law with respect to
all Transfer Taxes, and, if required by Applicable Law, the parties shall
join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. Each
party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as the
other party may reasonably request in connection with efforts to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Transfer Taxes and to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Taxing Authority or any other Person as
may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Transfer Taxes.

 

(k) _Tax Treatment of Merger_.

 

(i) For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Merger is intended to constitute
a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The
parties to this Agreement adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization"
within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the Treasury
regulations.

 

(ii) The Sole Shareholder, Parent, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall
each use Reasonable Efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and
before or after the Effective Time, none of the Sole Shareholder, Parent, the
Company or Merger Subsidiary shall knowingly take any action, cause any action
to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken
which action or failure to act could cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

(iii) The Sole Shareholder, Parent, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall
comply with the recordkeeping and information reporting requirements set
forth in Treasury Regulation 1.368-3.

(iv) Following the Merger, neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary will take
any action or fail to take any action if such action or failure to act would
prevent the Merger from satisfying the "continuity of business enterprise"
requirement for a "reorganization" as provided in Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-1(d).

(l) _Conflicts_. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this
Agreement, to the extent that this  _Section 8.4_ conflicts with any other
provision of this Agreement, this _Section 8.4_ shall govern with respect to
the matters described in this _Section 8.4_. For the avoidance of doubt,
_Section 12.5_ is not a conflict with this _Section 8.4_ and shall apply to
the Sole Shareholders indemnification obligations under _Section 8.4(a)_.

 

8.5 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each party shall, prior to Closing, to
the extent that the party has Knowledge of the following, give prompt notice
of (a) the occurrence (or non-occurrence) of any event the occurrence (or non-
occurrence) of which could reasonably be expected to cause any of its
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect, in the case of representations or
warranties not qualified as to materiality or a Material Adverse Effect, or in
any respect, in the case of representations or warranties that are so
qualified, (b) any failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any
covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, (c)
any event, condition, fact, or circumstance that would make the timely
satisfaction of any of the conditions

 



80  set forth in _Article IX_ impossible or unlikely and (d) any notice or other
communication from any Person alleging that the consent or waiver of such
Person is required in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 8.5_ shall not cure the inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty, the failure to comply with any covenant, the failure to meet any
condition or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the
party receiving such notice.

 

8.6 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of the parties shall use its Reasonable Efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents. The parties will coordinate and cooperate with each other in
exchanging such information and assistance as any of the parties may
reasonably request in connection with the foregoing.

 

8.7 _Sole Shareholder Representation on Parent Board_. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall increase the number of directors of Parent by one and,
subject to the fiduciary duties of Parents board of directors, (i) appoint,
as of the Effective Time, George M. Yates as a Class II director of Parent,
for a term of office continuing until the next election of one or more
directors by the shareholders of Parent and thereafter until the election and
qualification of his respective successor or until his earlier death,
retirement, resignation or removal from the board of directors of Parent, (ii)
approve compensation for George M. Yates, in his capacity as a director, such
that he shall receive the same annual retainer, meeting fees and equity awards
generally provided to non-employee directors of Parent and (iii) nominate
George M. Yates for reelection at the Companys 2015 annual meeting of
shareholders.

8.8 _Records_. The Sole Shareholder may retain copies of any and all Records
and may retain the originals of those Records relating to pre-Closing Tax and
accounting matters. Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall preserve and keep a
copy of all Records in their possession in accordance with Parents record
retention policies and shall provide access to such records, during normal

Parties_ ") against and shall hold each of them harmless from any and all
damage, liability, loss, fine, penalty, cost and expense (including court
costs and reasonable consultants and attorneys fees and expenses) ("
_Damages_ ") arising from, based upon, related to or associated with (i) any
breach or inaccuracy of any of the representations and warranties of the
Company or the Sole Shareholder contained in _Section 5.1_ or _Section 5.2_
of this Agreement (without giving effect, in determining the amount of
Damages, to any materiality or similar qualification limiting the scope of
such representation or warranty), (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement
of the Company or the Sole Shareholder that survives Closing pursuant to this
Agreement, (iii) the Sole Shareholders indemnification obligations pursuant
to _Section 8.4(a)_ of this Agreement, (iv) the Specified Matters to the
extent claims are made with respect 

 



88  thereto within the applicable statute of limitations and (v) any of the
Excluded Liabilities, EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES ARE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY
THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER
LEGAL FAULT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PERSON, INVITEE, OR THIRD PERSON, AND WHETHER
OR NOT CAUSED BY A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION, BUT EXCLUDING THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE
OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PERSON. No claim for indemnification
may be brought by Parent Indemnified Parties unless the aggregate amount of
Damages with respect to all such claims exceeds $500,000 (the " _Deductible_
"), at which point Parent Indemnified Parties may recover all Damages in
excess of the Deductible. The Deductible shall not apply to (1) inaccuracies
in or breaches of any of the Company Fundamental Representations, the Sole
Shareholder Fundamental Representations or the representations contained in
_Section 5.1(q)_ or (2) the indemnification obligations set forth in clauses
(ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of this _Section 12.2(a)_ (collectively, the "
_Limitation Exceptions_ "). The maximum aggregate liability for all
indemnification claims (other than the Limitation Exceptions) shall not exceed
$30,000,000 and the maximum aggregate liability for all indemnification claims
(including the Limitation Exceptions) shall not exceed the Merger
Consideration.

(b) Effective after the Closing, subject to terms and conditions of this
__Article XII, Parent hereby indemnifies the Sole Shareholder and its
respective Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, equity
holders, managers and employees (" _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") against
and shall hold each of them harmless from any and all Damages arising from,
based upon, related to or associated with (i) any breach or inaccuracy of any
of the representations and warranties of Parent or Merger Subsidiary contained
in _Section 5.3_ of this Agreement (without giving effect, in determining the
amount of Damages, to any materiality or similar qualification limiting the
scope of such representation or warranty), (ii) any breach of any covenant or
agreement of Parent or Merger Subsidiary that survives Closing pursuant to
this Agreement, (iii) any Assumed Liabilities other than those for which
indemnification by the Sole Shareholder is expressly provided for under
_Section 12.2(a)_, and (iv) Taxes of the Company and each Company Subsidiary
that are not the responsibility of the Sole Shareholder under Section 8.4(a),
EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES ARE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER
SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF ANY
INDEMNIFIED PERSON, INVITEE, OR THIRD PERSON, AND WHETHER OR NOT CAUSED BY A
PRE-EXISTING CONDITION, BUT EXCLUDING THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PERSON. The total amount of payments that Parent
and Merger Subsidiary can be required to make to the Company Indemnified
Parties pursuant to this _Section 12.2_ shall be limited to the Merger
Consideration.

 

12.3 _Third-Party Claim Procedures_.

 

(a) The party seeking indemnification under _Section 12.2_ (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") agrees to give prompt notice in writing to the party
against whom indemnity is to be sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the
assertion of any claim or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding
by any third party (" _Third-Party Claim_ ") in respect of which indemnity
may be sought under _Section 12.2_. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable
detail such Third-Party Claim and the basis for indemnification (taking into
account the information 

 



89  then available to the Indemnified Party), and the calculation of Damages.
The Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party within ten (10) days
after it becomes aware of any Third-Party Claim in respect of which indemnity
may be sought under _Section 12.2_; _provided_ , that the failure to so
notify the Indemnifying Party within such time period shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations or liability hereunder, except to the
extent such failure prejudices the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend the
Third-Party Claim. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the
Indemnifying Party, promptly after the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof,
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
Indemnified Party relating to the Third-Party Claim.

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
any Third-Party Claim and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof
with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall
continue to be entitled to assert any limitation of any claims contained
in this _Article XII_.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of any such Third-
Party Claim, it shall notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its intent
to do so and the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified
Party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense thereof. The Indemnifying Party will have the
right to assume control of such defense of the Third-Party Claim provided the
Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Parties advised of the status of
such Third-Party Claim and the defense thereof on a reasonably current basis.
If the Indemnifying Party assumes the control of the defense of any Third-
Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 12.3_, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any such
Third-Party Claim and to employ, at its expense, separate counsel of its
choice for such purpose, it being understood, however, that the Indemnifying
Party shall continue to control such defense; _provided_ , that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the
reasonable costs and expenses of such defense (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses) of the Indemnified Party if the Indemnified Partys outside
counsel shall have reasonably concluded that (x) there are defenses available
to the Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those
available to the Indemnifying Party, or (y) there is a conflict of interest
that would make it inappropriate under applicable standards of professional
conduct to have common counsel for the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Indemnifying Party will not be permitted to settle, compromise or consent to
the entry of a judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought
hereunder, in each case, without the Indemnified Partys prior written consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless
the settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of
the Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Third-Party Claim
and (ii) does not contain any admission or statement of any wrongdoing
or liability on behalf of the Indemnified Party.

(d) Each party shall reasonably cooperate, and cause their respective
Affiliates to reasonably cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any
Third-Party Claim and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such records,
information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings,
hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection
therewith.

 



90 12.4 _Direct Claim Procedures_. If the Indemnified Party has a claim for
indemnity under _Section 12.2_ against the Indemnifying Party that does not
involve a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to give prompt
notice in writing of such claim to the Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall
set forth in reasonable detail such claim and the basis for indemnification
(taking into account the information then available to the Indemnified Party)
and the calculation of Damages. The failure to promptly notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure prejudices the
Indemnifying Partys ability to defend the claim. If the Indemnifying Party
does not notify the Indemnified Party within forty-five (45) calendar days
following its receipt of such notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes its
liability to the Indemnified Party under this _Article XII_ , such direct
claim for indemnity specified by the Indemnified Party in such notice shall
be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party under this
_Article XII_ and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such
liability to the Indemnified Party on demand, or in the case of any notice in
which the amount of the direct claim for indemnity (or any portion thereof)
is estimated, on such later date when the amount of such direct claim (or such
portion thereof) becomes finally determined.

 

12.5 _Calculation of Damages_. The obligation of the Indemnifying Party to
indemnify the Indemnified Party under  _Section 12.2_ is subject to the
following limitations:

(a) The amount of any Damages payable under _Section 12.2_ by the
Indemnifying Party shall be reduced by (i) any Tax benefits actually realized
by the Indemnified Party on or prior to the date of the claim that result from
or arise out of such Damages, net of any corresponding Tax costs incurred
by such party and (ii) any amounts recoverable by the Indemnified Party under
applicable insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to have
responsibility. Each Indemnified Party shall pursue in good faith all claims
available under such third-party insurance coverage and from any Person
alleged to have responsibility. If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts
under applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be
responsible for any Damages (which were not earlier taken into account in
calculating Damages), subsequent to an indemnification payment by the
Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the
Indemnifying Party for any payment made or out-of-pocket expense incurred by
the Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification
payment up to the amount actually received by the Indemnified Party.

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under _Section 12.2(a)_ or
_12.2(b_ ) for any consequential, punitive, incidental, indirect, special or
exemplary Damages (including lost profits, opportunity costs or damages based
upon a multiple of earnings), whether based on contract, strict liability,
other Applicable Law or otherwise and whether or not arising from any other
partys sole, joint or concurrent negligence, strict liability or other fault;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for such
consequential, punitive, incidental or indirect or special Damages (including
lost profits) to the extent such consequential, punitive, incidental,
indirect, special or exemplary Damages (including lost profits, opportunity
costs or damages based upon a multiple of earnings) are recovered against
an Indemnified Party by a Person that is not an Indemnified Party or an
Affiliate of such Indemnified Party.

(c) The Indemnified Party shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate any
Damages for which the Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this
Agreement and shall use Reasonable Efforts to avoid any costs or expenses
associated with such claim and, if such costs and expenses cannot be avoided,
to use Reasonable Efforts to minimize the amount thereof.

(d) Any indemnity payment under this Agreement shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Merger Consideration for Tax purposes.

 



91 12.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. After the Closing, the remedies set forth in
_Article IV_ , _Section 8.4_ and _Section 12.2_ or the applicable
Transaction Documents will provide the sole and exclusive remedies arising out
of, in connection with, relating (directly or indirectly) to, or arising under
this Agreement, the Transaction Documents and any other document, agreement,
certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant hereto or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any misrepresentation, breach of
warranty, covenant or other agreement or other claim arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (other than (i) in the case
of intentional misrepresentation or fraud or (ii) equitable remedies as they
relate to breaches of covenants or other agreements contained herein to the
extent such covenants or agreements are to be performed after the Closing),
regardless of Applicable Law or the legal theory under which such liability or
obligation may be sought to be imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort,
or whether at law or in equity or otherwise.

12.7 _Disclaimer_. EXCEPT AS AND TO THE EXTENT SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN
_SECTION 4.1_ , _SECTION 5.1_ OR _SECTION 5.2_ OF THIS AGREEMENT, (I) THE
COMPANY, THE COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES AND THE SOLE SHAREHOLDER MAKE NO OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED AND (II) EACH OF
THE COMPANY, THE COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES AND THE SOLE SHAREHOLDER EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY,
STATEMENT OR INFORMATION MADE OR COMMUNICATED (ORALLY OR IN WRITING)
TO PARENT OR MERGER SUBSIDIARY OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES,
OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, CONSULTANTS OR REPRESENTATIVES. THE
COMPANY AND PARENT AGREE THAT, TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW TO BE
EFFECTIVE, THE DISCLAIMERS OF CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
CONTAINED IN THIS _SECTION 12.7_ ARE "CONSPICUOUS" DISCLAIMERS FOR THE
PURPOSE OF ANY APPLICABLE LAW.
