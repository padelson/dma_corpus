any such audit, assessment or proceeding could result in an indemnification claim by any of the Parent Indemnified Parties. In the event that Parent proposes to compromise or settle any Tax claim, or consent or agree to any Tax liability, relating
to the Company or any Company Subsidiary that could result in an indemnity payment to the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;12.2(a)</U>, the Sole Shareholder shall have the right to review and provide its written consent to such
proposed compromise, settlement, consent or agreement. Parent shall not agree or consent to compromise or settle any issue or claim arising in any such audit, assessment or Proceeding on a basis that could result in liability of the Sole Shareholder

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">12.4 <B><U>Direct Claim Procedures</U></B>. If the Indemnified Party has a claim for indemnity
under <U>Section&nbsp;12.2</U> against the Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to give prompt notice in writing of such claim to the Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable
detail such claim and the basis for indemnification (taking into account the information then available to the Indemnified Party) and the calculation of Damages. The failure to promptly notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure prejudices the Indemnifying Party&#146;s ability to defend the claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within forty-five
(45)&nbsp;calendar days following its receipt of such notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party under this <U>Article XII</U>, such direct claim for indemnity specified by the Indemnified Party in such notice
shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party under this <U>Article XII</U> and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such liability to the Indemnified Party on demand, or in the case of any notice in which the amount
of the direct claim for indemnity (or any portion thereof) is estimated, on such later date when the amount of such direct claim (or such portion thereof) becomes finally determined. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">12.5 <B><U>Calculation of Damages</U></B>. The obligation of the Indemnifying Party to indemnify the Indemnified Party under
<U>Section&nbsp;12.2</U> is subject to the following limitations: </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(a) The amount of any Damages payable under <U>Section&nbsp;12.2</U>
by the Indemnifying Party shall be reduced by (i)&nbsp;any Tax benefits actually realized by the Indemnified Party on or prior to the date of the claim that result from or arise out of such Damages, net of any corresponding Tax costs incurred by
such party and (ii)&nbsp;any amounts recoverable by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to have responsibility. Each Indemnified Party shall pursue in good faith all claims available under such
third-party insurance coverage and from any Person alleged to have responsibility. If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Damages (which were not
earlier taken into account in calculating Damages), subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or out-of-pocket expense incurred
by the Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the amount actually received by the Indemnified Party. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under <U>Section&nbsp;12.2(a)</U> or <U>12.2(b</U>) for any consequential, punitive,
incidental, indirect, special or exemplary Damages (including lost profits, opportunity costs or damages based upon a multiple of earnings), whether based on contract, strict liability, other Applicable Law or otherwise and whether or not arising
from any other party&#146;s sole, joint or concurrent negligence, strict liability or other fault; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for such consequential, punitive, incidental or indirect or special
Damages (including lost profits) to the extent such consequential, punitive, incidental, indirect, special or exemplary Damages (including lost profits, opportunity costs or damages based upon a multiple of earnings) are recovered against an
Indemnified Party by a Person that is not an Indemnified Party or an Affiliate of such Indemnified Party. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(c) The Indemnified Party
shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate any Damages for which the Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this Agreement and shall use Reasonable Efforts to avoid any costs or expenses associated with such claim and, if such costs and
expenses cannot be avoided, to use Reasonable Efforts to minimize the amount thereof. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(d) Any indemnity payment under this Agreement
