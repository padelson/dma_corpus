the Company and each of its subsidiaries (A)&nbsp;has timely filed all Tax returns and reports required to be filed by it (after giving effect to any filing extension properly granted by a
Governmental Entity having authority to do so), and all such returns and reports are true, accurate and complete in all material respects, and (B)&nbsp;has paid (or the Company has paid on its
behalf) within the time and manner prescribed by law, all Taxes shown on such returns and reports as required to be paid by it. The most recent financial statements contained in the Company SEC
Documents reflect an adequate reserve for all material Taxes payable by the Company and each subsidiary for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the date of such financial statements. The
Company and each of its subsidiaries has established on its books and records reserves that are adequate for the payment of all material liabilities for Taxes accruing through the period covered by
such books and records and until the Effective Time, shall continue to establish and maintain reserves that are adequate for the payment of all material liabilities for Taxes accruing through the
Effective Time, assuming for these purposes the actual or deemed liquidation of the Company for federal income tax purposes as of such date. Since the beginning of the Initial REIT Year, the Company
has incurred no liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code, including without limitation any Tax arising from a prohibited transaction described in Section&nbsp;857(b)(6)
of the Code or from "redetermined rents, redetermined deductions or excess interest" described by Section&nbsp;857(b)(7) of the Code, or from the disallowance of a deduction for interest pursuant to
Section&nbsp;163(j) of the Code, and neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has incurred any material liability for Taxes other than in the ordinary course of business. No material unpaid
deficiencies for any Taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed against the Company or any of its subsidiaries, including claims by any taxing authority in a jurisdiction where the Company or any
of its subsidiaries does not file Tax returns but in which any of them is or may be subject to taxation, and no requests for waivers of any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes have been made
and no extensions of the time to assess or collect any
such Tax are pending and no such waiver remains in effect. As used in this Agreement, "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Taxes</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" or "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Tax</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"

election has not been terminated or revoked, and since its formation, Target OP has been classified for federal income tax purposes as a partnership pursuant to Section&nbsp;7701 of the Code (and
