 Section 1.8. _ Certificate of Limited Partnership and Partnership Agreement._ The Certificate of Limited Partnership of Target OP as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Certificate of Limited Partnership of the Surviving OP, which shall simultaneously be amended in accordance with applicable law so as to reflect the change in the Surviving OP\'s general partner and limited partners. Acquiror OP Partnership Agreement as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the partnership agreement of the Surviving OP, until duly amended in accordance with applicable law. 

   

 Section 1.9 _ Reservation of Right to Revise Structure._ Subject to this Section 1.9, at Parent\'s request, and with the Company\'s consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, the Mergers alternatively may be structured such that (a) the REIT Merger Sub is merged with and into the Company (with the Company as the surviving corporation) or, (b) another directly or indirectly wholly-owned entity of Parent, other than REIT Merger Sub is merged with the Company; or (c) the Target OP is merged with and into Acquiror OP (with the Acquiror OP as the surviving partnership) or, (d) another directly or indirectly wholly-owned entity of Parent, other than Acquiror OP is merged with Target OP.

 (a) At the Closing, Parent shall deposit with SunTrust Bank, Atlanta, Georgia, or such other bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and OP Units for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.3, cash representing the aggregate REIT Merger Consideration issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and the aggregate OP Merger Consideration issuable pursuant to Section 2.2(b) (such REIT Merger Consideration and OP Merger Consideration being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). 

  

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than two (2) business days thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate (or certificates) which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Company Stock Certificates_ ") (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Stock Certificate(s) (to the extent applicable) shall pass, only upon delivery of the Company Stock Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such certificates) (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent or the Exchange Agent reasonably may specify, together with a substitute Form W-9) and (ii) instructions for surrendering Company Stock Certificate(s) in exchange for the REIT Merger Consideration. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Company Stock Certificate in proper form for cancellation, together with a duly executed Letter of Transmittal, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check representing the REIT Merger Consideration that such Company Shareholder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(c), in all cases after giving effect to the payment of all required withholding Taxes. For shares of Company Common Stock that are held in book entry form, Parent shall establish procedures for the delivery of such Company Common Stock, which procedures shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company. The Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing (and notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement), no interest shall be paid or accrued in respect of any of the REIT Merger Consideration. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered on the stock transfer books and records of the Company, a check representing the REIT Merger Consideration that such holder of Company Common Stock is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(c), will be issued to such transferee only if a Company Stock Certificate held by such transferee is properly presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that all applicable stock transfer Taxes theretofore have been paid. Until surrendered in accordance with this Section 2.3 and as specified in 

     

the Letter of Transmittal, each Company Stock Certificate shall be deemed at
all times from and after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender, the REIT Merger Consideration. If any Company
Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Company Stock
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate, the
Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Company Stock Certificate, the REIT Merger Consideration that such holder of
Company Common Stock is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(c).

  

 (c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than two (2) business days thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each limited partner holding OP Units (the " _Limited Partners_ ") at the address set forth on Schedule 3.1(c)(i) to the Company Disclosure Schedule a certified check payable to such holder in the amount set forth opposite such holder\'s name on Schedule 3.1(c)(i) to the Company Disclosure Schedule; provided, however, that prior to the Effective Time such Limited Partner has acknowledged its record and beneficial ownership of the OP Units and indicated the address to which the OP Merger Consideration shall be sent. 

  

 (d) All REIT Merger Consideration paid upon surrender of Company Stock Certificates in accordance with this Article II and as specified in the Letter of Transmittal shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock represented thereby and, as of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books and records of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books and records of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company Stock Certificates are properly presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason (but otherwise in accordance with this Article II and as specified in the Letter of Transmittal), they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.3. 

  

 (e) At any time following the six-month anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any remaining portion of the Exchange Fund not theretofore distributed to former holders of shares of Company Common Stock or Limited Partners (including any interest received with respect thereto and other income resulting from investments thereof by the Exchange Agent, as directed by Parent), and such former holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) with respect to the REIT Merger Consideration or OP Merger Consideration, as the case may be, payable upon due surrender of their Company Stock Certificates or otherwise, without any interest thereon and less all required withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Company Stock Certificate for REIT Merger Consideration or a Limited Partner for OP Merger Consideration (or dividends or distributions in respect thereof) or cash from the Exchange Fund in each case delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

   

 (f) The Exchange Fund shall only be used to pay the REIT Merger Consideration and the OP Merger Consideration and shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest, proceeds and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent upon termination of the Exchange Fund in accordance with Section 2.3(e). If the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to satisfy fully all of the payment obligations to be made by the Exchange Agent hereunder, then Parent promptly shall, from time to time, deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to satisfy fully such payment obligations. 

     

 (g) Each of the Surviving Corporation, REIT Merger Sub and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the REIT Merger Consideration and the OP Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options (as defined below) or OP Units such Taxes and other amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and pursuant to the applicable provisions of state, local and foreign Tax laws. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, the Surviving Corporation, REIT Merger Sub, Acquiror OP, or Parent shall pay to the applicable taxing authority such deducted, withheld and paid amounts, which shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options, or Restricted Stock Grants as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction, withholding and payment was made by the Surviving Corporation, REIT Merger Sub, Acquiror OP or Parent. 

  

 Section 2.4. _ Certain Adjustments._ If after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time and to the extent permitted by this Agreement, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or outstanding OP Units shall be changed into a different number, class or series of shares or partnership units, as the case may be, by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization or combination, forward stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend or rights issued in respect of such stock, or any similar event shall occur (any such action, an " _Adjustment Event_ "), the REIT Merger Consideration and/or the OP Merger Consideration, as the case may be, shall be adjusted correspondingly to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock and OP Units the right to receive the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement immediately prior to such Adjustment Event and Parent\'s payment obligations likewise shall be correspondingly adjusted such that it shall be required to pay and deliver not more than the aggregate REIT Merger Consideration and OP Merger Consideration contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

  

Section 2.5. _ Stock Options and Restricted Stock Grants. _

  

  

 (a) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, not later than 20 days after the date hereof, from each holder of outstanding options (whether or not then exercisable or vested) to acquire Company Common Stock granted under the Company\'s 1993 Restricted Stock and Stock Option Plan, as amended, and all other plans, agreements and arrangements providing for equity-based compensation to any director, Employee, consultant or independent contractor of the Company or any of their subsidiaries as described in Schedule 2.5 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ " and collectively, the " _Company Stock Options_ "), an executed agreement substantially in the form described in Schedule 2.5 to the Company Disclosure Schedule (each, an " _Optionee Consent Letter_ "), in each case providing that (i) immediately prior to the Effective Time each Company Stock Option held by such holder shall become fully vested and immediately exercisable, (ii) at the Effective Time each then outstanding Company Stock Option shall at the Effective Time be cancelled and void, (iii) in consideration of such vesting and cancellation, immediately prior to the Closing each Company Stock Option shall thereupon represent for all purposes under the relevant Company Stock Plan and all grant and award instruments and agreements governing and evidencing such holder\'s Company Stock Option(s) only the right to receive from Rose Managers, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, (subject to Section 2.3(g) and Section 2.1(c)) such amount of cash equal to, for each Company Stock Option, the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Options held by such holder and (y) the excess (to the extent a positive number (i.e.where the REIT Merger Consideration is in excess of the applicable exercise price of the Company Stock Option) of the REIT Merger Consideration over the then applicable per share exercise price of each such Company Stock Option (such amount of cash being so paid in full settlement of and in consideration for cancellation of each such Company Stock Option being hereinafter referred to as the " _Option Consideration_ "), payable as 

   provided in Section 2.5(b), and (iv) from and after the Effective Time,
except as provided in this Section 2.5, such holder shall not have any rights
or benefits under any Company Stock Plan or Company Stock Option (or any
grant or award letter or agreement issued in respect thereof) to acquire any
securities of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
subsidiary of Parent and shall, by virtue of having effected such surrender,
cancellation and receipt of Option Consideration, have unconditionally and
irrevocably discharged and released Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and each of their respective subsidiaries, officers, directors and
affiliates from and against, and thereupon shall have permanently waived, all
rights and claims (fixed, contingent or otherwise) such holder may now or
hereafter have thereunder with respect to all Company Stock Plans and Company
Stock Options (and all grant and award instruments and agreements governing
and evidencing the same).

  

 (b) Immediately prior to the Closing, the Company shall, or shall cause Rose Managers, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, to pay to each holder of a Company Stock Option the Option Consideration (net of any applicable withholding tax as provided in Section 2.3(g)) in respect thereof. Until settled in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.5(b), each Company Stock Option shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent for all purposes only the right to receive from the Company, Rose Managers, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, or Parent, the Option Consideration. 

   

 (c) The Company promptly shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (including causing the Board of Directors of the Company or any compensation, stock option, corporate governance, special or other duly constituted committee thereof to take all such actions as are permitted by the Company Stock Plans) to implement the provisions of this Section 2.5 (including, without limitation, the delivery to all holders of Company Stock Options such letters, notices and disclosures informing such holders of the REIT Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and delivery of the form of Optionee Consent Letter contemplated by Section 2.5(a) above) and to ensure that in exchange for payment of the Option Consideration (i) from and after the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Stock Option nor any party to or participant in any of the Company Stock Plans shall have any right thereunder to acquire any equity securities of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary thereof and (ii) the Company Stock Plans and all Company Stock Options (and all grant and award letters and agreements issued in respect thereof) shall terminate and become void as of the Effective Time. The Company shall permit each holder of Company Stock Options to satisfy any withholding Tax and other payments in respect of such holder under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and pursuant to the applicable provisions of state, local and foreign Tax laws, by withholding such amount of cash otherwise payable to such holder pursuant to this Agreement as shall be equal in value to the amount of any such withholding Tax and other payments in respect of such holder. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of any grant or award agreement evidencing awards of Company Common Stock the vesting of which is subject to future forfeiture or attainment of performance measures (a " _Restricted Stock Grant_ "), all outstanding restricted Company Common Stock that is subject to a Restricted Stock Grant shall vest in full immediately prior to the Effective Time so as to no longer be subject to any forfeiture or to attainment of any performance measures and all such shares of Company Common Stock shall be considered outstanding Company Common Stock for all purposes of this Agreement, including receipt of the REIT Merger Consideration.

good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and the Company
Financial Advisor (or an independent financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation), that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a
Company Superior Proposal; it being hereby intended and agreed that the
Company shall not enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to

maximum amount that can be paid to the Recipient REIT without causing it to
fail to meet the requirements of Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code
determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income
described in Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ "),
as determined by outside counsel or independent accountants to the Recipient
REIT, and (ii) in the event the Recipient REIT receives a letter from outside
counsel (the " _Recipient REIT Break-Up Tax Opinion_ ") indicating that the
Recipient REIT has received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by
the Recipient REIT of the amount referred to in (A) above would either
constitute Qualifying Income as to the Recipient REIT or would be excluded
from the Recipient REIT\'s gross income for purposes of Section 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code (the " _REIT Requirements_ "), the amount referred to in
(A) above less the amount payable under clause (B)(i) above. In the event

amount referred to in (A) above and the amount actually paid to the Recipient
REIT pursuant to this subsection 5.4(c)) in escrow (the " _Escrowed Amount_
"), and shall not release any portion thereof to the Payor or Recipient REIT
unless and until the Payor receives any one or a combination of the following:
(i) a letter(s) from the Recipient REIT\'s outside counsel or independent
accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that time to
Recipient REIT without causing the Recipient REIT to fail to meet the REIT
Requirements for any relevant taxable year, together with an IRS ruling or
opinion of tax counsel to the effect that such payment should not be treated
as included in the income of the Recipient REIT for any prior taxable year,
in which event such maximum amount shall be paid to the Recipient REIT, or
(ii) a Recipient REIT Break-Up Tax Opinion indicating that the Recipient
REIT\'s receipt of the Escrowed Amount would satisfy, in whole or in part, the
REIT Requirements, in which event such portion of the Escrowed Amount shall be
released and paid to the Recipient REIT. The Payor\'s obligation to pay any
unpaid portion of the Escrowed Amount (provided the Payor has otherwise
complied with its obligations under this provision) shall terminate and
any Escrowed Amount still held in such escrow shall be released to the Payor
on the date that is five years from the date that any amount described in
subsection 5.4(b) first becomes due under this Agreement.

Dear :

  

  

Reference is made to (i) the Agreement by and among CNL Hospitality
Properties, Inc. ("CNL"), CNL Rose Acquisition Corp., RFS Hotel Investors,
Inc. ("RFS"), CNL Rose Acquisition OP, LP and RFS Partnership, L.P. (the
"Merger Agreement") pursuant to which, CNL will acquire Rose by way of merger
(the "Merger"); and (ii) those several management agreements by and among
Flagstone and the subsidiaries of RFS substantially in the form of Exhibit A
hereto (collectively, the "Management Agreements"). This letter agreement (the
"Agreement") is being delivered pursuant to Section 6.2(h) of the Merger
Agreement.

  

1\. _Representations._

  

  

 Flagstone represents and warrants to CNL on the date hereof and as of the closing date of the Merger as follows: 

  

  

 (a) Flagstone is a limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has the requisite limited liability company power and requisite authority to carry on its business as presently being conducted. Flagstone is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Flagstone. Flagstone has all requisite limited liability company power and authority to enter into this Agreement. 

  

 (b) Flagstone is and has been, in compliance in all material respects with all applicable statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances, permits, rules, writs, judgments, orders, decrees or arbitration awards of any governmental entity applicable to Flagstone (collectively, "Permits"). Flagstone is in compliance in all material respects with the terms of all Permits and all Permits are in full force and effect and no suspension, modification or revocation of any of them is pending or, to the knowledge of Flagstone, threatened nor, to the knowledge of Flagstone, do grounds exist for any such action. For purposes of this letter agreement, "knowledge" means the knowledge (after reasonable inquiry and investigation) of Flagstone\'s current Chief Administrative Officer. 

  

 (c) The balance sheet, income statement and statement of cash flows of Flagstone for the twelve and three month periods ended December 31, 2002 and March 31, 2003, respectively, in the form attached hereto was prepared in accordance with the Uniform Systems of Accounts for the Lodging Industry, 9th Edition (1996). 

  

    
  

 (d) Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedules to the Merger Agreement and as would not have a material adverse effect on Flagstone: 

    

 (i) No event has occurred, and to the knowledge of Flagstone, there exists no condition or set of circumstances (including without limitation the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement) in connection with which Flagstone could be subject to any liability with respect to any Benefit Plan (except for benefit claims and funding obligations payable in the ordinary course) under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or any other applicable law. There are no funded benefit obligations under any of the Benefit Plans for which contributions have not been made or accrued and there are no unfunded benefit obligations under any Benefit Plans which have not been accounted for by reserves, or otherwise properly footnoted, in accordance with generally accepted accounting procedures, on Flagstone\'s financial statements. Neither RFS nor any subsidiary or affiliate of RFS has any direct or indirect, actual or contingent liability with respect to any of the Benefit Plans, whether pursuant to the Management Agreements or otherwise. 

  

 (ii) For purposes of clause (i) of this Section 1(d), the term "Benefit Plan" means any pension, stock option, stock purchase, benefit, welfare, profit sharing, retirement, disability, vacation, severance, hospitalization, insurance, incentive, deferred compensation or other similar fringe benefit plan, fund, program, arrangement, whether written or oral, that is maintained for the benefit of, or relates to any or all current or former employees of Flagstone or any entity related to Flagstone under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code. 

    

 (e) Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedules to the Merger Agreement and as would not have a material adverse effect on Flagstone: 

    

 (i) Flagstone is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement or other current labor agreement with any labor union or organization, and, to Flagstone\'s knowledge, there is no question involving current union representation of its employees, nor to Flagstone\'s knowledge is any activity or proceeding of any labor organization (or representative thereof) or employee group (or representative thereof) underway to organize any such employees. 

  

 (ii) There is no unfair labor practice charge or grievance arising out of a collective bargaining agreement or other grievance procedure pending, or, to Flagstone\'s knowledge, threatened against Flagstone. 

  

 (iii) There is no complaint, lawsuit or proceeding in any forum by or on behalf of any present or former employee, any applicant for employment or any class of the foregoing, alleging breach of any express or implied contract of employment, any law or regulation governing employment or the termination thereof or other discriminatory, wrongful or tortious conduct in connection with the employment relationship pending, or, to Flagstone\'s knowledge, threatened against Flagstone. 

  

 (iv) There is no strike, slowdown, work stoppage or lockout pending, or to Flagstone\'s knowledge, threatened against or involving Flagstone. 

  

 (v) Flagstone is in material compliance with all applicable laws in respect of employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, wages, hours of work and occupational safety and health. 

  

 (vi) There is no proceeding, claim, suit, action or governmental investigation pending, or to Flagstone\'s knowledge, threatened with respect to which any current or former officer, director, employee or agent of Flagstone is claiming indemnification from Flagstone. 

   

     
  

 (vii) No employment agreement or other agreement or arrangement exists that requires any severance payment, change in control payment or other post-employment liability or obligation with respect to any current or former officer, director, employee or agent of Flagstone. 

    

 (f) Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedules to the Merger Agreement, there is no material pending or threatened litigation, action, suit, proceeding, investigation or arbitration with respect to Flagstone. 

  

 (g) No event of default (whether with respect to RFS or Flagstone) exists under any Management Agreement and except as otherwise may arise in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice, no amount is due and owing by RFS to Flagstone thereunder. To Flagstone\'s knowledge, no event exists which, with the giving of notice, the passage of time, or both, would result in Rose being in default under any Management Agreement. Each Management Agreement is in full force and effect and, assuming the due enforceability as to RFS, is duly enforceable in accordance with its terms. 

   

2\. _Covenants._

  

 (a) Immediately following consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement: 

    

 (i) the fee arrangement pursuant to the Management Agreements will be substantially in accordance with the description on Exhibit B hereto, retroactive to January 1, 2003; and 

  

 (ii) the Operating Agreement of Flagstone will be amended substantially in accordance with Exhibit C hereto. 

    

 (b) From the date hereof through the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) Flagstone will promptly advise CNL orally and in writing to the extent it has knowledge of any representation or warranty made by it contained in this letter becoming untrue or inaccurate. 

  

 (c) Flagstone will afford CNL and its officers, counsel, financial advisors and lenders, reasonable access during normal business hours during the period from the date hereof through the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), to its books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and all other information relating to the hotel properties that are the subject of the Management Agreement, as CNL may reasonably request. 

  

 (d) In connection with the above, CNL will hold, and will cause its consultants and advisors to hold, in strict confidence, all documents and information concerning Flagstone furnished to CNL in connection with this letter; provided, however, that CNL may disclose such document or information: (i) that is already public knowledge prior to such disclosure or (ii) to the extent that, in the reasonable opinion of CNL\'s legal counsel, such disclosure is required by law but only after CNL has given prior written notice of the disclosure to Flagstone, to the extent reasonably possible. 

  

3\. _Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties._

  

None of the representations and warranties in this Agreement shall survive
the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement).

   

4\. _Miscellaneous._

  

  

 It is the intent of the parties that the provisions contained in this letter agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with, the internal substantive and procedural laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to such State\'s conflicts of law principles, and each of CNL and Flagstone consent to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any Federal or state court located in Delaware. 

   If the foregoing is acceptable, kindly confirm your acceptance of the terms hereof by executing the duplicate original contained herein, and returning same to our attention.
