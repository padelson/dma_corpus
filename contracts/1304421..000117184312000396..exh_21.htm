AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  

  

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of February 5, 2012 (as amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, and together with all
exhibits and schedules hereto, this "Agreement"), is entered into by and among
Consolidated Communications Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"),
SureWest Communications, a California corporation (the "Company"), WH
Acquisition Corp., a California corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent ("Merger Sub I"), and WH Acquisition II Corp., a California corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub II" and together with
Merger Sub I, the "Merger Subs").

  

  

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of each of the Company, Parent,
and (upon their formation) Merger Subs have approved the acquisition of the
Company by Parent through the statutory merger of Merger Sub I with and into
the Company, pursuant to which the Company would become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (the "First Merger"), and, as part of the same overall
transaction, the surviving entity of the First Merger would merge with and
into Merger Sub II (the "Second Merger," and together with the First Merger,
the "Mergers") upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement;

  

  

WHEREAS, it is intended that the Mergers are integrated steps in the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement and will together qualify as a tax-
free reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the Code;

  

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has (a) determined that the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby are advisable and in

1.1 The Mergers. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, in accordance the California General Corporation Law ("CGCL"), at
the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined), Merger Sub I shall merge with and
into the Company. The Company shall be the surviving corporation (hereinafter
sometimes called the "First-Step Surviving Company") of the First Merger, and
shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of
California. Upon consummation of the First Merger, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub I shall terminate. At the Second Effective Time (as
defined below), Parent shall cause the First-Step Surviving Company to merge
with and into Merger Sub II in accordance with California Law, whereupon the
separate corporate existence of the First-Step Surviving Company shall cease,
and Merger Sub II shall be the surviving corporation. The surviving
corporation after the Second Merger is sometimes referred to hereinafter as
the "Surviving Company." The parties to this Agreement agree to treat the
First Merger and the Second Merger as integrated steps in the single
transaction contemplated by this Agreement and for any and all federal and
state income tax reporting purposes shall report the transaction as a single
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code. The
parties to this Agreement hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g).

CGCL, which shall be duly executed by the Company and Merger Sub I and filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of California (the "California
Secretary") on the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) or as soon thereafter
as practicable. As used herein, the term "Effective Time" shall mean the date

of Merger and otherwise in accordance with applicable law.

  

  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, but in all cases within one (1)
Business Day thereafter, Parent shall cause the Second Merger to be
consummated by filing an agreement of merger, together with such other
certificates satisfying the applicable requirements of the CGCL, which shall
be duly executed by the First-Step Surviving Company and Merger Sub II with
the California Secretary, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
CGCL (the time of the filing of such agreement of merger with respect to the
Second Merger, or the time of effectiveness thereof that is specified therein,
if different, shall be referred to herein as the "Second Effective Time").

  

  

1.3 Effects of the Mergers. At and after the Effective Time, the First Merger
shall have the effects and consequences set forth in this Agreement and in
Section 1107 of the CGCL. At and after the Second Effective Time, the Second
Merger shall have the effects and consequences set forth in the applicable
agreement of merger and in Section 1107 of the CGCL.

this Agreement, a "Business Day" shall mean any day that is not a Saturday, a
Sunday or other day on which the office of the California Secretary is closed.

  

  

1.5 Articles of Incorporation. The Articles of Incorporation of the Company,
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall at the Effective
Time, be amended and restated to read as set forth in Exhibit A hereto and as
so amended and restated shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the First-
Step Surviving Company, until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable
law and such Articles of Incorporation. The articles of incorporation of
Merger Sub II, as in effect immediately prior to the Second Effective Time,
shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Company at the Second
Effective Time.

  

  

1.6 Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the First-Step Surviving
Company shall be amended and restated in their entirety to be identical to the
bylaws of Merger Sub I, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law and such bylaws.
The bylaws of Merger Sub II, as in effect immediately prior to the Second
Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Company at the Second

2. EFFECT OF THE FIRST MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

  

  

2.1 Conversion of Company Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the First Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or
the holder of any of the shares of Company Common Stock, Parent Stock (as
defined below) or any capital stock of either Merger Sub:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-3-  

  

 

 

 

  

(a) All shares of common stock, without par value, of the Company (the
"Company Common Stock") held in treasury or owned directly by the Company, any
Subsidiary of the Company, Merger Subs or Parent (other than shares in trust
accounts, managed accounts and the like or shares held in satisfaction of a
debt previously contracted) shall be cancelled and retired and shall not
represent capital stock of the Surviving Company and shall not be exchanged
for the Merger Consideration (as defined below). Shares of Company Common
Stock that are canceled and retired pursuant to this Section 2.1(a) are
hereinafter referred to as the "Excluded Shares"; and

  

  

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares and
Dissenting Shares (as defined below)) issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become the right to receive
the following consideration:

  

  

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to
receive cash (a "Cash Election") has been properly made and not revoked or
lost pursuant to Section 2.2(c) (each a "Cash Electing Company Share") shall
(subject to Section 2.2(d)) be converted into the right to receive $23.00 in
cash without interest (such per share amount is hereinafter referred to as the
"Cash Consideration").

  

  

(ii) Each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to
receive stock consideration (a "Stock Election") has been properly made and
not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.2(c) (each a "Stock Electing Company
Share") shall (subject to Section 2.2(d)) be converted into the right to
receive the number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (the "Parent Stock")
determined by dividing (A) $23.00 by (B) the Parent Trading Price (as defined
in Section 2.1(b)(iv) below) (such quotient, the "Exchange Ratio"), subject to
adjustment in accordance with Section 2.1(d) (such per share amount, together
with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock to be paid pursuant
to Section 2.1(c), is hereinafter referred to as the "Parent Stock
Consideration"); provided, however, that (x) if the number determined by
dividing $23.00 by the Parent Trading Price (as defined below) is less than or
equal to 1.03896, the Exchange Ratio shall be 1.03896 and (y) if the number
determined by dividing $23.00 by the Parent Trading Price is greater than or
equal to 1.40565, the Exchange Ratio shall be 1.40565.

  

  

(iii) Each share of Company Common Stock that is not (x) an Excluded Share or
(y) a share of Company Common Stock with respect to which a Cash Election or a
Stock Election has been properly made and not revoked or lost pursuant to
Section 2.2(c) (each, a "Non-Electing Company Share") shall be converted into
the right to receive the Cash Consideration or the Parent Stock Consideration,
as determined pursuant to Section 2.3.

  

  

(iv) As used in this Agreement, the term "Parent Trading Price" means the
average closing price of a share of Parent Stock, as reported on the NASDAQ
Global Select Market, for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on
the second trading day preceding the Closing Date.

  

  

Effective as of the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded
Shares) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of certificates or evidence
of shares in book-entry form which immediately prior to the Effective Time
evidenced shares of Company Common Stock (each a "Certificate") shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with
Section 3.4. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Merger Consideration"
with respect to a given share of Company Common Stock shall mean either the
Cash Consideration (with respect to a share of Company Common Stock
representing the right to receive the Cash Consideration) or the Parent Stock
Consideration (with respect to a share of Company Common Stock representing
the right to receive the Parent Stock Consideration).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-4-  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) No Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Parent Stock shall be issued
in respect of shares of Company Common Stock that are to be converted in the
Mergers into the right to receive shares of Parent Stock. Each holder of a
Certificate (other than holders of Certificates representing Excluded Shares)
shall be entitled to receive in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Stock
to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled pursuant to Sections
2.1(b) and 2.3 an amount in cash (without interest), rounded to the nearest
whole cent, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional
share of Parent Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (after
taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder
immediately prior to the Effective Time, such holder's unrevoked Cash
Elections and Stock Elections and the provisions of Section 2.3) by (ii) the
Parent Trading Price.

  

  

(d) Adjustments. If, on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time, Parent splits, combines into a smaller number of shares, or
issues by reclassification any shares of Parent Stock, then the Parent Stock
Consideration and any dependent items shall be appropriately adjusted to
provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action, and as so adjusted shall,
from and after the date of such event, be the Parent Stock Consideration or
other dependent item, as applicable, subject to further adjustment in
accordance with this sentence.

  

  

2.2 Election Procedures.

  

  

(a) Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall designate and
appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as
exchange agent hereunder (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging
Certificates.

  

  

(b) Parent shall prepare and file as an exhibit to the Parent Registration
Statement (as hereinafter defined) a form of election, and other appropriate
and customary transmittal materials, in such form and containing such
provisions as Parent and the Company shall mutually agree (collectively, the
"Form of Election"). The Form of Election shall permit each Person who, at or
prior to the Election Deadline (as defined below), is a record holder (or, in
the case of nominee record holders, the beneficial owner, through proper
instructions and documentation) of any share of Company Common Stock (other
than Excluded Shares) to specify (i) the number of such holder's shares of
Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder makes a Cash Election
and/or (ii) the number of such holder's shares of Company Common Stock with
respect to which such holder makes a Stock Election. The Form of Election
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the completed Form
of Election and any Certificates to the Exchange Agent. The Company shall mail
the Form of Election to all Persons who are record holders of shares of
Company Common Stock as of the record date for the Company Shareholder Meeting
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Form of Election
available to all Persons who become holders of shares of Company Common Stock
during the period between the record date for the Company Shareholder Meeting
and the Election Deadline. As used in this Agreement, "Election Deadline"
means 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on the date that is two (2) Business Days
immediately preceding the Closing Date (or on such other date as the parties
hereto mutually agree).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-5-  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) Any such election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have received at its designated office, by the Election Deadline, a Form
of Election properly completed and signed and accompanied by Certificates
representing the shares of Company Common Stock to which such Form of Election
relates (or by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such Certificates as
set forth in such Form of Election from a firm that is an "eligible guarantor
institution" (as defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Exchange Act); provided,
that such Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time
set forth in such guarantee of delivery). Any share of Company Common Stock
(other than Excluded Shares) with respect to which a proper Cash Election or
Stock Election has not been made as aforesaid shall be deemed to be a Non-
Electing Company Share. After a Cash Election or a Stock Election is properly
made with respect to any share of Company Common Stock, no further
registration of transfers of such share shall be made on the stock transfer
books of the Company, unless and until such Cash Election or Stock Election is
properly revoked.

  

  

(d) Parent and the Company shall publicly announce the anticipated date of the
Election Deadline at least five (5) Business Days prior to the anticipated
Closing Date. If the Closing Date is delayed to a subsequent date, the
Election Deadline shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and Parent
and the Company shall promptly announce any such delay and, when determined,
the rescheduled Election Deadline.

  

  

(e) Any Cash Election or Stock Election may be revoked with respect to all or
any portion of the shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto (but only in
whole share amounts) by the holder who submitted the applicable Form of
Election by such holder submitting to the Exchange Agent a written notice of
such revocation received by the Exchange Agent at or prior to the Election
Deadline. In addition, all Cash Elections and Stock Elections shall
automatically be revoked if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
Section 9. If a Cash Election or Stock Election is revoked with respect to any
shares of Company Common Stock, the Certificates representing such shares
shall be promptly returned to the holder that submitted the same to the
Exchange Agent, except to the extent (if any) a subsequent Cash Election
and/or Stock Election is properly made with respect to any or all of the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate.

  

  

(f) The good faith determination of the Exchange Agent (or the joint
determination of Parent and the Company, in the event that the Exchange Agent
declines to make any such determination) shall be conclusive and binding as to
whether or not Cash Elections and Stock Elections shall have been properly
made or revoked pursuant to this Section 2.2 and as to when Cash Elections,
Stock Elections and revocations were received by the Exchange Agent. The
Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to disregard immaterial
defects in the Forms of Election. The Exchange Agent (or Parent and the
Company jointly, in the event that the Exchange Agent declines to make the
following computations) shall also make all computations as to the proration
contemplated by Section 2.3, and absent manifest error such computations shall
be conclusive and binding on Parent, the Company and all holders of Company
Common Stock. The Exchange Agent may, with the written agreement of Parent
after Parent's reasonable consultation with the Company, make any rules that
are consistent with this Section 2.2 for the implementation of the Cash
Elections and Stock Elections provided for in this Agreement and shall be
necessary or desirable to effect the Cash Elections and Stock Elections.

2.3 Proration. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary:

  

  

(a) With respect to all shares of Company Common Stock (other than the
Excluded Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time:

  

  

(i) fifty percent (50%) of the sum of (x) the shares of Company Common Stock
and (y) that number of shares equal to the aggregate Equity Award
Consideration (as defined below) divided by the Cash Consideration (the
"Equity Award Equivalent Shares") (such number of shares, the "Cash Conversion
Number"), shall be converted into the right to receive an amount per share
equal to the Cash Consideration; and

  

  

(ii) the remainder of the shares of Company Common Stock shall be converted
into the right to receive the Parent Stock Consideration per share.

  

  

(b) If the aggregate number of Cash Electing Company Shares plus the Equity
Award Equivalent Shares (such number of shares, the "Cash Election Number")
equals or exceeds the Cash Conversion Number, then:

  

  

(i) all Stock Electing Company Shares and all Non-Electing Company Shares
shall be converted into the right to receive the Parent Stock Consideration
per share; and

  

  

(ii) the number of Cash Electing Company Shares of each shareholder of the
Company that shall be converted into the right to receive an amount per share
equal to the Cash Consideration shall be equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) the number of Cash Electing Company Shares of such shareholder
by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash Conversion Number and
the denominator of which is the Cash Election Number, and the remaining number
of such holder's Cash Electing Company Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Parent Stock Consideration per share.

  

  

(c) If the Cash Election Number is less than the Cash Conversion Number (such
difference between the Cash Election Number and the Cash Conversion Number,
the "Shortfall Number"), then:

  

  

(i) all Cash Electing Company Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive an amount per share equal to the Cash Consideration; and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-7-  

  

 

 

 

  

(ii) the Stock Electing Company Shares and the Non-Electing Company Shares
shall be treated in the following manner:

  

  

(1) if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the aggregate number of
Non-Electing Company Shares, then (A) all Stock Electing Company Shares shall
be converted into the right to receive the Parent Stock Consideration per
share and (B) the number of Non-Electing Company Shares of each shareholder of
the Company that shall be converted into the right to receive an amount per
share equal to the Cash Consideration shall be equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (1) the number of Non-Electing Company Shares of such
shareholder by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number
and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of Non-Electing Company
Shares, and the remaining number of such holder's Non-Electing Company Shares
shall be converted into the right to receive the Parent Stock Consideration
per share; or

  

  

(2) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the aggregate number of Non-Electing
Company Shares, then (A) all Non-Electing Company Shares shall be converted
into the right to receive an amount per share equal to the Cash Consideration
and (B) the number of Stock Electing Company Shares of each shareholder of the
Company that shall be converted into the right to receive an amount per share
equal to the Cash Consideration shall be equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (1) the number of Stock Electing Company Shares of such
shareholder by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which
the Shortfall Number exceeds the aggregate number of Non-Electing Company
Shares and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of Stock Electing
Company Shares, and the remaining number of such holder's Stock Electing
Company Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Parent Stock
Consideration per share.

  

  

2.4 Consideration Adjustment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Cash
Conversion Number shall be reduced to the extent necessary so that the
aggregate fair market value of the Parent Stock (based on the closing price of
Parent Stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the trading day
immediately preceding the Closing Date) received by the holders of Company
Common Stock in exchange for their Company Common Stock in the First Merger
shall be equal to forty-two percent (42%) of the aggregate amount of cash plus
the fair market value of the Parent Stock (based on the closing price of
Parent Stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the trading day
immediately preceding the Closing Date) received by the holders of Company
Common Stock in exchange for their Company Common Stock in the First Merger.
To assure that the holders of Company Common Stock receive equivalent value of
Parent Stock in consideration for the reduction of the Cash Conversion Number,
for each share by which the Cash Conversion Number is reduced additional
Parent Stock shall be paid as part of the Parent Stock Consideration (in
addition to the number of shares of Parent Stock received through the Exchange
Ratio with respect to such share) so that the aggregate fair market value of
the Parent Stock (based on the closing price of Parent common stock as
reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the trading day immediately
preceding the Closing Date) received with respect to such share is equal to
the Cash Consideration.

  

  

2.5 Effect on Capital Stock of Merger Sub I. At and after the Effective Time,
each share of common stock, without par value, of Merger Sub I issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one (1) fully paid share of common stock, without par value, of the
First-Step Surviving Company and constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the First-Step Surviving Company and shall not be effected by
the First Merger.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-8-  

  

 

 

 

  

2.6 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, in the event that the applicable requirements of Section 1300(b) of
the CGCL have been satisfied, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a
shareholder (the "Dissenting Shareholders") who (a) did not vote such
shareholder's shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the Mergers (or did
not consent thereto in writing, if approval the Mergers is obtained by written
consent), (b) is entitled to demand and properly demand that the Company
purchase such shares at their fair market value in accordance with Section
1301 of the CGCL, (c) has submitted such shares for endorsement in accordance
with Section 1302 of the CGCL and (d) has not otherwise failed to perfect or
effectively withdrawn or lost such right to require the Company to so purchase
such shares, shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (the "Dissenting Shares"), but instead such
Dissenting Shareholder shall be entitled to have the Dissenting Shares
purchased by the Company for cash at the fair market value thereof as agreed
upon or determined in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 13 of the CGCL
(and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
such Dissenting Shareholder shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to have the Dissenting Shares purchased by the
Company in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 13 of the CGCL), unless
and until such Dissenting Shareholder shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost such right to require the Company to so
purchase the Dissenting Shares. If any Dissenting Shareholder shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such
holder's shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as if they
had been converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as
of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each such share of Company
Common Stock, in accordance with Section 2.1(b), without any interest thereon.
The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands
pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CGCL, attempted withdrawals of such demands and
any other instruments served pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CGCL and received
by the Company relating to a shareholder's demand that the Company purchase
shares of Company Common Stock, and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any
payment with respect to, or settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such
demand for purchase and payment.

  

  

2.7 Treatment of Options and Other Stock-Based Awards.

  

  

(a) As of the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock or other right to purchase Company Common Stock under any Company Stock
Plan (each a "Company Option"), to the extent it is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior thereto, shall become fully vested as of the
Effective Time and shall by virtue of the Mergers and without any action on
the part of any holder of any Company Option be automatically cancelled and
the holder thereof will receive, as soon as reasonably practicable following
the Effective Time a cash payment (without interest) with respect thereto
equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Cash Consideration over
the exercise price per share of such Company Option and (ii) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Option
(collectively, the "Option Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all
Company Options, whether or not vested or exercisable, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a
Company Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Option Consideration; provided that, if the exercise
price of any such Company Option is equal or greater than the Cash
Consideration, such Company Option shall be cancelled without any payment
being made in respect thereof. The Option Consideration shall in all cases be
paid in cash and shall not be subject to the proration contemplated by Section
2.3.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-9-  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) As of the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit granted under any
Company Stock Plan (each a "Company RSU") which is outstanding immediately
prior thereto shall become fully vested as of the Effective Time. Each Company
RSU that is not subject to Section 409A of the Code shall by virtue of the
Mergers and without any action on the part of any holder of any Company RSU be
automatically cancelled, and the holder thereof will receive as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, a cash payment (without
interest) with respect thereto equal to the product of (i) the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU and (ii)
the Cash Consideration (collectively, the "RSU Consideration"). Each Company
RSU that is subject to Section 409A of the Code shall vest as described in
this Section 2.7(b) but will be settled in cash pursuant to the timing terms
of the applicable award agreement and, therefore, the holder thereof will
receive the RSU Consideration at the time prescribed by the applicable award
agreement. As of the Effective Time, all Company RSUs that are not subject to
Section 409A of the Code and which are outstanding immediately prior thereto,
whether or not vested, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
cease to exist, and each holder of a Company RSU shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the RSU
Consideration. As of the Effective Time, all Company RSUs that are subject to
Section 409A of the Code and which are outstanding immediately prior thereto
shall be fully vested as set forth above and shall remain outstanding to the
extent provided in the applicable award agreement until such time as the RSU
Consideration is distributed to the holder thereof. The RSU Consideration
shall in all cases be paid in cash and shall not be subject to the proration
contemplated by Section 2.3.

  

  

(c) As of the Effective Time, each restricted stock award granted under any
Company Stock Plan (each a "Company RSA", and together with the Company
Options and the Company RSUs, the "Company Equity Awards")) which is
outstanding and unvested immediately prior thereto shall become fully vested
as of the Effective Time and shall by virtue of the Mergers and without any
action on the part of any holder of any Company RSA be automatically cancelled
and the holder thereof will receive as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Effective Time a cash payment (without interest) with respect
thereto equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Company RSA and (ii) the Cash Consideration
(collectively, the "RSA Consideration", and, together with the Option
Consideration and the RSU Consideration, the "Equity Award Consideration"). As
of the Effective Time, all unvested Company RSAs shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a
Company RSA shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the RSA Consideration. The RSA Consideration shall in all

Certificate in exchange for the total amount of Merger Consideration that such
Non-Electing Company Holder is entitled to receive in exchange for such

Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Stock to
be paid pursuant to Section 2.1(c)), if any, into which such holder's shares
of Company Common Stock represented by such holder's properly surrendered
Certificates were converted in accordance with Section 2, plus (B) any cash

representing the number of whole shares of Parent Stock, if any, into which

check in an amount of U.S. dollars (after giving effect to any required
withholdings pursuant to Section 3.7) equal to (A) the amount of cash
(consisting of the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of a fractional share
of Parent Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1(c)), if any, into which
such holder's shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holder's
properly surrendered Certificates were converted in accordance with Section 2,
plus (B) any cash dividends and other distributions that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to Section 3.3.

  

  

3.3 Dividends and Distributions. No dividends or other distributions with
respect to shares of Parent Stock shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate until such Certificate is surrendered as provided in
this Section 3. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following such
surrender, there shall be paid, without interest, to the record holder of the
shares of Parent Stock issued in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock
represented immediately prior to the Effective Time by such Certificate (i)
when any payment or distribution of a certificate representing any share(s) of
Parent Stock is made to such holder pursuant to Section 3.2(b) or (c), all
dividends and other distributions payable in respect of such Parent Stock with
a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the
date of such surrender and not previously paid and (ii) on the appropriate
payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to
such Parent Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender. For purposes

3.4 Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. After the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall
be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on
the records of the Company. After the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration and such dividends and
other distributions on or in respect of Parent Stock as provided herein or as
otherwise provided by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Company for any reason, they shall
be canceled and exchanged as provided in Section 2.

  

  

3.5 Termination of Fund; No Liability. At any time following twelve (12)

Exchange Agent to deliver to Parent (i) certificates representing shares of
Parent Stock and (ii) cash held by the Exchange Agent for payment of Cash
Consideration and cash payments in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock,
in each case, not delivered to holders of Certificates. Thereafter, holders of
Certificates shall be entitled to look only to Parent, which shall thereafter
act as the Exchange Agent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws), as general creditors of Parent with respect to the delivery of
the Merger Consideration (including payment of cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Stock). None of Parent, the Surviving Company and the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person for any Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

  

  

3.6 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit
attesting to that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if requested by Parent or the Surviving Company, the
delivery by such Person of a bond (in such amount as Parent or the Surviving
Company may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Company on account of the
alleged loss, theft or destruction of such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a
certificate representing shares of Parent Stock and/or deliver a check for
Cash Consideration, and pay the cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent
Stock to which such holder is entitled, which constitute the total amount of
Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of such Certificate as determined
in accordance with Section 2.

  

  

3.7 Withholding Taxes. Parent or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of Company
Common Stock such amounts as Parent, or any affiliate (as defined under the
Exchange Act (an "Affiliate")) thereof, or the Exchange Agent are required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any applicable
provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent
that such amounts are properly withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent and
paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts will be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding
were made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.

  

  

3.8 Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. Without limiting the other provisions of
the Agreement, in the event that the Company changes the number of shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer
tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger
Consideration and the Equity Award Consideration shall be equitably adjusted
to reflect such change.

which it is organized (in the case of the good standing, to the extent such
jurisdiction recognizes such concept), except, in the case of the
Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good

its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business in each
jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of
its properties makes such qualification necessary, other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed, would not

in this Agreement, the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" means (i) a
material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial
condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) a
material adverse effect on the Company's ability to consummate the

determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred, there

arising in connection with (A) any adverse change, effect, event or
occurrence, state of facts or developments to the extent the public
announcement or the pendency of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or any actions required to be taken (or refrained from
being taken) in compliance herewith or otherwise with the consent of the other
party hereto, including the impact thereof on the relationships of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries with customers, suppliers, distributors,

the transactions contemplated hereby, (B) any failure by the Company to meet
any projections or forecasts for any period ending (or for which revenues or
earnings are released) on or after the date hereof, (C) any change in federal,
state, non-U.S. or local law, regulations, policies or procedures, or
interpretations thereof, generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") or
regulatory accounting requirements applicable or potentially applicable to the
industries in which the Company or its Subsidiaries operate, (D) changes
generally affecting the industries in which the Company or its Subsidiaries
operate that are not specifically related to the Company and its Subsidiaries
and do not have a materially disproportionate adverse effect on the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (E) changes in economic conditions
(including changes in the prevailing interest rates) in the United States, in
any region thereof, or in any non-U.S. or global economy or (F) any attack on,
or by, outbreak or escalation of hostilities or acts of terrorism involving,
the United States, or any declaration of war by the United States Congress or
any hurricane or other natural disaster. As used herein, "Subsidiary" means,

limited liability company or any other entity that is consolidated with such
Person for financial reporting purposes.

material respects of all meetings and other material corporate actions held or

Company or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise
receive any shares of the Company capital stock (including any rights plan or
agreement). Section 4.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
true, complete and correct list of the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of each stock option or subject to
each restricted stock award or restricted stock unit granted under the Company
Stock Plans that was outstanding as of the Capitalization Date and the

Company has not (i) issued or repurchased any shares of its capital stock or
any securities convertible into or exercisable for any shares of its capital
stock, other than upon the exercise of employee stock options granted prior to
such date and disclosed in this Section 4.2(a) or pursuant to the surrender of
shares to the Company or the withholding of shares by the Company to cover tax
withholding obligations under the Company Stock Plans, or (ii) issued or
awarded any options, restricted shares or other equity-based awards under the
Company Stock Plans.

jurisdiction of organization, authorized and outstanding shares of capital
stock and record and beneficial owners of such capital stock for each
Subsidiary of the Company. Except as set forth in Section 4.2(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
own, directly or indirectly, any equity or similar interest in, or any
interest convertible into or exchangeable for, any equity or similar interest
in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other similar business
association or entity (other than its wholly owned Subsidiaries), with respect
to which securities the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has invested (and
currently owns) or is required to invest $2,000,000 or more. Except as set
forth in Section 4.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company owns,
directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock of or all other equity interests in each of the Company's Subsidiaries
free and clear of any liens, charges, encumbrances, adverse rights or claims
and security interests whatsoever ("Liens"), and all of such shares are duly
authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership
thereof. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has or is bound by
any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or
agreements of any character calling for the purchase, repurchase, sale,
redemption or issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other equity
security of any Subsidiary of the Company or any securities representing the
right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any
other equity security of any such Subsidiary.

  

  

4.3 Authority; No Violation.

  

  

(a) The Company has full corporate power and corporate authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and the Agreement of Merger and, subject to receipt
of the Company Required Vote (as hereinafter defined), to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The Board of Directors of the
Company (the "Company Board") at a duly held meeting has (i) determined that
this Agreement, the Agreement of Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, including the Mergers, are in the best interests of the
Company and its shareholders, (ii) approved this Agreement, the Agreement of
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the
Mergers, (iii) approved the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Agreement of Merger, and (iv) subject to Section 7.7, recommended that the
shareholders of the Company approve this Agreement, the Agreement of Merger

consideration by the Company's shareholders at the Company Shareholder
Meeting. None of the aforesaid actions by the Company Board has been amended,
rescinded or modified as of the date of this Agreement. Except for the
approval of this Agreement and the Agreement of Merger by the affirmative vote
of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to
vote (the "Company Required Vote"), no other corporate proceedings on the part
of the Company are necessary to approve this Agreement, the Agreement of
Merger or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and
(assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Subs)
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against
the Company in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited
by general principles of equity whether applied in a court of law or a court
of equity and by bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors'
rights and remedies generally (the "Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions"). The
Agreement of Merger, once duly and validly executed and delivered by the
Company and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and
Merger Subs), will constitute a valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as
enforcement may be limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions.

respective properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or
obligation to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by
which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or
affected, except (in the case of clause (ii) above) for such violations,

the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

4.4 Consents and Approvals. No consent, approval, clearance, waiver, Permit or
order ("Consent") of or from, or filings or registrations with, any federal,

Exchange Act, (d) the filing of the Agreement of Merger and related
certificates with the California Secretary pursuant to the CGCL and (e) other

Company SEC Reports contained, when filed or, if amended or supplemented prior
to the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment or supplement, any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. There are no outstanding or unresolved comments in
comment letters received from the SEC with respect to the Company SEC Reports.
To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date hereof, none of the Company

Company is required to file or furnish reports with the SEC pursuant to the
Exchange Act.

after giving effect to any restatements made by the Company prior to the date
of this Agreement, fairly present in all material respects (subject, in the
case of the unaudited statements, to normal recurring adjustments, none of
which would be reasonably expected to result in, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect) the results of the consolidated
operations and changes in shareholders' equity and consolidated financial
position of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods
or as of the respective dates therein set forth. Each of such financial

Agreement, complies in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto and each of such financial statements (including the related

thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q.
The books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been, and are
being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any
other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual
transactions.

(b) The records, systems, controls, data and information of the Company and
its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of the Company or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-
direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls described below
in this Section 4.6(b). The Company (i) has established and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the
Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to the Company,
including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive
officer and the chief financial officer of the Company by others within those

the Company Board (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as

adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and

authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do
business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business currently
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets
owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except

contemplated hereby on a timely basis; provided, however, that in determining
whether a Parent Material Adverse Effect has occurred, there shall be excluded
any effect on the Parent or its Subsidiaries relating to or arising in
connection with (A) any adverse change, effect, event or occurrence, state of
facts or developments to the extent the public announcement or the pendency of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or any actions required
to be taken (or refrained from being taken) in compliance herewith or
otherwise with the consent of the other party hereto, including the impact
thereof on the relationships of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with
customers, suppliers, distributors, consultants, employees or independent
contractors or other third parties with whom Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
has any relationship and including any litigation brought by any shareholder
of the Company or Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, (B) any failure by Parent to meet any projections or forecasts for any
period ending (or for which revenues or earnings are released) on or after the

regulatory accounting requirements applicable or potentially applicable to the
industries in which Parent or its Subsidiaries operate, (D) changes generally
affecting the industries in which Parent or its Subsidiaries operate that are
not specifically related to Parent and its Subsidiaries and do not have a
materially disproportionate adverse effect on the Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, (E) changes in economic conditions (including changes in the
prevailing interest rates) in the United States, in any region thereof, or in
any non-U.S. or global economy or (F) any attack on, or by, outbreak or

the Mergers, or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and each
Merger Sub and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the
Company) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Parent and each Merger
Sub, enforceable against Parent and each Merger Sub in accordance with its

Parent SEC Reports contained, when filed or, if amended or supplemented prior
to the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment or supplement, any untrue

be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. There are no outstanding or unresolved comments in
comment letters received from the SEC with respect to the Parent SEC Reports.

in the Parent SEC Reports (including the related notes, where applicable),
after giving effect to any restatements made by Parent prior to the date of
this Agreement, fairly present in all material respects (subject, in the case
of the unaudited statements, to normal recurring adjustments, none of which
would be reasonably expected to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect) the results of the consolidated operations and
changes in shareholders' equity and consolidated financial position of Parent
and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective
dates therein set forth. Each of such financial statements (including the
related notes, where applicable), after giving effect to any restatements made
by Parent prior to the date of this Agreement, complies in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and each of such financial
statements (including the related notes, where applicable) has been prepared
in accordance with GAAP, as in effect on the date or for the period with
respect to which such principles are applied, in all material respects
consistently applied during the periods involved, except in each case as

accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions.

computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Parent or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the system of internal accounting controls described below in this
Section 5.6(b). Parent (i) has established and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure
that material information relating to Parent, including its consolidated
Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief
financial officer of Parent by others within those entities and (ii) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
Parent's outside auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board (A) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of
the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parent's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Parent's internal controls over
financial reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to
Parent's auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been made
available to the Company.

administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of
action or, to the Knowledge of Parent, private environmental investigations or
remediation activities or governmental investigations of any nature seeking to
impose, or that reasonably would reasonably be expected to result in the
imposition, on Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of any liability or
obligation arising under Environmental Laws, which liability or obligation
would reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect. To
the Knowledge of Parent, during or prior to the period of (a) its or any of
its Subsidiaries' ownership or operation of any of their respective current
properties, (b) its or any of its Subsidiaries' participation in the
management of any property, or (c) its or any of its Subsidiaries' holding of
a security interest or other interest in any property, there were no releases
or threatened releases of hazardous, toxic, radioactive or dangerous materials
or other materials regulated under Environmental Laws in, on, under or
affecting any such property which would reasonably be expected to result in a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is
subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or
with any Governmental Entity or third Person imposing any material liability
or obligation pursuant to or under any Environmental Law that would reasonably
be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of
Parent, Parent and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all Environmental
Laws, including possessing all material permits required for its currently
conducted operations under applicable Environmental Laws, except, in each
case, for any such non-compliance that, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary
(including Section 5.12), the representations and warranties of Parent in this
Section 5.15 constitute the sole representations and warranties of Parent with
respect to any matter (including any liability) relating to Environmental
Laws.

  

  

5.16 Financing.

  

  

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete copies of
the executed commitment letter from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc.
including any related fee letter in redacted form (the "Debt Commitment
Letter"), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof,
the lender party or parties thereto have committed to lend the amounts set
forth therein on the terms set forth therein to Consolidated Communications,
Inc., a Subsidiary of Parent ("CCI" ) for the purpose of funding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Debt Financing").

  

  

(b) As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and
effect and has not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended,
supplemented or modified in any respect. The Debt Commitment Letter, in the
form so delivered, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of CCI and, to the
knowledge of Parent as of the date hereof, the other party or parties thereto.
There are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements
(except for customary fee letters and engagement letters, complete copies of
which have been provided to the Company, with only the fee amounts and certain
other terms (none of which would adversely affect the amount or availability
of the Debt Financing) redacted) relating to the Debt Financing between
Parent, Merger Subs and CCI, on the one hand, and the provider or providers of
the Debt Financing, on the other hand. As of the date hereof, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of CCI under any term, or a failure
of any condition, of the Debt Commitment Letter. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 4 and compliance by the
Company with its covenants and agreements hereunder, as of the date of this
Agreement neither Parent nor Merger Subs has reason to believe that CCI would

Indemnified Party to repay such advanced Expenses if it is determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction in a final order that such Indemnified Party
was not entitled to indemnification hereunder with respect to such Expenses.
In the event any Claim is brought against any Indemnified Party, Parent and
the Surviving Company shall each use all commercially reasonable efforts to
assist in the vigorous defense of such matter, provided that neither Parent
nor the Surviving Company shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment in any Claim (and in which indemnification could be sought by
such Indemnified Party hereunder) without the prior written consent of such
Indemnified Party if and to the extent the claimant seeks any non-monetary
relief (including any admission of liability or guilt) from such Indemnified
Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to control the defense of any action, suit, investigation or proceeding with
counsel of its own choosing reasonably acceptable to Parent and Parent and the
Surviving Company shall cooperate in the defense thereof; provided, that
Parent shall not be liable for the fees of more than one counsel for all
Indemnified Parties, other than local counsel, unless a conflict of interest
shall be caused thereby. The indemnification and advancement obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Company pursuant to this Section 7.6(a) shall extend
to acts or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time and any Claim
relating thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement by the Company Board and the
Company's shareholders and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and any Claim relating thereto) and all rights to indemnification and
advancement conferred hereunder shall continue as to an individual who has
ceased to be a director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries at or
prior to the Effective Time and shall inure to the benefit of such
individual's heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives. In
connection with any determination as to whether the Indemnified Parties are
entitled to the benefits of this Section 7.6, the burden of proof shall be on
Parent and the Surviving Company to establish that an Indemnified Party is not
so entitled. As used in this Section 7.6(a), (A) the term "Claim" means any
threatened, asserted, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, or any
inquiry or investigation, whether instituted by the Company, any Governmental
Entity or any other party, that any Indemnified Party in good faith believes
might lead to the institution of any such action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other, including any
arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution mechanism, arising out of
or pertaining to matters that relate to such Indemnified Party's duties or
service as a director or officer of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any
employee benefit plan maintained by any of the foregoing at or prior to the
Effective Time and any other Person at the request the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; and (B) the term "Expenses" means attorneys' fees and all other
costs, expenses and obligations (including experts' fees, travel expenses,
court costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding
costs, as well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or
incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or
participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend,
be a witness in or participate in, any Claim for which indemnification is
authorized pursuant to this Section 7.6(a), including any action relating to a
claim for indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-46-  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) From the Effective Time and for a period of six (6) years thereafter,
Parent and the Surviving Company shall keep in full force and effect, and
comply with the terms and conditions of, any agreement in effect as of the
date of this Agreement between or among the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and any Indemnified Party providing for the indemnification of and advancement
of expenses to such Indemnified Party.

  

  

(c) Without limiting any of the obligations under paragraph (a) of this
Section 7.6, Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification and advancement
of expenses and all limitations of liability existing in favor of the
Indemnified Parties as provided in the Company's Articles of Incorporation or
Bylaws or in the corresponding constituent documents of any of the Company's
Subsidiaries as in effect as of the date of this Agreement with respect to
matters occurring on or prior to the Effective Time shall survive the Mergers
and shall continue in full force and effect thereafter, without any amendment
thereto.

  

  

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Company, as the case may be
(including Parent's ultimate parent entity, if applicable), assume all of the
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company set forth in this Section 7.6.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-47-  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company as of the Effective Time
to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the
directors' and officers' liability coverage of the Company's existing
directors' and officers' insurance policies and the Company's existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, "DandO Insurance"), in
each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years
from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any
period or time at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current insurance
carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided
under the Company's existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged
error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of
duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that
existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby). If
the Company or the Surviving Company for any reason fail to obtain such "tail"
insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall
continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six years from and
after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof
with the Company's current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with
the same or better credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier
with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the
Company's existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Company
shall purchase from the Company's current insurance carrier or from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's
current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance comparable DandO
Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are no less favorable than as provided in the
Company's existing policies as of the date hereof.

  

  

(f) The provisions of this Section 7.6 shall survive the consummation of the
Mergers and (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent or the Surviving Company
under this Section 7.6 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as
to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party under this Section 7.6
without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company to perform all of the obligations of the Surviving Company
under this Section 7.6. Parent and the Surviving Company, jointly and
severally, shall pay all expenses, including reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel, that an Indemnified Party may incur in enforcing the indemnity and
other obligations provided for in this Section 7.6.

7.7 No Solicitation.

  

  

(a) During the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing
until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with Section 9.1, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective officers and directors shall, and the Company shall instruct and
cause its and its Subsidiaries' other Representatives to, cease and cause to
be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any Person that would
otherwise be prohibited by this Section 7.7(a). Promptly following the
execution of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver a written notice to
each such Person to the effect that, subject to the provisions of this Section
7.7, the Company is ending all discussions and negotiations with such Person
with respect to any Alternative Proposal, effective on and from date of this
Agreement, and the notice shall also request such Person to promptly return or
destroy all confidential information concerning the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries. Subject to the provisions of this Section 7.7, during the period
commencing on the date of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to
occur of the Effective Time and the Termination Date, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not, and shall cause its and their respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit (including by way
of furnishing non-public information), initiate or knowingly encourage or
facilitate any inquiry with respect to, or the making, submission or
announcement of, any proposal or offer that constitutes, or is reasonably
expected to lead to, an Alternative Proposal, (ii) furnish to any Person
(other than Parent or Merger Subs or their respective designees) any non-
public information relating to the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, or afford
to any Person access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or
other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries (other than Parent or Merger Subs or their respective designees),
in any such case relating to an Alternative Proposal or any inquiries or the
making of any proposal that could lead to an Alternative Proposal, (iii)
engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding any Alternative Proposal with any Person, except to
notify such Person as to the existence and content of the provisions of this
Section 7.7, or (iv) grant any waiver, amendment or release under any
standstill or confidentiality agreement (except for any portion of any such
standstill or confidentiality agreement that restricts the ability of a Person
to communicate an Alternative Proposal to Company Board), or anti-takeover
laws.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 7.7 or
elsewhere in this Agreement, until the Agreement of Merger contained in this
Agreement shall have been approved by the Company Required Vote, the Company
may, directly or indirectly through one or more Affiliates or Representatives,
participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, furnish any non-
public information relating to the Company and/or its Subsidiaries to, and/or
afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other
non-public information, or to the personnel, of the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries to, a Person or group of Persons that makes a bona fide
Alternative Proposal (under circumstances in which the Company has complied
with its non-solicitation obligations under Section 7.7(a)); provided,
however, that the Company shall promptly make available to Parent and Merger
Subs any material non-public information concerning the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person given such access which was not
previously made available to Parent or Merger Subs or their respective
Representatives (which requirement may be satisfied by posting such
information in the online data room established by the Company prior to the
date hereof); and provided further that, prior to initiating any such action,
the Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Alternative
Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal; and provided further that prior to
furnishing such information or access to, or entering into substantive
discussions (except as to the existence of this Section 7.7) or negotiations
with, such Person(s), (A) the Company receives from such Person(s) an executed
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (B) the Company notifies Parent to
the effect that it intends to furnish information or access to, or intends to
enter into substantive discussions or negotiations with, such Person(s).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-49-  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) Except as provided by Section 7.7(d), at any time after the execution of
this Agreement, the Company Board shall not:

  

  

(i) resolve to withdraw, modify or qualify and/or withdraw, modify or qualify
the Company Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent and Merger Subs (a
"Company Recommendation Change"); or

  

  

(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement (an "Alternative
Acquisition Agreement") relating to an Alternative Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in compliance with the terms of Section
7.7(b)) or authorize, approve or publicly recommend an Alternative Proposal or
any agreement, understanding or arrangement relating to an Alternative
Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in compliance
with the terms of Section 7.7(b)).

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if
the Company is then in receipt of a bona fide written Alternative Proposal
from any Person that is not withdrawn and that the Company Board concludes in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may (1) effect a
Company Recommendation Change, and/or (2) adopt, approve, endorse or
recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve, endorse or recommend, to the
shareholders of the Company any Superior Proposal and authorize the Company to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1(c)(ii) to enter into
an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal
(provided, however, that in such event under this clause (2), the Company
concurrently terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(ii) and
enters into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal), then the Company Board may effect a Company
Recommendation Change, if and only if:

  

  

(i) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the directors' exercise of their
fiduciary obligations to the shareholders of the Company under applicable
laws; and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-50-  

  

 

 

 

  

(ii) in the case of clause (x)(2) above, the Company shall have validly
terminated this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1(c)(ii), including the
payment of the Termination Fee in accordance with Section 9.2(a).

  

  

(e) The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding the matters
contemplated by this Section 7.7 (including any Alternative Proposals).
Without limiting the generality of foregoing, (i) the Company shall promptly
notify Parent if any proposals or offers with respect to an Alternative
Proposal are received by the Company or any of its Representatives indicating,
in connection with such notice, the material terms and conditions of any
proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any written requests,
proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and thereafter shall keep
Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and material
terms of any such proposals or offers (including any material amendments
thereto), including any change in the Company's intentions as previously
notified, and (ii) the Company agrees that it will promptly notify Parent if
any non-public information is requested from, or any discussions or
negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or any
of its Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the status
of any such discussions or negotiations, including any change in the Company's
intentions as previously notified. The Company agrees that it and its
Subsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person
subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company from providing such
information to Parent.

  

  

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, from (i)
taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rules
14d-9 or 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending
disclosure of its position thereunder, or (ii) making any disclosure to its
shareholders if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such disclosure would
be inconsistent with the directors' exercise of their fiduciary obligations to
the Company's shareholders under applicable law or would constitute a
violation of applicable law. It is understood and agreed that, for purposes of
this Agreement (including Section 9), a factually accurate public statement by
the Company that describes the Company's receipt of an Alternative Proposal
and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto, or any "stop, look
and listen" communication by the Company Board, shall not constitute a Company
Recommendation Change or an approval or recommendation with respect to any
Alternative Proposal.

  

  

(g) Other than with respect to the Debt Commitment, neither Parent nor Merger
Subs, nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall make or enter into any
formal or informal arrangements or understandings (whether or not binding)
with any Person, or have any discussions or other communications with any
other Person, in any such case with respect to any Alternative Proposal
involving the Company.

  

  

(h) As used in this Agreement:

  

  

(i) "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" shall mean a customary
confidentiality and standstill agreement that contains confidentiality and
standstill provisions that are not materially less favorable in the aggregate
to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
(provided, however, that such confidentiality agreement shall not be required
to restrict a Person from communicating an Alternative Proposal to the Company
Board) or, to the extent applicable, a confidentiality agreement entered into
prior to the execution of this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-51-  

  

 

 

 

  

(ii) "Alternative Proposal" shall mean any proposal, indication or offer,
including any proposal, indication or offer from or to the Company's
shareholders, made by any Person or group (as defined under Rule 13(d) of the
Exchange Act) other than Parent or its Subsidiaries and/or Affiliates relating
to, whether in a single transaction or series of related transactions, and
whether directly or indirectly, any (i) transaction or series of transactions
(including any merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business
combination, joint venture, partnership, recapitalization, dissolution,
liquidation or similar direct or indirect transaction involving the Company
and/or any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Company or the issuance or
acquisition of shares of Company Common Stock or other equity securities of
the Company whose business or businesses constitute twenty percent (20%) (in
number or voting power) or more of the assets, revenues or earnings of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) acquisition, license or
purchase of assets of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries equal to twenty
percent (20%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or to which twenty percent (20%) or more of the Company's
revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable or (iii)
acquisition of beneficial ownership (as defined under Rule 13(d) of the
Exchange Act) of equity interests representing a twenty percent (20%) or
greater economic or voting interest in the Company or tender offer (including
a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in
any Person or group (as defined under Rule 13(d) of the Exchange Act)
beneficially owning equity interests representing a twenty percent (20%) (in
number or voting power) or greater economic or voting interest in the Company.

  

  

(iii) "Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona fide Alternative Proposal
(except that references to "twenty percent (20%) or more" in the definition
thereof will be deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%) or more") made
by any Person that is on terms that the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and
after taking into account all legal, financial (including the financing terms
thereof), regulatory, timing and other aspects of the proposal, as well as any
modification to this Agreement that Parent and Merger Subs propose to make in
accordance with Section 7.7(d)(ii), are more favorable to the Company's
shareholders from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  

  

7.8 Standstill. Until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of
this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall (a) purchase
any shares of Company Common Stock or any security of the Company that is
convertible into Company Common Stock in the open market or in privately
negotiated transactions or (b) form, join or in any way participate in a
"group" (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) in connection
with any of the foregoing or (c) commence a tender offer or exchange offer.

  

  

7.9 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall
take all such steps as may be required and permitted to cause the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispositions of shares of
Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to such
Company Common Stock) by each individual who is or will be subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

7.10 Financing.

  

  

(a) Parent and Merger Subs acknowledge and agree that the Company and its
Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives shall not, prior to
the Effective Time, incur any liability to any Person under any financing that
Parent and Merger Subs may raise in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any cooperation provided pursuant to this
Section 7.10 and that Parent and Merger Subs shall, on a joint and several
basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Affiliates and its and
their respective Representatives from and against any losses, damages, claims,
costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the
Debt Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith.

  

  

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Subs shall take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange and obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing on the
terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter, including: (i)
entering into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof, (ii) satisfying, or cause their Representatives to
satisfy, on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent, Merger Subs,
CCI or their respective Representatives that are within their respective
control in such definitive agreements and (iii) using commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the lenders and any other Persons providing the Debt
Financing to fund the Debt Financing at the Closing.

  

  

(c) Parent shall not agree to any amendments or modifications to, or grant any
waivers of, any condition or other provision under the Debt Commitment Letter
without the prior written consent of the Company if such amendments,
modifications or waivers would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing or (ii) impose new or additional conditions that would reasonably be
expected to (A) prevent or materially delay the ability of Parent to
consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (B) adversely impact the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or CCI to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter.
Parent shall not release or consent to the termination of the obligations of
the lenders under the Debt Commitment Letter, except for assignments and
replacements of an individual lender under the terms of or in connection with
the syndication of the Debt Financing or as otherwise expressly contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter.

  

  

(d) In no event shall Parent or Merger Subs or any of their Affiliates (which
for purposes of this Section 7.10(d) shall be deemed to include each direct or
indirect investor or potential investor in Parent or Merger Subs, or any of
Parent's, either Merger Sub's or such investor's financing sources or
potential financing sources or other Representatives) (i) award any agent,
broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other firm or Person any
financial advisory role on an exclusive basis or any additional firm or Person
on a non-exclusive basis in connection with the Mergers or the other
transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) prohibit or seek to prohibit any bank
or investment bank or other potential provider of debt or equity financing
from providing or seeking to provide financing or financial advisory services
to any Person in connection with a transaction relating to the Company or its
subsidiaries or in connection with the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-53-  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable in
the manner or from the sources contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, (i)
Parent shall promptly so notify the Company and (ii) Parent and Merger Subs
shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to arrange and
obtain, and to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to,
alternative financing from alternative financial institutions in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement upon
conditions not materially less favorable to Parent, Merger Subs and the
Company than those in the Debt Commitment Letter, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event (and in any event no later than the
Closing Date). The definitive agreements entered into pursuant to the first
sentence of this Section 7.10(e) or Section 7.10(b)(i) are referred to in this
Agreement, collectively, as the "Financing Agreements."

  

  

(f) Each of Parent and each Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that neither
the obtaining of the Debt Financing or any alternative financing, nor the
completion of any issuance of securities contemplated by the Debt Financing or
any alternative financing, is a condition to the Closing, and reaffirms its
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
irrespective and independently of the availability of the Debt Financing or
any alternative financing, or the completion of any such issuance, subject the
applicable conditions set forth in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, the breach of
which obligation will give rise, without limitation, to the remedies set forth
in Section 10.7.

  

  

(g) Parent shall (i) furnish the Company complete, correct and executed copies
of the Financing Agreements or any alternative financing agreement promptly
upon their execution, (ii) give the Company prompt notice of any material
breach or material threatened breach by any party of any of the Financing
Commitments, any alternative financing commitment, the Financing Agreements,
or any alternative financing agreement of which Parent or Merger Subs becomes
aware or any termination thereof, and (iii) otherwise keep the Company
reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing
(or any alternative financing).

  

  

7.11 Financing Cooperation.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and shall cause its
subsidiaries to, at Parent's sole expense, cooperate, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its respective officers, employees,
representatives, auditors, and advisors, including legal and accounting
advisors, to cooperate, in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing, as may be reasonably requested by Parent (provided that such
requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of business of the Company and its subsidiaries), including: (i)
participation in meetings, drafting sessions, rating agency presentations, due
diligence sessions, and "road show" and other customary marketing
presentations; (ii) furnishing in writing any financing sources as promptly as
practicable with pertinent information regarding the Company and its
subsidiaries as is reasonably requested in connection with the Debt Financing;
(iii) assisting any financing sources in the preparation of (A) one or more
customary offering documents, information memoranda and/or documents to be
filed with the SEC in connection with the Debt Financing and (B) materials for
rating agency presentations; (iv) executing and delivering any pledge and
security documents and otherwise facilitating the pledging of collateral; (v)
taking all reasonably required corporate actions, subject to the consummation
of the Mergers, to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing; (vi)
providing authorization letters to any financing sources authorizing the
distribution of information to prospective lenders and containing customary
representation to the arranger of any financing that the information contained
in any offering document or information memorandum relating to the Company and
its subsidiaries does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; (vii) cooperating reasonably with the financing sources; due
diligence of the Company and its subsidiaries, to the extent customary and
reasonable. Parent shall, promptly upon termination of this Agreement,
reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and costs
incurred in connection with the Company's or its Affiliates' obligations under
this Section 7.11.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-54-  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) In addition, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall: (i) use its
reasonable best efforts to cause Ernst and Young LLP, independent accountants of
the Company, to provide a letter or letters containing statements and
information of the type ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters"
to underwriters with respect to financial statements and certain financial
information used in connection with the Debt Financing; (ii) use its
reasonable best efforts to provide customary representation letters and other
authorizations or information to Ernst and Young LLP, to enable them to provide
the foregoing "comfort letters"; (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the consent of Ernst and Young LLP for the inclusion of its reports on
the Company in any document or documents to be used in connection with the
Debt Financing; and (iv) cause the appropriate representatives of the Company
to execute and deliver any definitive financing documents or other
certificates or documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent for
delivery at the consummation of the Debt Financing.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or
other similar fee or enter into any definitive agreement or incur any other
liability of obligation in connection with the Debt Financing (or any
alternative financing) prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

 

7.12 Tax Treatment as Reorganization. Each of Parent, the Company and the
Surviving Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take such actions
so as to cause the Mergers to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code. Neither Parent nor the Company shall take any
action prior to the Closing, and Parent shall not take any action or fail to
take any action (and shall prevent the Surviving Company from taking any
action or failing to take any action) following the Closing, that would cause
the Mergers to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. Parent and the Surviving Company shall report the
Mergers for income tax purposes as a single "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, including the filing of the statement
required by Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-3, unless otherwise required by
a taxing authority pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section

9.2 Effect of Termination.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if:

  

  

(i) (A) this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(ii),
Section 9.1(b)(iii) or Section 9.1(d)(i) (due to a breach of Section 7.7), (B)
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and in the case of a
termination pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(ii) or Section 9.1(d)(i), prior to such
termination, and in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(iii),
prior to the Company Meeting, any bona fide Alternative Proposal (substituting
fifty percent (50%) for the twenty percent (20%) thresholds set forth in the
definition of "Alternative Proposal") (a "Qualifying Transaction") shall have
been communicated to the Company or a member of the Company Board (whether or
not publicly disclosed) and not withdrawn or otherwise abandoned (and, if
publicly disclosed, not publicly withdrawn or otherwise abandoned) and (C)
within twelve (12) months following the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 9.1(b)(ii), Section 9.1(b)(iii) or Section 9.1(d)(i), as
applicable, a Qualifying Transaction is consummated; or

  

  

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
9.1(c)(ii) or by Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(ii);

  

  

then in any such event the Company shall pay to Parent (or a Person designated
in writing by Parent) by wire transfer of same-day funds a fee equal to the
Termination Fee. "Termination Fee" shall mean an amount equal to $14,675,000.
Such payment shall be made, in the case of a termination referenced in clause
(i) above, upon the consummation of any Qualifying Transaction, or in the case
of a termination referenced in clause (ii) above, concurrently with the
termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(ii) or
within two (2) business days after termination of this Agreement by Parent
pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(ii). For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall
the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the
circumstances in which the Termination Fee is or becomes payable pursuant
Section 9.2(a), Parent's and each Merger Sub's sole and exclusive remedy
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against the
Company or any of its Affiliates with respect to the facts and circumstances
giving rise to such payment obligation shall be payment of the Termination Fee
pursuant to Section 9.2(a), and upon payment in full of such amount, none of
Parent nor either Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates nor any
other Person shall have any rights or claims against the Company or any of its
Affiliates (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise)
under or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Company
fails promptly to pay Parent any amounts due under this Section 9.2, the
Company shall pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses) in connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit
or other legal action, taken to collect payment, together with interest on the
amount of any unpaid fee or obligation at the publicly announced prime rate of
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. in effect from time to time from the date such fee or
obligation was required to be paid.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-59-  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 9.2
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement. The parties acknowledge that the Termination Fee, in the
circumstances in which such fee becomes payable, constitute liquidated damages
and are not a penalty.

  

  

(d) There shall be deducted from any payments made pursuant to this Section
9.2 such amounts as may be required to be withheld therefrom under the Code or
under any provision of U.S. state or local tax law.

  

  

(e) The party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1
(other than Section 9.1(a)) shall give written notice of such termination,
including a description in reasonable detail of the reasons for such
termination, to the other party in accordance with Section 10.3, specifying
the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is
effected. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 9, any valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1 (other than Section
9.1(a)) shall be effective immediately upon the delivery of notice of the
terminating party to the other party or parties hereto, as applicable. In the
event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the Company as
provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have
no effect, and none of Parent, either Merger Sub, the Company, any of their
respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them
shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that (i)
Sections 7.2(b), 9.2, 10.2 and 10.6 shall survive any termination of this
Agreement and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, neither Parent, either Merger Sub nor the Company shall be relieved
or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its willful and
material breach of this Agreement.

  

  

9.3 Amendment. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective boards of directors, at any time before the Effective Time;
provided, however, that after receipt of the Company Required Vote, there may
not be any amendment of this Agreement which, by applicable law or in
accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires further
approval of the Company's shareholders. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.

  

  

9.4 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein;
provided, however, that, after receipt of the Company Required Vote, there may
not be any extension or waiver of this Agreement which decreases the Merger
Consideration or which adversely affects the rights of the Company's
shareholders hereunder without the approval of such shareholders. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance
with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a
waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

10. GENERAL PROVISIONS

  

  

10.1 Nonsurvival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements. None of the

10.4 Interpretation; Construction. The words "hereof," "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and the schedules hereto and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement, and Section references are to this
Agreement unless otherwise specified. Whenever the words "include," "includes"
or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation." Unless the context otherwise requires, "or"
is not exclusive. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable
to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine
as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. The table of
contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to require the
Company, Merger Subs, Parent or any of their respective officers, directors,
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to take any action which would violate or conflict
with any applicable law (whether statutory or common), rule or regulation.
This Agreement shall be construed without regard to any presumption or
interpretation against the party drafting or causing any instrument to be
drafted. All schedules accompanying this Agreement and all information
specifically referenced in any such schedule form an integral part of this
Agreement, and references to this Agreement include reference to them.

  

  

10.5 Counterparts; Facsimile. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart. Signatures transmitted by facsimile shall be
accepted as originals for all purposes of this Agreement.

  

  

10.6 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the agreements,
documents, schedules and the instruments referred to herein or delivered
herewith) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof, other than the Confidentiality Agreement, which
shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and any termination
of this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-62-  

  

 

 

 

  

10.7 Specific Performance. The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of it hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions and that, accordingly, the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees
that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief sought in accordance with this Section 10.7 on the
basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in
equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions in accordance with this
Agreement to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

  

  

10.8 Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to any
applicable conflicts of law provisions (except to the extent that mandatory
provisions of federal law). Each of the parties hereto irrevocably submit to
the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts of the State of California
or of the United States of America, in each case located in the County of San
Francisco, California, for the purpose of any suit, action or other proceeding
arising out of this Agreement, or any of the agreements or transactions
contemplated hereby, which is brought by or against any other party hereto and
hereby irrevocably agree (a) that all claims in respect of any such suit,
action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court and (b) not
to commence any action suit or proceeding relating to this Agreement other
than in such court. Each party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives
and agrees not to assert in any such suit, action or proceeding, in each case,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, (i) any objection to the
laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such
court, (ii) any claim that such party is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of any such court, and (iii) any claim that any such suit, action
or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party hereto agrees
that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered
mail addressed to such party shall be effective service of process for any
action, suit or proceeding brought against such party in any such court. Each
party hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such suit, action or
proceeding brought in any such court shall be conclusive and binding upon such
party and may be enforced in any other courts to whose jurisdiction such party
is or may be subject, by suit upon such judgment.

  

  

10.9 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable
the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity
or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction, and if any provision of this Agreement is determined to be
so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only
so broad as is enforceable, in all cases so long as neither the economic nor
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party or its shareholders. Upon any such
determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree
upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect the original
intent of the parties.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-63-  

  

 

 

 

  

10.10 Publicity. Parent, Merger Subs and the Company shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release with respect to the Mergers or this
Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement without the prior consent of the other party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that a party may, without
the prior consent of the other party (but after prior consultation, to the
extent practicable in the circumstances) issue such press release or make such
public statement or SEC filing as may upon the advice of outside counsel be
required by law or the rules and regulations of any applicable stock exchange
(including the NASDAQ Stock Market). The parties have agreed upon the form of
a joint press release announcing the Mergers and the execution of this
Agreement.

  

  

10.11 Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations of any party hereunder shall be assigned
by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other party. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. Except for (a) the provisions of Section 7.5 and Section 7.6, (b) the
right of the Company's shareholders to receive the Merger Consideration at the
Effective Time, (c) the right of the holders of Company Options, Company RSUs
and Company RSAs to receive the Equity Award Consideration at the Effective
Time, and (d) the rights of the Company's shareholders to pursue claims for
damages and other relief, including equitable relief, for Parent's or either
Merger Sub's willful breach of this Agreement (provided, that the rights
granted pursuant to this clause (e) shall be enforceable on behalf of the
shareholders only by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion), this
Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is not
intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder.

  

  

10.12 Merger Subs. On the date hereof, the Company and Parent are executing
and delivering this Agreement. Promptly after the date hereof, Parent shall
cause each Merger Sub to be incorporated under the laws of the State of
