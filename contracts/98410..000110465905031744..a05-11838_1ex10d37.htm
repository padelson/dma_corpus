 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

  



  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 1, 2005 (this "Agreement"), by
and among Tipperary Corporation, a Texas corporation (the "Company"), Santos
International Holdings Pty Ltd., a corporation incorporated under the laws of
the Australian Capital Territory A.B.N. 57 057 585 869 ("Purchaser"), and
Santos Acquisition Co., a Texas corporation and wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Purchaser ("Merger Sub").

  



  

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of each of the Company, Purchaser and Merger
Sub have each approved this Agreement and the merger of the Company with and
into Merger Sub (the "Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the Texas Business
Corporation Act, as amended (the "TBCA");

  



  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has determined
that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interest of, its shareholders;
and

  



  

WHEREAS, Slough Estates USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("SUSA"), is the
beneficial owner of approximately 53.64% of the issued and outstanding common
stock, U.S.$0.02 par value, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock"), and
simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as
a condition and inducement to Purchasers willingness to enter into
this Agreement, Slough Estates plc, a public limited company organized under
the laws of England and Wales and the ultimate parent of SUSA, has entered
into an Interest Purchase Agreement (the "IPA") providing for certain matters
with respect to its shares of Company Common Stock and certain other actions
relating to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth
herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  



  

ARTICLE I

  



  

[RESERVED]

  



  

ARTICLE II

  



  

THE MERGER

  



  

2.1 _The Merger_.

  



  

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, and in
accordance with the provisions of the TBCA, Santos Ltd., a corporation
incorporated under the laws of South Australia ("Parent"), shall cause Merger
Sub to be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time.  As a
result of the Merger, the separate

  



  

1   

     
   

  



  

corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue
its existence as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Purchaser. The Company, in its
capacity as the corporation surviving the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes
referred to as the "Surviving Corporation". Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, upon the Merger, all the rights, privileges, immunities,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation and all the obligations, duties, debts and liabilities
of the Company and Merger Sub shall be the obligations, duties, debts and
liabilities of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

2.2 _Effective Time_.

  



  

As promptly as possible on the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause
the Merger to be consummated by delivering to the Secretary of State of the
State of Texas (the "Secretary of State") articles of merger (the "Articles
of Merger") in such form as is required by and executed in accordance with
Article 5.04 of the TBCA. The Merger shall become effective when
a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") is issued to the
Surviving Corporation by the Secretary of State or at such later time as
shall be agreed upon by Purchaser and the Company and specified in the
Articles of Merger (the "Effective Time"). Prior to the filing referred
to in this Section 2.2 and unless this Agreement shall have been terminated
and the transactions contemplated herein abandoned pursuant to Section 8.1,
a closing (the "Closing") shall be held at 10:00 a.m., Houston time, on a
date to be specified by the parties hereto, which shall be no later than the
Business Day after satisfaction or waiver (by the party entitled to waive the
condition) of all of the conditions set forth in Article VII (except for
those conditions that can by their nature be satisfied only at the time of
the Closing), but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions)
(the "Closing Date"), at the offices of Chamberlain, Hrdlicka, White,
Williams and Martin, 1200 Smith Street, Suite 1400, Houston, Texas 77002,
unless another date and/or place is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto.

  



  

2.3 _Effects of the Merger_.

  



  

From and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Article 5.06 of the TBCA.

  



  

2.4 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws_.

  



  

Pursuant to the Merger, (a) the Companys Articles of Incorporation, as in
effect on the date of this Agreement (the "Company Articles"), shall be the
Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the "Articles of
Incorporation") until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
Applicable Law, and (b) the Companys Bylaws, as in effect on the date of
this Agreement (the "Company Bylaws"), shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation (the "Bylaws") until thereafter changed or amended as provided
therein or by Applicable Law.

  



  

2.5 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

  



  

From and after the Effective Time, (a) the directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective
Time, be the

  



  

2   

     
   

  



  

directors of the Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have been
duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and
the Bylaws and (b) the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and
shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

  



  

2.6 _The Shareholders  Meeting_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall, in accordance with Applicable Law and the Company Articles and
the Company Bylaws:

  



  

(i) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock for the sole purpose of considering
and voting upon approval of the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (such meeting, including any postponement or
adjournment thereof, is referred to as the "Shareholders Meeting"), and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to hold the Shareholders Meeting no
later than 45 days after such date; and

  



  

(ii) prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")
a preliminary proxy or information statement relating to this Agreement, and
take all lawful actions to obtain and furnish the information required to be
included by the SEC in the Proxy Statement, and, after consultation with
Purchaser, to respond promptly to any comments made by the SEC or the staff
of the SEC (the "SEC Staff") with respect to the preliminary proxy or
information statement and cause a definitive proxy or information statement
(together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement")
to be mailed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock as soon as
practicable, which Proxy Statement shall include all information required
under Applicable Laws to be furnished to the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; and

  



  

(iii) include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of the Board to the
extent not previously withdrawn in compliance with Section 6.2(e).

  



  

(b) The Company shall promptly notify Purchaser of any comments from the SEC
Staff with respect to the Proxy Statement or any request of the SEC Staff for
additional information and shall supply Purchaser with copies of all
correspondence between the Company or its representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC Staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement.

  



  

(c) Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.2, the Company, acting through
the its board of directors, shall (i) recommend adoption of this Agreement

  



  

3   

     
   

  



  

and include in the Proxy Statement such recommendation and (ii) use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit and obtain such adoption. Notwithstanding
any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any
Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or any other fact or circumstance, the Company shall submit this Agreement to
the shareholders of the Company at the Shareholders Meeting for the purpose
of adopting this Agreement, with such disclosures as shall be required by
Applicable Law. At any such Shareholders Meeting following any such
withdrawal, amendment or modification of the recommendation of this Agreement
by the Companys board of directors, the Company may submit this Agreement to
its shareholders without a recommendation or with a negative
recommendation (although the approval of this Agreement by the Companys
board of directors may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the
Companys board of directors may communicate the basis for its lack of a
recommendation or negative recommendation to its shareholders in the Proxy
Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto.

  



  

ARTICLE III

  



  

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

  



  

3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

  



  

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective shareholders
and shareholders, as applicable:

  



  

(a) Each share of common stock, par value U.S.$1.00 per share, of Merger Sub
("Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock, par value U.S.$0.02 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.
 Such newly issued shares shall thereafter constitute all of the issued and
outstanding Surviving Corporation capital stock.

  



  

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, excluding any shares of Company Common Stock
owned by Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any shareholders properly exercising rights to dissent
pursuant to Article 5.12 of the TBCA ("Article 5.12"), as provided in Section
3.1(d), shall be converted into and represent the right to receive in cash,
without interest, an amount equal to the Merger Consideration. At the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and automatically shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any shares of Company Common Stock (a "Certificate") shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration or in the case of holders of Dissenting Shares the right
to receive the applicable payments set forth in Section 3.1(d).

  



  

4   

     
   

  



  

(c) Each share of the Company capital stock held in the treasury of the
Company automatically shall be cancelled and retired and no payment shall be
made in respect thereof. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and retired and no
payment shall be made in respect thereof.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are held by any holder of Company Common Stock that is
entitled to demand and properly demands payment of the fair value of such
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to, and that complies in all respects
with, the provisions of Article 5.12 (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 3.1(b), but, instead, such holder of Company Common Stock shall be
entitled to such rights (but only such rights) as are granted by Article
5.12. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and automatically shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and, except as otherwise provided by Applicable Laws, each holder of
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to the
Dissenting Shares, other than such rights as are granted by Article 5.12.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder of shares of
Company Common Stock (i) shall have failed to establish entitlement to relief
as a dissenting shareholder as provided in Article 5.12, (ii) shall have
effectively withdrawn demand for relief as a dissenting shareholder with
respect to such Dissenting Shares or lost the right to relief as a dissenting
shareholder and payment for such Dissenting Shares under Article 5.12, or
(iii) shall have failed to file a complaint with the appropriate court
seeking relief as to the determination of the value of all such Dissenting
Shares within the time provided in Article 5.12, such holder of Company
Common Stock shall forfeit or, in the event a court of competent jurisdiction
shall determine that holder of Company Common Stock is not entitled to the
relief provided by Article 5.12, lose the right to relief as a dissenting
shareholder with respect to such Dissenting Shares, and such Dissenting
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and
shall have become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided
in Section 3.1(b) without interest. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Purchaser of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock
and any attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the TBCA and received by the Company relating
to shareholder dissent rights, and Purchaser shall have the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Purchaser, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  



  

(e) The "Merger Consideration" shall be an amount equal to $7.41 cash per
share of Company Common Stock.

  



  

5   

     
   

  



  

3.2 _Surrender and Payment_.

  



  

(a) _Paying Agent and Exchange Fund_.  Prior to the Effective Time, on behalf
of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Purchaser shall designate,
or shall cause to be designated Morgan Guaranty and Trust Co. or another bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the
payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of Certificates, upon
surrender of such Certificates in accordance with this Article III from time
to time after the Effective Time (the "Paying Agent").  Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause Purchaser or Merger Sub to
deposit, with the Paying Agent cash in amounts sufficient for the payment of
the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(b) upon surrender of such
Certificates (such cash, the "Exchange Fund"). The Paying Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Purchaser, on a daily
basis, provided that no such investment shall affect Purchasers obligation
to pay the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest and other
income resulting from investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains
undistributed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock one year after
the date of the mailing required by Section 3.2(b) shall be delivered to
Purchaser, upon demand by Purchaser, and holders of Certificates that have
not theretofore complied with this Section 3.2 shall thereafter look only to
Purchaser for payment of any claim to the Merger Consideration.

  



  

(b) _Exchange Procedure_.  As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Purchaser shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates held by such holder of Company Common
Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Purchaser
may reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to
such other agent or agents as may be reasonably appointed by Purchaser,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by the Certificate shall have been converted
pursuant to Section 3.1(b), and the Certificate so surrendered shall be
cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
that is not registered in the stock transfer books of the Company, the proper
amount of cash may be paid in exchange therefor to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of Purchaser that the Tax has been paid or is not
applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any Merger
Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends
and distributions payable to holders of

  



  

6   

     
   

  



  

Certificates.  In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common
Stock may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate representing such shares
of Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and the Person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the delivery of the Merger
Consideration in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish
to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is
not payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.1, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate.

  



  

(c) _Stock Transfer Books_.  At the close of business on the day on which the
Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.  If,
after the Effective Time, any Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall
be converted into the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares
of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates and any
dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to Section 3.1(g), without any interest thereon.

  



  

(d) _No Liability; Termination of Exchange Fund_. None of Purchaser, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
Person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. All funds held by the
Paying Agent for payment to the holders of unsurrendered Certificates and
unclaimed one year after the Effective Time shall be returned to Purchaser,
after which time any holder of unsurrendered Certificates shall look as a
general creditor only to Purchaser for payment of the funds to which the
holder of unsurrendered Certificates may be due, subject to Applicable Laws.
If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to five years after
the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any
Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the
extent permitted by all applicable laws, statutes, orders, rules,
regulations, policies or guidelines promulgated, or judgments, decisions or
orders entered by any Governmental Entity (collectively, "Applicable Laws"),
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of
all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(e) _Lost Certificates_.  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming a Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent will
issue in exchange for

  



  

7   

     
   

  



  

such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration

6.2 _Acquisition Proposals_.

  



  

(a) The Company agrees that, except as expressly contemplated by this
Agreement, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and the Company
shall, and

  



  

32   

     
   

  



  

shall cause its Subsidiaries and affiliates (as such term in used in Rule
12b-2 under the Exchange Act) to, cause their respective officers,
directors, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors,
agents and other representatives not to (i) directly or indirectly initiate,
solicit, knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of furnishing
information) any inquiries or the making or submission of any proposal that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or
disclose any non-public information or data relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or afford access to the properties, books or records of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person that has made an Acquisition
Proposal or to any person in contemplation of an Acquisition Proposal, or
(iii) accept an Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement, including
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement, arrangement or
understanding, (A) constituting or related to, or that is intended to or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement permitted pursuant to this Section
6.2) or (B) requiring, intended to cause, or which could reasonably be
expected to cause the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement (each an
"Acquisition Agreement"). Any violation of the foregoing restrictions by any
of the Companys Subsidiaries or by any representatives of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such representative is so authorized and
whether or not such representative is purporting to act on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Agreement by the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Company and its board of directors may take
any actions described in clause (ii) of this Section 6.2(a) with respect to a
third party if at any time prior to the Effective Time (x) the Company
receives a written Acquisition Proposal from such third party (and
such Acquisition Proposal was not initiated, solicited, knowingly encouraged
or facilitated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective officers, directors, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants, financial advisors, agents or other representatives) and (y)
such proposal constitutes, or the Companys board of directors determines in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel) that such proposal could reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Superior Proposal, provided that the Company shall not deliver any
information to such third party without entering into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall
be entitled to waive any "standstill" or similar provision in any Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement which would preclude such Person from making an
Acquisition Proposal to the Company, provided that such waiver is for the
limited purpose of enabling such Person to make an Acquisition Proposal
to the Company during the 45-day period following execution of such
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, and any such waiver shall not
constitute a breach of this Section 6.2. Nothing contained in this Section
6.2 shall prohibit the Company or its board of directors from taking and
disclosing to the Companys shareholders a position with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal to the extent required by Applicable Law.

  



  

33   

     
   

  



  

(b) Neither (i) the Companys board of directors nor any committee thereof
shall directly or indirectly (A) withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner
adverse to Purchaser or Merger Sub), or publicly propose to withdraw (or
amend or modify in a manner adverse to Purchaser or Merger Sub), the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Companys
board of directors or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the
merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B)
recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or
approve, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in this clause (i)
being referred to as a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change") nor (ii)
shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries execute or enter into an
Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to
the Effective Time, and subject to the Companys compliance at all times with
the provisions of this Section 6.2 and Section 2.6, in response to a Superior
Proposal, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its
right to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a
Superior Proposal (X) until three Business Days after the Company provides
written notice to Purchaser (a "Company Notice") advising Purchaser that the
Companys board of directors or a committee thereof has received a Superior
Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal, and identifying the Person or group making such Superior Proposal
and (Y) if during such three Business Day period, Purchaser proposes any
alternative transaction (including any modifications to the terms of this
Agreement), unless the Companys board of directors determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
and taking into account all financial, legal, and regulatory terms
and conditions of such alternative transaction proposal) that such
alternative transaction proposal is not at least as favorable to the Company
and its shareholders from a financial point of view as the Superior Proposal
(it being understood that any change in the financial or other material terms
of a Superior Proposal shall require a new Company Notice and a new three
Business Day period under this Section 6.2(b)).

  



  

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this Section 6.2, as promptly as practicable after receipt
thereof, the Company shall advise Purchaser in writing of any request for
information or any Acquisition Proposal received from any Person, or any
inquiry, discussions or negotiations with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, and the terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry, discussions or negotiations, and the Company shall promptly provide
to Purchaser copies of any written materials received by the Company in
connection with any of the foregoing, and the identity of the Person or group
making any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry or with whom any
discussions or negotiations are taking place. The Company agrees that it
shall simultaneously provide to Purchaser any non-public information
concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries provided to any other Person or
group in connection with any Acquisition Proposal which was not previously
provided to Purchaser. The Company and shall keep Purchaser fully informed of
the status of any Acquisition Proposals (including the identity of the
parties and price involved and any changes to any material terms
and conditions thereof). The Company agrees not to release any third party
from, or waive any provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement
to which it is a party.

  



  

34   

     
   

  



  

(d) Immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and their respective officers,
directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
agents to, cease and terminate any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
possible Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it shall (i) take the
necessary steps to promptly inform its officers, directors, investments
bankers, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors, agents or other
representatives involved in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
of the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.2 and (ii) request each
Person who has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection
with such Persons consideration of acquiring the Company or any portion
thereof to return or destroy (which destruction shall be certified in writing
by an executive officer of such Person) all confidential
information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on the Companys
behalf.

  



  

(e) For purposes of this Section 6.2:

  



  

(i) For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any
bona fide proposal, whether or not in writing, for the (i) direct or indirect

or indirect acquisition or purchase of 10% or more of any class of equity
securities or capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose
business constitutes 10% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of

consolidation, restructuring, transfer of assets or other business
combination, sale of shares of capital stock, tender offer, exchange offer,
recapitalization, stock repurchase program or other similar transaction that
if consummated would result in any Person or Persons beneficially owning 10%
or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 10% or more of the net revenues, net
income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(ii) The term "Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal made by a third party to acquire (which term shall
include a parent to parent merger or other business combination with a
similar result), directly or indirectly, pursuant to a tender offer, exchange
offer, merger, share exchange, consolidation or other business combination,
(A) 50% or more of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (B) 50% or more of the equity securities of the Company, in each
case on terms which the Companys board of directors determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
and taking into account all financial, legal and regulatory terms and
conditions of the Acquisition Proposal and this Agreement, including any
alternative transaction (including any modifications to the terms of this
Agreement) proposed by Purchaser in response to such Superior Proposal,
including any conditions to and expected timing of

  



  

35   

     
   

  



  

consummation, and any risks of non-consummation, of such Acquisition
Proposal) to be superior to the Company and its shareholders (in their
capacity as shareholders) from a financial point of view as compared to the
transactions contemplated hereby and to any alternative transaction
(including any modifications to the terms of this Agreement) proposed by
Purchaser hereto pursuant to this Section 6.2.

  



  

6.3 _Access to Information_.

  



  

From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Purchaser and to its
officers, employees, accountants, counsel and its authorized representatives
(including environmental consultants) reasonable access during normal
business hours upon reasonable prior notice all of its properties, contracts,
books, commitments, records, data and books and personnel and, during such
period, the Company shall furnish to Purchaser upon request (a) a copy of
each report, letter, registration statement and other document filed
or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of the
Exchange Act and (b) such other information used in the operation of its
business as Purchaser may reasonably request and the provision of which is
not inconsistent with Applicable Laws or would represent a material breach of
any agreements. Purchaser and its authorized representatives will conduct
all such inspections in a manner which will minimize any disruptions of the
business and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Until the
Effective Time, Purchaser will hold any such information in accordance with
the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement and will cause such
information to be so held by their Representatives (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement). Upon a termination of this Agreement pursuant to

hold confidential) all information provided pursuant to this Section 6.3
and all other Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement)
pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement.

proper or advisable under Applicable Laws to consummate and make effective

best efforts to satisfy the conditions precedent to the obligations of any of
the parties hereto, to obtain all necessary authorizations, consents and

request in connection with the foregoing and will provide the other parties
with copies of all filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity or
any other information supplied by such party to a Governmental Entity in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

36   

     
   

  



  

(b) The Company shall (i) take all actions necessary to ensure that no
Applicable Law relating to state takeover or business combination matters or
any similar Applicable Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the
merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(ii) if any such Applicable Law or similar Applicable Law becomes applicable
to this Agreement, the merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the merger and

the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1.

  



  

6.8 _Employee Benefits_.

respect to any employee, officer, director or executive or former employee,
officer, director or executive of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof,
including the Plans in existence as of the date hereof, and that are
disclosed in Section 4.9 of the Company Disclosure Letter. Nothing herein
shall be construed to prohibit the Surviving Corporation from amending or
terminating such contracts, agreements, arrangements, policies, plans and
commitments in accordance with the terms thereof and with Applicable Law.

  



  

(b) In addition to the foregoing, Purchaser hereby agrees that, for a period
of six months after the Effective Time, it shall continue to maintain
benefits for

  



  

38   

     
   

  



  

the employees and former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries which
in the aggregate are no less favorable taken as a whole (on a value or cost
basis) than those provided to them under the Plans on the date hereof.

  



  

(c) For purposes of all employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements
maintained by or contributed to by Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to cause each
such plan, program or arrangement to treat the prior service with the Company
and its Affiliates of each person who is an employee or former employee of
the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (a
"Company Employee") (to the same extent such service is recognized under
analogous plans, programs or arrangements of the Company or its Affiliates
prior to the Effective Time) as service rendered to the Surviving
Corporation, for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (and only
for purposes of benefit accrual and determination of benefit levels solely
with respect to service awards, vacation and severance); provided, however,
that any benefits provided by the Surviving Corporation under any (i)
ERISA Plans, (ii) nonqualified employee benefit or deferred compensation
plans, stock option, bonus or incentive plans or (iii) other employee benefit
or fringe benefit programs, that may be in effect generally for employees of
the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries from time to time, shall be
reduced by benefits in respect of the same years of service under analogous
plans, programs and arrangements maintained by or contributed to by the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries. Surviving
Corporation shall (x) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to the Company Employees under any welfare benefit
plans that such Company Employees may be eligible to participate in after the
Effective Time, other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in
effect with respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of
the Effective Time under any welfare benefit plan maintained for the Company
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) provide each
Company Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior
to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-
pocket requirements under any welfare plans that such employees are eligible
to participate in after the Effective Time.

  



  

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates to employ any Company Employee for any length of time
following the Effective Time. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
shall be construed to prevent Purchaser or its Affiliates from (i)
terminating, or modifying the terms of employment of, any Company Employee
following the Effective Time or (ii) terminating or modifying to any extent
in accordance with its terms any Company benefit plan or any other employee
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement that Purchaser or its
Affiliates may establish or maintain; provided, however, that to the extent
that, and for so long as, a Company Employee remains employed by Purchaser or
any of its Subsidiaries during the [six month] period following the Effective
Time, the compensation and benefits payable to such employee during such
period shall be subject to Section 6.8(b).
