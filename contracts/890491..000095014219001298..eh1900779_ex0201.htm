(c) _Effect on Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub, any Company Stockholder or any other Person, each outstanding share of
Merger Sub Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, par value
$0.01 per share (the " _Surviving Corporation Common Stock_ "). Such shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock shall constitute the only outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation as of immediately
following the Effective Time.

  

(d) _Changes to Stock_. If at any time during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Company
Common Stock shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split or combination, split-up, exchange or readjustment of shares or
any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, or any
similar transaction or event, the Merger Consideration and any other similarly
dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to
provide the holders of shares of Company Common Stock the same economic effect
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

  

(e) _Dissenting Shares; Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, Dissenting Shares shall not be converted
into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with _Section 2.6(b)_ , but shall be entitled only to such rights as are
granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares (and at the Effective
Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights set forth in
Section 262 under the DGCL), unless and until such holder shall have failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or otherwise lost such holder's
right to appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their
status as such (by the holder thereof effectively withdrawing, failing to
perfect, or otherwise losing such holder's appraisal rights under the DGCL
with respect to such shares), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or
the date of loss of such status, such shares shall thereupon be deemed to have
been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.6(b)_ , without interest, and
shall not thereafter be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give
Parent prompt notice of any demand for appraisal of shares of Company Common
Stock received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other
documents or instruments received by the Company relating to Section 262 of
the DGCL or stockholder demands or claims thereunder. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make
any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands,
or agree to do any of the foregoing. Parent shall have the right to
participate in and direct and control all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands.

  

  

 

17  

  

Section 2.7 _Exchange of Certificates and Book Entry Shares_.

  

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select an
institution reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the exchange agent
(the " _Exchange Agent_ ") in the Merger for the purpose of exchanging
Certificates and Book Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration. Parent will
make available to the Exchange Agent, at or prior to the Effective Time, cash
in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.6(b)_ (such amount, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Promptly after the
Effective Time, Parent will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to
each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a
Certificate ( _i_ ) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent or by appropriate guarantee of delivery in the form customarily
used in transactions of this nature from a member of a national securities
exchange, a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or a
commercial bank or trust company in the United States) for use in effecting
delivery of shares to the Exchange Agent and ( _ii_ ) instructions for
effecting the surrender of Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration issuable and payable in respect thereof. Exchange of any Book
Entry Shares shall be effected in accordance with the Company's customary
procedures with respect to securities represented by book entry.

  

(b) _Exchange Procedure_. Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that
have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in _Section 2.6(b)_ , upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or
compliance with Parent's customary procedure with respect to the exchange of
Book Entry Shares, will be entitled to receive cash in an amount equal to the
Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 2.6_. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger
Consideration payable to holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares. Until
so surrendered, each Certificate and Book Entry Share shall, after the
Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive such
Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.6(b)_.

  

(c) _Certificate Holder_. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be
paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable
surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to the payment
thereof that the surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
delivery of the Merger Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

  

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights_. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance
with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to shares of Company Common Stock,
subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay any
dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the
Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the Company on such
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
or prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the
Effective Time, and after the Effective Time

  

  

 

18  

  

there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificates or Book Entry Shares formerly representing shares of
Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article II_.

  

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investment thereof) that remains undistributed
to the Company Stockholders for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any Company Stockholder who has not
theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim for the
Merger Consideration.

  

(f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange
Fund delivered to a public official to the extent required by any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Immediately prior to such time as
any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by former holders of Company
Common Stock would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority, such Merger Consideration shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen,
defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and,
if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in respect of such lost,
stolen, defaced or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration with respect
to each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate.

  

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Exchange
Agent shall each be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted
and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under any applicable
Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, such withheld
amounts shall be remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority and shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  

Section 2.8 _Company Equity Awards_.

  

(a) _Equity Award Merger Consideration_. Except as otherwise expressly agreed
in writing with the holder of the applicable Company Equity Award, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned upon the occurrence
of the Effective Time, each Company Equity Award shall be cancelled and
treated in the following manner:

  

  

 

19  

  

(i) _Company Stock Options_. As of the Effective Time, each then outstanding
Company Stock Option (whether or not vested or exercisable and automatically
without any further action required of the holder of any such Company Stock
Option) shall be cancelled and the holder thereof shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto but shall instead be entitled to receive an amount
in cash equal to the result of ( _A_ ) the product of ( _x_ ) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option multiplied
by ( _y_ ) the Merger Consideration, minus ( _B_ ) the aggregate exercise
price of such Company Stock Option (the " _Stock Option Merger Consideration_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the per share exercise price of any such
Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration,
such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled and terminated without any cash
payment being made in respect thereof. Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay the Stock Option Merger Consideration, without interest
thereon, at the Effective Time or as soon practicable thereafter (but in no
event later than the date which is the later of ( _x_ ) seven Business Days
after the Effective Time and ( _y_ ) the date of the Company's first regularly
scheduled payroll after the Effective Time).

  

(ii) _Company Restricted Stock_. As of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each then outstanding share of Company Restricted Stock (automatically
without any further action required of the holder of any such Company
Restricted Stock) shall be fully vested and such shares of Company Restricted
Stock, after any applicable reduction for withholding, shall be treated in the
same manner as all other outstanding shares of Company Common Stock pursuant
to _Section 2.6_.

  

(iii) _Company RSUs_. As of the Effective Time, each then outstanding Company
RSU (whether or not vested and automatically without any further action
required of the holder of any such Company RSU) shall be cancelled and the
holder thereof shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto but shall
instead be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of ( _A_
) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying all Company RSUs
held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (
_B_ ) the Merger Consideration (the " _RSU Merger Consideration_ "). Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the RSU Merger Consideration,
without interest thereon, at the Effective Time or as soon practicable
thereafter (but in no event later than the date which is the later of ( _x_ )
seven Business Days after the Effective Time and ( _y_ ) the date of the
Company's first regularly scheduled payroll after the Effective Time).

  

(iv) _Company PSUs_. As of the Effective Time, each then outstanding Company
PSU (whether or not vested and automatically without any further action
required of the holder of any such Company PSU) shall be cancelled and the
holder thereof shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto but shall
instead be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of ( _A_
) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying all Company PSUs
held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time, determined based
on the greater of ( _x_ ) the target level of shares subject to such Company
PSU or ( _y_ ) the number of Company PSUs earned based on performance through
the Effective Time, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board
of Directors of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time,
multiplied by ( _B_ ) the Merger Consideration (the " _PSU Merger
Consideration_ " and, together with the Stock Option Merger Consideration and
the RSU Merger Consideration, the " _Equity Award Merger Consideration_ ").
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay

  

  

 

20  

  

the PSU Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, at the Effective Time
or as soon practicable thereafter (but in no event later than the date which
is the later of ( _x_ ) seven Business Days after the Effective Time and ( _y_
) the date of the Company's first regularly scheduled payroll after the
Effective Time).

  

(b) _Termination of Incentive Plan_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of
Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof
administering the Incentive Plan and/or Company Equity Awards) shall take all
actions necessary to approve and effectuate the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 2.8_ and the other provisions of this Agreement applicable to the
Company Equity Awards under the Incentive Plan and any agreements issued under
the Incentive Plan, including ( _i_ ) making any determinations and/or
resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company or a committee thereof or
any administrator of the Incentive Plan as may be necessary and ( _ii_ )
providing all Company Equity Award holders with any advance notice required
under the Incentive Plan and terminating the Incentive Plan effective as of
the Effective Time, so that, following the Effective Time, there shall be no
outstanding Incentive Plan, Company Equity Awards (vested or unvested) or
obligations or Liabilities to holders of Company Equity Awards, other than
payment of the Equity Award Merger Consideration as set forth in this _Section
2.8_. The Company (including the Board of Directors of the Company and each
relevant committee thereof) will take all actions necessary to ensure that,
following the Effective Time, no participant in the Incentive Plan or other
similar incentive equity or stock plan will have any right thereunder to
acquire any equity securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Subsidiaries.

  

Section 2.9 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation or Parent reasonably believes or is advised that any
further instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary
or desirable to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement, then
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective officers and directors
shall execute and deliver all such proper deeds, assignments, instruments and
assurances and do all other things reasonably necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes and intent of this Agreement.

permitted by _Section 5.15(a)_ or as otherwise agreed to in writing by the
Company, no such amendment, restatement or modification thereto is
contemplated; provided that the existence or exercise of "market flex"
provisions contained in the Fee Letters shall not constitute an amendment or
modification of the Debt Financing Commitment Letter. As of the date of this
Agreement, the Financing Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and
constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the
knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, enforceable against each party
thereto in accordance with its terms (in each case, except as such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, rehabilitation, liquidation, preferential
transfer, moratorium and similar Laws now or hereafter affecting creditors'
rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at equity

expected to constitute a default) on the part of any party to the Financing

  

  

 

42  

  

Commitment Letters, under the Financing Commitment Letters, and ( _ii_ )
Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing
Commitments will not be satisfied (or that the full amount of the Equity
Financing and the full amount of the Debt Financing will not be available to
Parent) on or prior to the Closing Date. Parent has fully paid any and all
commitment and other fees, costs and expenses that are required to be paid on
or prior to the date of this Agreement pursuant to the Financing Commitment

best efforts to cause the Representatives of the Company to, immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any Person (other than an Excluded Party for so long as such
Person or group is an Excluded Party) conducted heretofore with respect to any
Alternative Transaction Proposal and, with respect to any such Person with
whom such activities, discussions or negotiations have been terminated, the
Company shall promptly require such Person to return or destroy, in accordance
with the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement, any information

48  

  

promptly terminate access by any Person (other than an Excluded Party for so

and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the
Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article VII_ , the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries,
officers, directors and employees not to, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, ( _i_ )
solicit or initiate, or knowingly induce, facilitate or encourage, any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative Transaction Proposal, ( _ii_
) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect

statement approving or recommending, or enter into any agreement relating to,
any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Alternative Transaction Proposal, except in each case
as provided herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the Company and its Representatives may ( _A_
) seek to clarify the terms and conditions of any proposal or offer to
determine whether such inquiry or proposal would reasonably be expected to
lead to a Superior Proposal and ( _B_ ) inform any Person that makes an
Alternative Transaction Proposal of the restrictions imposed by this _Section
5.2_. Promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a list of the Excluded Parties and a summary
of the material terms of the Alternative Transaction Proposals submitted by
such parties.

  

(b) _Superior Proposal_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
_Section 5.2(a)_ , ( _x_ ) in the event that the Company receives after the
date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, a bona fide written Alternative Transaction Proposal that did not
result from a breach of this _Section 5.2_ and that the Company Special
Committee determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisor) to be, or to be reasonably likely to lead to, a
Superior Proposal, or ( _y_ ) prior to the Keep-Shop Expiration Time, with
respect to any Alternative Transaction Proposal made by an Excluded Party, the
Company and its Representatives may then take the following actions:

  

(i) Furnish any nonpublic information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person or group (and their respective Representatives)
making such Alternative Transaction Proposal and afford access to the
business, properties, assets, books and records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that prior to furnishing any such information, it
receives from such Person or group (other than an Excluded Party which is
already party to a confidentiality agreement with the Company) an executed
confidentiality agreement containing terms at least as restrictive in all
applicable matters as the terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
(other than de minimis differences); _provided_ , _further_ , that such
information has previously been made available to Parent or is provided
promptly to Parent; and

  

(ii) Engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person or group (and
their Representatives) with respect to such Alternative Transaction Proposal.

  

  

 

49  

  

In no event may the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
Representatives directly or indirectly reimburse or pay, or agree to reimburse
or pay, the fees, costs or expenses of, or provide or agree to provide any
compensation to, any Person or group (or any of its or their Representatives
or potential financing sources) who makes an Alternative Transaction Proposal.

  

(c) _Notification_. In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in
_Sections 5.2(a)_ , ( _b_ ), ( _d_ ) and ( _e_ ) hereof, as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within 24 hours) following receipt of any
Alternative Transaction Proposal by the Company, the Company shall ( _i_ )
provide Parent with written notice of such Alternative Transaction Proposal
(other than an Alternative Transaction Proposal made by an Excluded Party
prior to the date hereof), which notice shall include a summary of the
material terms thereof (including, if applicable, copies of any written
requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and the name of
the Person or group making such Alternative Transaction Proposal and ( _ii_ )
provide Parent with all information as is reasonably necessary to keep Parent
informed on a current basis of all material oral or written communications
regarding, and the status and terms of, any Alternative Transaction Proposal
(including any material amendments thereto) (including any Alternative

(d) _Changes of Recommendation; Termination_. Neither the Board of Directors
of the Company nor any committee thereof shall, directly or indirectly, except
as expressly permitted by _Section 5.2(e)_ , ( _i_ ) ( _A_ ) withdraw,
withhold or qualify (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent) or
publicly propose to withdraw, withhold or qualify (or amend or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent), the approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by such Board of Directors or any committee thereof of this
Agreement, or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, ( _B_ ) publicly recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly
to recommend, adopt or approve, any Alternative Transaction Proposal, ( _C_ )
fail to include in the Proxy Statement a statement to the effect that the
Company Special Committee has recommended that the Company Stockholders vote
in favor of adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholders' Meeting or
( _D_ ) if an Alternative Transaction Proposal has been publicly disclosed,
fail to publicly recommend against any such Alternative Transaction Proposal
within ten Business Days of the request of Parent and reaffirm the Board of
Directors' recommendation that the Company Stockholders adopt this Agreement
within such ten Business Day period upon such request ( _provided_ , that
Parent may only make one such request with respect to such Alternative
Transaction Proposal or with respect to any material amendment thereto) (any
action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or ( _ii_ ) approve or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
other similar agreement, arrangement or understanding ( _A_ ) constituting, or
providing for, any Alternative Transaction Proposal or ( _B_ ) requiring it
(or that would require it) to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section 5.2(d)_ ,
at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval: ( _x_ ) the
Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof may make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change in

  

  

 

50  

  

response to an Intervening Event if the Board of Directors of the Company or
such committee has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties
under applicable Law or ( _y_ ) the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof may, following receipt of a bona fide written Alternative
Transaction Proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section 5.2_
and that the Board of Directors of the Company or such committee determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor) constitutes a Superior Proposal, make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or cause the Company to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(i)_ in order to enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal (a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_
"), but only if the Board of Directors of the Company or such committee has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate
this Agreement and enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Prior to the Company taking
any action permitted:

  

(i) under _Section 5.2(e)(x)_ , ( _I_ ) the Company shall have ( _1_ )
provided Parent four Business Days' prior written notice (such period of time,

Intervening Event has occurred, ( _y_ ) provide a reasonably detailed
description of such Intervening Event and ( _z_ ) state that the Company
intends to make an Adverse Recommendation Change, ( _2_ ) to the extent
requested by Parent, engaged (and used its reasonable best efforts to cause
its Representatives to engage) in good faith negotiations with Parent during
the Company Notice Period to amend this Agreement in a manner that would
obviate the need to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, ( _3_ )
considered in good faith any bona fide offer made by Parent to the Company
during the Company Notice Period and ( _II_ ) following the expiration of the
Company Notice Period, and taking into account any negotiations with, or
consideration of any bona fide offers made by, Parent during the Company
Notice Period, the Board of Directors of the Company or the applicable
committee thereof again makes the determination set forth in _Section
5.2(e)(x)_ ;

  

(ii) under _Section 5.2(e)_ ( _y_ ), with respect to a Superior Proposal
received ( _A_ ) from a Person or Group who is not an Excluded Party or ( _B_
) following the Keep-Shop Expiration Time, ( _I_ ) the Company shall have (
_1_ ) provided Parent four Business Days' prior written notice, which notice
shall state ( _x_ ) that the Company has received a Superior Proposal, ( _y_ )
the material terms of such Superior Proposal and ( _z_ ) that the Company
intends to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this
Agreement and enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement, ( _2_ ) to the
extent requested by Parent, engaged (and used its reasonable best efforts to
cause its Representatives to engage) in good faith negotiations with Parent
during the Company Notice Period to amend this Agreement and ( _3_ )
considered in good faith any bona fide offer made by Parent to the Company
during the Company Notice Period, and ( _II_ ) following the expiration of the
Company Notice Period, and taking into account any negotiations with, or
consideration of any bona fide offers made by, Parent during the Company
Notice Period, the Board of Directors of the Company or the applicable
committee thereof again makes the determination set forth in _Section
5.2(e)(y)_ (it being understood and agreed that any amendments or other
revisions to the financial terms or any other material term of any Alternative
Transaction Proposal that was previously the subject of a notice hereunder
will be

  

  

 

51  

  

deemed to be a new Alternative Transaction Proposal, and shall require a new
notice to Parent as provided above, but, with respect to any such subsequent
notice, the Company Notice Period shall be deemed to be three Business Days);
or

  

(iii) with respect to a Superior Proposal received from an Excluded Party
prior to the Keep-Shop Expiration Time, ( _A_ ) the Company shall have ( _1_ )
provided Parent two Business Days' prior written notice (the " _Keep-Shop
Notice Period_ "), which notice shall state ( _x_ ) that the Company has
received a Superior Proposal from an Excluded Party, ( _y_ ) the material
terms of such Superior Proposal and ( _z_ ) that the Company intends to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement and enter
into a Company Acquisition Agreement, ( _2_ ) to the extent requested by
Parent, engaged (and used its reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to engage) in good faith negotiations with Parent during the
Keep-Shop Notice Period to amend this Agreement, and ( _3_ ) considered in
good faith any bona fide offer made by Parent to the Company during the Keep-
Shop Notice Period, and ( _B_ ) following the expiration of the Keep-Shop
Notice Period and any negotiations with, or consideration of any bona fide
offers made by, Parent during the Keep-Shop Notice Period, the Company Special
Committee again makes the determination set forth in _Section 5.2(e)(y)_ (it
being understood and agreed that any amendments or other revision to the
financial terms or any other material terms of any Alternative Transaction
Proposal that was previously the subject of a notice hereunder will be deemed
to be a new Alternative Transaction Proposal, and shall require a new notice
to Parent as provided above).

  

(f) _Tender Offer Rules_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit
the Company or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof, including the
Company Special Committee, from ( _i_ ) taking and disclosing to the Company
Stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to Company Stockholders
in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange
offer); _provided_ that this _Section 5.2(f)_ shall not permit the Board of
Directors or any committee thereof, including the Company Special Committee,
to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change except to the extent otherwise
specifically permitted by this _Section 5.2_ or ( _ii_ ) making any "stop,
look and listen" communication to the Company Stockholders of the nature
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act.

(vi) The Company shall ( _A_ ) as promptly as practicable notify Parent of (
_1_ ) the receipt of any comments from the SEC and all other written
correspondence and oral communications with the SEC relating to the Proxy

to the Proxy Statement or for additional information with respect thereto and
( _B_ ) supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between it or any of
its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with
respect to the Proxy Statement or the Merger. No response to any comments from
the SEC or the staff of the SEC relating to the Proxy Statement shall be made
by the Company without providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon unless pursuant to a telephone call initiated by the SEC, and
the Company shall consider in good faith all comments reasonably proposed by
Parent.

  

(vii) Each of Parent and the Company shall ensure that none of the information
supplied by or on its behalf for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Proxy Statement will, at the time the Proxy Statement is first mailed to
the Company Stockholders and at the time of the meeting of Company
Stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders ' Meeting_"), contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

  

(viii) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers is discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub which
is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement so that such document would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by Law, disseminated to the Company Stockholders.

  

(b) _Company Stockholders ' Meeting_.

  

(iv) The Company shall duly give notice of, convene and hold the Company

recommend to its stockholders adoption of this Agreement and include in the
Proxy Statement such recommendation and ( _B_ ) use its reasonable best
efforts to solicit such adoption and obtain the Company Stockholder Approval.
The Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders' Meeting to the
extent necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the
Proxy Statement is provided to its stockholders

  

  

 

53  

  

in advance of a vote on the adoption of this Agreement, or, if, as of the time
for which the Company Stockholders' Meeting is originally scheduled, there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such
meeting. The Company shall ensure that the Company Stockholders' Meeting is
called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited
in connection with the Company Stockholders' Meeting are solicited in
compliance with applicable Law, the rules of NYSE and the Company Charter and
the Company Bylaws. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company's obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.3(b)(i)_ (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, are subject to _Section 5.2(e)_ ) shall not be affected by
the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of any Alternative Transaction Proposal or by a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance
with _Section 7.1(c)(i)_.

  

(v) Except to the extent expressly permitted by _Section 5.2(e)_ , ( _A_ ) the

effect that the Company Special Committee has recommended that the Company
Stockholders vote in favor of adoption of this Agreement at the Company
Stockholders' Meeting.

  

Section 5.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

  

(a) _Access to Information_. Upon reasonable prior notice and subject to
applicable Law, from the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its Representatives to, afford Parent and its officers,
directors, employees and Representatives, following notice from Parent in
accordance with this _Section 5.4_, reasonable access during normal business
hours to officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and other
facilities, books and records of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and
all other financial, operating and other data and information as shall be
reasonably requested and, during such period shall furnish, and shall cause to
be furnished, as promptly as reasonably practicable, a copy of each report,
schedule and other document filed or received pursuant to the requirements of
the federal securities laws or a Governmental Authority, except, with respect
to examination reports, as may be restricted by applicable Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to disclose
any information that, in its sole discretion, ( _i_ ) it is not legally
permitted to disclose or the disclosure of which would contravene any
applicable Law or Order or ( _ii_ ) the disclosure of which would be
reasonably likely to cause the loss or waiver of any attorney-client or other
legal privilege or trade secret protection; _provided_ , that the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to implement reasonable measures to
permit the disclosure of such information in a manner that removes the basis
for the objection, including by arrangement of appropriate clean room
procedures, redaction or entry into a customary joint defense agreement with
respect to any information to be so provided, if the Company determines, in
its sole discretion, that doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of
such information without violating applicable Law or Order or jeopardizing
such privilege. The Company shall be entitled to have Representatives present
at all times during any such inspection, and all inspections granted pursuant
to this _Section 5.4_ shall be subject to the Company's reasonable security
measures and insurance requirements. No investigation pursuant to this
_Section 5.4_ or information provided, made

  

  

 

54  

  

available or delivered pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ or otherwise shall
affect any representations or warranties or conditions or rights contained in
this Agreement.

  

(b) _Limitations_. The Company may, as it deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other under this _Section 5.4_ or _Section 5.5_ as "outside counsel only".
Such material and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside legal counsel of Parent and will not be disclosed by such outside
counsel to employees, officers, or directors of Parent unless express
permission is obtained in advance from the Company or its legal counsel.

  

(c) _Conduct of Business_. Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall give Parent or any of its Affiliates,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company's or its
Subsidiaries' business or operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, maintain and exercise complete control and supervision over
the operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  

(d) _Confidentiality_. All information and materials provided by the Company
to Parent pursuant to this Agreement will be subject to the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, which will remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

(a) _Governmental and Third-Party Approvals_. Subject to _Section 5.5(c)_ ,
each of the parties shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, including ( _i_ ) preparing and
filing, within 10 Business Days after the date hereof, all forms,

Governmental Authority relating to antitrust, competition, trade, pre-merger
notification or other regulatory matters, ( _ii_ ) obtaining all necessary
consents, approvals, authorizations or waivers from, and providing notices to,
third parties, including providing any further information as may be required
by such third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that no consent of any third
party (excluding Governmental Authorities) shall be a condition to the closing
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to _Article VI_ ,
( _iii_ ) the defending of any Actions challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the Merger, including seeking to have vacated or reversed any
Order that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing and ( _iv_ ) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments required by applicable
Law necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to fully
carry out the purposes of this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto shall
furnish to the other parties such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as such other party may reasonably request in connection with the
foregoing. In addition, each of the parties hereto shall consult with the
other with respect to, provide any necessary information with respect to and
provide the other (or its counsel) copies of, all filings made by such party
with any third party or any other information

  

  

 

55  

  

supplied by such party to a third party in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

(b) _Notification_. Each of the Company and Parent shall keep the other
reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the

its reasonable best efforts to: ( _i_ ) promptly notify the other of, and if
in writing, furnish the other with copies of (or, in the case of material oral
communications, advise the other orally of) any material communications from
or with any Governmental Authority or other third party with respect to the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, ( _ii_
) permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good
faith the views of the other in connection with, any proposed written (or any
material proposed oral) communication with any such Governmental Authority or
other third party with respect to the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, ( _iii_ ) to the extent reasonably practical,
not participate in any meeting with ( _A_ ) any Governmental Authority with
respect to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and ( _B_ ) any third party (excluding Governmental Authorities)
with respect to any material consent, approval or waiver in connection with
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in
each case, unless it consults with the other in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority or other third party, as applicable,
gives the other the opportunity to attend and participate thereat, and ( _iv_
) furnish the other with such necessary information and reasonable assistance
as the Company or Parent, as applicable, may reasonably request in connection
with its preparation of necessary filings or submissions of information to any
such third party.

  

(c) _Certain Actions_. In furtherance of the covenants set forth in _Section
5.5(a)_ , if any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under any domestic or foreign antitrust or Competition Law
or if any Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the Federal
Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any other applicable
Governmental Authority under any domestic or foreign antitrust or Competition
Law challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby or which would
otherwise prohibit or materially impair or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, Parent shall take any and all actions
necessary to resolve any such objections or Actions (or threatened Actions) so
as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby to close as
soon as reasonably practicable.

  

(d) _Control of Process_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, but subject to Parent's obligations set forth in this
Section 5.5, Parent shall have the right, following consultation with the
Company and after giving due consideration to its views and acting reasonably
and in good faith, to direct all matters with any Governmental Authority
consistent with its obligations hereunder and Parent shall have the principal
responsibility for devising and implementing the strategy for obtaining any
necessary antitrust or competition clearances.

  

Section 5.6 _State Takeover Statutes_. In connection with and without limiting
the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall ( _a_ ) take all reasonable action
necessary to ensure that no "fair price," "business combination," "control
share acquisition" or other state takeover statute or similar Law is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions

  

  

 

56  

  

contemplated hereby and ( _b_ ) if any "fair price," "business combination,"
"control share acquisition" or other state takeover statute or similar Law
becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that such transactions
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms required by, or
provided for, in this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the
effect of such Law on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by

Section 5.7 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

  

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless the present and former
directors, officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and any
individuals serving in such capacity at or with respect to other Persons
(each, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") from and against any losses, damages,
liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys'
fees), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including
all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with
or in respect of any thereof) in respect of the Indemnified Persons' having
served in such capacity prior to the Effective Time, in each case to the
fullest extent permitted by Delaware Law or any other Law or provided under
the Company Charter and Company Bylaws, each as in effect on the date hereof.
If any Indemnified Person is made party to any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation arising out of or relating to matters that would be
indemnifiable pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, advance fees, costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented attorneys' fees and disbursements) as
incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with and prior to the final
disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation;
_provided_ , that the Indemnified Person shall provide an undertaking to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Person is
not entitled to indemnification.

  

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporation's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries and
agents and advancement of fees, costs and expenses that are no less
advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions
in the Company Charter and Company Bylaws, each as in effect on the date
hereof. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor and comply with their
respective obligations under any indemnification agreement with any
Indemnified Person, and not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such
agreement in any manner that would materially adversely affect any
indemnification right of any Indemnified Person thereunder.

  

(c) Neither Parent nor the Company shall settle, compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual litigation, claim or
proceeding relating to any acts or omissions covered under this _Section 5.7_
(each, a " _Claim_ ") for which indemnification could be sought by an
Indemnified Person hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all
liability arising out of such Claim or such Indemnified Person otherwise
consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent (such consent
not to be unreasonably delayed, withheld or conditioned).

  

  

 

57  

  

The Company, Parent and the Indemnified Persons shall cooperate in the defense
of any Claim and shall provide access to properties and individuals as
reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished records, information
and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, as of the
Effective Time, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable
extension of the directors' and officer's liability coverage of the Company's
existing directors' and officers' insurance policies and the Company's
existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the " _D andO
Insurance_"), which DandO Insurance shall ( _i_ ) be for a claims reporting or
discovery period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time with
respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the
Effective Time, ( _ii_ ) be from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with respect to DandO
Insurance and ( _iii_ ) have terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the
Company's existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged error,
misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or
any matter claimed against an Indemnified Person by reason of his or her
having served in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ , _however_ , that in
no event shall the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
be required to expend for such policies an annual premium in excess of 300% of
the premium amount per annum for the Company's existing policies; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the aggregate premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for
a cost not exceeding such amount. If the Surviving Corporation for any reason
fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at
least six years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place
with the Company's current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with
the same or better credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier
with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the
Company's existing policies, or the Surviving Corporation shall purchase from
the Company's current insurance carrier or from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with
respect to DandO Insurance comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period
with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less
favorable than as provided in the Company's existing policies; _provided_ that
in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend
for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess
of 300% of the premium amount per annum for the Company's existing policies;
and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the aggregate premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

  

(e) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (
_i_ ) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or ( _ii_ ) transfers or conveys all or

  

  

 

58  

  

substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.7_. The
obligations of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any successors or assigns
under this _Section 5.7_ shall continue in full force and effect for a period
of six years from the Effective Time (or if later the expiration of all
statutes of limitation applicable to any such claim); _provided_ , that if any
Claim (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is brought
against an Indemnified Person on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, the provisions of this _Section 5.7_ shall continue in effect
until the full and final resolution of such Claim.

  

Section 5.8 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall consult with
each other before issuing, and will provide each other the reasonable
opportunity to review and reasonably comment upon, and use reasonable best
efforts to agree on, any press release or other public statements with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the
prior written consent of the other party (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), except as either party, after consultation
with outside counsel, may determine is required by applicable Law, court
process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange or stock market if it has used reasonable best efforts to
consult with the other party prior thereto regarding the timing, scope and
content of any such press release or public statement; _provided_ , _however_
, that no such consultation shall be required to make any disclosure or
otherwise take any action expressly permitted by _Section 5.2_. In addition,
except ( _i_ ) to the extent disclosed in or consistent with the Proxy
Statement in accordance with the provisions of _Section 5.3_ , ( _ii_ ) to the
extent necessary to comply with the Company's periodic reporting obligations
under the Exchange Act, ( _iii_ ) for any consent given in accordance with
this _Section 5.8_ or ( _iv_ ) as expressly permitted by _Section 5.2_ ,
neither party shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public
statement or disclosure concerning the other party or the other party's
business, financial condition or results of operations without the consent of
such other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be in the form
agreed to by the parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the issuance of
any press release or the making of any public statement with respect to which
the consultation procedures set forth in this _Section 5.8_ have been
followed, either party may issue such additional publications or press
releases and make such other customary announcements without consulting with
any other party hereto so long as such additional publications, press releases
and announcements do not disclose any non-public information regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement beyond the scope of the disclosure
included in the press release or public statement with respect to which the
other party had been consulted.

  

Section 5.9 _Employee Benefits_.

  

(a) For a period of one year following the Closing Date, the employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries who remain in continuous employment with the
Company and its Subsidiaries following the Closing (the " _Company Employees_
") shall receive ( _i_ ) annual base salary or wages, as applicable, that are
no less than the annual base salary or wages in effect for

  

  

 

59  

  

each such employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, and ( _ii_ )
employee benefits and other compensation that, in the aggregate, are
substantially comparable to the employee benefits (other than defined benefit
pension and post-employment medical benefits and long-term incentive, change
in control, transaction, retention, equity or equity-based compensation and
benefits, provided that Parent shall take the actions set forth on _Section
5.9(a)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter) provided by or on behalf of the
Company to such employee immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
that, except as provided in _Section 5.9(c)_ , nothing contained in this
_Section 5.9_ shall be construed as requiring Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to continue or adopt any
specific plans or to continue the employment of any specific Person;
_provided_ , that Parent or one of its Affiliates shall, as of the Closing
Date, continue the Company Plans set forth on _Section 3.13(e)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter for such longer period as set forth in the applicable
Company Plan.

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, starting on
the Closing Date, Parent and Surviving Corporation shall, for a period ending
on the date one year after the Closing Date, maintain a severance pay practice
for the benefit of each Company Employee that is no less favorable than the
severance pay practice in effect and applicable to such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Company Plans set forth on _Section 3.13(e)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter); _provided_ that in no event shall the provisions of this _Section
5.9(b)_ enlarge or extend the rights of any Company Employee whose severance
benefits are subject to an existing employment, severance or similar
agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that, if the termination of any Company
Employee occurs following the termination of any such employment, severance or
similar agreement and prior to the first anniversary of the Closing, the
applicable Company Employee shall have the severance benefits provided under
the severance pay practice that is in effect and that would otherwise have
applied to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date in the
absence of such employment, severance or similar agreement.

  

(c) With respect to any annual incentive bonuses that may be payable to
Company Employees under the Company's annual bonus plan in respect of the
fiscal year in which the Closing Date occurs, Parent or one of its Affiliates
shall assume and pay such bonuses in the ordinary course of business, subject
to the performance and service requirements (including service through the
applicable payment date) and other terms and conditions of the annual
incentive plan established by the Company prior to the Closing in compliance
with the terms of this Agreement.

  

(d) Parent shall recognize the service of Company Employees with the Company
or its Subsidiaries (or their respective Affiliates) prior to the Closing Date
as service with Parent or its Affiliates in connection with any employee
benefit plans, programs, contracts and arrangements (including 401(k) plans,
severance, vacation, sick leave and holiday policies) maintained by Parent and
its Affiliates which is made available following the Closing Date by Parent
and its Affiliates for purposes of any waiting period, vesting, eligibility
and benefit entitlement (but excluding benefit accruals under any defined
benefit plan and, to the extent permitted by Law, post-employment medical
benefit plan).

  

(e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to ( _i_ ) waive, or cause
its insurance carriers to waive, all limitations as to pre-existing and at-
work conditions, if any, with

  

  

 

60  

  

respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to Company
Employees under any welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA)
which is made available to Company Employees following the Closing Date by
Parent or one of its Affiliates to the extent such limitations or conditions
would have been satisfied or waived under the terms of the comparable Company
Plan prior to Closing, and ( _ii_ ) provide credit to Company Employees for
any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such employees
under the corresponding Company Plan during the portion of the relevant plan
year including the Closing Date.

  

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein, whether express
or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any
employee benefit plan or arrangement, or shall limit the right of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to amend, terminate or
otherwise modify any employee benefit plan or arrangement sponsored by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates following the Closing
Date. In the event that ( _i_ ) a Person not a party to this Agreement makes a
claim or takes other action to enforce any provision in this Agreement as an
amendment to any employee benefit plan or arrangement sponsored by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates, and ( _ii_ ) such provision
is deemed to be an amendment to such plan or arrangement even though not
explicitly designated as such in this Agreement, then such provision shall
lapse retroactively and shall have no amendatory effect.

  

(g) The Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent regarding material
written communications related to the transactions contemplated hereby that
are intended for broad-based and general distribution to any current or former
employees or service providers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and
Parent shall be provided a reasonable opportunity (and reasonable period of
time) to review and offer comments on any such communications prior to the
occurrence of such communication.

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, as the case may be, of ( _i_ ) the occurrence or
non-occurrence of any event of which is likely to cause any representation or
warranty of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to be untrue or
inaccurate at the Closing Date such that the conditions to closing set forth
in _Article VI_ would fail to be satisfied, and ( _ii_ ) any failure by the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, to materially comply with or materially
satisfy any covenant or other agreement to be complied with by it hereunder
such that the conditions to closing set forth in _Article VI_ would fail to be
satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this _Section 5.10(a)_ shall not limit or otherwise affect any remedies
available to Parent or the Company, as the case may be.

  

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any notice or other
communication received by it from any third party, subsequent to the date of
this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, alleging any material breach
of, or material default under, any Company Material Contract. In addition, the
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt
notice to the Company, of any notice or other material communication received
by such party from any third party, subsequent to the date of this Agreement
and prior

  

  

 

61  

  

to the Effective Time, regarding any consent that is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the delivery of notice by the Company to Parent, or Parent to
the Company, as applicable, pursuant to this _Section 5.10(b)_ shall not limit
or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to Parent or the Company,
respectively.

  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will a party's good faith
failure to comply with this _Section 5.10_ provide any other party the right
to not consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except to
the extent that any other provisions of this Agreement independently provide
such a right.

  

Section 5.11 _Certain Litigation_. The Company shall promptly advise Parent of
any Action commenced after the date hereof against the Company or any of its
directors by any Company Stockholder relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and shall keep Parent
reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis regarding any such
litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the
Company regarding the defense or settlement of any such Action and shall
consider in good faith Parent's views with respect to such Action and shall
not settle any such Action without the prior written consent of Parent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Parent shall not
enter into any settlement agreement in respect of any stockholder litigation
against the Company and/or its directors or officers relating to the Merger or
any other transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent
of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld
or delayed.

  

Section 5.12 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the
Company and Parent shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent
permitted under applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Company Common
Stock (including securities deliverable upon exercise, vesting or settlement
of any Company Equity Awards or other derivative securities) resulting from
the transactions contemplated hereby by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  

Section 5.13 _Equity Financing_.

  

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the Equity Financing on the terms
and conditions described in the Equity Commitment Letter, including, but not
limited to, using reasonable best efforts to ( _i_ ) maintain in effect the
Equity Commitment Letter, ( _ii_ ) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions
that are applicable to Parent and its Subsidiaries in the Equity Commitment
Letter and comply with its obligations thereunder and not take or fail to
take, directly or indirectly, any action that would be reasonably expected to
prevent or impede or delay the availability or funding of the Equity Financing
to Parent on the Closing Date and ( _iii_ ) diligently and in good faith
enforce its rights under the Equity Commitment Letter.

  

(b) In the event that all conditions to the Equity Financing have been
satisfied, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Guarantors to fund the Equity Financing

  

  

 

62  

  

on the Closing Date (including by taking enforcement action, which shall
include but is not limited to specific performance, to cause the Guarantors to
fund the Equity Financing).

  

(c) Parent shall not have the right to amend, replace, supplement or otherwise
modify, or consent to or waive any provision or any of its rights under, the
Equity Commitment Letter if such amendment, replacement, supplement,
modification, consent or waiver would ( _i_ ) reduce the aggregate amount of
the Equity Financing from that contemplated in the Equity Commitment Letter to
an amount that would not enable Parent to meet its obligations under this
Agreement, including under _Article II_ , and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and to pay all fees and expenses reasonably expected to be
incurred in connection herewith and with the Equity Financing, ( _ii_ ) impose
new or additional conditions or other terms or otherwise expand upon the
conditions precedent to the Equity Financing as set forth in the Equity
Commitment Letter, ( _iii_ ) prevent or impede or delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or make the timely funding of
the Equity Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Equity
Financing less likely to occur, or ( _iv_ ) adversely impact the ability of
Parent to enforce its rights against the Guarantors when required pursuant to
this Agreement. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company a true and
complete copy of any such amendment or modification.

  

(d) Parent shall give the Company prompt oral and written notice (but in any
event not later than 24 hours after the occurrence or discovery thereof) ( _i_
) of any breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the
Equity Commitment Letter of which Parent becomes aware, ( _ii_ ) of the

to any property or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. In
addition, ( _A_ ) no action, liability or obligation of the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives pursuant to any
certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument relating to the

_Section 5.14_ will require ( _1_ ) any officer or Representative of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to deliver any document (except for the
delivery of the authorization letters set forth in clause ( _vi_ ) above), or
take any action that could reasonably be expected to result in personal
liability to such officer or Representative; or ( _2_ ) the Board of Directors
of the Company or any committee thereof, including the Company Special
Committee, to approve any financing or Contracts related thereto that are

(c) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company (and in any event
within 10 Business Days of such request), reimburse the Company for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the
Company or any of its Affiliates (including reasonable attorneys' fees and

_Section 5.14_.

  

(d) All non-public or other confidential information provided by the Company
or any of its Representatives pursuant to this Agreement will be kept

Financing Sources and other financial institutions and investors that may
become parties to the Debt Financing and to any underwriters, initial
purchasers or placement agents in connection with the Debt Financing (and, in
each case, to their respective counsel and auditors) so long as such Persons (
_i_ ) agree to be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement as if parties thereto
or ( _ii_ ) are subject to other confidentiality undertakings reasonably
satisfactory to the Company and of which the Company is an express third party
beneficiary. The Company shall be permitted to review and comment on those
portions of any confidential information memorandum, offering memorandum, or
other marketing document circulated to potential Debt Financing Sources that
contain or are based upon any such non-public or other confidential
information.

  

(e) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Affiliates
and their respective directors, officers and employees from and against any
and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, fees, costs and expenses

incurred by them in connection with the arrangement and completion of any Debt
Financing, capital markets transactions or related transactions by Parent in
connection with financing the

  

  

 

66  

  

transactions contemplated hereby and any information utilized in connection
therewith, except to the extent such Losses are caused by the bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Company or any of its Affiliates. This
_Section 5.14(e)_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and the Closing
and any termination of this Agreement, and is intended to benefit, and may be
enforced by, the officers and directors of the Company and its Affiliates and
their respective heirs, executors, estates and personal representatives who
are each third party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.14(e)_.

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent
acknowledges and agrees that receipt of the Debt Financing is not a condition
to its obligation to consummate the Merger; it being understood and agreed

(g) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to supplement the
information provided pursuant to this _Section 5.14_ on a reasonably current
basis to the extent that any such information, to the knowledge of the
Company, is not Compliant.

  

(h) The Company hereby consents to the reasonable use of all of the Company's
logos, names and trademarks in connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_
that such logos, names and trademarks shall be used solely in a manner that is
not intended or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of
its respective Subsidiaries, or their reputation or goodwill.

  

Section 5.15 _Debt Financing - Obligations of Parent_.

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt Financing on terms and
conditions not less favorable to Parent than those described in the Debt
Financing Commitment Letter (including any "market flex" provisions applicable
thereto), including using reasonable best efforts to ( _i_ ) negotiate
definitive agreements (such definitive agreements being referred to as the "
_Debt Financing Agreements_ ") with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions contained in the Debt Financing Commitment Letter, (including any
"market flex" provisions applicable thereto) or, if available, on other terms
that are acceptable to Parent and would not materially and adversely affect
the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated herein, ( _ii_ ) satisfy on a timely basis or obtain the waiver
of all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the Debt Financing
Commitment Letter that are within their control, ( _iii_ ) maintain in full
force and effect the Debt Financing Commitment Letter in accordance with the
terms thereof (subject to Parent's right to replace, restate, supplement,
modify, assign, substitute, waive or amend the Debt Financing Commitment
Letter in accordance herewith), ( _iv_ ) in the event that all conditions in
the Debt Financing Commitment Letter have been satisfied, draw down upon and
consummate the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment
Letter at the Closing, and ( _v_ ) take such actions as are reasonably
necessary to enforce its rights under the Debt Financing Commitment Letter in
the event of a breach by the financing sources. Parent shall have the right
from time to time to amend, replace, supplement or otherwise modify, or waive
any of its rights under, the Debt Financing Commitment Letter; _provided_ that
any such amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification to or waiver
of any provision of the Debt Financing Commitment Letter that amends the Debt
Financing shall not, without the prior written consent

  

  

 

67  

  

of the Company, ( _1_ ) reduce the length the commitment period set forth in
the Debt Financing Commitment Letter, ( _2_ ) reduce the aggregate amount of
the Financing such that Parent would not or does not have sufficient cash
proceeds to satisfy Parent's obligations under this Agreement, including under
_Article II_ , and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to
pay all fees and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred in connection
herewith and with the Financing Commitments, ( _3_ ) expand upon the
conditions precedent to the Debt Financing as set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitment Letter or ( _4_ ) be reasonably expected to prevent, materially
impede or materially delay the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that Parent may
replace, amend, supplement or modify the Debt Financing Commitment Letter to
add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities (or titles with respect to such entities) that have not executed the
Debt Financing Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement (it being
understood that the aggregate commitments of the lenders party to the Debt
Financing Commitment Letter prior to such replacement, amendment, supplement
or modification may be reduced in the amount of such additional party's
commitments). Upon any such replacement, amendment, supplement or other
modification of, or waiver under, the Debt Financing Commitment Letter in
accordance with this _Section 5.15_ , the term "Debt Financing Commitment
Letter" (and consequently the terms "Debt Financing," and "Financing" shall
mean the Debt Financing contemplated by such Debt Financing Commitment Letter
as so replaced, amended, supplemented, modified or waived), shall mean such
Debt Financing Commitment Letter as so replaced, amended, supplemented,
modified or waived.

  

(b) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment Letter
(including any "market flex" provisions that are contained in the Fee Letters)
(other than as a result of the failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.3_), Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing or such portion of the Debt Financing
from the same or alternative sources, which may include one or more of a
senior secured debt financing, an offering and sale of notes, or any other
financing or offer and sale of other debt securities, or any combination
thereof, in an amount such that the aggregate funds that would be available to
Parent at the Closing will be sufficient to satisfy Parent's obligations under
this Agreement, including under _Article II_ , and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and to pay all fees and expenses reasonably
expected to be incurred in connection herewith and with the Financing
Commitments (the " _Alternative Financing_ "); _provided_ that Parent shall
not be required to arrange or obtain any Alternative Financing having terms
and conditions (including "market flex" provisions) less favorable to Parent
than those contained in the Debt Financing Commitment Letter; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that any such Alternative Financing shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Company, expand upon the conditions precedent to the
Debt Financing as set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment Letter. In such
event, the term "Debt Financing" as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to
include any Alternative Financing (and consequently the term "Financing" shall
include the Equity Financing and the Alternative Financing), and the term
"Debt Financing Commitment Letter" as used in this Agreement shall be deemed
to include the commitment letter with respect to such Alternative Financing.

  

(c) Parent shall keep the Company informed upon request on a reasonably
current basis and in reasonable detail with respect to all material activity
and developments concerning the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt
Financing. Without limiting the generality

  

  

 

68  

  

of the foregoing, Parent shall notify the Company promptly, and in any event
within two Business Days after it becomes aware thereof, ( _A_ ) of any
termination of the Debt Financing Commitment Letter or the entry into any
material and definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing, ( _B_ ) of
any material breach or default by any party to any Debt Financing Commitment
Letter or definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing of which Parent
becomes aware and that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
availability or amount of the Debt Financing, ( _C_ ) of the receipt by Parent
of any written notice or other written communication (other than negotiations
of the definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing) from any Debt
Financing Source with respect to any material breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to any Debt Financing Commitment Letter or any
definitive agreement related to the Debt Financing or ( _D_ ) if for any
reason Parent has concluded in good faith that it will not be able to obtain
on the Closing Date all or any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by
the Debt Financing Commitment Letter and the related fee letters. In addition,
Parent promptly will provide the Company with copies of all executed
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing.

  

(d) Parent shall not enter into any merger, acquisition, joint venture,
disposition, lease, debt or equity financing or similar transaction that would
reasonably be expected to materially impair, delay or prevent the consummation
of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment Letter.

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent
acknowledges and agrees that receipt of the Debt Financing is not a condition
to its obligation to consummate the Merger; it being understood and agreed
that the Company's sole remedies in the event the Debt Financing is not
received are as set forth in _Section 7.3(c)_ and _Section 8.12(b)_.

  

Section 5.16 _Stock Exchange De-listing and De-registration_. The Company and
Parent shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary
under applicable Laws and the rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the de-
listing from the NYSE and de-registration under the Exchange Act of the
Company Common Stock as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time.

  

Section 5.17 _Cooperation Regarding Amendment_. The Company and Parent shall,
and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, cooperate with the other parties hereto
in good faith and use their respective reasonable best efforts to negotiate
and, as promptly as practicable following the date hereof and consistent with
the terms hereof, enter into, an amendment to this Agreement providing for (
_a_ ) the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby through a
tender offer and merger structure in accordance with DGCL Section 251(h) in
lieu of the Merger and ( _b_ ) other related changes in furtherance of such
structure; _provided_ , that no such amendment shall be executed unless the
Voting Agreement is simultaneously amended to require that the Subject Shares
(as defined in the Voting Agreement) be tendered in the tender offer
contemplated by such amendment and to make other changes appropriate to
reflect such change in structure in a manner reasonably satisfactory to each
of the Company and Parent.

result from ( _a_ ) the intentional failure of any party to fulfill a
condition to the performance of the obligations of any other party or ( _b_ )
the willful breach of a material provision of this Agreement by, or fraud on
the part of, any party, such party shall be fully liable for any and all
damages that are the natural, probable and reasonably foreseeable result of
the event that gave rise thereto (which the parties acknowledge and agree may
not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may
include the benefit of the bargain lost by the applicable party's
stockholders; it being understood that if Parent has received the Company
Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses, the receipt of either such amount will
be taken into account in the calculation of its damages) incurred or suffered
by the other parties as a result of such failure; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that for the purposes of this _Section 7.2_ , "willful breach of a material
provision" means a breach of any material covenant or agreement of a party
hereunder that is the consequence of an act or omission taken or failed to be
taken with knowledge that the taking of such action or failure to take such
action by the Person taking or failing to take such action would be a breach
of any material covenant or agreement of such party ( _provided_ that the
knowledge of any officer, director, employee or Representative of such party
who would reasonably be expected to know, or after reasonable due inquiry
would learn that the taking of such act or failure to take such action would
be a breach of any such material covenant or agreement, will be imputed to
such Person). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the obligations
set forth in _Section 5.4(d)_ (Confidentiality), the reimbursement obligations
of Parent pursuant to _Section 5.14(c)_ , the indemnification obligations of
Parent pursuant to _Section 5.14(e)_ , this _Section 7.2_ and _Section 7.3_
(Payments), as well as _Article VIII_ (General), shall survive any termination
of this Agreement. No termination of this Agreement shall affect the
obligations of the parties contained in the Confidentiality Agreement or the

  

  

 

73  

  

Guaranty, all of which obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement
in accordance with their terms.

  

Section 7.3 _Payments_.

  

(a) _Company Termination Fee_. In the event that:

  

(i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(i)_ ,
other than any such termination prior to or at the Keep-Shop Expiration Time
(as such Keep-Shop Expiration Time may be extended in accordance with _Section
7.3(b)_ ) to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with an Excluded
Party;

  

(ii) prior to the Company Stockholders' Meeting, or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof, in any case, at which a final vote with respect to the
Company Stockholder Approval was taken, Parent terminates this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ ; or

  

(iii) ( _A_ ) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ or _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ , ( _B_ ) before the
date of such termination (or, in the case of a termination pursuant to
_Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ , prior to the Company Stockholders' Meeting, or any
adjournment or postponement thereof, in either case, at which a final vote
with respect to the Company Stockholder Approval was taken), an Alternative
Transaction Proposal has been made to the Company, the Board of Directors of
the Company or the Company Special Committee, or is publicly announced or
otherwise becomes publicly known, and ( _C_ ) within twelve months after the
date of termination, the Company consummates an Alternative Transaction or
enters into a definitive agreement with respect to an Alternative Transaction
(and such Alternative Transaction is subsequently consummated, whether or not
such consummation occurs during such twelve-month period) ( _provided_ that
for purposes of this _Section 7.3(a)(iii)_ , all references to "20%" in the
definition of Alternative Transaction shall be deemed to be references to
"50%");

  

then, in any case, the Company shall pay such Person as is designated by
Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, a one-time fee equal
to $17,500,000 (the " _Company Termination Fee_ "), ( _x_ ) at or prior to the
termination of this Agreement in the case of a termination pursuant to
_Section 7.1(c)(i)_ , ( _y_ ) as promptly as practicable (and, in any event,
within two Business Days following such termination) in the case of a
termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ or ( _z_ ) if payable pursuant to
_Section 7.3(a)(iii)_ , as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within
two Business Days) after the date on which the last applicable event
referenced therein occurs.

  

(b) _Parent Expenses_. In the event that the Company terminates this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(i)_ prior to or at the Keep-Shop Expiration Time
to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with an Excluded Party, then the
Company shall pay such Person as is designated by Parent, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the documented out-of-pocket expenses theretofore
incurred by Parent and its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and
the Financing up to an aggregate amount of $4,000,000 (the " _Parent Expenses_
") as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within two Business Days
following such termination). For all purposes under this Agreement, in the
event that any Keep-

  

  

 

74  

  

Shop Notice Period begins pursuant to _Section 5.3(e)(iii)(A)(1)_ after June
11, 2019 and prior to June 14, 2019, the Keep-Shop Expiration Time for such
Superior Proposal and any amendments thereto will be deemed to occur two
Business Days after the commencement of the final Keep Shop Notice Period with
respect thereto.

  

(c) _Parent Termination Fee_. In the event this Agreement is terminated by the
Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ or _Section 7.1(c)(iii)_ , Parent
shall pay the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, a one-
time fee equal to $30,000,000 (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ") within two
Business Days following such termination.

  

(d) _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, each party
shall bear its own expenses in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

(e) _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_.

  

(i) Subject to the Company's right to specific performance set forth in
_Section 8.12_ (and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 7.2_
) and the rights of the Company to enforce the Equity Commitment Letter and
the Guaranty, ( _A_ ) the Company's right to receive payment of the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_ (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, from the Guarantors pursuant to their respective obligations under the
Guaranty, subject to the limitations contained therein) shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) of the Company, its Subsidiaries and its and their Affiliates
against Parent, Merger Sub and any former, current or future direct or
indirect equity holder, controlling Person, general or limited partner,
stockholder, member, manager, director, officer, employee, agent, Affiliate,
assignee, representative or Debt Financing Source of Parent or Merger Sub (any
such Person, other than Parent and Merger Sub, a " _Parent Recourse Related
Party_ ") for any damages suffered as a result of the failure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated, whether at law
or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and ( _B_ ) except ( _1_ ) as
provided in the immediately foregoing clause (A), ( _2_ ) for the obligations
of Elliott Advisors (UK) Ltd. under the Confidentiality Agreement, ( _3_ ) the
obligations of the Guarantors under the Guaranty and the Equity Commitment
Letter, and ( _4_ ) for the reimbursement obligations of Parent pursuant to
_Section 5.14(c)_ and the indemnification obligations of Parent pursuant to
_Section 5.14(e)_ , none of the Parent Recourse Related Parties will have any
liability or obligation to the Company or any of its Affiliates relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter (except, for the
avoidance of doubt, for the Guarantors' obligations under the Equity
Commitment Letter, subject to the limitations contained therein), the Guaranty
(except, for the avoidance of doubt, for the Guarantors' obligations under the
Guaranty, subject to the limitations contained therein), the Debt Financing
Commitment Letter or in respect of any other document or theory of law or
equity or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in
connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise. The parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will
Parent or the Guarantors be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more
than one occasion. For the avoidance of doubt, while the Company may pursue
both a grant of specific performance under _Section 8.12_ and the payment of
the Parent Termination Fee under this _Section 7.3_ , as applicable, under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or

  

  

 

75  

  

entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance and the payment of
the Parent Termination Fee.

  

(ii) The parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will the Company be
required to pay the Company Termination Fee and the Parent Expenses or either
alone on more than one occasion. For the avoidance of doubt, while Parent may
pursue both a grant of specific performance under _Section 8.12_ and the
payment of the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses under this
_Section 7.3_ , as applicable, under no circumstances shall Parent be
permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance and the
payment of the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses.

  

(iii) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the agreements
contained in this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and without these agreements, the parties
hereto would not enter into this Agreement.

Section 8.3 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that
all parties need not sign the same counterpart. The exchange of copies of this
Agreement and of signature pages by facsimile or e-mail shall constitute
effective execution and delivery of this Agreement as to the parties and may
be used in lieu of the original Agreement for all purposes. Signatures of the
parties transmitted by facsimile or e-mail shall be deemed to be their
original signatures for all purposes.

  

Section 8.4 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the documents and the instruments referred to herein) ( _a_ )
constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral (except for the Confidentiality
Agreement and the Guaranty), among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and neither party is relying on any other oral or written
representation, agreement or understanding and no party makes any express or
implied representation or warranty in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement other than as set forth in this Agreement, and
( _b_ ) except for the provisions of _Section 2.6_ (which upon the Effective
Time are intended to benefit the Company Stockholders), _Section 5.7_ (which
upon the Effective Time are intended to benefit the Indemnified Persons),
_Section 5.14(e)_ (which is

  

  

 

77  

  

intended to benefit the officers and directors of the Company and its
Affiliates and their respective heirs, executors, estates and personal
representatives), _Section 7.3(e)_ (which is intended to benefit the Parent
Recourse Related Parties), this _Sections 8.4_ , _8.6_ and _8.17_ (which are
intended to benefit the Debt Financing Sources), and _Section 8.18_ (which is
intended to benefit the Non-Recourse Related Parties), is not intended to
confer upon any Person other than the parties any rights or remedies.

  

Section 8.5 _Governing Law_. All disputes, claims or controversies arising out
of or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance
of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without
regard to its rules of conflict of laws.

  

Section 8.6 _Amendments and Supplements_. This Agreement may be amended,
modified or supplemented at any time solely by additional written agreements
signed by, or on behalf of the parties (including, in the case of the Company,
upon the approval of the Company Special Committee), as may mutually be
determined by the parties to be necessary, desirable or expedient to further
the purpose of this Agreement or to clarify the intention of the parties,
whether before or after adoption of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders
or adoption of this Agreement by the sole stockholder of Merger Sub;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval or adoption of this Agreement by the sole stockholder of Merger Sub,
no amendment may be made to this Agreement that pursuant to applicable Law
would require further approval or adoption by the stockholders of the Company
or the sole stockholder of Merger Sub without such further approval or
adoption. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented in any
manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, except by an instrument in
writing specifically designated as an amendment hereto, signed by, or on
behalf of, each of the parties in interest at the time of such amendment.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in herein, _Section 7.3_ ,
_Section 8.4_ , this _Section 8.6_ , _Section 8.17_ and _Section 8.18_ may not
be modified, waived or terminated in a manner that is materially adverse to
the Debt Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Debt
Financing Sources.

  

Section 8.7 _Waiver_. No provision of this Agreement may be waived except by a
written instrument signed by the party against whom the waiver is to be
effective. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
provided herein shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Law.

  

Section 8.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties; _provided_ that each of Parent
and Merger Sub may collaterally assign their respective rights under this
Agreement, in whole or in part, to any Affiliate or Debt Financing Source;
_provided_ , _further_ , that no such assignment shall relieve Parent or
Merger Sub of their obligations hereunder. Any assignment in violation of the
preceding sentence shall be void. Subject to the preceding two sentences, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

  

  

 

78  

  

Section 8.9 _Headings_. The headings and table of contents contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  

Section 8.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect, insofar as the foregoing can be
accomplished without materially affecting the economic benefits anticipated by
the parties to this Agreement. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the greatest extent
possible.

  

Section 8.11 _Failure or Delay Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. No failure or
delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder
shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in,
any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and remedies existing under
this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies
otherwise available.

  

Section 8.12 _Specific Performance_.

  

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties
would not have any adequate remedy at Law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that,
subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 7.3(e)_ , the parties shall
be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to seek to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in the Delaware Courts, without proof of actual damages or otherwise
(and each party hereto hereby waives any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, but
subject to _Section 7.3(e)_ , the parties hereto hereby further acknowledge
and agree that the Company shall be entitled to specific performance to cause
Parent's obligations to cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to
consummate the Closing if, and only if, ( _i_ ) all of the conditions set
forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.3_ have been and remain satisfied or
waived on the date the Closing would have otherwise occurred pursuant to
_Section 2.4_ (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
or waived at the Closing), ( _ii_ ) the Debt Financing has been funded or will
be funded at the Closing, ( _iii_ ) the Company has delivered written notice
to Parent that the Company is ready, willing and able to consummate the Merger
(subject to the satisfaction of the conditions referred to in clause (i)) and
( _iv_ ) Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the Merger within three
Business Days following the Company's delivery of such notice.

  

  

 

79  

  

Section 8.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE COMPANY, PARENT AND MERGER
SUB HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HERBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE COMPANY, PARENT OR MERGER SUB IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

  

Section 8.14 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto hereby (
_a_ ) irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit itself to the sole
and exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, the Superior Court of
the State of Delaware (or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction over
such matter is vested in the federal courts, any court of the United States
located in the State of Delaware) (collectively, the " _Delaware Courts_ ") in
connection with any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, ( _b_ ) waives any
objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation in any of the Delaware
Courts, ( _c_ ) agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that such
litigation brought therein has been brought in an inconvenient forum and
agrees not otherwise to attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
or venue by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and ( _d_ )
agrees that it will not bring any action, suit, or proceeding in connection
with any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in any court or other
tribunal, other than any of the Delaware Courts. All actions and proceedings
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, shall be heard and determined in the Delaware
Courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
agrees that service of process in connection with any dispute, claim, or
controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby may be made upon such party by prepaid certified or
registered mail, with a validated proof of mailing receipt constituting
evidence of valid service, directed to such party at the address specified in
_Section 8.2_ hereof. Service made in such manner, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, shall have the same legal force and effect as if
served upon such party personally within the State of Delaware. Nothing herein
shall be deemed to limit or prohibit service of process by any other manner as
may be permitted by applicable Law.

  

Section 8.15 _Incorporation of Exhibits_. The Company Disclosure Letter, the
Parent Disclosure Letter and all Exhibits and schedules attached hereto and
referred to herein are hereby incorporated herein and made a part hereof for
all purposes as if fully set forth herein.

  

Section 8.16 _No Joint Venture_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed or construed as creating a joint venture or partnership between any of
the parties hereto. No party is by virtue of this Agreement authorized as an
agent, employee or legal representative of any other party. No party shall
have the power to control the activities and operations of any other and their
status is, and at all times shall continue to be, that of independent
contractors with respect to each other. No party shall have any power or
authority to bind or commit any other party. No party shall hold itself out as
having any authority or relationship in contravention of this _Section 8.16_.

  

  

 

80  

  

Section 8.17 _Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, each of the parties hereto: ( _a_ ) agrees that all actions
(whether in law or in equity and whether in tort, contract or otherwise) that
may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, the Debt
Financing or any of the agreements (including the Debt Financing Commitment
Letter) entered into in connection with the Debt Financing or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services
thereunder against the Debt Financing Sources shall be subject to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court in the Borough of
Manhattan, New York, New York and any appellate court thereof and each party
hereto irrevocably submits itself and its property with respect to any such
action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court, and such action (except to
the extent relating to the interpretation of any provisions in this Agreement
(including any provision in the Debt Financing Commitment Letter or in any
definitive documentation related to the Debt Financing that expressly
specifies that the interpretation of such provisions shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the law of the State of the Delaware)) shall be
governed by the laws of the State of New York, regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws, ( _b_
) agrees not to bring or support or permit any of its controlled Affiliates to
bring or support any action (whether in law or in equity and whether in tort,
contract or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement, the Debt Financing or any of the agreements (including the Debt
Financing Commitment Letter) entered into in connection with the Debt
Financing or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the
performance of any services thereunder against any Debt Financing Source in
any forum other than any federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan,
New York, New York, ( _c_ ) irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such action in any such court, ( _d_ ) irrevocably and unconditionally waives
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law any right it may have to a
trial by jury in any action brought against the Debt Financing Sources
directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this
Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Financing Commitment Letter or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any
services thereunder, and ( _e_ ) agrees that the Debt Financing Sources are
express third party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, any of the provisions
in this Agreement reflecting the foregoing agreements in this _Section 8.17_.

  

Section 8.18 _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any Action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, may only be brought
against the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and then only
with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such
party. No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator,
manager, member, general or limited partner, stockholder, equityholder,
controlling person, Affiliate, agent, attorney or other Representative of any
party hereto or any of their successors or permitted assigns or any direct or
indirect director, officer, employee, incorporator, manager, member, general
or limited partner, stockholder, equityholder, controlling person, Affiliate,
agent, attorney, Representative, successor or permitted assign of any of the
foregoing (each, a " _Non-Recourse Party_ "), shall have any liability for any
obligations or liabilities of any party under this Agreement or for any Claim
(whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of or by reason
of the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any written or oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith. Without
limiting the rights of the Company against Parent, in no event shall the
Company or any of its Affiliates seek

  

  

 

81  

  

to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this
Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Non-Recourse
Party.
