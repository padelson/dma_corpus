At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended so as to read in their entirety in the form set forth as _Exhibit A_ hereto until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein, by the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation or by applicable Law. 

  

 _1.2_ _Effective Time_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause a certificate of merger or other appropriate documents (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be duly executed and filed in accordance with the DGCL on the Closing Date (or on such other date as Parent and the Company may agree in writing) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and shall make all other filings or recordings required in connection with the Merger under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the 

   ##### 

  

 

time such Certificate of Merger shall have been duly filed with, and accepted
by, the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or such later date and

_Effective Time_." 

   

 _1.3_ _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m., Boston time, on a date to be specified in writing by the parties, such date to be no later than the second Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than any conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) (the " _Closing Date_ "), at the offices of BRL Law Group LLC, 425 Boylston Street, Boston, Massachusetts, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. 

  

 _1.4_ _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, from and after the Effective Time, shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws and applicable Laws. 

  

ARTICLE II 

   

 _Merger Consideration; Conversion of Stock_  

  

 _2.1_ _Conversion of Company Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof: 

  

 (a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub, par value $.01 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, par value $.01 per share. 

  

 (b) _Cancellation of Parent-Owned, Merger Sub-Owned and Company-Owned Company Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock_. Each outstanding or issued share of Company Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock that is owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, or by any wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no cash, stock or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. 

  

 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, all shares of then otherwise unvested restricted 

   ##### 

  

 

Company Common Stock other than Forfeited Stock (as defined below) issued and
then outstanding under any Company Equity Incentive Plan shall be fully
vested (such shares of Company Common Stock that vest as of the Effective
Time, the " _Vested Restricted Stock_ "). Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Excluded Shares, Dissenting Shares and other than each outstanding (but
otherwise unvested) share of restricted Company Common Stock issued under the
Companys Amended and Restated 2003 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, that is
subject to performance-based vesting and which would not otherwise vest in
accordance with its terms as of the Effective Time (the " _Forfeited Stock_
")) shall automatically be converted into the right to receive cash in an
amount equal to the Common Stock Merger Consideration. As of the Effective
Time, all shares of Forfeited Stock shall be forfeited and cancelled without
action required by any Person and without consent of the holders thereof, and
no cash, stock or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable
in exchange therefor. As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common
Stock then issued and outstanding shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") or book-entry shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_
") representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such shares, except, in all cases, the right to
receive (other than with respect to Excluded Shares, Dissenting Shares and
Forfeited Stock) the Common Stock Merger Consideration, without interest,
upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
Section 2.1(h). 

   

 (d) _Conversion of Series A Preferred Stock_. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall automatically be converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration. As of the Effective Time, all shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares representing any such shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except, in all cases, the right to receive (other than with respect to Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, without interest, upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section 2.1(h). For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto agree that all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock through the Effective Time shall be paid in kind immediately prior to the Effective Time and be deemed outstanding at such time. 

  

 (e) _Company Stock Options_. The Company shall take all requisite action so that at the Effective Time, each outstanding qualified or nonqualified option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (" _Company Stock Options_ ") under any employee equity incentive plan or arrangement of the Company other than the Companys Amended and Restated 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (" _Company Equity Incentive Plans_ ") shall be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Common Stock Merger 

   ##### 

  

 

Consideration over the exercise price of each such Company Stock Option
multiplied by (y) the number of unexercised shares of Company Common Stock
subject thereto (the " _Closing Option Merger Consideration_ "). At the
Effective Time, all such Company Stock Options shall be cancelled and shall
represent only the right to receive the Closing Option Merger Consideration. 

   

 (f) _Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each Company Warrant shall be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Common Stock Merger Consideration over the exercise price of each such Company Warrant multiplied by (y) the number of unexercised shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto (the " _Warrant Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all such Company Warrants shall be cancelled and shall represent only the right to receive the Warrant Consideration. 

  

 (g) _ESPP_. Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock outstanding as of the date of this Agreement under the Companys Amended and Restated 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (the " _ESPP_ "), shall terminate not later than the Effective Time, provided that the Company may permit each participant in the ESPP to purchase from the Company as many whole shares of Company Common Stock as the balance of the participants account will allow as of a date not less than 10 days prior to the Effective Time (which date shall be reasonably determined by the Company Board, or a committee thereof in accordance with the ESPP), at the applicable price determined under the terms of the ESPP for such option, using such date as the final purchase date for the offering period and consistent with any other applicable limitations on purchases under the ESPP, and any amounts remaining in any participants account after any such purchase will be refunded to the participant. Upon the expiration of such offering period and the occurrence of the exercise date pursuant to the preceding sentence, no further offering period or purchase period shall commence under the ESPP. 

  

 (h) _Disposition of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares; Paying Agent_. As promptly as reasonably practicable prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company to act as Paying Agent (the " _Paying Agent_ "), which Paying Agent shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the payment of the Stock Merger Consideration and the Warrant Consideration (collectively referred to as the " _Merger Consideration_ ") other than the Restricted Stock Consideration (as defined in Section 2.1(j)(ii)).

 (i) _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of the Company Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares representing ownership of the Company Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have rights with respect to such Company Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable, except as otherwise provided for herein. Until surrendered in accordance with this Section 2.1, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the applicable Stock Merger Consideration. Any Stock Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to that Certificate or Book-Entry Share and the shares of Company Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock formerly represented thereby. 

  

 (j) _Payment Procedures_. 

   

 (i) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event within three (3) Business Days), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of (i) a Certificate or Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares and Vested Restricted Stock), (ii) outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock (other than Excluded Shares), and (iii) Company Warrants (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates, Book-Entry Shares or Company Warrants shall pass to the Paying Agent, only upon delivery of the Certificates, Book-Entry Shares or Company Warrants to the Paying Agent, and which letter shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates, Book-Entry Shares or Company Warrants in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this Agreement. Upon delivery of any Certificate, Book-Entry Shares or Company Warrant to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents reasonably satisfactory to the Company as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate, Book-Entry Shares or Company Warrant shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable, previously represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this Article II or the amount of cash payable in respect of the Company Warrants pursuant to the provisions of this Article II. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of 

   ##### 

  

  

the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall
be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the
Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required
by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has
been paid or is not applicable. 

   

 (ii) At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Company cash in U.S. dollars equal to the aggregate Closing Option Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, Parent shall also deposit or cause to be deposited with the Company cash in U.S. dollars equal to that portion of the aggregate Common Stock Merger Consideration that is payable to holders of Vested Restricted Stock (such portion of the Common Stock Merger Consideration, the " _Restricted Stock Consideration_ "). The Company shall pay the holders of Company Stock Options the cash payments described in Section 2.1(e) as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event within five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time. The Company shall pay to each holder of any shares of Vested Restricted Stock the Stock Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof as described in Section 2.1(c) as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event within five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time. Any payment made pursuant to this Section 2.1(j)(ii) to the holder of any Company Stock Option or share of Vested Restricted Stock shall be reduced by any income or employment Tax withholding required under (i) the Code, (ii) any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Laws and (iii) any other applicable Laws. 

  

 (k) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund which remains undistributed for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock or Company Warrants prior to the Effective Time who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent and only as general creditors thereof for payment of the Common Stock Merger Consideration, Preferred Stock Merger Consideration or Warrant Consideration, as applicable. 

  

 (l) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or the Paying Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any Person in respect of the Common Stock Merger Consideration, Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, Closing Option Merger Consideration or Warrant Consideration, as applicable, from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

 (m) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if invested, such investments shall be in short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations guaranteed by, the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality 

   ##### 

  

 

thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated P-1 or A-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1.0 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then
publicly available). Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income
produced by, such investments shall be payable to Parent. To the extent that
there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Payment Fund
diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments
of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall
promptly replace or restore the portion of the Payment Fund lost through
investments or other events so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is, at all
times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments. 

   

 (n) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon (i) the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and (ii) at the request of Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Stock Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 _2.2_ _Withholding Rights_. The Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

  

 _2.3_ _Appraisal Rights_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal Rights_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration or Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, as applicable. Such holders shall be entitled to receive such consideration as is determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under the Appraisal Rights, then the right of such holder to be paid such 

   ##### 

  

 

consideration as is determined to be due pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted
as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the
right to receive, the applicable Common Stock Merger Consideration
or Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, without interest. 

   

 (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) written notice as promptly as reasonably practicable of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, the withdrawals of such demands and any other instrument relating to appraisal served on the Company under the DGCL and (ii) the right to control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands for appraisal; _provided_ , that the Company shall have the right to participate in such negotiations and proceedings and, _provided_ , _further_ , that for the avoidance of doubt, prior to the Effective Time Parent shall not have the authority to cause the Company to commit to or incur any obligations with respect to any demands for appraisal rights, except to the extent that any such obligation is conditioned upon the occurrence of the Merger. 

  

 _2.4_ _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes the number of shares of Company Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable, issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse split), stock-based dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, combination, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the applicable Stock Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to provide to the holders of the Company Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable, the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such reclassification, split, dividend, distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, combination, tender or exchange or similar transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such adjustments shall be made in connection with any in kind dividends payable on the outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to the Companys certificate of incorporation, as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

The Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it therein or in which the transaction of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate, lease and encumber its properties and carry on its business as now conducted, except where the failure to have such power or authority would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (b) Each of the entities listed in Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Company Subsidiaries_ ") is a corporation or limited liability company duly incorporated or organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization. Each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership of its property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification or licensing, except for jurisdictions in which such failure to be so qualified, licensed or to be in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Company Subsidiary has all requisite power and authority to own, operate, lease and encumber its properties and carry on its business as now conducted. The Company has no Subsidiaries other than the Company Subsidiaries.

The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have obtained all licenses, permits and other authorizations and have taken all actions required by applicable Law or governmental regulations in connection with their businesses as now conducted, except where the failure to obtain any such license, permit or authorization or to take any such action, alone or together with all other such failures, would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (d) Since July 31, 2007, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has: (i) to the Companys Knowledge, used any of its funds for 

   #####

none of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is in breach,
violation or default under any IP License and no event has occurred that, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a material breach,
violation or default by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or,

   ##### 

  

 

Agreement and enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal. The Company shall not be entitled to exercise its rights set forth

faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to do so

outside counsel and financial advisor), permit the Company Board not to
effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. The Company shall not be
entitled to exercise its rights set forth under Section 6.4(d)(II) unless (w)
the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the

transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal, the identity of the
Person or group of Persons making such Superior Proposal and any other
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal), (y) Parent does not
make, within three (3) Business Days after receipt of the prior written
notice provided for in clause (x) of this sentence (it being understood and
agreed that any change to the financial or other material terms of such
Superior Proposal shall require an additional prior written notice to Parent
and a new two (2) Business Day period), a proposal that would, in the good
faith determination of the Company Board (after consultation with its outside
counsel and financial advisor), cause the Takeover Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal, and (z) before or concurrently with any
termination in accordance with this Section 6.4(d), the Company shall pay the
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(a). 

   

 (e) Nothing in this Section 6.4 shall prohibit the Company Board from taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties or would violate applicable Law; _provided_ , that, in no event shall the Company Board take any action prohibited by Section 6.4(d) without complying with the terms of such provision. In addition, it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement, (i) a factually accurate public statement by the Company that describes the Companys receipt of a Takeover Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto, shall not be deemed a withdrawal or modification of, or a proposal by the Company Board to withdraw or modify the Company Recommendation, or an approval or recommendation with respect to such Takeover Proposal, so long as such public statement includes a statement that the Company Board continues to support the Company Recommendation, and (ii) any "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, or any similar communication to the stockholders of the Company or otherwise, shall not constitute a 

   ##### 

  

 

Company Adverse Recommendation Change or a withdrawal or modification, or a
proposal by the Company Board to withdraw or modify the Company
Recommendation, or an approval or recommendation with respect to any Takeover
Proposal, so long as such communication includes a statement that the Company
Board continues to support the Company Recommendation. 

   

 (f) As used in this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any bona fide written inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) or "group", within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, after the date of this Agreement relating to, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, any (A) acquisition of assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries equal to 20% or more of the Companys consolidated assets or to which 20% or more of the Companys revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable, (B) acquisition of "beneficial ownership," within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, of shares of capital stock or other securities representing 20% or more of the voting power of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, including by way of a merger, consolidation, stock exchange, tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (C) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 20% or more of the voting power of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (D) merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or (E) any combination of the foregoing types of transactions if the sum of the percentage of consolidated assets, consolidated revenues or earnings, securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (including Company Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock) or voting power of the Company or any Company Subsidiary involved is 20% or more. 

  

 (g) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means any Takeover Proposal that the Company Board has determined in its good faith judgment, after consultation with outside counsel and financial advisors, is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all legal, regulatory and financial aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal, and if consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than the Transaction (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such proposal or otherwise);  _provided_ , that for purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal," the references to "20%" in the definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "51%." 

  

 _6.5_ _Officers  and Directors Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) It is understood and agreed that the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless and, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys 

   #####

Party is or was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the
request of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a director,
officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (ii) the negotiation, execution
or performance of this Agreement, any agreement or document contemplated
hereby or delivered in connection herewith, or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, whether in any case asserted or arising at or
before or after the Effective Time. In the event of any such threatened or
actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether asserted
or arising at or before or after the Effective Time), (A) the Company and,
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to) promptly pay expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any such threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, demand, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, subject to the receipt of an
undertaking by such Indemnified Party to repay such expenses if it is
ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
be indemnified and (B) the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
satisfactory to them, and the Company and, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) pay all reasonable and documented fees and expenses of such counsel

manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law. Any Indemnified
Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.5, upon learning
of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify the Company and, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation thereof in writing;  _provided_ , that the
failure promptly to so notify in writing shall not affect the obligations of
the Company and the Surviving Corporation except to the extent, if any, such
failure materially prejudices them. 

   

 (b) Parent and Merger Sub each agrees that all rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal liability of, each Indemnified Party provided for in Section 6.5(a) above or in the respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or other applicable organizational documents) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or otherwise in effect as of the date hereof (including through any agreement or arrangement between the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on the other hand, previously made available to Parent) shall survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to

 _9.4_ _Interpretation_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Wherever used herein, a pronoun in the masculine gender shall be considered as including the feminine gender unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Terms defined in the singular shall have a comparable meaning when used in the plural and vice versa, and wherever the word "include," "includes" or "including" is used in this Agreement, it shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The term "made available", when referring to information, documents, projections, forecasts or other material made available to Parent or Merger Sub, means that such information, documents, projections, forecasts or other material has been placed in the data room in connection with the Transaction or otherwise provided to Parent or its Representatives. References herein to any Law shall be deemed to refer to such Law as amended, modified, codified, reenacted, supplemented or superseded in whole or in part and in effect from time to time, and also to all rules and regulations promulgated

thereunder, except where the reference to Law speaks as of a date certain or
references the effect of a change in Law. Whenever this Agreement requires a
Company Subsidiary to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Company
Subsidiary to take such action. The term "or" is used in the inclusive sense
of "and/or". 

   

 _9.5_ _Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements_. Except for Articles I and II, Section 6.5 and any covenant or agreement of the parties which by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time, (a) none of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time and (b) thereafter there shall be no liability on the part of any of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or stockholders in respect thereof. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement, there are no representations or warranties of any party hereto, express or implied. 

  

 _9.6_ _Remedies; Specific Enforcement_. 

  

 (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. 

  

 (b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without bond or other security being required, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. 

  

 _9.7_ _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which may arise under this Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues and, therefore, each such party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any legal action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transaction. Each party to this Agreement certifies and acknowledges that (a) no representative of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not seek to enforce the foregoing waiver in the event of a legal action, (b) such party has considered the implications of this waiver, (c) such party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (d) such party has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certificates in this Section 9.7. 

   ##### 

  

  

 _9.8_ _Assignment_. Except as expressly permitted by the terms hereof, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that Parent may assign this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder to any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries;  _provided_ , _however_ , any such assignment shall not release Parent from any of its obligations hereunder if such assignment is made prior to the Closing. Any purported assignment without such prior written consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 _9.9_ _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement constitutes, together with the Confidentiality Agreement and the Company Disclosure Schedule, the entire agreement and supersedes all of the prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Except for the provisions of Section 6.5, which shall inure to the benefit of the Persons or entities benefiting therefrom who are expressly intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof and who may enforce the covenants contained therein, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than the parties hereto or their respective heirs, successors, executors, administrators and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement. 

  

 _9.10_ _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or circumstance is held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby, and to such end, the provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be severable. 

  

 _9.11_ _Choice of Law/Consent to Jurisdiction_. 

  

 (a) All disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its rules of conflict of laws. 

  

 (b) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) consents to submit to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction over the matter is vested in the federal courts, any court of the United States located in the State of Delaware for any litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or the Transaction, (ii) agrees not to commence any litigation relating thereto except in such courts, (iii) waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation in such courts and (iv) agrees not to plead or claim in such courts that such litigation brought therein has been brought in any inconvenient forum. Each of the parties hereto agrees, 

   ##### 

  

 

(A) to the extent such party is not otherwise subject to service of process
in the State of Delaware, to appoint and maintain an agent in the State of
Delaware as such partys agent for acceptance of legal process, and (B) that
service of process may also be made on such party by prepaid certified mail
with a proof of mailing receipt validated by the United States Postal Service
constituting evidence of valid service. Service made pursuant to (A) or (B)
above shall have the same legal force and effect as if served upon such party
personally within the State of Delaware. 

   

 _9.12_ _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party. Facsimile transmission of any signed original document shall be deemed the same as delivery of an original. At the request of any party, the parties will confirm facsimile transmission by signing a duplicate original document.
