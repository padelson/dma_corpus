The Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the Accounting

3 (b) The Closing Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties on
the 30th calendar day following delivery thereof, unless Seller gives written
notice of its disagreement with the Closing Statement (a " _Notice of
Disagreement_ ") to Purchaser on or prior to such date. Any Notice of
Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of each
disagreement so asserted and calculations of all disputed amounts. All amounts
not so disputed in the Notice of Disagreements shall be final and binding
upon the parties and included in the final Closing Statement. If a Notice of
Disagreement is delivered to Purchaser within the 30 calendar day period
referred to above, then the Closing Statement (as revised in accordance with
this sentence) shall become final and binding upon the parties on the date on
which all such disputed matters are finally resolved in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 1.04. During the 30 calendar day period
following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Purchaser and Seller
shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences that they may
have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. At
the end of such 30 calendar day period, Purchaser and Seller shall submit to
an internationally recognized independent public accounting firm agreed upon
by Purchaser and Seller in writing (the " _Independent Expert_ ") for review
of any and all matters that remain in dispute and were included in the Notice
of Disagreement (such items, " _Disputed Items_ ") and all matters set forth
in the Notice of Disagreement and resolved without submission to the
Independent Expert shall be final and binding upon the parties and included
in the final Closing Statement. The parties shall instruct the Independent
Expert to render its decision as to the Disputed Items and the effect of its
decision on the Closing Statement as promptly as practicable but in no event
later than 60 calendar days after its selection. Each party shall furnish to
the Independent Expert such working papers and other relevant documents and
information relating to the Disputed Items, and shall provide interviews and
answer questions, as the Independent Expert may reasonably request in
connection with its determination of such Disputed Items. In the event any
party shall participate in teleconferences or meetings with, or make
presentations to, the Independent Expert, the other party shall be entitled
to participate in such teleconferences, meetings or presentations. The terms
of appointment and engagement of the Independent Expert shall be as reasonably
agreed upon between the parties in writing.

 

(c) In resolving any Disputed Item, the parties shall instruct the Independent
Expert to (i) act in the capacity of an expert and not as an arbitrator (and
the parties acknowledge and agree that the Independent Expert shall act in
such capacity), (ii) limit its review to Disputed Items, (iii) assign a value
to each Disputed Item no greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed
by either party in the Closing Statement or in the Notice of Disagreement, and
(iv) limit its scope to fixing mathematical errors and determining whether
Disputed Items were calculated in accordance with the Accounting Principles
and this Agreement. The Independent Expert is not authorized to, and shall
not, make any other determination, including (A) any determination with
respect to any matter included in the Closing Statement or the Notice of
Disagreement that was not submitted for resolution to the Independent Expert,
(B) any determination as to whether the

 



4  Accounting Principles were followed with respect to the MPHE Financial
Statements (except to the extent necessary to determine whether or not a
Disputed Item has been calculated in accordance with the Accounting
Principles), (C) any determination as to whether the Estimated Working Capital
was properly calculated in accordance with the Accounting Principles, (D) any
determination as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 3.05 or any other representation or warranty in this
Agreement, or (E) any determination as to compliance by any party with any of
their respective covenants in this Agreement. Any dispute not within
the scope of disputes to be resolved by the Independent Expert pursuant to
this Section 1.04 shall be resolved as otherwise provided in this Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 1.04 is not intended to adjust the
Initial Closing Date Amount or the Final Closing Date Amount for errors or
omissions, under IFRS or otherwise, that may be found with respect to the
Financial Statements. Any determination by the Independent Expert, and any
work or analyses performed by the Independent Expert, may not be offered as
evidence in any Proceeding as evidence of a breach of Section 3.05, a breach
of any other representation or warranty in this Agreement or a breach of any
covenant in this Agreement (other than a breach of this Section 1.04). All
negotiations pursuant to this Section 1.04 shall be treated as compromise and
settlement negotiations for purposes of Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of
Evidence and comparable state rules of evidence.

 

(d) The final determination by the Independent Expert of the matters submitted
to it pursuant to Section 1.04(b) shall (i) be in writing, (ii) include the
Independent Experts calculation of the Final Closing Date Amount, (iii)
include the Independent Experts determination of each Disputed Item, and (iv)
include a brief summary of the Independent Experts reasons for its
determination of each Disputed Item.

(e) The resolution of Disputed Items by the Independent Expert shall be final
and binding, and the determination of the Independent Expert shall constitute
an arbitral award that is final, binding and non-appealable and upon which a
judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction over the party against
which such determination is to be enforced. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Expert incurred pursuant to this Section 1.04 shall be borne
between Seller and Purchaser based upon the percentage which the portion of
the Disputed Items not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually
contested by such party. For example, if Seller claims that the appropriate
adjustments are $1,000 greater than the amount determined by Purchaser and if
the Independent Expert ultimately resolves the Disputed Items by awarding to
Seller $300 of the $1,000 contested, then the fees, costs and expenses of the
Independent Expert will be allocated 30% (i.e., 300 ÷ 1,000) to Purchaser and
70% (i.e., 700 ÷ 1,000) to Seller.

(f) Within five Business Days after the Closing Statement becomes final and
binding upon the parties:

(i) if the Final Closing Date Amount is less than the Initial Closing
Date Amount, Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount of such difference by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the bank account designated in
writing by Purchaser; or

 



5 (ii) if the Final Closing Date Amount is greater than the Initial Closing
Date Amount, Purchaser shall, or shall cause a Group Company to, pay to
Seller the amount of such difference by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the bank account designated in writing by Seller,

 

in each case, together with interest thereon at a rate equal to the Interest
Rate, calculated on the basis of the actual number of calendar days elapsed
divided by 365, from (and including) the Closing Date to (but excluding) the
date of payment.

(g) No actions taken by Purchaser on its own behalf or on behalf of the
Company on or following the Closing Date shall be given effect for purposes of
determining the Closing Cash, the Closing Working Capital, the Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Transaction Expenses or the Closing Change of Control
Payments. Subject to Section 5.13, during the period from the Closing until
such time as the Closing Statement shall become final and binding upon the
parties in accordance with this Section 1.04, Purchaser and the Company shall
afford, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to afford, to Seller and any
accountants, counsel or financial advisers retained by Seller in connection
with any adjustment to the Purchase Price contemplated by this Section 1.04
reasonable access during normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice
to the books and records of the Group Companies, and the work papers of
Purchaser and the Group Companies, in each case, relevant to the
adjustments contemplated by this Section 1.04; _provided_ that such access
shall not (i) unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of such Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates, (ii) include access to materials that are subject to
the attorney-client, work-product or other privilege or (iii) include any
access to any working papers of any independent accountant unless customary
confidentiality and hold harmless agreements have been first executed.

 

SECTION 1.05 _Withholding Taxes_. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amount otherwise payable by it pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as Purchaser is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of any such payment under any provision of applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if Purchaser determines that any such
deduction or withholding is so required, Purchaser shall, to the extent
reasonably practicable, provide notice of its intention to withhold to Seller
at least two Business Days prior to the date on which such payment is to be
made, with a written explanation substantiating the requirement to withhold,
and shall cooperate with Seller to reduce or eliminate such deduction or
withholding to the extent allowed by applicable Law and (ii) subject to
Sellers compliance with Section 1.03(a)(viii), Purchaser shall not deduct
and withhold under any provision of the Code; _provided_ , _further_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) shall not apply to any
deduction or withholding applicable to compensatory payments or interest
payments on the Subordinated Promissory Note, if any. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing
Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made.

Companys or any of their respective Affiliates (as opposed to any other

ARTICLE V

_Covenants _

SECTION 5.01 _Confidentiality Agreement_. Purchaser agrees that the
information being provided to it in connection with the Transactions
(including the terms of this Agreement) is subject to the terms of a
confidentiality agreement, dated as of June 22, 2017, between Purchaser and
Seller (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). Effective upon the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect to information relating
solely to the Group Companies; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser agrees
that any and all other information provided to it or any of its Affiliates,
or any of their respective representatives pursuant to the Confidentiality
Agreement, by Seller or any of its Affiliates, or any of their respective
representatives, shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement after the Closing (including any temporal
limitations thereof), and Purchaser shall otherwise comply with the
Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with its terms (including with respect
to the non-solicitation of employees). Effective upon the Closing, Seller
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause any confidentiality agreements
entered into between Seller or Company or any of their respective Affiliates,
on the one hand, and any potential purchaser in a proposed transaction similar
to the Transaction, on the other hand, to be assigned to the Company, such
that the Company and its Affiliates receive the benefit of, and full right
to enforce, such confidentiality agreements from and after the Closing.

SECTION 5.02 _Expenses_. Except as expressly set forth in any other provision
of this Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such costs
and expenses.

 



33 SECTION 5.03 _[Reserved]_.

 

SECTION 5.04 _Tax Matters_. (a) _Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes_. Purchaser,
Seller and the Company agree that:

 

(i) Purchaser shall cause each Group Company to timely prepare and file with
the applicable Taxing Authorities all Tax Returns for any Tax period
beginning on or before the Closing Date that are required to be filed by such
Group Company after the Closing Date and shall cause each Group Company to
timely pay all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns (including
amounts remitted to Purchaser by Seller under this Section 5.04(a)(i)). Each
such Tax Return shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the past practice
of each such Group Company, except as required by applicable Law. At least 30
calendar days, in the case of income Tax Returns, and within a reasonable
period of time, in the case of all other Tax Returns, prior to the due date
for filing any such Tax Return (taking into account any extensions), Purchaser
shall furnish Seller with a complete copy of any such Tax Return for Sellers
review and comment, and Purchaser shall, subject to the remainder of this
Section 5.04(a)(i), revise such Tax Return to reflect any reasonable comments
from Seller. If Purchaser disagrees with any such comments, it shall notify
Seller of such disagreement and the basis for its objection. The parties shall
act in good faith to resolve any such dispute prior to the date on which the
relevant Tax Return is required to be filed. In the case of any such Tax
Return that is with respect to a Straddle Period, if the parties cannot
resolve any disagreement, the item in question shall be resolved by the
Independent Expert, and such resolution shall be binding. In the case of any
Tax Return with respect to a taxable period that ends on or before the
Closing Date, (A) if the parties cannot resolve any disagreement and such
disagreement relates to an item that is not reflected consistent with past
practice of the relevant Group Company or that is reasonably likely to
subject Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, in the reasonable judgment of
Purchaser, to non-monetary sanctions or penalties, the item in question shall
be resolved by the Independent Expert, and such resolution shall be binding;
otherwise, the applicable Tax Return shall reflect Sellers position; and (B)
Purchaser shall not file any such Tax Return without Sellers consent (not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The fees and expenses of
the Independent Expert in relation to the matters contemplated in this Section
5.04(a)(i) shall be borne equally by Seller and Purchaser. Seller shall be
responsible for all Taxes due in respect of the Tax Returns referred to in
this Section 5.04(a)(i) to the extent Seller has an indemnification obligation
with respect to such Taxes under Section 6.03(a). Purchaser shall notify
Seller of any amounts due from Seller in respect of any such Tax Return no
later than 10 Business Days prior to the date on which such Tax Return is due,
and Seller shall remit such payment to Purchaser no later than five Business
Days prior to the date such Tax Return is due. For the purposes of this
Section 5.04(a)(i), where Tax is payable with no associated Tax Return, the
calculation of the Tax payable shall be treated as a Tax Return due on the day
on which the Tax is required to be paid.

 



34 (ii) Purchaser shall not, and shall not cause or permit any Group Company
to, (A) amend, re-file or otherwise modify any Tax Return filed on or before
the Closing Date with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Straddle
Period or (B) make or change any Tax election or take any other action, which
Tax election or action has retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
in each case without Sellers prior written consent, in each case, except as
otherwise required by Law or a good faith resolution of a Tax Claim or as
would not reasonably be expected to result in a more than de minimis Tax (or a
more than de minimis diminution of a Tax attribute) with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period.

(b) _Cooperation_. Seller, the Company and Purchaser shall reasonably
cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, auditors and representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and
filing all Tax Returns of a Group Company, including maintaining and
making available to each other all records necessary in connection with Taxes
and in resolving all disputes, subject to Section 6.08(d), and audits with
respect to all taxable periods relating to Taxes of a Group Company. Seller
and its Affiliates will need access, from time to time, after the Closing
Date, to certain accounting and Tax records and information held by the Group
Companies to the extent such records and information pertain to events
occurring on or prior to the Closing Date; therefore, Purchaser and the
Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to, (i) use their
commercially reasonable efforts to retain and maintain such records until such
time (not to be longer than seven years) as Seller agrees that such retention
and maintenance is no longer necessary and shall thereafter provide Seller
with written notice prior to any destruction, abandonment or disposition of
all or any portions of such records and transfer such records to Seller upon
its written request and at Sellers sole cost and expense and (ii) allow
Seller and its agents and representatives (and agents or representatives of
any of its Affiliates), at times and dates mutually acceptable to the parties,
to inspect, review and make copies of such records as Seller may reasonably
deem necessary or appropriate from time to time, such activities to be
conducted during normal business hours and at Sellers expense.

 

(c) _Refunds and Credits_. Purchaser, Seller and the Company agree that:

 

(i) Any refund or credit of Taxes (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
overpayments of estimated Taxes) of any Group Company for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period received after the Closing Date shall be for the account of Seller,
except to the extent any such refund or credit (A) results from the carryback
of any net operating loss or other Tax attribute arising in a Post-Closing
Tax Period (other than any such net operating loss or other Tax attribute that
is attributable to a Transaction Deduction), (B) was taken into account in (or
is attributable to a Tax asset that was included in) the calculation of
Working Capital, (C) is attributable to a change in applicable Law or change
in any practice of any Taxing Authority, in each case that is announced after
the Closing Date or (D) reduced Sellers indemnification obligation pursuant
to clause (4) of the proviso to Section 6.03(a). Any refund or credit of Taxes
of any Group Company for any Post-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account
of Purchaser. Any refund or credit of Taxes of any Group Company for any
Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned between Seller and Purchaser in
a manner consistent with the principles in Section 6.03(c).

 



35 (ii) Purchaser shall, if Seller reasonably so requests, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable Group Company to file
for and obtain any refunds or credits of Taxes to which Seller is entitled
under this Section 5.04(c).

 

(iii) Each party shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, forward to any other
party entitled under this Section 5.04(c) to any refund or credit of Taxes
any such refund within 10 calendar days after such refund is received or
reimburse such other party for any such credit within 10 calendar days after
the credit is allowed or applied against other Tax liability (in each case,
net of Taxes thereon, if any, and any costs or expenses reasonably incurred in
obtaining the same). To the extent a refund or credit against Taxes that gave
rise to a payment hereunder is subsequently disallowed or otherwise reduced,
the party that received such payment shall reimburse the other party for the
amount of such disallowed or reduced refund or credit against Taxes.

 

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the control of the prosecution of a claim
for refund of Taxes paid pursuant to a deficiency assessed subsequent to the
Closing Date as a result of an audit shall be governed by the provisions of
Section 6.08.

 

(d) _Tax Benefits_. Seller and Purchaser agree to reflect in a Pre-Closing
Tax Period to the maximum extent permissible under applicable Law any
deductions or expenses to which any Group Company is entitled as a result of
incurring or paying any amount included in Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses
and Change of Control Payments (" _Transaction Deductions_ "). To the extent
any such deductions or expenses give rise to a Tax refund actually received,
or a credit of Taxes actually realized as a reduction in cash Taxes payable,
by any Group Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, such refund or credit
shall be for the account of Seller under (and subject to the exceptions set
forth in) Section 5.04(c). To the extent any such deductions or
expenses reduce cash Taxes that would otherwise be payable, or give rise to a
Tax refund actually received, or a credit of Taxes actually realized as a
reduction in cash Taxes payable, by any Group Company for any Post-Closing Tax
Period or Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (other than the Group
Companies), Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the amount of
such reduction, refund or credit except to the extent that any such reduction,
refund or credit (A) was taken into account in the calculation of Working
Capital or (B) reduced Sellers indemnification obligation pursuant to clause
(4) of the proviso to Section 6.03(a). The determination of whether any such
deductions or expenses gives rise to a cash Tax reduction, refund or credit
for any Post-Closing Tax Period under this Section 5.04(d) shall be made on a
with and without basis. To the extent a cash Tax reduction, refund or credit
that gave rise to a payment from Purchaser to Seller hereunder is
subsequently disallowed or otherwise reduced, Seller shall reimburse Purchaser
for the amount of such disallowed or reduced cash Tax reduction, refund or
credit.

 



36 SECTION 5.05 _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with
the transfer of the Shares or otherwise in respect of any of the Transactions
shall be borne equally between Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on the
other hand. Purchaser and Seller shall reasonably cooperate to prepare and
timely file any Tax Returns relating to Transfer Taxes, and Purchaser shall
timely pay all Transfer Taxes; _provided_ that the Seller portion of any such
Transfer Taxes shall be deemed a Transaction Expense or otherwise reimbursed
by Seller to Purchaser.

 

SECTION 5.06 _Publicity_. No press release or other public announcement
concerning the Transactions shall be issued by a party or such partys
Affiliates without the prior written consent of the other parties (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as
such press release or public announcement may be required by applicable
Law, Judgment or any Governmental Entity, in which case the party required to
make the press release or public announcement shall to the extent reasonably
practicable allow the other party to comment thereon in advance of such
issuance. The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with
respect to the Transactions shall be in the form, of substance and with timing
agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser (the " _Announcement_ "). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (a) this Section 5.06 shall not apply to any press release or
other public announcement made by any of the parties hereto which (i) is
consistent with the Announcement and the terms of this Agreement and does not
contain any information relating to Seller, Purchaser or the Group Companies
that has not been previously announced or made public in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement or (ii) is made in the ordinary course of business and
does not relate specifically to this Agreement or the Transactions and (b)
each of Seller, the Company and Purchaser may make internal announcements to
their respective employees that are consistent with the parties prior public
disclosures regarding the Transactions.

 

SECTION 5.07 _Records_. (a) Purchaser recognizes that certain records of the
Group Companies may contain information relating to Subsidiaries, divisions
and businesses of Seller and its Affiliates other than the Group Companies,
and that Seller may retain copies thereof.

 

(b) Purchaser and the Company shall retain, for seven years after the Closing
Date, all books, records and other material documents pertaining to the Group
Companies businesses that relate to the period prior to the Closing Date
(except for any such books, records and other material documents in the
possession of Seller or any of its Affiliates on or after the Closing),
except for Tax Returns and supporting documentation which shall be retained
until the later of the date following seven years after the Closing and the
date that is 60 calendar days after the date required by applicable Law, and
to make the same available after the Closing Date for inspection and copying
by Seller, during regular business hours and upon reasonable request;
_provided_ that such inspection shall not (i) unreasonably disrupt the normal
operations of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, (ii) include access to
materials that are subject to the attorney-client, work-product or other
privilege or (iii) include any access to any working papers of any independent
accountant unless customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreements have
been first executed. At and after the expiration of such period, if Seller or
any of its Affiliates has previously requested that such books and records be
preserved, Purchaser and the Company shall either preserve such books and
records for such reasonable period as may be requested or transfer such books
and records to Seller or its designated Affiliates at Sellers expense.

 



37 (c) Seller shall retain, for seven years after the Closing Date, all
books, records and other material documents pertaining to the Group
Companies businesses that remain in Sellers or any of its Affiliates
possession as of immediately following the Closing that relate to the period
prior to the Closing Date (except for any such books, records and other
material documents in the possession of Parent, Purchaser or any Group Company
on or after the Closing), except for Tax Returns and supporting documentation
which shall be retained until the later of the date following seven years
after the Closing and the date that is 60 calendar days after the date
required by applicable Law, and to make the same available after the Closing
Date for inspection and copying by Purchaser or the Company, during regular
business hours and upon reasonable request; _provided_ that such inspection
shall not (i) unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of Seller or any of
its Affiliates, (ii) include access to materials that are subject to the
attorney-client, work-product or other privilege or (iii) include any access
to any working papers of any independent accountant unless customary
confidentiality and hold harmless agreements have been first executed. At and
after the expiration of such period, if Purchaser, the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates has previously requested that such books and
records be preserved, Seller shall either preserve such books and records for
such reasonable period as may be requested or transfer such books and records
to Purchaser, the Company or any of their designated Affiliates at the
Companys expense.

 

SECTION 5.08 _Non-Solicitation of Employees_. For a period of 12 months from
the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, solicit for employment, hire or retain as a consultant
any of the individuals named in Section 5.08 of the Seller Disclosure Letter
(each, a " _Restricted Person_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing shall not preclude (a) general solicitations by Seller or its
Subsidiaries or by a bona fide search firm that are not targeted at any such
Restricted Persons or (b) the hiring of any Restricted Person who (i) has had
his or her employment terminated with any Group Company at least three months
prior to commencement of employment discussions between Seller or its
Subsidiaries and such Restricted Person or (ii) responds to any general
solicitation placed by Seller or its Subsidiaries (or by a bona fide search
firm) that is not targeted at such Restricted Person.

 

SECTION 5.09 _Data Protection Agreements_. Upon receipt of a written request
from Seller received by Purchaser prior to the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall enter into appropriate data transfer
arrangements (including, where requested, the EU approved model clause
contracts) with Seller or any of its Affiliates as required in order for
Seller or any of its Affiliates to comply with any applicable data protection
Laws or cross-border transfer obligations relating to the transfer of personal
information.

 

SECTION 5.10 _Indemnification and Insurance_. (a) From and after the Closing,
Purchaser shall cause the Group Companies, to the fullest extent permissible
by applicable Law, and in each case to the extent provided by and subject to
the terms and conditions of the organizational or similar documents of the
Group Companies in existence as of the date of this Agreement (or in any
agreement in existence as of the date of this Agreement providing for

 



38  indemnification between any of the Group Companies and any Indemnitee, in
each case a true and complete list of which is forth in Section 5.10(a) of the
Seller Disclosure Letter), indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at
the Closing is, or at any time prior to the Closing was, a director or officer
of any Group Company (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the "
_Indemnitees_ ") with respect to Losses in connection with any Proceeding,
whenever asserted, to the extent based on or arising out of (A) the fact that
an Indemnitee is or was a director or officer of such Group Company or (B)
acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitees capacity as a director
or officer of such Group Company or taken at the request of such Group Company
(including in connection with serving at the request of such Group Company as
a representative of another Person (including any employee benefit plan)), in
each case under clause (A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the Closing
(including any Proceeding relating to the enforcement of this provision or any
other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnitee but in each case
excluding any Losses to the extent arising from such Indemnitees position as
a director, officer, employee or other agent of Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Group Companies)). Without limiting the
foregoing, Purchaser, from and after the Closing, shall cause, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law, the organizational or similar documents
of the Group Companies to contain provisions no less favorable to the
Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and
officers and indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this
Agreement in the organizational or similar documents of the Group Companies,
which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees.
In addition, from and after the Closing to the extent provided for in the
organizational or similar documents of the Group Companies in existence as of
the date of this Agreement (or in any agreement set forth in Section 5.10(a)
of the Seller Disclosure Letter), Purchaser shall, without requiring a
preliminary determination of entitlement to indemnification, advance any
expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnitee
under this Section 5.10 (including in connection with enforcing the indemnity
and other obligations referred to in this Section 5.10) as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, subject to the receipt of an
undertaking to refund such amounts to the extent it is determined that such
Person is not entitled to indemnification hereunder.

 

(b) For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Closing,
Purchaser shall maintain in effect directors and officers liability
insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing with
respect to those individuals who are currently covered by the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policies on terms and scope with
respect to such coverage, and in amount, no less favorable to such individuals
than those of the Companys current directors and officers liability
insurance policy in effect on the date of this Agreement. The obligations set
forth in this Section 5.10 shall be deemed satisfied if Purchaser purchases
and maintains in effect a "tail" directors and officers liability insurance
policy, with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Closing,
on terms no less favorable to the individuals who are covered, immediately
prior to the Closing, by the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance policies if the cost thereof does not exceed 250% of the last
annual premium (such amount, the " _Maximum Premium_ ") paid by the Company
for the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policies
existing immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ , that if Purchaser and
the Company are unable to obtain the insurance described in the prior clause
for an amount equal to or less than the Maximum Premium, then Purchaser or the
Company shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an annual
premium equal to the Maximum Premium and, upon so doing, the obligations under
this Section 5.10 shall be deemed satisfied.

 



39 (c) The provisions of this Section 5.10 are (i) intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her
heirs and his or her legal representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such individual may have under the organizational or similar documents of the
Group Companies, by Contract or otherwise. The obligations of Purchaser under
this Section 5.10 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.10
applies unless (x) such termination or modification is required by applicable
Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees
to whom this Section 5.10 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
Section 5.10).

 

(d) In the event that (i) Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (A) consolidates or merges with or into any other
Person and is not the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or
merger or (B) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, or (ii) Purchaser or any of its successors or
assigns dissolves the Company, then, and in each such case, proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser or the Company
shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in this Section 5.10.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Group Companies for any of their respective directors, officers or other
employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided
for in this Section 5.10 is not prior to or in substitution for any such
claims under such policies.

 

(f) Purchaser and the Companys obligations under this Section 5.10 shall
continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from the Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any Proceeding (whether arising before, at or
after the Closing) is brought against an Indemnitee on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Closing, the provisions of this Section 5.10 shall, with
respect to such Proceeding, continue in effect until the full and final
resolution of such Proceeding.

 

SECTION 5.11 _Insurance_. Purchaser acknowledges that none of the Group
Companies shall be entitled to coverage under any insurance policies
maintained by Seller or its Affiliates (other than any such insurance policies
maintained directly by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Group
Companies, in each case at Parent or Purchasers cost and expense) from
and after the Closing.

SECTION 5.12 _Confidentiality_. From and after the Closing until the second
anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and
representatives to, keep confidential and not disclose to any other Person, or
use for their own benefit or the benefit of any other Person, any

 



40  confidential or non-public information regarding the Group Companies
obtained prior to the Closing or obtained in connection with Sellers
access rights under this Agreement. The obligations of Seller under this
Section 5.12 shall not apply to information which (i) is or becomes generally
available to the public without breach of Sellers obligations under
this Section 5.12 or (ii) is required to be disclosed by applicable Law or
any Judgment; _provided_ , _however_ , that in any such case, Seller shall
notify Purchaser as early as practicable prior to disclosure to allow
Purchaser to take appropriate measures to preserve the confidentiality of
such information.

SECTION 5.13 _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested
by any party hereto, and without further consideration by Purchaser, each
other party hereto shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be
taken, all such further actions, as such other party may reasonably deem
necessary or desirable to consummate the Transactions, including, in the case
of Seller, executing and delivering to Purchaser such assignments, deeds,
bills of sale and other instruments as Purchaser or its counsel may
reasonably request as necessary or desirable for such purpose.

SECTION 5.14  _Release_. Effective as of the Closing, Seller, on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates, hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any
claims that each such Person, in its capacity as a direct or indirect
equityholder of any Group Company, has or may have in the future against each
Group Company and releases, on its own behalf and on behalf of its successors
and assigns, each Group Company and their respective Affiliates, directors and
officers, from any and all Proceedings with respect thereto. Seller, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates, expressly waives, to the full extent that
it may lawfully waive, all rights pertaining to a general release of claims,
and affirms that it is releasing all known or unknown claims that it has or
may have against any of the Group Companies, and their respective Affiliates,
directors and officers in each case in its capacity as a direct or indirect
equityholder of any Group Company.

 

SECTION 5.15 _Cooperation in Financing and Related Matters_. After Closing,
upon reasonable notice to Seller, Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause its directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents, financial
advisors, attorneys, accountants or other representatives to use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide, Purchaser with such cooperation
as may be reasonably required by Purchaser, including (a) to the extent
reasonably necessary to allow Purchaser to consummate a securities offering
following the Closing or to comply with its obligations under its debt
documents; (b) to facilitate Purchasers obtaining customary accountants
comfort letters and consents from KPMG International Cooperative and its
Affiliates (" _KPMG_ "), including issuing any customary representation
letters in connection therewith to KPMG in connection with the historical
financial statements regarding the Company; (c) to provide access to such
financial information related directly to the Company as was used in the
preparation of the Companys historical financial statements as shall be
reasonably requested by Purchaser, including source records, books, general
ledger or operating statements in Sellers or its Affiliates possession; and
(d) to the extent reasonably necessary to allow Purchaser to make any filings
pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder and comply with SEC requirements after the
Closing, assist in the preparation of financial statements and other financial
data in accordance with GAAP.

Prior to or at the Closing, Seller and the Company shall, and shall cause Moy
Park Limited to, terminate the Management Services Agreement, dated as of
September 8, 2016, and as amended on May 8, 2017, by and between Seller and
Moy Park Limited, a company organized and existing under the laws of Northern
Ireland (the " _Management Agreement_ ") without any further liability,
obligation or Losses of or to any of the Group Companies or any of their
respective Affiliates (including, following the Closing, Purchaser, Parent
and their respective Affiliates). Following the Closing, upon the request of
Purchaser, Seller shall, and shall cause any of its applicable Affiliates to,
provide to any of the Group Companies any services previously provided to any
of the Group Companies under the Management Agreement; _provided_ , that such
services shall be performed in accordance with, and subject to, the terms and
conditions of the Shared Services Agreement, dated as of January 2, 2017 and
effective as of January 1, 2017, by and between Parent and JBS USA Food

SECTION 6.01 _General Indemnification by Seller_. (a) Subject to the terms
(including the limitations) set forth in this Article VI, from and after the
Closing, Seller shall (without duplication with respect to any other payment

harmless from, any loss, liability, fine, claim, damage, cost or expense,
including reasonable fees and expenses of third party lawyers, accountants and
other advisors, and the reasonable costs of investigation, settlement and
defense (collectively, " _Losses_ ") suffered or incurred by Purchaser, its
Affiliates (including the Group Companies) and each of their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives and their
respective successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnitees_
") (other than any Loss relating to Taxes, for which indemnification is
provided under Section 6.03) to the extent arising, resulting from or relating
to:

 

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by Seller
in this Agreement;

 

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement made
or to be performed by Seller or any of its Affiliates; and

(iii) any Closing Indebtedness, Closing Transaction Expenses or Closing Change

Amount but were not so reflected.

(b) Seller shall not be required to indemnify Purchaser and shall not have
any liability:

 



42 (i) under Section 6.01(a)(i) unless the aggregate amount of all Losses
for which Seller would, but for this clause (i), be liable thereunder exceeds
on a cumulative basis GBP 10,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), and then only to
the extent of any such excess;

 

(ii) under Section 6.01(a)(i) for any individual claims until the Loss
relating thereto and all other claims relating to the same or similar facts,
circumstances, events or transactions exceeds GBP 100,000 (the " _Per Claim
Threshold_ ") and then all such amounts (including that below the Per Claim
Threshold) shall be deemed a Loss; and

 

(iii) under Section 6.01(a)(i) in excess of GBP 75,000,000 (the " _Cap_ ");
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that none of the Cap, the Deductible or the Per
Claim Threshold shall apply with respect to any claim for indemnification
arising out of a breach or alleged breach of a Seller Fundamental
Representation; _provided_   _further_ , _however_ , that the cumulative
indemnification obligations of Seller with respect to claims under this
Agreement (including with respect to any claim for indemnification arising out
of a breach or alleged breach of a Seller Fundamental Representation but
excluding claims under Section 6.03) shall not exceed the __ Purchase Price.

(c) For purposes of Section 6.01(a)(i) above, any breach of any
representation or warranty made by Seller in this Agreement (and the
calculation of Losses arising, resulting from or relating thereto) shall be
determined without regard to any materiality qualifications set forth in such
representation or warranty, and all references to the terms "material",
"Seller Material Adverse Effect", "Company Material Adverse Effect" or any
similar terms shall be given no effect and shall be disregarded in their
entirety for purposes of determining whether such representation or warranty
was breached and the amount of Losses arising out of or resulting from any
such breach of representation or warranty;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3.05(d), Section 3.09(a) (for purposes of determining which Contracts
are Company Contracts for purposes of this Agreement), Section 3.15 and the
second sentence of Section 3.16 shall remain so qualified by the terms

entitled pursuant to Section 7.05 and (ii) claims of, or causes of action
arising from, Actual Fraud, Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each other
Purchaser Indemnitee, agrees that its sole and exclusive remedy after the
Closing with respect to any and all claims under this Agreement shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VI.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 6.01(d) shall
in any way impair the rights and obligations of Purchaser and Seller to
resolve disputes with respect to the Closing Statement and the calculation of
the Final Closing Date Amount pursuant to Section 1.04, and the fact that
Purchaser may have the right to pursue a claim for indemnification under
Article VI with respect to any facts or circumstances shall not operate to
impair the application of Section 1.04 in accordance with its terms;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Purchaser be entitled to
receive indemnification for Losses (or Taxes) to the extent that any item is
reflected in the calculation of Closing Working Capital and therefore
reflected in the calculation of the Final Closing Date Amount.

 



43 SECTION 6.02 _General Indemnification by Purchaser_. (a) Subject to the
terms (including the limitations) set forth in this Article VI, from and
after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify Seller against, and hold it

each of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and
representatives and their respective successors and assigns (collectively, the
" _Seller Indemnitees_ ") (other than any Loss relating to Taxes, for which
indemnification is provided under Section 6.03) to the extent arising,
resulting from or relating to:

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by
Purchaser in this Agreement; and

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement made
or to be performed by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Group
Companies solely with respect to periods following the Closing).

 

(b) Purchaser shall not be required to indemnify Seller and shall not have any
liability:

 

(i) under Section 6.02(a)(i) unless the aggregate amount of all Losses for
which Purchaser would, but for this clause (i), be liable thereunder exceeds
on a cumulative basis the Deductible, and then only to the extent of any such
excess;

 

(ii) under Section 6.02(a)(i) for any individual claims until the Loss
relating thereto and all other claims relating to the same or similar facts,
circumstances, events or transactions exceeds the Per Claim Threshold, and
then all such amounts (including that below the Per Claim Threshold) shall be
deemed a Loss; and

 

(iii) under Section 6.02(a)(i) in excess of the Cap; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that none of the Cap, the Deductible, or the Per Claim Threshold shall apply
with respect to any claim for indemnification arising out of a breach or
alleged breach of a Purchaser Fundamental Representation; _provided_ _further_
, _however_ , that the cumulative indemnification obligations of Purchaser
with respect to claims under this Agreement (including with respect to any
claim for indemnification arising out of a breach or alleged breach of a
Purchaser Fundamental Representation) shall not exceed the __ Purchase Price.

(c) Except for (i) any specific enforcement remedy to which a party is
entitled pursuant to Section 7.05 and (ii) claims of, or causes of action
arising from, Actual Fraud, Seller, on behalf of itself and each of its
Affiliates, agrees that its sole and exclusive remedy after the Closing with
respect to any and all claims under this Agreement shall be

 



44  pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VI.

in any way impair the rights and obligations of Purchaser and Seller to
resolve disputes with respect to the Closing Statement and the calculation of
the Final Closing Date Amount pursuant to Section 1.04, and the fact that
Seller may have the right to pursue a claim for indemnification under Article
VI with respect to any facts or circumstances shall not operate to impair the
application of Section 1.04 in accordance with its terms; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall Seller be entitled to receive
indemnification for Losses (or Taxes) to the extent that any item is reflected
in the calculation of Closing Working Capital and therefore reflected in the
calculation of the Final Closing Date Amount.

 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Article VI shall limit the
rights of Seller or any of its Affiliates, or of any director, officer,
employee or agent of any such Person, in each case in such Persons capacity
as a direct or indirect equityholder, or as a director, officer, employee or
agent, of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (from and after Closing), or
limit the obligations of any such Person to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(from and after Closing) in such capacity.

 

SECTION 6.03 _Tax Indemnification_. (a) Subject to the terms (including the
limitations) set forth in this Article VI, from and after the Closing, Seller

(ii) Taxes resulting from any breach of any covenant or agreement relating to
Taxes contained in this Agreement made or to be performed by Seller or any of
its Affiliates;

(iii) Taxes of a third party for which any Group Company becomes liable as
a result of being or having been a member of a group with (or otherwise
connected with or associated with for any Tax purpose) such third party for
Tax purposes before the Closing;

 

(iv) Taxes of a third party for which any Group Company becomes liable as a
result of any obligation to indemnify any other person, or any successor or
transferee liability, in each case to the extent such Taxes related to an
event or transaction occurring before the Closing; and

 

(v) any Specified Tax Matter,

 



45 _provided_ that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Seller shall not be liable under this Section 6.03 for any Taxes (or Losses
resulting from such Taxes) to the extent any such Taxes (or Losses) (1) are
described in Section 6.03(b), (2) are attributable to a change in applicable
Law (including an increase in rates of Tax) or change in any practice of any
Taxing Authority, in each case that is announced after the Closing Date, (3)
arise as a result of any action taken or omitted to be taken by Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing Date, the Group

Companys business, (iii) taken or omitted pursuant to a binding commitment
created on or before the Closing, (iv) taken or omitted at the request of

can be reduced or offset by any Tax deductions, credits or similar attributes
available to the Group Companies as of the Closing and not taken into account
in calculating Closing Working Capital (other than any Tax deductions, credits
or attributes in respect of which a payment is made to Seller pursuant to
Section 5.04(c) or Section 5.04(d)).

(b) Subject to the terms (including the limitations) set forth in this
Article VI, from and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify Seller
against, and hold it harmless from any Loss or Tax incurred by a Seller
Indemnitee to the extent arising out of, resulting from or relating to:

(i) Taxes imposed on or payable by or on behalf of the Group Companies for
any Post-Closing Tax Period other than Taxes described in Section
6.03(a)(i)(B) and Section 6.03(a)(iv);

(ii) Taxes resulting from any breach of any covenant or agreement relating to
Taxes contained in this Agreement made or to be performed by Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates (including the Group Companies solely with respect to
periods following the Closing); and

(iii) Transfer Taxes for which Purchaser is responsible pursuant to Section
5.05.

 

(c) In the case of any Straddle Period:

 

(i) real, personal and intangible property Taxes imposed on a periodic basis
without regard to income, gross receipts, payroll, sales or any specific
transaction or event (" _Property Taxes_ ") of any Group Company for the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of such Property Taxes for the
entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of calendar days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of all calendar
days in the Straddle Period; and

(ii) Taxes of any Group Company (other than Property Taxes) for the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be computed as if a relevant taxable period ended as
of the close of business on the Closing Date.

 



46 (d) Any indemnity obligation for Taxes to be made pursuant to this Section
6.03 shall be paid within 30 Business Days after Purchaser or Seller, as
applicable, makes written demand upon the other party claiming it is entitled
to indemnification under this Section 6.03, but in no case earlier than
five Business Days prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes are required
to be paid to the relevant Taxing Authority.

SECTION 6.04  _Calculation of Losses; Mitigation_. (a) The amount of any Loss
(or Tax) for which indemnification is provided under this Article VI shall be
net of any amounts actually recovered by the indemnified party under insurance
policies or otherwise with respect to such Loss (or Tax) (net of the
reasonable, out-of-pocket costs of investigation and collection) and shall be
reduced to take account of any Tax benefit actually realized as a result of
the incurrence or payment of the applicable Loss (or Tax) as a reduction in
cash Taxes paid by the indemnified party (or, in the case of Purchaser, any
Group Company) in the taxable year in which the applicable Loss (or Tax) is
incurred and increased to take account of any Tax cost incurred by the
indemnified party as a result of the receipt of any indemnification payment
hereunder, determined on a with and without basis. The amount of the Loss (or
Tax) arising out of any item included as a liability in calculating Closing
Working Capital, if any, shall be calculated net of the amount so included. To
the extent that any amount is recovered by any indemnified party under an
insurance policy or any other source of indemnification is realized after the
date that an indemnity payment is made hereunder, then such indemnified party
shall pay to the indemnifying party such amounts (net of associated
reasonable out-of-pocket costs) no later than five days after such proceeds
are received (but not to exceed the amount of the indemnity payment).

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or provided under
applicable Law, Losses indemnifiable pursuant to this Article VI shall not
include Losses that are in the nature of punitive, incidental, consequential,
special, treble or indirect damages or damages based on any multiple,
including business interruption, loss of future revenue, profits or
income, or loss of business reputation or opportunity, in each case of any
kind or nature, regardless of the form of action through which any of the
foregoing are sought, in each case except to the extent (x) in the case of
consequential damages, including business interruption, loss of future
revenue, profits or income, or loss of business reputation or opportunity, any
such Losses are reasonably foreseeable to the indemnifying party or (y) any
such Losses are awarded and paid by an indemnified party with respect to a
Third Party Claim.

(c) Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with each other with respect to
resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one party is obligated
to indemnify the other party hereunder, including by using commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate any Loss for which indemnification is sought
under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the reasonable out-of-
pocket costs of such mitigation shall constitute Losses for purposes of this
Agreement. In the event that Purchaser or Seller shall fail to use such
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any claim or liability,
then notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained herein, the other
party shall not be required to indemnify any Person for any loss, liability,
claim, damage or expense that would reasonably be expected to have been
avoided if Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, had made such efforts.

 



47 SECTION 6.05 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification_. Any indemnity payment under
this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price,
except as otherwise required by applicable Law or a good faith resolution of a
Tax Claim.

 

SECTION 6.06 _Termination of Indemnification_. The obligations to indemnify
and hold harmless any party (a) pursuant to Section 6.01(a)(i) or Section
6.02(a)(i) shall terminate when the applicable representation or warranty
terminates pursuant to Section 6.09, (b) pursuant to Section 6.01(a)(ii) or
Section 6.02(a)(ii) shall terminate when the applicable covenant or agreement
terminates pursuant to Section 6.09, (c) pursuant to Section 6.01(a)(iii)
shall terminate on April 30, 2018 and (d) pursuant to Section 6.03 shall
terminate upon the date that is 60 days after the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations (as the same may be extended); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not
terminate with respect to any item as to which the Person to be indemnified
shall have, before the expiration of the applicable period, delivered a notice
of such claim in writing (stating in reasonable detail the basis of such
claim) pursuant to Section 6.07 or Section 6.08 to the party to be providing
the indemnification.

SECTION 6.07 _Indemnification Procedures for Other Than Tax Claims_.

 

(a) _Third Party Claims_. In order for a Person (the " _indemnified party_ ")
to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under Section 6.01 or
Section 6.02 in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim made by any
third Person against the indemnified party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such
indemnified party must notify the party required to provide indemnification
therefor (the " _indemnifying party_ ") in writing (and in reasonable detail)
of the Third Party Claim within 15 Business Days after receipt by such
indemnified party of written notice of the Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that failure to give, or delaying in giving, such notification
shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent
the indemnifying party shall have been prejudiced as a result of such
failure. Thereafter, the indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying
party, promptly following the indemnified partys receipt thereof, copies of
all written notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
indemnified party relating to the Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that failure to provide, or delay in providing, such copies shall not affect
the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying
party shall have been prejudiced as a result of such failure.

(b) _Assumption_. If a Third Party Claim is made against an indemnified
party, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense
thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel
selected by the indemnifying party that is reasonably acceptable to the
indemnified party; _provided_ that the indemnifying party shall not be
entitled to assume or continue control of the defense of any Third Party Claim
if (i) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any
criminal or quasi-criminal Proceeding, (ii) the Third Party Claim principally
seeks an injunction or equitable relief against any indemnified party, (iii)
the Third Party Claim when taken

 



48  together with all other unresolved Third Party Claims has resulted, or would
reasonably be expected to result in, Losses in excess of the Cap, (iv) the
Third Party Claim would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the indemnified partys business or relates to its customers,
suppliers, vendors or other service providers or (v) the indemnifying party
has failed or is failing to defend or prosecute in good faith the Third Party
Claim. Should the indemnifying party so elect in writing to assume the defense
of a Third Party Claim, (x) the indemnifying party shall defend such Third
Party Claim in good faith and (y) the indemnifying party shall not be liable
to the indemnified party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof; _provided_ , that if
on the advice of counsel to the indemnified party, (1) there are
legal defenses available to an indemnified party that are different from or
additional to those available to the indemnifying party; or (2) there exists
reasonable likelihood of a conflict of interest between the indemnifying party
and the indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the indemnified party in each
jurisdiction for which the indemnified party determines counsel is required.
If the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the indemnified party shall
have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel,
subject to the immediately preceding sentence, separate from the counsel
employed by the indemnifying party, it being understood that the indemnifying
party shall control such defense. The indemnifying party shall be liable for
the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the indemnified party for any
period during which the indemnifying party has not assumed the
defense thereof (other than during any period in which the indemnified party
shall have failed to give notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above).
If the indemnifying party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim,
all the indemnified parties shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or
prosecution thereof upon the request of, and at the sole cost and expense of,
the indemnifying party. Such cooperation shall include the retention of, and
upon the indemnifying partys written request, the provision of, records and
information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim (which
shall be subject to Section 5.07 and Section 5.12). Whether or not the
indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
indemnified party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle,
compromise or discharge such Third Party Claim without the indemnifying
partys prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the indemnified party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or
discharge of a Third Party Claim that the indemnifying party may recommend and
that by its terms (i) involves only money damages and does not seek an
injunction, equitable relief or other nonmonetary relief against any
indemnified party, including the imposition of a consent order, injunction or
decree that would restrict the future activity or conduct of the indemnified
party, (ii) contains an unconditional release of each indemnified party with
respect to such Third Party Claim, (iii) includes no finding or admission of
fault or misconduct by any indemnified party, and (iv) obligates the
indemnifying party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection
therewith (regardless of the Cap) (a settlement, compromise or discharge
meeting all requirements of clauses (i) through (iv), a " _Specified
Settlement_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the indemnifying party shall
not, without prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle,
compromise or offer to settle or compromise any Third Party Claim except if
such settlement, compromise or offer is a Specified Settlement.

 



49 (c) If the indemnifying party is not entitled to, or does not elect to, assume
or control the defense of a Third Party Claim, (i) the indemnified party
shall have the right to conduct such defense, and (ii) the indemnified party
may only consent to entry of any judgment upon, or settle, compromise or
discharge any such Third Party Claim, with the prior written consent of the
indemnifying party (which consent shall not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 

(d) _Other Claims_. In the event any indemnified party should have a claim
against any indemnifying party under Section 6.01 or Section 6.02 that does
not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be
collected from such indemnified party, the indemnified party shall promptly
deliver written notice of such claim (describing such claim in reasonable
detail) to the indemnifying party. Subject to Section 6.06 and Section 6.09,
the failure by any indemnified party to so notify the indemnifying party shall
not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability that it may have to
such indemnified party under Section 6.01 or Section 6.02, except to the
extent that the indemnifying party shall have been prejudiced as a result of
such failure. If the indemnifying party does not notify the indemnified
party within 30 calendar days following its receipt of such notice that the
indemnifying party disputes its liability to the indemnified party under
Section 6.01 or Section 6.02, such claim specified by the indemnified party in
such notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the indemnifying
party under Section 6.01 or Section 6.02 and the indemnifying party shall pay
the amount of such liability to the indemnified party on demand or, in the
case of any notice in which the amount of the claim (or any portion thereof)
is estimated, on such later date when the amount of such claim (or such
portion thereof) becomes finally determined.

 

(e) Tax Claims shall be governed by Section 6.08 and not by this Section 6.07.

 

SECTION 6.08 _Indemnification Procedures for Tax Claims_. (a) If a claim shall
be made by any Taxing Authority, which, if successful, might result in an
indemnity payment to any indemnified party pursuant to Section 6.03 (or if an
indemnified party becomes aware of any matter that may give rise to such a
claim), the indemnified party shall promptly (and in any event within 15
Business Days of receipt of written notice of such claim) notify the
indemnifying party in writing of such claim or matter (a " _Tax Claim_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give, or delay in giving, such
notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to
the extent the indemnifying party shall have been actually prejudiced as a
result of such failure.

 

(b) With respect to any Tax Claim relating solely to Taxes of any Group
Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Seller shall control (at its sole
expense) all Proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including
selection of counsel) but Purchaser shall have the right to participate
in such Proceeding at its own expense, and Seller shall not be able to
settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of such Tax

 



50  Claim that is reasonably likely to affect the Tax liability of any Group
Company or Purchaser or any of their Affiliates for any Post-Closing Tax
Period without the consent of Purchaser (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _that_ , that if Seller fails
to assume control of the conduct of any such Proceeding within a reasonable
period following the receipt by Seller of notice of such Tax Claim, Purchaser
shall have the right to assume control of such Proceeding and shall be able to
settle, compromise and/or concede such Tax Claim in its sole discretion.
Seller and Purchaser shall jointly control (at each partys sole expense) all
Proceedings taken in connection with any Tax Claim relating solely to Taxes of
any Group Company for a Straddle Period.

 

(c) To the extent reasonably requested by Seller and at Sellers sole cost and
expense in the case of reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses, Purchaser
shall, and shall cause the applicable Group Company to, cooperate with Seller
in contesting any Tax Claim, which cooperation shall to the extent reasonably
practicable include the retention (and upon Sellers reasonable request the
provision to Seller) of records and information which are reasonably relevant
to such Tax Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information or explanation of any material
provided hereunder or to testify at Proceedings relating to such Tax Claim.

 

(d) Purchaser shall not be required to take, and shall not be required to
cause the applicable Group Company to take, any action pursuant to Section
6.08(b) or (c):

(i) if Purchaser or the Group Company or any person connected with any
of them reasonably considers such action would be unlawful;

(ii) unless Seller indemnifies Purchaser and the Group Companies to
Purchasers reasonable satisfaction against any Losses which may be incurred;
or

(iii) where such action involves an appeal to a judicial body, unless Seller
has obtained the opinion of leading Tax counsel (being counsel reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser) that there is a reasonable prospect that the appeal
will succeed.

 

(e) No Purchaser Indemnitee shall settle or otherwise compromise any Tax Claim
relating solely to Taxes of any Group Company for a taxable period that ends
on or before the Closing Date without prior written consent of Seller (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless Seller
fails to assume control of any Proceeding in connection with such Tax Claim
and Purchaser assumes such control pursuant to Section 6.08(b). Neither party
shall settle a Tax Claim relating solely to Taxes of any Group Company for a
Straddle Period without the other partys prior written consent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , that
Purchaser may settle such a Tax Claim without Sellers prior written consent
in the event that Seller fails to assume control of any Proceeding
in connection with such Tax Claim and Purchaser assumes such control pursuant
to Section 6.08(b).

 



51 SECTION 6.09 _Survival of Representations and Covenants_. The
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing as follows: (a) the Seller Fundamental
Representations and the Purchaser Fundamental Representations shall survive
the Closing until the date that is 60 days after expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations (as may be extended); (b) the representations and
warranties in Section 3.11 shall not survive the Closing; (c) the
representations and warranties in Section 3.18 shall survive the Closing
until the date that is 36 months after the Closing Date, (d) the
representations and warranties in Article II, Article III and Article IV
(other than the Seller Fundamental Representations, the Purchaser Fundamental
Representations and the representations and warranties in Section 3.11 and
Section 3.18) shall survive the Closing until April 30, 2019; and (e) the
covenants and agreements of the parties contained in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing until the first anniversary of the Closing Date, except
for those covenants and agreements that by their terms are to be performed in
whole or in part at or after the Closing, which covenants shall survive in
accordance with their terms.

ARTICLE VII

 

 _General Provisions_

 

SECTION 7.01 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may be amended or waived
if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed by the
party against whom such amendment or waiver shall be enforced. The failure of
any party to exercise any right, power or remedy provided under this Agreement
or otherwise available in respect hereof at Law or in equity, or to insist
upon compliance by any other party with its obligations hereunder, shall not
constitute a waiver by such party of its right to exercise any such other
right, power or remedy or to demand such compliance.

 

SECTION 7.02 _Assignment_. This Agreement and the rights and obligations
hereunder shall not be assignable or transferable by any party (including by
operation of Law in connection with a merger or consolidation of such party)
without the prior written consent of the other parties; _provided_ , _however_
, that Purchaser may assign, in its sole discretion, all of its rights,
interests and obligations hereunder to as collateral security to any lender to
Purchaser or to an Affiliate of Purchaser, but (i) no such assignment shall
relieve Purchaser of its obligations hereunder, (ii) any such
assignment shall not be taken into account for purposes of calculating any
increase to an indemnity payment under Section 6.04 and (iii) if Purchasers
assignee is required to withhold any amounts under Section 1.05 from any
amounts payable to Seller or any of its Affiliates as a result of any such
assignment, Purchasers assignee shall pay to Seller or such Affiliate such
additional amounts as are required so that Seller or such Affiliate receives
the same amount it would have received had no such withholding been made,
except to the extent such withholding would have been required had Purchaser
made such payments. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section 7.02
shall be void.

 



52 SECTION 7.03 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is for the sole
benefit of the parties and their permitted assigns and nothing herein
expressed or implied shall give or be construed to give to any Person, other
than the parties hereto and their permitted assigns, any legal or equitable
rights or remedies hereunder;  _provided_ , _however_ , that each of this
Section 7.03 and Article VI is intended to be for the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the Purchaser Indemnitees and the Seller Indemnitees, as
applicable; _provided_   _further_ , _however_ , that each of this Section
7.03 and Section 5.10 is intended to be for the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the Indemnitees.

permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered by

SECTION 7.05 _Right to Specific Performance_. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to
equitable relief, including in the form of an injunction or injunctions, to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction
as set forth in Section 7.14, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which any party is entitled at Law or in equity. The right to specific
enforcement shall include the right of Seller to cause Purchaser to cause the
Transactions to be consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in

 



54  this Agreement. The parties hereto further agree to (a) waive any
requirement for the security or posting of any bond in connection with any
such equitable remedy and (b) not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to applicable Law or
inequitable for any reason, or to assert that a remedy of monetary damages
would provide an adequate remedy. The parties acknowledge and agree that
the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, the parties hereto
would not have entered into this Agreement. In the event that a court of
competent jurisdiction enters a binding and non-appealable order or similar
requirement resulting in rescission or a similar remedy with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the parties agree that
(notwithstanding any indemnification obligations or any other provision in
this agreement), they will take any and all such actions such that the result
of such remedy is equitable to both parties.
