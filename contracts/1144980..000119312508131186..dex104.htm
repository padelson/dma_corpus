ARTICLE 3

_EARNEST MONEY_

3.1 _Deposit and Investment of Earnest Money_. On the Effective Date,
Purchaser shall deposit the Earnest Money with Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent
shall invest the Earnest Money in one or more interest-bearing accounts
satisfactory to Seller and Purchaser, shall not commingle the Earnest Money
with any funds of Escrow Agent or others, and shall promptly provide Purchaser
and Seller with confirmation of the investments made. Such account shall have
no penalty for early withdrawal, and Purchaser accepts all risks with regard
to such account. Purchaser and Seller shall promptly provide Escrow Agent with
the appropriate Forms W-9 for tax identification number certifications, or
Forms W-8 for non resident alien certifications.

3.2 _Independent Consideration_. If Purchaser elects to terminate this
Agreement and is entitled to receive a return of the Earnest Money pursuant
to the terms hereof, the Escrow Agent shall first disburse to Seller One
Hundred and No/100 Dollars ($100.00) as independent consideration for Sellers
performance under this Agreement (" _Independent Consideration_ "), which
shall be retained by Seller in all instances. 3.3 _Form; Failure to Deposit_. The Earnest Money shall be in the form of the
wire transfer to Escrow Agent of immediately available U.S. federal funds. If
Purchaser fails to timely deposit the Earnest Money within the time periods
required, Seller may terminate this Agreement by written notice to Purchaser,
and thereafter the parties hereto shall have no further rights or obligations
hereunder, except for rights and obligations which, by their terms, survive
the termination hereof.

3.4 _Disposition of Earnest Money_. The Earnest Money shall be applied as a
credit to the Purchase Price at Closing. However, if Purchaser is entitled to
and elects to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the express terms
of Section 5.2, Section 7.2, Section 7.3.8, Section 10.2 or Section 12.20
hereof (the " _Permitted Purchaser Termination Provisions_ "), Escrow Agent
shall pay the entire Earnest Money (less the Independent Consideration) to
Purchaser on the third Business Day following Escrow Agents and Sellers
receipt of notice from Purchaser (as long as the current investment can be
liquidated and disbursed in one Business Day) and neither party shall have
any further liability, rights or obligations, other than those that by these
terms survive the termination of this Agreement. In the event of a termination
of this Agreement by either Seller or Purchaser for any reason other than by
Purchaser pursuant to the Permitted Purchaser Termination Provisions, Escrow
Agent is authorized to deliver the Earnest Money to Seller pursuant to the
terms hereof on the third Business Day following receipt by Escrow Agent and
Purchaser of written notice of such termination from Seller. With respect to
either such termination, if the party to whom the Earnest Money is NOT being
returned notifies Escrow Agent that it disputes the right of other party to
receive the Earnest Money prior to the third Business Day after receipt of
such notice, Escrow Agent shall not disburse the Earnest Money until such
dispute is resolved in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In such
event, Escrow Agent may interplead the Earnest Money into a court of
competent jurisdiction in the county in which the Earnest Money has been
deposited. All attorneys fees and costs and Escrow Agents costs and expenses
incurred in connection with such interpleader shall be assessed against the
party that is not awarded the Earnest Money, or if the Earnest Money is
distributed in part to both parties, then in the inverse proportion of such
distribution. Interest earned on the Earnest Money shall in all events be
distributed in the same manner as the Earnest Money.

3.5 _Treatment of Earnest Money_. The parties hereto agree to treat the
Earnest Money and interest accrued thereon as owned by the Purchaser and not
received by Seller, in all cases to the extent not paid to Seller pursuant to
this Agreement, and to file all tax returns on a basis consistent with
such treatment. Until the Closing or other disposition of the Earnest Money
in accordance with the terms hereof, the beneficial interest in the Earnest
Money remains with Purchaser and all interest and other income earned on the
Earnest Money shall be reported as taxable income of Purchaser, and the
parties hereto shall file applicable tax forms consistent with such treatment.
Any disbursement of the Earnest Money to Seller may be treated for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as consisting, in part, of imputed interest in
accordance with the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder. ARTICLE 4

_DUE DILIGENCE_

4.1 _Due Diligence Materials To Be Delivered_. Seller shall deliver to
Purchaser complete (to Sellers knowledge) copies of, and/or make electronic
copies available to Purchaser on Sellers iPortal internet site relating to
the Property and containing documents relating thereto (" _iPortal_ ") of
and/or make available in Sellers Atlanta office, the following (the "

available to Purchaser on iPortal to a compact disk at the close of business
on the Property Information Delivery Date and shall promptly provide the same
to Purchaser for its records). Except for the Rent Roll contemplated in
Section 4.1.1, Sellers obligation to deliver the items listed in this Section
4.1 shall be limited to the extent such items are in the possession of Seller.

4.1.1 _Rent Roll_. A current rent roll in Sellers standard form for the
Property, together with (i) the purchase price allocated to each Property

this Agreement, the term " _Original Acquisition Purchase Agreement_ " means

components, described in Section 17.10(c)(ii) of that certain Lease Agreement
dated December 12, 2005 by and between ASTAR ASB TX1, LP, and ASTAR ASB GA3,

4.4.1 _Purchase Price Adjustment for Certain Matters Discovered During the
Inspection Period_. Purchaser shall have through the Closing in which to
examine, inspect, and investigate the Property Information (the " _Property
Documents_ ") and the Property. In the event that Purchaser discovers during
the Inspection Period that (a) there exists a material defect to title to a
Property rendering title to such Property or a material portion thereof
unmarketable or materially adversely affecting the value thereof (other than
to the extent attributable to an action or inaction by Purchaser or any
affiliate thereof), or (b) there exists a material zoning violation at a
Property rendering such Property or any material portion thereof unusable for
motor vehicle sales, automobile body services or other automobile services,
as applicable for such Property, and the current use applicable for such
Property (other than to the extent attributable to an action or inaction by
Purchaser or any affiliate thereof), then Purchaser may request an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for the applicable Property by giving
written notice to Seller and Escrow Agent (the " _Purchase Price Adjustment
Notice_ ") on or before the last day of the Inspection Period setting forth in
reasonable detail the reason for the requested adjustment and the requested
amount of the adjustment, which in no event shall exceed 75% with respect to
Subsection (a) hereof, and 25% with respect to Subsection (b) hereof of the
portion of the Allocated Purchase Price for such Property. If Purchaser does
not give a Purchase Price Adjustment Notice for the matters set forth in this
Section 4.4.1 prior to the last day of the Inspection Period, Purchaser shall
be deemed to have waived its right to any adjustment of the Purchase Price
pursuant to this Section 4.4.1.

4.4.2 _Purchase Price Adjustment for Certain Environmental Matters_. In the
event that reports, tests or studies obtained by Purchaser or delivered to
Purchaser by Seller after the Effective Date, including without limitation,
the 2008 Environmental Reports, indicate the existence or reasonable
potential existence of any contamination of any portion of the Property that
(i) is not disclosed in the Property Documents delivered to Purchaser prior to
the Effective Date (other than the 2008 Environmental Summary) and (ii) is
material (meaning that the reasonably estimated cost of remediation and/or
other liability associated therewith, as determined by Sellers environmental
consultants, exceeds $100,000 for such Property) and if and only if
the applicable tenant or Guarantor is not required to remediate such damage
or indemnify the owner of the applicable Property therefor pursuant to the
applicable Lease or Guaranty, then Purchaser may request an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for such Property by delivering to Seller a Purchase Price
Adjustment Notice setting forth in reasonable detail the    reason for the requested adjustment and the requested amount of the
adjustment in accordance with the terms of Section 4.4.5 (in no event shall
any such adjustment exceed 75% of the Allocated Purchase Price for such
Property), provided that the Purchase Price Adjustment Notice shall
additionally include with copies of the reports, tests or studies identifying
such contamination.

4.4.3 _Purchase Price Adjustment for Newly Disclosed Information and Rent
Adjustment Information_.

(a) Newly Disclosed Information. In the event that Newly Disclosed Information
(as defined in Section 6.4) is provided that adversely affects a Property
or the value thereto of at least $50,000, and if the Indemnity described
herein is not provided, then Purchaser may request an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for such Property by delivering to Seller a Purchase Price
Adjustment Notice setting forth in reasonable detail the reason for the
requested adjustment and the requested amount of the adjustment in accordance
with the terms of Section 4.4.5 (in no event shall any such adjustment exceed
75% of the Allocated Purchase Price for such Property). With respect to Newly
Disclosed Information that adversely affects a Property or the value thereof
reasonably estimated to be at least $50,000 and such adverse effect cannot be
reasonably reduced to, or liquidated to, a monetary amount, iStar Financial
Inc. may provide an indemnity in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser indemnifying Purchaser against any loss, cost or damage incurred
with respect to such matter, with the liability of iStar Financial Inc.
being capped at the Allocated Purchase Price for the applicable Property (the
" _Indemnity_ "). If and to the extent that iStar Financial Inc. provides to
Purchaser an Indemnity, then Purchaser shall not be entitled to any
adjustment of the Purchase Price with respect thereto.

(b) Rent Adjustment Information. In the event that Rent Adjustment Information
(as defined in Section 6.4) is provided and such Rent Adjustment Information
does NOT constitute a Significant Reduction, then the Allocated Purchase Price
for the applicable Property shall be changed to equal the reduced base rent
divided by 0.07661. In the event that Rent Adjustment Information is provided
and such Rent Adjustment Information does constitute a Significant Reduction,
then Seller shall have the rights set forth in Section 6.4; provided, however,
that Purchaser and Seller may attempt, but shall not be obligated, to
negotiate an agreeable adjustment to the Purchase Price in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 4.4.5.

4.4.4 _Exclusions from Purchase Price Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Purchaser shall have no right to any adjustment to the
Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 4.4 or Section 6.4 due to (i) the
terms of any Lease or Guaranty, except to the extent amended after the
Effective Date without Purchasers approval as required under the terms of
this Agreement and except as expressly permitted under Section 6.4(b), (ii)
the environmental condition of any Property except as explicitly provided in
Section 4.4.2, (iii) any casualty or condemnation affecting any Property or
any portion thereof except as explicitly provided in Section 6.2 or Section
6.3, (iv) the fact that the Property located at 3600-3630 West Airport
Freeway, Irving, TX is currently being used as a body shop and office space or
that the Property located at 3900 West Airport Freeway, Irving, TX is vacant
per the terms of a Letter Agreement dated January 11, 2007, (v) any lawsuit
affecting any Property for which a tenant or Guarantor is required to
indemnify the Property owner, (vi) the Nalley Lexus Work, as defined in
Section 6.1.3 or the technical default of the tenant for failure to obtain
consent for the    Nalley Lexus Work (it being understood and agreed that Seller has not
declared such default in a notice to the tenant with respect thereto), (vii)
the Purchase Contracts which are to be assumed by Purchaser in accordance
with the terms hereof except for Newly Discovered Matters relating thereto,
which are subject to Section 6.4(a), (viii) the Unrecorded Agreements, as
defined in Section 9.1.12 except for Newly Discovered Matters relating
thereto, which are subject to Section 6.4(a), or (ix) matters arising after
the Effective Date and prior to the Closing Date except as explicitly provided
for Newly Discovered Matters in Section 6.4(a) or Rent Adjustment Information
in Section 6.4(b).

4.4.5 _Procedures for Determining Purchase Price Adjustment_. During any
Price Adjustment Period, Seller and Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to
reach agreement on the amount of any adjustment to the Purchase Price of any
affected Property. If Seller and Purchaser agree in a writing signed by both
parties on an adjustment to the Purchase Price, then such amount shall become
final and binding on the parties. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to
resolve any disagreement as to amount of any adjustment to the Purchase Price
during the Price Adjustment Period, then the dispute will be promptly referred
for mandatory arbitration in accordance with Section 12.21, which arbitration
shall be final and binding on both Purchaser and Seller, unless
parties mutually agree to a different dispute resolution mechanism. In the
event that said arbitration (or other dispute resolution mechanism) has not
been concluded by the Closing Date, then a portion of the Purchase Price equal
to the disputed amount (the " _Escrow Amount_ ") shall be deposited by Escrow
Agent into an account maintained by Escrow Agent to be held and disbursed in
accordance with the terms of an escrow agreement substantially in the form of
_Exhibit J_  (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that Purchaser shall have no right to terminate this Agreement other than as
expressly provided in the Permitted Purchaser Termination Provisions, to delay
Closing for resolution of any dispute regarding an adjustment to the Purchase
Price hereunder (except as expressly provided in Section 6.3 below), or to
withhold any portion of the Purchase Price at Closing in lieu of depositing
the same with Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser and Seller hereby agree
that, if Purchaser is permitted pursuant to the terms of Section 4.4, Section
6.2, Section 6.3 or Section 6.4 of this Agreement to, and does so request, a
Purchase Price Adjustment for any Property in an amount in excess of 25% of
the Allocated Purchase Price therefor, then Seller, at its sole option and by
giving written notice to Purchaser within the Price Adjustment Period, may
elect to terminate this Agreement with respect to such Property or, in the
event such Property is leased pursuant to the McDavid Lease, terminate this
Agreement with respect to every Property leased pursuant to the McDavid Lease
and the Purchase Price payable under this Agreement shall be reduced by the
amount of the Allocated Purchase Price for the applicable Property(ies) unless
Purchaser elects, within 10 Business Days after receipt of Sellers notice,
to reduce the requested adjustment to the Purchase Price to 25% of the
Allocated Purchase Price therefor.

4.5  _Return of Documents and Reports_. As additional consideration for the
transaction contemplated herein, if Purchaser fails to consummate the purchase
of the Property pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise defaults on its
obligations hereunder at or prior to Closing for any reason, then, within
three (3) Business Days after Sellers request (which request may be made at
Sellers sole option), Purchaser shall provide to Seller copies of all third
party reports, investigations and studies, other than economic analyses
(collectively, the " _Reports_ " and, individually, a " _Report_ ") prepared
for Purchaser in connection with its due diligence    review of the Property, including, without limitation, any and all Reports
involving structural or geological conditions, environmental, hazardous waste
or hazardous substances contamination of the Property, if any; provided,
however, that as a condition precedent to providing such Reports to Seller,
Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for all of Purchasers actual out-of-pocket
costs of obtaining such Reports, including the costs of any Reports
previously provided to Seller pursuant to Section 4.11 hereof. The Reports
shall be delivered to Seller without any representation or warranty as to the
completeness or accuracy of the Reports or any other matter relating thereto.
Purchasers obligation to deliver the Property Documents and the Reports to
Seller shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

the extent known or readily available to the public, Purchaser shall not
disclose prior to the Closing the contents to any person other than to the
trustees, directors, officers, employees and partners of Purchaser or its
parent company, and to Purchasers potential lenders, potential investors,
attorneys, accountants and other consultants and permitted assignees and to
the tenants under the Leases and Guarantor, provided that such persons have
agreed to preserve the confidentiality of such information as required hereby,
and may be disclosed to the extent required by law (collectively, "
_Permitted Outside Parties_ "). At any time and from time to time, within two
Business Days after Sellers request, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a list
of all parties to whom Purchaser has provided any Property Documents or any
information taken from the Property Documents. Purchaser shall not divulge the
contents of the Property Documents and other information except in strict
accordance with the confidentiality standards set forth in this Section 4.7.
In permitting Purchaser to review the Property Documents or any other
information, Seller has not waived any privilege or claim of confidentiality
with respect thereto, and no third party benefits or relationships of any
kind, either express or implied, have been offered, intended or created.
Purchasers obligations under this Section 4.7 and any other confidentiality
agreement between Purchaser or its Affiliates and Seller or its Affiliates

with respect to financial information provided as part of the Property
Documents and indemnification obligations.

4.8 _No Representation or Warranty by Seller_. Purchaser acknowledges that,
except as expressly set forth in this Agreement and any other document

and does not make any warranty or representation regarding the truth, accuracy
or completeness of the Property Documents or the source(s) thereof.
Purchaser further acknowledges that some if not all of the Property Documents
were prepared by third parties other than Seller. Except as expressly set
forth in this Agreement or the documents required to be executed by Seller and
delivered to Purchaser at Closing, Seller expressly disclaims any and all
liability for representations or warranties, express or implied, statements of
fact and other matters contained in such information, or for omissions from
the Property Documents, or in any other written or oral communications
transmitted or made available to Purchaser. Purchaser shall rely solely upon
its own investigation with respect to the Property, including, without
limitation, the Propertys physical, environmental or    economic condition, compliance or lack of compliance with any ordinance,
order, permit or regulation or any other attribute or matter relating
thereto. Seller has not undertaken any independent investigation as to the
truth, accuracy or completeness of the Property Documents and are providing
the Property Documents solely as an accommodation to Purchaser.

4.9 _Purchaser s Responsibilities_. In conducting any inspections,

concerning the Property and the Property Documents to anyone other than the
Permitted Outside Parties, in accordance with the confidentiality standards
set forth in Section 4.7 above, or except as may be otherwise required by
law. Purchasers obligations under this Section 4.9 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.

4.10  _Purchaser s Agreement to Indemnify_. Purchaser hereby agrees to
indemnify, defend and hold Seller harmless from and against any and all liens,
claims, causes of action, damages, liabilities and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of Purchasers inspections or tests
permitted under this Agreement or any violation of the provisions of Sections
4.3, 4.7 and 4.9; provided, however, the indemnity shall not extend to protect
Seller from its own negligence or misconduct or from any pre-existing
liabilities for matters merely discovered by Purchaser (i.e., latent
environmental contamination) so long as Purchasers actions do not aggravate
any pre-existing liability of Seller. Purchaser also hereby agrees to
indemnify, defend and hold any tenant harmless from and against any and all
claims, causes of action, damages, liabilities and expenses which such tenant
may suffer or incur due to Purchasers breach of its obligation under Section
4.7 above to maintain the confidential nature of any Property Documents or
other information relative to such tenant. Purchasers obligations under this
Section 4.10 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall
survive the Closing.

4.11 _Environmental Studies_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in Section 4.5 above, as additional consideration for the
transaction contemplated in this Agreement, Purchaser shall, upon Sellers
request (which request may be made at Sellers sole option) provide to Seller,
promptly following the receipt of same by Purchaser, copies of any and all
reports, tests or studies involving contamination of or other environmental
concerns relating to the Property received by Purchaser prior to Closing;
provided, however, Purchaser shall have no obligation to cause any such tests
or studies to be performed on the Property. Seller shall reimburse Purchaser
for the costs of such reports, tests or studies if so required under Section
4.5 above. Seller acknowledges that Purchaser has not made and does not make
any warranty or representation regarding the truth or accuracy of any such
studies or reports. Notwithstanding    Section 4.10 above, Purchaser shall have no liability or culpability of any
nature as a result of having provided such information to Seller or as
a result of Sellers reliance thereon or arising out of the fact that
Purchaser merely conducted such tests or studies, so long as Purchasers
actions do not aggravate any pre-existing liability of Seller.

Purchase Price or a portion thereof for such purpose), and Seller shall
deliver the Property free and clear of any such financing liens or mechanics
liens that are attributable to any work or actions of Seller (but not of any
tenant); provided, however that the foregoing requirement to discharge liens
shall not apply to liens on any tenants leasehold estate permitted under the
Leases. Seller further agrees to remove any exceptions or encumbrances to

by, through or under Purchaser; items shown on the Survey; real estate taxes
and special assessments not yet due and payable; rights of tenants under the
Leases; rights of licensees under License Agreements; and the items set forth
on _Schedule 5.3_.

Leases) and bringing the title current to the date of the Closing without
exceptions other than the standard exclusions from coverage contained in such
policy and the Permitted Exceptions and insuring Purchasers fee simple title

subdivision (as applicable), arbitration deletion, and survey amendment, to
the extent available in the state in which such Property is located (the "
_Title Policy_ "), Seller shall be entitled to a thirty (30) day period to
identify a replacement title company to provide the Title Policy, with a
corresponding extension of the Closing Date. If Seller fails to identify a
replacement title company within said period, Purchaser shall have the right
to terminate this Agreement, in which case the Earnest Money shall be
immediately returned to Purchaser and the parties hereto shall have no further
rights or obligations, other than those that by their terms survive the

be required for necessary repair or replacement, and replacement shall be

Personal Property. Purchaser acknowledges that (i) the Nalley Lexus Work has
commenced notwithstanding that the tenant failed to obtain required consent

limitation, tenant financial information to the extent in Sellers
possession, and (b) requesting Purchasers approval, which may be given or
withheld with respect to License Agreements in Purchasers sole discretion or,
with respect to Leases, in Purchasers sole discretion or such lesser
standard as is required of Seller under the applicable Lease. Purchaser agrees
to give Seller written notice of approval or disapproval of a proposed
amendment or termination of a Lease or License Agreement or new Lease or new
License Agreement within two Business Days after Purchasers receipt of the

request within such time period, then Purchaser will be deemed to have
approved such amendment, termination or new Lease or new License Agreement.

6.2 _Damage_. If prior to Closing the Property is damaged by fire or other
casualty, Seller shall, promptly upon receiving actual knowledge thereof
notify Purchaser of the same, and estimate the cost to repair and the time

Property or any portion thereof after the Effective Date but prior to
Closing, and if and only if (i) the applicable tenant or Guarantor is _not_
required to repair the damage pursuant to the applicable Lease or Guaranty, or
(ii) the tenant is entitled to and elects to terminate the Lease as result of
such casualty or is entitled to a material reduction in its rent as a result
of such casualty (either, a " _Lease Casualty Event_ "), then Purchaser may
request an adjustment to the Allocated Purchase Price for such Property in
accordance with the terms of Section 4.4.5 (in no event shall any such
adjustment exceed 75% of the Allocated Purchase Price for such Property);
provided however, that for purposes of this Section 6.2.1 only, the Price
Adjustment Period shall commence on the date on which Seller receives the
Purchase Price Adjustment Notice (which shall not later than three Business
Days after Purchaser receives the Casualty Notice) and shall expire five
Business Days thereafter. The parties shall proceed under this Agreement and
close on schedule, and as of Closing Seller shall assign to Purchaser, without
representation or warranty by or recourse against Seller, all of Sellers
rights in and to any resulting insurance proceeds (including any rent loss
insurance applicable to any period on and after the Closing Date) due Seller
as a result of such damage or destruction and Purchaser shall assume
full responsibility for all needed repairs, and Purchaser shall receive a
credit at Closing for any deductible amount under such insurance policies to
the extent not payable by the applicable tenant under the applicable Lease or
by Guarantor under the Guaranty (but the amount of the deductible plus
insurance proceeds shall not exceed the lesser of (a) the cost of repair or
(b) the portion of the Allocated Purchase Price the applicable Property and a
pro rata share of the rental or business loss proceeds, if any). For the
purposes of this Agreement, " _Material Damage_ " and " _Materially Damaged_ "
means damage which, in Sellers reasonable estimation, exceeds $250,000 to
repair. 

6.2.2 _Not Material_. If the Property is not Materially Damaged by the
casualty and no Lease Casualty Event has occurred, then Purchaser shall have
no right to request an adjustment to the Purchase Price under this Agreement,
and, if an only if the applicable tenant or Guarantor is _not_ required to
repair the damage pursuant to the applicable Lease or Guaranty, Seller shall,
at its option, either (a) repair the damage before the Closing in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser (and if necessary, Seller may extend the
Closing Date up to 30 days to complete such repairs), or (b) credit Purchaser
at Closing for the reasonable cost to complete the repair (in which case
Seller shall retain all insurance proceeds and Purchaser shall assume full
responsibility for all needed repairs). If the applicable tenant is required
to repair the Property under the applicable Lease and no Lease Casualty Event
has occurred, then Purchaser shall have no right to request an adjustment to
or credit against the Purchase Price under this Agreement or that Seller
repair the damage.

6.3 _Condemnation_

6.3.1 If Seller receives notice of, or proceedings are instituted for,
eminent domain with respect to the Property or any portion thereof after the
Effective Date and prior to the Closing (a " _Condemnation_ "), and if an only
if (i) the applicable tenant or Guarantor is _not_ required to restore the
Property pursuant to the applicable Lease or Guaranty, or (ii) the tenant is
entitled to and elects to terminate the Lease as result of such
condemnation or is entitled to a material reduction in its rent as a result
of such condemnation (either, a " _Lease Condemnation Event_ "), then
Purchaser may remove such Property from this Agreement and receive an
adjustment to the Purchase Price equal to the Allocated Purchase Price for
such Property, or    request an adjustment to the Purchase Price for such Property in accordance
with the terms of Section 4.4.5 (in no event shall any such adjustment exceed
75% of the Allocated Purchase Price for such Property); provided however, that
for purposes of this Section 6.3 only, the Price Adjustment Period shall
commence on the date on which Seller receives the Purchase Price Adjustment
Notice (which shall not later than three Business Days after Purchaser
receives the notice of the eminent domain proceeding) and shall expire five
Business Days thereafter. In addition to the first sentence of this Section
6.3 (and unless Purchaser elects to remove the applicable Property from this
Agreement), in the event a Condemnation, the parties shall proceed under this
Agreement and close on schedule, and as of Closing Seller shall assign to
Purchaser Sellers entire right, title and interest in and to any
condemnation award, and Purchaser shall have the sole right after the Closing
(as between Purchaser and Seller, but subject to the terms of the applicable
Lease with respect to any rights of tenant) to negotiate and otherwise deal
with the condemning authority in respect of such matter. With respect to the
proceedings described in _Schedule 6.3_ or any proceedings with respect to
which the applicable tenant is required to restore the Property under the
applicable Lease and no Lease Condemnation Event has occurred, Purchaser shall
have no right to request any adjustment to the Purchase Price under this
Agreement, and shall proceed under this Agreement and Seller shall, at the
Closing, assign to Purchaser Sellers entire right, title and interest in and
to any condemnation award relating thereto, and Purchaser shall have the sole
right after the Closing (as between Purchaser and Seller, but subject to the
terms of the applicable Lease with respect to any rights of tenant) to
negotiate and otherwise deal with the condemning authority in respect of such
matter. In the event that the tenant has a right to terminate its Lease as a
result of such Condemnation, but the period for tenants exercise of such
right has not expired and such tenant has not yet affirmatively exercised or
declined to exercise such right, then the Property subject to such
Condemnation shall be closed in escrow pending the expiration of such period.

6.4 _Updated Property Information_

From the Effective Date through the Closing Date, if and to the extent that
Seller receives from an unaffiliated third-party any additional Property
Information not previously provided to Purchaser, or if and to the extent
that Seller receives any document, notice or correspondence from an
unaffiliated third-party or otherwise obtains actual knowledge from an
unaffiliated third-party source of a condition arising after the Effective
Date that would render any of the representations and warranties of Seller in
Section 9.1 (excluding the representations and warranties contained in
Sections 9.1.3 and 9.1.17) untrue if and to the extent remade after the
Effective Date, Seller shall promptly so notify Purchaser and deliver all
such documents, notices, correspondence or other information in Sellers
possession (" _Newly Disclosed Information_ "). Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Newly Disclosed Information shall not include, and
Seller shall have no obligation to provide to Purchaser and no liability for
any change in any representation or warranty after the Effective Date, for any
matter disclosed in any additional Property Information or other document,
notice, correspondence or other information provided by, or any condition
attributable to any action or inaction of, Purchaser or any affiliate thereof,
and Purchaser shall have no right to an adjustment to the Purchase Price as a
result thereof.

(a) From the Effective Date through the Closing Date, if and to the extent
that Seller receives any document, notice or correspondence from an
unaffiliated third-party or otherwise obtains actual knowledge from an
unaffiliated third-party source of a condition arising after the    Effective Date that would change the Base Rent set forth the Rent Roll for
any Property or Sellers representations and warranties in Section 9.1.3 with
respect to Base Rent only for any Property, Seller shall promptly so notify
Purchaser and deliver all such documents, notices, correspondence or other
information in Sellers possession, together with a reasonable description of
the rent and Property affected (" _Rent Adjustment Information_ "). In the
event that the Rent Adjustment Information discloses a reduction in the base
rent for any Property of fifteen percent (15%) or more (a "
_Significant Reduction_ "), in addition to its right to request an adjustment
to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 4.4.3, subject to the following
sentence, Purchaser shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement with respect
to such Property (or all Properties subject to the McDavid Lease, as
applicable) without any liability of Purchaser to Seller. Unless Seller and
Purchaser agree to an adjustment to the Purchase Price as a result of such
Significant Reduction, Seller shall be entitled to a period of 120 days to
negotiate with such tenant or Guarantor with respect to the issue identified
in such Rent Adjustment Information in order to resolve such issue to
Purchasers good faith satisfaction. The Closing solely with respect to the
Property (or all of the Properties subject to the McDavid Lease, if
applicable) subject to such Rent Adjustment Information shall be extended for
up to 120 days pending such resolution. In the event that such issue is
not resolved to Purchasers good faith satisfaction in said period, then this
Agreement shall be terminated with respect to such Property (or all of the
Properties subject to the McDavid Lease, if applicable) without any liability
of Seller to Purchaser. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Rent
Adjustment Information shall not include, and Seller shall have no obligation
to provide to Purchaser and no liability for any change in any representation
or warranty after the Effective Date, for any matter disclosed in any
document, notice, correspondence or other information provided by, or any
matter attributable to any action or inaction of, Purchaser or any affiliate
thereof, and Purchaser shall have no right to an adjustment to the Purchase
Price as a result thereof.

(b) In the event that a tenant or Guarantor provides to Seller a notice
or correspondence after the Effective Date (other than any matter which
constitutes Rent Adjustment Information) that would render Seller unable to
remake any of the representations in Section 9.1.3(1) or Section 9.1.3(2) as
of the Closing Date (a " _Tenant/Guarantor Disclosure_ "), Seller shall
promptly notify Purchaser thereof. If Purchaser is unwilling to close with
respect to the applicable Property as a result of such Tenant/Guarantor
Disclosure (or all of the Properties subject to the McDavid Lease, if
applicable), or accept an adjustment to the Purchase Price as a result thereof
in accordance with Section 4.4.3, Seller shall be entitled to a period of 120
days to negotiate with such tenant or Guarantor with respect to the issue
identified in such Tenant/Guarantor Disclosure in order to resolve such issue
to Purchasers good faith satisfaction. The Closing solely with respect to the
Property (or all of the Properties subject to the McDavid Lease, if
applicable) subject to such Tenant/Guarantor Disclosure shall be extended for
up to 120 days pending such resolution. In the event that such issue is not
resolved to Purchasers good faith satisfaction in said period, then this
Agreement shall be terminated with respect to such Property (or all of the
Properties subject to the McDavid Lease, if applicable) without any liability
of Seller to Purchaser. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Seller shall have no obligation to provide to Purchaser and no liability for
any change in any representation or warranty after the Effective Date, for any
matter disclosed in any document, notice, correspondence or other information
provided by, or any matter attributable to any action or inaction of,
Purchaser or any affiliate thereof, and Purchaser shall have no right to an
adjustment to the Purchase Price as a result thereof. ARTICLE 7

pass) notwithstanding the non-satisfaction of such condition, in which event
such party shall be deemed to have waived any such condition. In the event
such party elects to close (or to permit any such earlier termination deadline
to pass), notwithstanding the non-satisfaction of such condition, said party

on the part of any other party hereto for breaches of representations and

warranty of Seller or result in any new or additional obligation, covenant,
representation or warranty of Seller under this Agreement beyond those

_PRORATIONS, DEPOSITS, COMMISSIONS_

8.1 _Prorations_. At Closing, the "Base Rent", as defined in the Leases,
shall be prorated as of the Closing Date, it being understood that for
purposes of prorations and adjustments, Purchaser shall be deemed the owner of
the Property on the Closing Date. The parties hereto acknowledge that each
Lease is an absolutely net lease, whereby the tenant thereunder pays all costs
and expenses relating to the Property, and, therefore, except with respect to
Base Rent as described above, there are no other items to be prorated
pursuant hereto. Purchaser shall look solely to the tenant under each Lease
for payment of all such other items customarily prorated as of a closing.

8.2 _Leasing Costs_. Seller agrees to pay or discharge at or prior to Closing
all leasing commissions, costs for tenant improvements, lease buyout costs,
moving allowances, design allowances, legal fees and other costs, expenses

") except for Leasing Costs created by Purchaser, if any, with respect to
Leases and License Agreements in force as of or prior to the Effective Date;

8.3 _Closing Costs_. Closing costs shall be allocated between Seller and
Purchaser in accordance with Section 1.2.

8.4 _Final Adjustment After Closing_. If final bills are not available or

money security deposits collected and not applied by Seller, including without
limitation, any earnest money deposits under the Purchase Contracts (and
interest thereon if required by law or contract) shall be transferred or

Seller or Purchaser, as applicable. This indemnification shall extend to any
and all claims, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and litigation costs) arising as a result of such claims and

ARTICLE 9

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_

9.1 _Seller s Representations and Warranties_. Seller represents and
warrants to Purchaser as of the Effective Date that:

9.1.1 _Organization and Authority_. Seller has been duly organized,
is validly existing, and is in good standing in the state in which it was
formed. Seller has the full right and authority and has obtained any and all
consents required to enter into this Agreement and to consummate or cause to
be consummated the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been,
and all of the documents to be executed by Seller at the Closing will be,
authorized and executed and constitute, or will constitute, as appropriate,
the valid and binding obligation of Seller, enforceable in accordance with
their terms.

9.1.2 _Conflicts and Pending Actions_. Other than the Purchase
Contracts, both of which Purchaser is assuming at Closing, and the April 23,
2008 Contract, which Seller shall terminate or permit to be terminated at or
prior to Closing, there is no agreement to which Seller    is a party or, to Sellers knowledge, that is binding on Seller which is in
conflict with this Agreement. There is no action or proceeding pending or, to
Sellers knowledge, threatened against Seller or relating to the Property,
which challenges or impairs Sellers ability to execute or perform its
obligations under this Agreement.

9.1.3 _Tenant Leases_. Except as a Lease may be amended pursuant to Section
6.1.4, _Schedule 2.1.2_ lists all Leases, Guaranties, and all tenants of the
Property and all guarantors of such tenants, and the Lease Files include true
and complete copies of all leases, guaranties and amendments and waiver
letters thereto with respect to the Property. There are no letters of credit
or security deposits under the Leases with respect to the Property. All Leases
and the Guaranty are currently in full force and effect.

(1) The documents contained in the Lease Files set forth the entire agreements
between Seller and the tenants relating to the leasing or occupancy of the
Property (or any portion thereof), and there are no other agreements, written
or oral, relating to the leasing or occupancy of the Property or any portion
thereof. Seller has not assigned the Leases or its interest therein to any
third party (except for assignments in connection with Sellers financing
which shall be released at Closing).

(2) Seller has not given to any tenant nor received from any tenant
any written notice of default that remains uncured under any of the Leases
(it being acknowledged and agreed that Seller has not provided the tenant with
a notice of default with respect to the failure to obtain consent for the
Nalley Lexus Work). Seller has not given to any Guarantor nor received from
any Guarantor any written notice of default that remains uncured under the
Guaranty. No notice of termination has been given by Seller or received from
any tenant with respect to the Leases. 

(3) No tenant has prepaid any rent under its Lease more than one month in
advance for any period attributable to after the Closing Date. Between the
date hereof and the Closing, Seller shall not accept any attempted prepayment
of rent for more than one month in advance.

(4) Seller has received no notice from a tenant asserting any claim against
Seller or a right of setoff under the Leases.

(5) Seller has not entered any unexpired agreement to provide funding or
monetary advances to any tenant.

(6) Seller has not received any written notice of Tenants intention to
substitute a property pursuant to any Substitution Agreement entered into
between Seller and Purchaser. Between the date hereof and the Closing, Seller
shall not agree to any request to substitute a property pursuant to any
Substitution Agreement entered into between Seller and Purchaser.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall promptly provide to Purchaser any
request for substitution received from a tenant in accordance with Section
6.4, but so long as Seller does not agree thereto, the mere receipt of such
request shall not give rise to a default under this Agreement. (7) _Leasing Commissions_. There are no unpaid Leasing Costs or installments
thereof or sales commissions owed now or in the future by Seller in
connection with the Leases or the Properties except for Leasing Costs created
by, through, or under Purchaser, if any.

(8) _Excluded Property_. A true, complete, and correct list of all "Excluded
Property" as defined in the Leases as of the date of such Leases is attached

consummate or cause to be consummated the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 6.4(a), Section 6.4(b) or Section 6.4(c)) and shall not be    deemed to be merged into or waived by the instruments of Closing, but shall
survive the Closing for a period of nine (9) months with respect to
all representations and warranties other than those set forth in Section 8.6
and Section 9.1.3(7) (which shall survive indefinitely) (the " _Survival
Period_ "); provided, however, that such representations and warranties shall
automatically terminate if (a) prior to the Closing, Purchaser assigns this
Agreement in violation of Section 12.1 or (b) following the Closing, any
direct or indirect transfer, assignment, conveyance or sale of the Property
or any ownership interest in Purchaser occurs other than a conveyance to an
affiliate of Purchaser (or a subsidiary of Purchasers sole owner) or in
connection with a financing of the Property by Purchaser. Terms such as "to
Sellers knowledge," "to the best of Sellers knowledge" or like phrases mean
the actual present and conscious awareness or knowledge of Mary-Beth Roselle,
Stephen Spencer or Vernon Schwartz (" _Seller s Representatives_"), without
any duty of inquiry or investigation; provided that so qualifying Sellers
knowledge shall in no event give rise to any personal liability on the part of
Sellers Representatives, or any of them, or any other officer or employee of
Seller, on account of any breach of any representation or warranty made by
Seller herein. Said terms do not include constructive knowledge, imputed
knowledge, or knowledge Seller or such persons do not have but could have
obtained through further investigation or inquiry. No broker, agent, or party
other than Seller is authorized to make any representation or warranty for or
on behalf of Seller. Each party shall have the right to bring an action
against the other on the breach of a representation or warranty or covenant
hereunder or in the documents executed by Seller and delivered to Purchaser at
the Closing, but only on the following conditions: (1) the party bringing the
action for breach first learns of the breach after Closing and gives written
notice of such breach to the other party before the end of the Survival Period
and files such action on or before the first day following the
second anniversary of the Closing Date, and (2) neither party shall have the
right to bring a cause of action for a breach of a representation or warranty
or covenant unless the damage to such party on account of such breach
(individually or when combined with damages from other breaches) equals or
exceeds $50,000, and then only to the extent of such excess. Neither party
shall have any liability after Closing for the breach of a representation or
warranty or covenant hereunder of which the other party hereto had knowledge
as of Closing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any
agreement contemplated by this Agreement, or any rights which Purchaser might
otherwise have at law, equity, or by statute, whether based on contract or
some other claim, Purchaser agrees that the aggregate liability of Seller to
Purchaser will be limited to $10,000,000. In no event shall Purchaser have the
right to seek, claim or obtain consequential, special or punitive damages
against Seller. Any written notice of a claim under this Section 9.3 shall be
given in good faith and shall set forth with reasonable specificity the basis
for such claim. The provisions of this Section 9.3 shall survive the Closing.
Any breach of a representation or warranty or covenant that occurs prior to
Closing shall be governed by Article 10.

ARTICLE 10

_DEFAULT AND REMEDIES_

10.1  _Seller s Remedies_. If Purchaser fails to consummate the purchase of
the Property pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise defaults on its
obligations hereunder at or prior to Closing in any material respect for any
reason except failure by Seller to perform hereunder, or if prior to Closing
any one or more of Purchasers representations or warranties are breached in
any    material respect, and such default or breach is not cured by the fifth (5th)
Business Day after written notice thereof from Seller (except no notice
or cure period shall apply if Purchaser fails to consummate the purchase of
the Property hereunder), Seller shall be entitled, as its sole remedy (except
as provided in Sections 4.10, 8.6, 10.3 and 10.4 hereof), to terminate this
Agreement and recover the Earnest Money as liquidated damages and not as
penalty, in full satisfaction of claims against Purchaser hereunder. Seller
and Purchaser agree that Sellers damages resulting from Purchasers default
are difficult, if not impossible, to determine and the Earnest Money is a
fair estimate of those damages which has been agreed to in an effort to cause
the amount of such damages to be certain. Notwithstanding anything in this
Section 10.1 or in _Exhibit I_ to the contrary, in the event of Purchasers
default or a termination of this Agreement, Seller shall have all remedies
available at law or in equity in the event Purchaser or any party related to
or affiliated with Purchaser is asserting any claims or right to the Property
that would otherwise delay or prevent Seller from having clear, indefeasible
and marketable title to the Property, and in said event Seller shall not be
required to submit such matter to arbitration as contemplated by  _Exhibit
I_. In all other events Sellers remedies shall be limited to those described
in this Section 10.1 and Sections 4.10, 8.6, 10.3 and 10.4 hereof. If Closing
is consummated, Seller shall have all remedies available at law or in equity
in the event Purchaser fails to perform any obligation of Purchaser under this
Agreement. IN NO EVENT SHALL PURCHASERS DIRECT OR INDIRECT PARTNERS,
SHAREHOLDERS, MEMBERS, OWNERS OR AFFILIATES, ANY OFFICER, DIRECTOR,
EMPLOYEE OR AGENT OF THE FOREGOING, OR ANY AFFILIATE OR CONTROLLING PERSON
THEREOF HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM, CAUSE OF ACTION OR OTHER LIABILITY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE PROPERTY, WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, COMMON LAW, STATUTE, EQUITY OR OTHERWISE. The Closing Date shall be
extended, if applicable, to provide the cure period set forth in the first
sentence hereof.

10.2 _Purchaser s Remedies_. If Seller fails to consummate the sale of the
Property pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise defaults on its obligations
hereunder at or prior to Closing in any material respect for any
reason except failure by Purchaser to perform hereunder, or if prior to
Closing any one or more of Sellers representations or warranties are breached
in any material respect, and such default or breach is not cured by the fifth
(5th) Business Day after written notice thereof from Purchaser (Purchaser
hereby agreeing to give such written notice to Seller within one Business Day
after Purchaser first learns of any such default or breach by Seller, except
no notice or cure period shall apply if Seller fails to consummate the sale
of the Property hereunder), Purchaser shall elect, as its sole remedy, either
to (a) terminate this Agreement by giving Seller timely written notice of such
election prior to or at Closing and recover the Earnest Money and
reimbursement from Seller of the actual reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by Purchaser (but in no event to exceed $500,000) and paid (i) to
Purchasers attorneys in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement
and the review and analysis of the Property Information and (ii) to unrelated
and unaffiliated third party consultants and travel providers in connection
with the performance of examinations, inspections and/or
investigations pursuant to Article 4, (b) recover the Earnest Money and
enforce specific performance to consummate the sale of the Property hereunder,
or (c) waive said failure or breach and proceed to Closing without any
reduction in the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Purchaser shall be deemed to have elected to terminate this
Agreement if Purchaser fails to deliver to Seller written notice of its intent
to file a claim or assert a cause of action for    specific performance against Seller on or before ten Business Days following
the scheduled Closing Date or, having given such notice, fails to file a
lawsuit asserting such claim or cause of action in the county in which the
Property is located within two months following the scheduled Closing Date.
Purchasers remedies shall be limited to those described in Section 8.6 or
this Section 10.2 and Sections 10.3 and 10.4 hereof. If, however, the
equitable remedy of specific performance is not available to Purchaser due to
Sellers frustration of Purchasers attempt therefor (as finally determined by
a court of law or pursuant to arbitration in accordance with the terms of
_Exhibit I_ hereto), Purchaser shall be entitled to liquidated damages from
Seller in the amount of $10,000,000 as liquidated damages and not as penalty,
in full satisfaction of claims against Seller hereunder. IN NO EVENT SHALL
SELLERS DIRECT OR INDIRECT PARTNERS, SHAREHOLDERS, MEMBERS, OWNERS OR
AFFILIATES, ANY OFFICER, DIRECTOR, EMPLOYEE OR AGENT OF THE FOREGOING, OR ANY
AFFILIATE OR CONTROLLING PERSON THEREOF HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM,
CAUSE OF ACTION OR OTHER LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE PROPERTY, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, COMMON LAW, STATUTE,
EQUITY OR OTHERWISE. The Closing Date shall be extended, if applicable, to
provide the cure period set forth in the first sentence hereof.

10.3 _Attorneys  Fees_. In the event either party hereto employs an attorney
in connection with claims by one party against the other arising from the
operation of this Agreement, the non-prevailing party shall pay the prevailing
party all reasonable fees and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees,
incurred in connection with such claims.

10.4 _Other Expenses_. If this Agreement is terminated due to the default of
a party as provided in Section 10.1 or Section 10.2, then the defaulting party
shall pay any fees or charges due to Escrow Agent for holding the Earnest
Money as well as any escrow cancellation fees or charges and any fees or
charges due to the Title Company for preparation and/or cancellation of the
Title Commitment.

Closing, Seller shall sell and convey to Purchaser and Purchaser shall accept
the Property "AS IS, WHERE IS, WITH ALL FAULTS," except to the extent
expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement and any document executed by
Seller and delivered to Purchaser at Closing. Except as expressly set forth
in this Agreement and any document executed by Seller and delivered to
Purchaser at Closing, Purchaser has not relied and will not rely on, and
Seller has not made and is not liable for or bound by, any express or implied
warranties, guarantees, statements, representations or information pertaining
to the Property or relating thereto (including specifically, without
limitation, Property information packages distributed with respect to the
Property) made or furnished by Seller, or any property manager, real estate
broker, agent or third party representing or purporting to represent Seller,
to whomever made or given, directly or indirectly, orally or in
writing. Purchaser represents that it is a knowledgeable, experienced and
sophisticated purchaser of real estate and that, except as expressly set forth
in this Agreement and any document executed by Seller and delivered to
Purchaser at Closing, it is relying solely on its own expertise and that of
Purchasers consultants in purchasing the Property and shall make an
independent verification of the accuracy of any documents and information
provided by Seller. Purchaser will conduct such inspections and
investigations of the Property as Purchaser deems necessary, including, but
not limited to, the physical and environmental conditions thereof, and shall
rely upon same. By failing to deliver a Purchase Price Adjustment Notice
as permitted or required in this Agreement, Purchaser acknowledges that
Seller has afforded Purchaser a full opportunity to conduct such
investigations of the Property as Purchaser deemed necessary to satisfy itself
as to the condition of the Property and the existence or non-existence or
curative action to be taken with respect to any Hazardous Materials on or
discharged from the Property, and will rely solely upon same and not upon any
information provided by or on behalf of Seller or its agents or employees
with respect thereto, other than such representations, warranties and
covenants of Seller as are expressly set forth in this Agreement and any
document executed by Seller and delivered to Purchaser at Closing. Upon
Closing, Purchaser shall assume the risk that adverse matters, including, but
not limited to, adverse physical or construction defects or adverse
environmental, health or safety conditions, may not have been revealed by    Purchasers inspections and investigations. Purchaser hereby represents and
warrants to Seller that: (a) Purchaser is represented by legal counsel in
connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement; and (b)
Purchaser is purchasing the Property for business, commercial, investment or
other similar purpose and not for use as Purchasers residence. The
acknowledgments and representations of Purchaser shall survive the Closing
and the delivery of the Deed. Purchaser waives any and all rights or remedies
it may have or be entitled to, deriving from disparity in size or from any
significant disparate bargaining position in relation to Seller.

11.3 _Seller Released from Liability_. Purchaser acknowledges that it will
have the opportunity to inspect the Property during the Inspection Period,
and during such period, observe its physical characteristics and existing
conditions and the opportunity to conduct such investigation and study on and
of the Property and adjacent areas as Purchaser deems necessary, and, except
as expressly provided in this Agreement and any other document executed by
Seller and delivered to Purchaser at Closing, Purchaser hereby FOREVER
RELEASES AND DISCHARGES Seller from all responsibility and liability,
including without limitation, liabilities and responsibilities for the
lessors obligations under the Leases relating to the physical, environmental
or legal compliance status of the Property, whether arising before or after
the Effective Date, and liabilities under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act Of 1980 (42 U.S.C. Sections 9601 et
seq.), as amended (" _CERCLA_ "), regarding the condition, valuation,
salability or utility of the Property, or its suitability for any purpose
whatsoever (including, but not limited to, with respect to the presence in the
soil, air, structures and surface and subsurface waters, of Hazardous
Materials or other materials or substances that have been or may in the
future be determined to be toxic, hazardous, undesirable or subject to
regulation and that may need to be specially treated, handled and/or removed
from the Property under current or future federal, state and local laws,
regulations or guidelines, and any structural and geologic conditions,
subsurface soil and water conditions and solid and hazardous waste and
Hazardous Materials on, under, adjacent to or otherwise affecting the
Property). Except as expressly provided in this Agreement and any other
document executed by Seller and delivered to Purchaser at Closing, Purchaser
further hereby WAIVES (and by Closing this transaction will be deemed to have
WAIVED) any and all objections and complaints (including, but not limited to,
federal, state and local statutory and common law based actions, and any
private right of action under any federal, state or local laws, regulations or
guidelines to which the Property is or may be subject, including, but not
limited to, CERCLA) concerning the physical characteristics and any existing
conditions of the Property, including, without limitation, the lessors
obligations under the Leases relating to the physical, environmental or legal
compliance status of the Property, whether arising before or after the
Effective Date. Purchaser further hereby assumes the risk of changes in
applicable laws and regulations relating to past, present and future
environmental conditions on the Property and the risk that adverse physical
characteristics and conditions, including, without limitation, the presence of
Hazardous Materials or other contaminants, may not have been revealed by its
investigation. If and only if (1) Purchaser is named in any litigation or
proceeding, or threat of litigation or proceeding, brought by a party
unrelated to Purchaser for any liability or claim related to the Property
during Sellers period of ownership of the Property arising under the CERCLA
or any other cause of action based on any other Environmental Statute, and (2)
the Environmental Indemnity Condition (as defined below) remains in effect,
then such waiver and release provided under the prior sentence shall not apply
to the extent that the subject matter of the litigation or proceeding relates
to an environmental condition arising during Sellers period of ownership of
the Property and    Purchaser may join Seller in such litigation or proceeding; provided,
however, that Purchaser may proceed with such prosecution against Seller only
at such time as (A) Purchaser has fully prosecuted such claim against the
applicable tenant and Guarantor to the point where a final, non-appealable
judgment in any such proceeding is obtained, and then only to the extent such
claim is not fully paid for and satisfied out of such judgment, (B) Purchaser
has not waived any of its rights or failed to fully pursue its claims against
applicable tenant and Guarantor pursuant to the terms of the applicable Lease
and the Guaranty, respectively, and (C) the Environmental Indemnity Condition
remains in effect. For the purposes of this Section 11.3, the term "
_Environmental Indemnity Condition_ " shall mean that the indemnity provisions
of the Lease and the Guaranty shall not have been amended or waived in any
way to reduce or waive the Landlords (as defined in the applicable Lease)
right to indemnification as such right is in effect as of the Closing Date.
The provisions of this paragraph shall survive the Closing or any earlier
termination of this Agreement.

11.4 " _Hazardous Materials" Defined_. For purposes hereof, " _Hazardous
Materials_ " means "Hazardous Material," "Hazardous Substance," "Pollutant or
Contaminant," and "Petroleum" and "Natural Gas Liquids," as those terms
are defined or used in Section 101 of CERCLA, and any other substances
regulated because of their effect or potential effect on public health and the
environment, including, without limitation, PCBs, lead paint, asbestos, urea
formaldehyde, radioactive materials, putrescible materials, and infectious
materials.

11.5 _Indemnity_. Purchaser agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Seller
harmless of and from any and all liabilities, claims, demands, and expenses of
any kind or nature which accrue after Closing and which are in any way related
to the ownership, maintenance, or operation of the Property by Purchaser and
its successors and assigns, including, without limitation, in connection with
Hazardous Materials; provided, however, that Purchaser shall be under no
obligation to indemnify Seller for any matter which is the subject of an
intentional misrepresentation by Seller in this Agreement or any other
document executed by Seller and delivered to Purchaser at Closing.

11.6  _Survival_. The terms and conditions of this Article 11 shall expressly
survive the Closing, not merge with the provisions of any closing documents,
including without limitation the Deed.

Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the disclaimers and other agreements
set forth herein are an integral part of this Agreement and that Seller would
not have agreed to sell the Property to Purchaser for the Purchase Price
without the disclaimers and other agreements set forth above.

and conditions herein contained, shall inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon the heirs, personal representatives, successors, and assigns of each of
the parties hereto. Purchaser may assign its rights under this Agreement upon
the following conditions: (a) the assignee of Purchaser must be an entity
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Purchaser, (b) all of
the Earnest Money must have been delivered in accordance herewith, (c) the
Inspection Period shall    have (or be deemed to have) ended and no Purchase Price Adjustment Notice
shall have been delivered, (d) the assignee of Purchaser shall assume
all obligations of Purchaser hereunder, but Purchaser shall remain primarily
liable for the performance of Purchasers obligations, (e) a copy of the fully
executed written assignment and assumption agreement shall be delivered to
Seller at least three Business Days prior to Closing, and (f) the
requirements in Section 12.17 are satisfied. Purchaser may also assign this

separate written agreement between Purchaser and Seller.

12.2 _Headings_. The article, section, subsection, paragraph and/or other
headings of this Agreement are for convenience only and in no way limit or
enlarge the scope or meaning of the language hereof.

12.3 _Invalidity and Waiver_. If any portion of this Agreement is held
invalid or inoperative, then so far as is reasonable and possible the
remainder of this Agreement shall be deemed valid and operative, and, to the
greatest extent legally possible, effect shall be given to the intent
manifested by the portion held invalid or inoperative. The failure by either
party to enforce against the other any term or provision of this Agreement
shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such partys right to enforce against
the other party the same or any other such term or provision in the future.

12.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed in all respects,
including validity, construction, interpretation and effect, by the laws of
the State of New York, without giving effect to its principles or rules of
conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or
permit the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. Each of Purchaser
and Seller hereby (i) irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of
the State of New York and the Federal courts of the United States of America
located in the State, City and County of New York for the purpose of any
action or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court, and (iii) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
any court other than a New York state court or federal court located in the
State, City and County of New York. Each of Purchaser and Seller hereby
consents to and grants any such court jurisdiction over the person of such
party and over the subject matter of any such dispute and agrees that mailing
of process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in
the manner provided in Section 12.10, or in such other manner as may be
permitted by law, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof on such
party.

12.5 _Survival_. The provisions of this Agreement that contemplate performance
after the Closing and the obligations of the parties not fully performed at
the Closing (other than any unfulfilled closing conditions which have been
waived or deemed waived by the other party) shall survive the Closing and
shall not be deemed to be merged into or waived by the instruments of
Closing.

12.6 _Entirety and Amendments_. This Agreement embodies the entire agreement
between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings
relating to the Property. This Agreement may be amended or supplemented only
by an instrument in writing executed by the party against whom enforcement is
sought. All Schedules and Exhibits hereto are incorporated herein by this
reference for all purposes. 12.7 _Time_. Time is of the essence in the performance of this Agreement.

12.8 _Confidentiality_. Prior to Closing, Purchaser shall make no public
announcement or disclosure of any information related to this Agreement to
outside brokers or third parties, without the prior written specific consent
of Seller; provided, however, that Purchaser may, subject to the provisions of
Section 4.7, make disclosure of this Agreement to its Permitted
Outside Parties as necessary to perform its obligations hereunder and as may
be required under laws or regulations applicable to Purchaser.

12.9  _No Electronic Transactions_. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree
this Agreement shall not be executed, entered into, altered, amended or
modified by electronic means. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the parties hereby agree the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall not be conducted by electronic means, except as specifically
set forth in the "Notices" section of this Agreement.

12.10 _Notices_. All notices required or permitted hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be served on the parties at the addresses set forth in
Section 1.3. Any such notices shall, unless otherwise provided herein, be
given or served (a) by depositing the same in the United States mail, postage
paid, certified and addressed to the party to be notified, with
return receipt requested, (b) by overnight delivery using a nationally
recognized overnight courier, (c) by personal delivery, (d) by facsimile
transmission during normal business hours with a confirmation copy delivered
by another method permitted under this Section 12.10, or (e) by electronic
mail addressed to the electronic mail address set forth in Section 1.3 for the
party to be notified with a confirmation copy delivered by another method
permitted under this Section 12.10. Notice given in accordance herewith for
all permitted forms of notice other than by electronic mail, shall be
effective upon the earlier to occur of actual delivery to the address of the
addressee or refusal of receipt by the addressee. Notice given by electronic
mail in accordance herewith shall be effective upon the entrance of such
electronic mail into the information processing system designated by the
recipients electronic mail address. Except for facsimile and electronic mail
notices as described above, no notice hereunder shall be effective if sent or
delivered by electronic means. In no event shall this Agreement be altered,
amended or modified by electronic mail or electronic record. A
partys address may be changed by written notice to the other party;
provided, however, that no notice of a change of address shall be effective
until actual receipt of such notice. Copies of notices are for informational
purposes only, and a failure to give or receive copies of any notice shall
not be deemed a failure to give notice. Notices given by counsel to the
Purchaser shall be deemed given by Purchaser and notices given by counsel to
the Seller shall be deemed given by Seller.

 

12.11 _Construction_. The parties acknowledge that the parties and their
counsel have reviewed and revised this Agreement and agree that the normal
rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved
against the drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this
Agreement or any exhibits or amendments hereto. 12.12 _Calculation of Time Periods; Business Day_. Unless otherwise specified,
in computing any period of time described herein, the day of the act or event
after which the designated period of time begins to run is not to be included
and the last day of the period so computed is to be included, unless such last
day is not a Business Day, in which event the period shall run until the end
of the next day which is a Business Day. The last day of any period of time
described herein shall be deemed to end at 5:00 p.m. local time in New York,
New York. As used herein, the term " _Business Day_ " means any day that is
not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday for national banks in the city of New
York, New York.

12.13 _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, and
all of such counterparts shall constitute one Agreement. To facilitate
execution of this Agreement, the parties may execute and exchange by telephone
facsimile counterparts of the signature pages, provided that executed
originals thereof are forwarded to the other party on the same day by any of
the delivery methods set forth in Section 12.10 other than facsimile.

12.14 _No Recordation_. Without the prior written consent of Seller, there
shall be no recordation of either this Agreement or any memorandum hereof, or
any affidavit pertaining hereto, and any such recordation of this Agreement or
memorandum or affidavit by Purchaser without the prior written consent of
Seller shall constitute a default hereunder by Purchaser, whereupon Seller
shall have the remedies set forth in Section 10.1 hereof. In addition to any
such remedies, Purchaser shall be obligated to execute an instrument
in recordable form releasing this Agreement or memorandum or affidavit, and
Purchasers obligations pursuant to this Section 12.14 shall survive any
termination of this Agreement as a surviving obligation.

12.15 _Further Assurances_. In addition to the acts and deeds recited herein
and contemplated to be performed, executed and/or delivered by either party
at Closing, each party agrees to perform, execute and deliver, but without any
obligation to incur any additional liability or expense, on or after the
Closing any further deliveries and assurances as may be reasonably necessary
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or to further perfect the
conveyance, transfer and assignment of the Property to Purchaser.

12.16 _Discharge of Obligations_. The acceptance of the Deed by Purchaser
shall be deemed to be a full performance and discharge of every representation
and warranty made by Seller herein and every agreement and obligation on the
part of Seller to be performed pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement,
except those which are herein specifically stated to survive Closing.

12.17 _ERISA_. Under no circumstances shall Purchaser have the right to assign
this Agreement to any person or entity owned or controlled by an employee
benefit plan if Sellers sale of the Property to such person or entity would,
in the reasonable opinion of Sellers ERISA advisors or consultants, create or
otherwise cause a "prohibited transaction" under ERISA. In the event Purchaser
assigns this Agreement or transfers any ownership interest in Purchaser, and
such assignment or transfer would make the consummation of the transaction
hereunder a "prohibited transaction" under ERISA and necessitate the
termination of this Agreement then, notwithstanding any contrary provision
which may be contained herein, Seller shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement. 12.18 _No Third Party Beneficiary_. The provisions of this Agreement and of
the documents to be executed and delivered at Closing are and will be for the
benefit of Seller and Purchaser only and are not for the benefit of any third
party, and accordingly, no third party shall have the right to enforce the
provisions of this Agreement or of the documents to be executed and delivered
at Closing, except that a tenant of the Property may enforce Purchasers
indemnity obligation under Section 4.10 hereof.

12.19 _Reporting Person_. Purchaser and Seller hereby designate the Title
Company as the "reporting person" pursuant to the provisions of Section
6045(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

12.20 _Bankruptcy/Guaranty Default or Termination_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, in the event that on the last Business Day
prior to the Closing Date (i) there exists an undismissed bankruptcy or
insolvency proceeding against Seller or, unless Purchaser is an affiliate
thereof, Guarantor or (ii) unless Purchaser is an affiliate of Guarantor, the
Guaranty has terminated or Guarantor is in material monetary default
thereunder, then Purchaser shall have the right and option to terminate this
Agreement by written notice to Seller on the last Business Day prior to the
Closing Date and in such event, Purchaser shall receive a full refund of the
Earnest Money (other than as provided in Section 3.3) and neither party shall
have any further rights or obligations hereunder, other than those that by
their terms survive termination of this Agreement.

12.21 _Mandatory Arbitration_. The parties have agreed to submit disputes to
mandatory arbitration in accordance with the provisions of _Exhibit I_ hereto
and made a part hereof for all purposes. Each of Seller and Purchaser waives
the right to commence an action in connection with this Agreement in any
court and expressly agrees to be bound by the decision of the arbitrator
determined in _Exhibit I_. The waiver of this Section 12.21 will not prevent
Seller or Purchaser from commencing an action in any court for the sole
purposes of enforcing the obligation of the other party to submit to binding
arbitration or the enforcement of an award granted by arbitration herein or as
expressly permitted by Section 10.1 or Section 10.2 hereof or for injunctive
relief. The terms of this Section 12.21 shall survive (a) the termination of
this Agreement, and (b) the Closing.

12.22 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. SELLER AND PURCHASER HEREBY WAIVE THEIR
RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON
OR ARISING OUT OF, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
RELATED DOCUMENTS, ANY DEALINGS BETWEEN SELLER AND PURCHASER RELATING TO THE
SUBJECT MATTER OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND/OR THE RELATIONSHIP THAT IS BEING ESTABLISHED
BETWEEN SELLER AND PURCHASER. THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALL
ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT
(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, BREACH OF DUTY
CLAIMS AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY CLAIMS). THIS WAIVER IS
IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN WRITING,
AND THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS,
RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO    THIS AGREEMENT, ANY RELATED DOCUMENTS, OR ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS OR AGREEMENTS
RELATING TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
RELATED TRANSACTIONS. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE FILED
AS A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT.

12.23 _Purchaser Reimbursement Obligations_. Purchaser hereby agrees to pay
to Seller (a) the Coggin Kia Reimbursable Amount within 10 Business Days of
the earlier to occur of (i) any termination of the Coggin Kia Purchase
Contract, (ii) failure to close thereunder on or by July 15, 2008, or (iii)
any direct or indirect transfer of the Property subject to the Coggin Kia
Purchase Contract (other than a financing) to any person or entity other than
the purchaser under the Coggin Kia Purchase Contract, and (b) if the Crown
Volvo Purchase Contract is executed prior to the Closing Date, the Crown Volvo
Reimbursable Amount within 10 Business Days of the earlier to occur of (i) any
termination of the Crown Volvo Purchase Contract, (ii) failure to close
thereunder on or by the date required for closing under such Crown Volvo
Purchase Contract, or (iii) any direct or indirect transfer of the Property
subject to the Crown Volvo Purchase Contract (other than a financing) to any
person or entity other than purchaser under the Crown Volvo Purchase Contract.
Purchaser hereby covenants to provide to Seller notice of any termination (or
asserted termination) of either Purchase Contract or any direct or indirect
transfer of either Property subject to a Purchase Contract (other than a
financing) within 10 Business Days.
