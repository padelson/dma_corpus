iii _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

 

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Plan of Merger_ ") is made as of
January 7, 2014, by and between Old National Bancorp, an Indiana corporation
(" _Purchaser_ "), and United Bancorp, Inc., a Michigan corporation ("
_Company_ ").

 

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

 

 __1\. The respective Boards of Directors of each of Company and Purchaser
have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective
corporations and shareholders that Company and Purchaser engage in a merger of
Company with and into Purchaser (the " _Merger_ ") in accordance with the
terms of this Plan of Merger, the Indiana Business Corporation Law (the "
_IBCL_ ") and the Michigan Business Corporation Act (the " _MBCA_ "), as
applicable, and any other applicable Law; and __

 

2\. The Company Board of Directors has, in light of and subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in this Plan of Merger, resolved to adopt this Plan
of Merger, to authorize the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
it and to recommend approval by the Company Shareholders of this Plan of
Merger; and

 

3\. The Purchaser Board of Directors has, in light of and subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in this Plan of Merger, resolved to adopt this Plan
of Merger and to authorize the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by it; and

__4\. For federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall
qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and this Plan
of Merger is intended to be and is adopted as a "Plan of Reorganization" for
the purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. __

 

5\. All of the members of the Company Board of Directors have executed and
delivered to Purchaser a voting agreement substantially in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit A_.

In consideration of the representations, warranties, mutual covenants and
agreements contained in this Plan of Merger, Company and Purchaser agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

1.1  _Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan of Merger, at
the Effective Time, Company shall be merged with and into Purchaser and the
separate corporate existence of Company shall cease. Company and Purchaser are
each sometimes referred to as a " _Constituent Corporation_ " prior to the
Merger. At the Effective Time, the Constituent Corporations shall become a
single corporation, which corporation shall be Purchaser (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ "). The effect of the Merger upon each of the
Constituent Corporations and the Surviving Corporation shall be as provided in
the IBCL and the MBCA, as applicable, with respect to the merger of
corporations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
to the IBCL and the MBCA, as applicable, at the Effective Time: (a) all the
rights, privileges, powers, franchises, licenses, and interests in and to
every type of property (whether

 



1  real, personal, or mixed) of Company and Purchaser, shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, (b) all choses in action of Company and Purchaser shall
continue unaffected and uninterrupted by the Merger and shall accrue to the
Surviving Corporation, and (c) all debts, liabilities and duties of Company
and Purchaser shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

1.2 _The Closing_. Company and Purchaser shall consummate the Merger (the "
_Closing_ ") (a) at the offices of Krieg DeVault LLP, at 10:00 a.m., local
time, on a date to be agreed upon by Company and Purchaser, which will be no
later than two Business Days following satisfaction or waiver of the last of
the conditions to Closing contained in _Article VI_ (other than any
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) or (b) at
such other place and time or on such other date as Company and Purchaser may
mutually determine (the date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred
to as the " _Closing Date_ ").

1.3 _Effective Time of Merger_. Upon completion of the Closing, Company and
Purchaser shall each promptly execute and file a certificate of merger as
required by the MBCA and the IBCL to effect the Merger (collectively, the "
_Certificates of Merger_ ", and individually, a " _Certificate of Merger_ ").
No party shall take any action to revoke a Certificate of Merger after its
filing without the written consent of the other party. The " _Effective Time_
" of the Merger shall be the time and date when the Merger becomes effective
as set forth in the Certificates of Merger, which may be the last day of the
month in which the Closing occurs.

 

1.4 _Additional Actions_. At any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation may determine that deeds, assignments, or assurances or any other
acts are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect, or confirm, of record or
otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its rights, title, or interest in, to,
or under any of the rights, properties, or assets of Company and Purchaser
acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger, or to otherwise carry out the purposes of this
Plan of Merger. Company and Purchaser grant to the Surviving Corporation
an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver all such deeds,
assignments, and assurances and to do all acts necessary, proper, or
convenient to accomplish this purpose. This irrevocable power of attorney
shall only be operative following the Effective Time and at such time the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be fully authorized
in the name of Company and Purchaser to take any and all such actions
contemplated by this Plan of Merger.

 

1.5 _Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall have the following attributes until they are subsequently changed in
the manner provided by Law:

1.5.1 _Name_. The name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Old
National Bancorp."

1.5.2 _Articles of Incorporation_. The articles of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation shall be the articles of incorporation of Purchaser as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, without change.

 



2 1.5.3 _Bylaws_. The bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be the bylaws of
Purchaser as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, without
change.

__1.5.4 _Officers_. The officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the
officers of Purchaser immediately before the effective time. __

__1.5.5 _Directors_. The directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be the
directors of Purchaser immediately before the effective time. __

1.6  _Reservation of Right to Revise Structure_. At Purchasers election, the
Merger may alternatively be structured so that (a) Company is merged with and
into any other direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Purchaser or (b)
any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Purchaser is merged with and
into Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such change shall (i) alter or
change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration or the treatment of the
holders of Company Common Stock or Company Share-Based Awards, (ii) prevent
the parties from obtaining the opinions of counsel referred to in _Sections
6.2.5_ and _6.3.5_ or otherwise cause the transaction to fail to qualify for
the Intended Tax Treatment, or (iii) materially impede or delay consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Plan of Merger. In the event of such
an election, the parties agree to execute an appropriate amendment to this
Plan of Merger (to the extent such amendment only changes the method of
effecting the business combination and does not substantively affect this Plan
of Merger or the rights and obligations of the parties or their respective
shareholders) in order to reflect such election.

ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT OF MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

 

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Company, Purchaser or any other Person:

2.1.1 _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock
that is owned by Company (or by any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries) or
Purchaser (or by any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries) (collectively, the "
_Excluded Shares_ ") immediately before the Effective Time will automatically
be canceled and cease to exist without delivery of any consideration in
exchange for or in respect of any Excluded Share.

2.1.2 _Conversion of Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the
Excluded Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive (i) $2.66 cash
(the " _Cash Consideration_ "), and (ii) 0.7 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") fully
paid and nonassessable shares of Purchaser Common Stock (collectively, the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), whereupon such shares of Company Common Stock will
no longer be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares of
Company Common Stock will cease to exist, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant
to _Section 2.4_, upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, in
accordance with _Section 2.3_. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on
any payment to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article II_.

 



3 2.2 _Stock Plans._

 

 __2.2.1 Company and Purchaser shall take all requisite action so that, as of
the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to receive
Company Common Stock or benefits measured in whole or in part by the value of
a number of shares of Company Common Stock under the Company Stock Plans
(each, an " _Award_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent an Award with
respect to Company Common Stock, and shall be converted by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of that Award, into
an award (as converted, a " _Converted Stock-Based Award_ ") with respect to a
number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock equal to the product of (a) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Award,
multiplied by (b) the sum of (i) the Exchange Ratio and (ii) $2.66 divided by
the Average Purchaser Closing Price (the " _Converted Stock-Based Award Ratio_
"). As of the Effective Time, Purchaser will assume each of the Company Stock
Plans. __

__2.2.2 All Converted Stock-Based Awards shall continue to have, and
be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable
Company Stock Plan (or any other agreement to which such Converted Stock-Based
Award was subject immediately prior to the Effective Time), except as
otherwise provided in this Plan of Merger. The exercise or strike price (if
any) per share of Purchaser Common Stock applicable to any Converted Stock-
Based Award shall be equal to (a) the per share exercise price of such Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (b) the Converted Stock-
Based Award Ratio. Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall make such
amendments and take such other actions with respect to the Company Stock Plans
as shall be necessary to effect the adjustment referred to in this _Section
2.2_, including notifying all participants in the Company Stock Plans of such
adjustment. __

__2.2.3 Purchaser shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock for delivery
upon exercise or settlement of the Converted Stock-Based Awards in accordance
with this  _Section 2.2_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, if and to the extent necessary to cause a sufficient number of
shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be registered and issuable under Converted
Stock-Based Awards, Purchaser shall file a post-effective amendment to the
Registration Statement or one or more registration statements on Form S-8 (or
any successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of
Purchaser Common Stock subject to Converted Stock-Based Awards and shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as
such Converted Stock-Based Awards remain outstanding. __

2.2.4 As of the Effective Time, each phantom share credited to
a participants account under the Company Deferred Compensation Plans that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall automatically
be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of Purchaser Common
Stock equal to the Converted Stock-Based Award Ratio, but shall otherwise
remain outstanding following the Effective Time and be distributed pursuant to
the terms of the Company Deferred Compensation Plan. Prior to the Effective
Time, Company or its Board of Directors or applicable committee thereof shall
make such amendments and take such other actions with respect to the Company
Deferred Compensation Plans as shall be necessary to effect the treatment
referred to in this _Section 2.2.4_. 

 



4 2.3 _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Purchaser shall mail to each holder of record of shares of
Company Common Stock (other than the Excluded Shares), as of the Effective
Time, a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and
reasonably acceptable to Company and shall specify that delivery will be
effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates or Book-Entry Shares will
pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to
Purchaser upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of
transmittal) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration and
any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.4.

 

Upon surrender of a Certificate or of Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to
Purchaser, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by Purchaser and reasonably acceptable
to Company, each holder of a Certificate or of Book-Entry Shares shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (a) book-entry shares
representing the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock and cash in the
amount of the Cash Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.1.2_ and (b) any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
_Section 2.4, _and such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. Purchaser shall mail, or cause to be mailed, a
statement of ownership relating to the shares of Purchaser Common Stock and a
check for payment of the Cash Consideration within seven days after such a
surrender of a Certificate or of Book-Entry Shares.

 

In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of Company, payment of the Merger
Consideration may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered are registered if properly
endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting
such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
transfer or establish, to the reasonable satisfaction of Purchaser, that such
Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this  _Section 2.3_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration and any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.4_.

2.4 _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Purchaser Common Stock with a record date on or
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the shares of Purchaser Common
Stock that the holder of such unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share
has the right to receive upon the surrender of such unsurrendered Certificate
or Book-Entry Share until the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall have surrendered such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance
with this _Article II_. Subject to escheat or other applicable Law, following
the surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share, there shall be paid to
the record holder of shares of Purchaser Common Stock issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, with respect to such shares of Purchaser

 



5  Common Stock (a) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date and a payment date on or after the
Effective Time and on or prior to the date of such surrender and (b) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date on or after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such shares
of Purchaser Common Stock.

2.5 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The
Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to _Section 2.4_ upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to
have been in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the
close of business on the Closing Date, the share transfer books of Company
shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the share transfer books of Company of shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall cease
to have any rights with respect to shares of Company Common Stock, except as
otherwise provided in this Plan of Merger or by applicable Law.

 

2.6 _No Liability_. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, none of
Company, Purchaser, or the Surviving Corporation will be liable to any
Company Shareholder or any other Person in respect of any cash properly
delivered to a Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws.

 

2.7 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, Purchaser will, upon the
receipt of an affidavit of that fact by the holder of such Certificate in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, pay in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration and any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.4 _payable
in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock previously evidenced by such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate. Purchaser, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of the Merger Consideration and any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.4_, may
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to deliver a
bond in such amount as Purchaser may reasonably direct (which amount shall be
consistent with Purchasers customary procedure for Purchasers existing
shareholders) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Purchaser with respect to such Certificate.

 

2.8 _Withholding Rights_. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold,
or cause to be deducted or withheld, from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Plan of Merger such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld or paid over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental
Entity by Purchaser, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Plan of Merger as having been paid to the Person in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Purchaser.

 



6 2.9 _Adjustments._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article
II_ , if, between the date of this Plan of Merger and the Effective Time,
there is declared (with an effective time prior to the Effective Time) or
effected a reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), split-up, stock dividend or stock
distribution (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into Purchaser Common Stock or Company Common Stock), combination, exchange,
or readjustment of shares with respect to, or rights issued in respect of,
Purchaser Common Stock or Company Common Stock, the Exchange Ratio shall be
proportionately adjusted accordingly to provide to the holders of Company
Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Plan of Merger
prior to such event. For the avoidance of doubt, no adjustment shall be made
under this _Section 2.9_ as a result of Purchaser issuing shares of Purchaser
Common Stock pursuant to the pending merger transaction by and between
Purchaser and Tower Financial Corporation.

2.10 _Upset Provision._

 

2.10.1 After Closing is properly called pursuant to _Section 1.2_, Company
shall have the right to terminate this Plan of Merger upon written notice to
Purchaser if the Upset Condition then exists. The " _Upset Condition_ " shall
have occurred if both of the following conditions exist: (a) the Final
Purchaser Price is less than $12.02 (the " _Floor Purchaser Price_ "); and
(b) the number determined by dividing the Final Purchaser Price by $15.02 (the
" _Initial Purchaser Price_ ") is less than the number obtained by subtracting
(i) .20 from (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing the Final Index Price by
the Initial Index Price. The " _Final Purchaser Price_ " means the average
closing price of Purchaser Common Stock for the 5 trading days ending on
the sixth Business Day prior to the date of Closing on which shares of
Purchaser Common Stock were actually traded in transactions reported on The
NASDAQ Global Select Market (the " _Pricing Period_ "). The " _Initial
Index Price_ " means the closing price of the Nasdaq Bank Index
(Nasdaq:IXBK), a sector index maintained by the Nasdaq Stock Market (" _Bank
Index_ ") on January 6, 2014. The " _Final Index Price_ " means the closing
price of the Bank Index on the last day of the Pricing Period.

2.10.2 If the Upset Condition exists, Company shall have the right,
exercisable at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time on the second
Business Day after the last day of the Pricing Period (the " _Exercise Period_
") to (a) proceed with the Merger on the basis of the Exchange Ratio set
forth in _Section 2.1.2_, subject to applicable adjustment as provided in
_Section 2.9 _and _Section 2.11_, by delivering to Purchaser within the
Exercise Period written notice of its decision to do so or by failing to
deliver any notice to Purchaser; or (b) request Purchaser to adjust the
Exchange Ratio by delivering to Purchaser within the Exercise Period written
notice to such effect (an " _Increase Notice_ ") to a ratio computed by
multiplying the Exchange Ratio by a fraction that has as its numerator the
Floor Purchaser Price and that has as its denominator the Final Purchaser
Price (the " _Adjusted Exchange Ratio_ ").

 

2.10.3 If the Upset Condition occurs and Purchaser receives an Increase
Notice, Purchaser shall either accept or decline the Adjusted Exchange Ratio
by delivering written notice of its decision to Company at or before 5:00
p.m., Eastern Time on the second Business Day after receipt of the Increase
Notice (the " _Acceptance Period_ "). If Purchaser accepts the Adjusted
Exchange Ratio within the Acceptance Period, this Plan of Merger shall remain
in effect in accordance with its terms except the Exchange Ratio shall be

 



7  equal to the Adjusted Exchange Ratio. If Purchaser declines the Adjusted
Exchange Ratio or fails to deliver written notice of its decision to accept or
decline the Adjusted Exchange Ratio within the Acceptance Period, the Merger
shall be abandoned and this Plan of Merger shall thereupon terminate without
further action by Company or Purchaser effective as of 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time
on the Business Day following the expiration of the Acceptance Period;
_provided_ that if Purchaser so declines the Adjusted Exchange Ratio or fails
to deliver written notice of its decision to accept or decline the Adjusted
Exchange Ratio within the Acceptance Period, Company may, by written notice
delivered to Purchaser at or before 5:00 pm, Eastern Time on the Business Day
following the expiration of the Acceptance Period, elect to proceed with the
Merger on the basis of the Exchange Ratio set forth in _Section
2.1.2_, subject to applicable adjustment as provided in _Section 2.9 and
2.11_, and, upon such election, no abandonment of the Merger or termination of
the Plan of Merger shall be deemed to have occurred, this Plan of Merger shall
remain in effect in accordance with its terms, and the Closing shall
thereafter occur, in accordance with the terms of this Plan of Merger.

2.11  _Adjustments to Exchange Ratio._ At the Effective Time, the Exchange
Ratio shall be adjusted, if applicable, as follows (which Exchange Ratio, as
adjusted as provided below and in _Section 2.9_, shall become the
"Exchange Ratio" for purposes of this Plan of Merger):

2.11.1 _Shareholders  Equity_. If as of the end of the month prior to
the Effective Time, the Company Consolidated Shareholders Equity is less
than $80,000,000, the Stock Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal
to (x) $80,000,000 minus (y) the Company Consolidated Shareholders Equity as
of the end of the month prior to the Effective Time (the "Shareholders
Equity Price Adjustment").

2.11.2  _Environmental Costs_. If the after-tax Environmental Costs are in
excess of $1,250,000, the Stock Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount
equal to (x) the after-tax Environmental Costs minus (y) $1,250,000
(the "Environmental Price Adjustment").

2.11.3 _Exchange Ratio Adjustment_. Subject to the satisfaction of  _Section
2.11.1 or 2.11.2_, the Exchange Ratio shall be decreased to a quotient
determined by dividing the Adjusted Stock Purchase Price by the total number
of shares of the Company Common Stock outstanding at the Effective Time,
and further dividing that number by the Average Purchaser Closing Price.

2.11.4 As used in this _Article II_ , the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated below:

" _Adjusted Stock Purchase Price_ " shall be equal to (a) the Stock
Purchase Price minus (b) the Shareholders Equity Price Adjustment, if
applicable, minus (c) the Environmental Price Adjustment, if applicable.

 

 _"_ _Average Purchaser Closing Price_ _"_ shall mean the average of the per
share closing prices of a share of Purchaser Common Stock as quoted on The
NASDAQ Global Select Market during the ten (10) trading days preceding the
fifth (5th) calendar day preceding the Effective Time.

 



8 " _Company Consolidated Shareholders  Equity_ _"_ shall be the consolidated
shareholders equity of Company excluding the net accumulated other
comprehensive income/(loss), each as of the end of the month prior to the
Effective Time, determined in accordance with GAAP to which shall be added the
following amounts (which amounts shall also be calculated in accordance with
GAAP): (a) any accruals, reserves, or charges resulting from expenses of the
Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Plan of Merger, and (b) any
accruals, reserves or charges taken by Company at the request of Purchaser
pursuant to _Section 5.19_.

" _Stock Purchase Price_ " shall be equal to the Exchange Ratio in effect at
the time of adjustment multiplied by the Average Purchaser Closing Price
multiplied by the total number of shares of the Company Common Stock
outstanding as of the Effective Time.

other corporate proceedings on the part of Company are necessary to authorize
this Plan of Merger or to consummate the Merger. This Plan of Merger has been
duly executed and delivered by, and (assuming due authorization, execution

performance of this Plan of Merger by Company and the consummation of the
Merger, do not and will not violate, conflict with, or result in a breach of:

laws, and the consents, authorizations, approvals, or exemptions required
under the Bank Holding Company Act, the FDI Act, the Michigan Banking Code

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 

3.3 _Subsidiaries._

3.3.1  _Ownership_. Company has provided to Purchaser a true and complete
list of each Company Subsidiary. Other than the Company Subsidiaries, Company
does not have "control" (as defined in Section 2(a)(2) of the Bank Holding

2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, no par value (the "Company Preferred

Company Share-Based Awards have been awarded under a Company Stock Plan, and,
there are no other compensatory awards outstanding pursuant to which Company
Common Stock is issuable, or that relate to or are determined by reference to
the value of Company Common Stock. All outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock, and all Company Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Company
Stock Plans when issued in accordance with the respective terms of the Company
Stock Plans, are or will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable and not issued in violation of any preemptive rights, purchase
option, call or right of first refusal rights.

adequacy, credit or reserve policies or management of Company or any Company
Subsidiary (a " _Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has Company nor any Company

in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, Company and each Company
Subsidiary has good and valid title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all
of their respective personal and real properties and assets as used in
their respective businesses as presently conducted, and all such personal and
real properties and assets, other than personal and real properties and assets
in which Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has leasehold interests,
are free and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted Liens. All material
leases to which Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party and under which
it is in possession of any personal or real property are valid and binding
contracts and are in full force and effect and neither Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has received any written notice alleging violation, breach,

Company Subsidiaries are structurally sound and in good operating condition
and repair, reasonable wear and tear excepted, and subject to maintenance
and repair in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
which has been and is being performed, are adequate for the uses to which they
are being put, except as have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to

warranties that follow in this _Section 3.15_. No Actions, suits or other
proceedings are pending or, to the Knowledge of Company, threatened that
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is infringing, misappropriating or
otherwise violating the rights of any Person with regard to any Intellectual
Property. To the Knowledge of Company, no Person is infringing,
misappropriating or otherwise violating the rights of Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries with respect to any Intellectual Property owned or
purported to be owned by

following the end of such notice period, the Company Board of Directors shall
have considered in good faith any changes to this Plan of Merger proposed in
writing by Purchaser, and shall have determined that the Company Superior
Proposal would continue to constitute a Company Superior Proposal if such

a Company Takeover Proposal that could have an impact, influence or other
effect on the Company Board of Directors decision or discussion with respect
to whether such proposal is a Company Superior Proposal, Company shall
deliver a new written notice to Purchaser pursuant to the foregoing clause
(a) and again comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.3.5_ with

Employees will receive credit for prior service with Company or the Company
Subsidiaries, or their predecessors, for purposes of eligibility and vesting

period of coverage for Continuing Employees or any Eligible Retirees under age
65 under any such Purchaser employee benefit plans is not a full 12-month
period of coverage, Continuing Employees and any Eligible Retirees under age
65 shall be given credit under the applicable plan for any deductibles and co-
insurance payments made by such Continuing Employees and any Eligible Retirees

shall be carried over to Purchasers sick time policy.

5.7.16 After the Effective Time, Purchaser shall continue to maintain and
administer, in accordance with the provisions thereof, the Company Stock

whichever is applicable, shall be liable for all obligations for continued
health coverage pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code and Section 601 through

Plan (the " _Severance Policy_ "), for purposes of calculating the severance
benefits payable under the Severance Policy, each Company Employee shall be
given full credit for prior years of employment with Company or any
Company Subsidiary.

5.8 _Press Releases and Public Announcement._ Neither Company nor Purchaser
will issue any press release or make any public announcement relating to this
Plan of Merger, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Plan

issue any such press release or make such public announcement, including with
respect to actions contemplated by _Sections 5.1_ and _5.2_ , as applicable,
it believes in good faith is required to be made by applicable Law or any
applicable rule or regulation promulgated by any applicable securities
exchange after consultation with outside legal counsel, in which case the
disclosing party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to advise and
consult with the other party regarding any such press release or other
announcement prior to making any such disclosure.

5.9 _Access to Information._

 

5.9.1 Subject to applicable Law, during the period commencing on the date of
this Plan of Merger and ending at the earlier of the Effective Time and the

Company will, and will cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to, upon
reasonable prior written notice, permit Purchaser and its
respective Representatives to have reasonable access at all reasonable times,
and in a manner so as not to interfere with the normal business operations of
Company and the Company

 



42  Subsidiaries, to the officers and senior management, premises, agents,
books, records, and Contracts of or pertaining to Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested in writing; and (b) upon the
reasonable request of Company, Purchaser shall furnish such reasonable
information about it and its business as is relevant to Company and its
shareholders in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Plan of
Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that such access or disclosure of information
will (i) comply with all applicable Laws, (ii) not result in, or reasonably be
expected to result in, the waiver of the attorney-client privilege, or (iii)
not result in, or reasonably be expected to result in, a material breach of
any material Contract. No such access shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or the remedies with
respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under
this Plan of Merger.

5.9.2 All Proprietary Information (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) provided pursuant to this Plan of Merger shall be subject to the
provisions of the letter agreement, dated October 30, 2013, between Company
and Purchaser (" _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which shall remain in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms.

5.10 _Indemnification and Insurance._

 

5.10.1 All rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses
now existing in favor of the current or former directors and officers, as the
case may be, of Company or the Company Subsidiaries as provided in their
respective articles of incorporation or bylaws or other organization documents
or in the existing indemnity agreements with Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and, except as otherwise
expressly provided in this _Section 5.10_, shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of six years from the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, subject to compliance with
applicable Law, shall maintain in effect exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses provisions that are no less favorable to officers and
directors than those set forth in the articles of incorporation and bylaws or
similar organization documents of Company and the Company Subsidiaries in
effect immediately prior to the date of this Plan of Merger, and, subject to
compliance with applicable Law, shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify
any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or former
directors, officers or employees of Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries. All rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses in
respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period
shall continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such
claim.

 

5.10.2 From and after the Effective Time and until the sixth anniversary of
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold
harmless to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, each current or
former director or officer of Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
(each, together with such persons heirs, executors or administrators, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs or expenses (including advancing
attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim,
suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest
extent permitted by Law and following receipt of any undertaking required by
applicable Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened 

 



43  Actions, arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or
omission occurring or alleged to have occurred at or before the Effective Time
in such Indemnified Partys capacity as a director or officer of Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries or in such Indemnified Partys capacity as a
director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or
enterprise at the request or for the benefit of Company or any Company
Subsidiary, including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Plan of Merger. All rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses in
respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period
shall continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such
claim. In the event of any such Action, the Surviving Corporation shall
reasonably cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of the Action.

5.10.3 The Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect for not less than
six years from the Effective Time the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the Indemnified Parties prior to the
Effective Time with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, including the transactions contemplated by this Plan of Merger.
Alternatively, the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of
substantially the same coverage containing terms and conditions that, taken
as a whole, are no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties. After the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay annual
premiums for insurance coverages in excess of 300% of the last annual premium
(such 300% threshold, the " _Maximum Amount_ ") paid by Company prior to the
date of this Plan of Merger in respect of the coverages required to be
obtained pursuant to this _Section 5.10.3_, but in such case shall purchase
the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Amount.
Alternatively, the Surviving Corporation may purchase at or after the
Effective Time, at a cost not exceeding three times the Maximum Amount, a
six-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing substantially
equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by Company
and the Company Subsidiaries for the Indemnified Parties with respect to
matters occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the
transactions contemplated by this Plan of Merger. If such "tail" prepaid
policy has been obtained, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain it in full
force and effect for its full term and honor all obligations thereunder.

 

5.10.4 The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such person may have under the
articles of incorporation or bylaws or other organization documents of Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other
indemnification arrangement, the MBCA and the IBCL, as applicable, directors
and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in
existence with respect to Company or the Company Subsidiaries or otherwise.
The provisions of this _Section 5.10_ shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of
the Indemnified Parties, each of whom is a third-party beneficiary of this
_Section 5.10_. __

 

5.10.5 In the event that the Surviving Corporation or its successors or
assigns (a) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or
merger or (b) transfers all or substantially

 



44  all of its properties and assets to any Person, in each case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section 5.10_. __

5.11 _Takeover Laws._ If any "moratorium," "control share," "fair price,"
"affiliate transaction," "business combination" or other anti-takeover Law is
or may become applicable to the Merger, the parties shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to (a) take such actions as are reasonably
necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereunder may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Plan of Merger
and (b) otherwise take all such actions as are reasonably necessary to
eliminate or minimize the effects of any such Law on the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Plan of Merger.

 

5.12 _Section 16 Matters._ Prior to the Effective Time, Company and Purchaser
each shall take all such steps as may be required to cause (a) any
dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with

individual who will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act with respect to Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and (b)
any acquisitions or dispositions of Purchaser Common Stock (including
derivative securities with respect to Purchaser Common Stock and Converted
Stock-Based Awards) resulting from the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Plan of Merger, by each individual who may become or is
reasonably expected to become subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Purchaser immediately following the
Effective Time, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

5.13 _Securityholder Litigation._ Each party shall keep the other parties
reasonably informed with respect to the defense or settlement of any
securityholder Action against it or its directors or officers relating to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Plan of Merger. Each
party shall give the other party the opportunity to consult with it regarding
the defense or settlement of any such securityholder Action and shall not
settle any such Action without the other partys prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

5.14 _Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment._

 

5.14.1 Company and Purchaser intend that the Merger will qualify as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code (the " _Intended Tax
Treatment_ "), and each shall not, and shall not permit any of their

Each of the undersigned directors of United Bancorp, Inc. (" _Company_ ")
hereby agrees in his or her individual capacity as a shareholder to vote his
or her shares of Company Common Stock that are registered in his or her
personal name (and agrees to use his or her reasonable efforts to cause all
additional shares of Company Common Stock owned jointly by him or her with
any other person or by his or her spouse or over which he or she has voting
influence or control to be voted) in favor of the Agreement and Plan of Merger
by and between Old National Bancorp and Company, dated January 7, 2014 (the "
_Agreement_ "). In addition, each of the undersigned directors hereby agrees
not to make any transfers of shares of Company Common Stock with the purpose
of avoiding his or her agreements set forth in the preceding sentence
and agrees to cause any transferee of such shares to abide by the terms of
this Voting Agreement. Each of the undersigned is entering into this Voting
Agreement solely in his or her capacity as an individual shareholder and,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Voting Agreement, nothing in
this Voting Agreement is intended or shall be construed to require any of the
undersigned, (i) in his or her capacity as a director of Company or (ii) in
his or her capacity as a trustee, personal representative or other fiduciary
capacity, to act or fail to act in accordance with his or her duties in such
director or fiduciary capacity. Furthermore, none of the undersigned makes any
agreement or understanding herein in his or her capacity as a director of
Company. Notwithstanding any contrary provision herein, this Voting Agreement
shall be effective from the date hereof and shall terminate and be of no
further force and effect upon the earliest of (a) the consummation of the
Merger (as defined in the Agreement); (b) the termination of the Agreement in
accordance with its terms; or (c) upon a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
(as defined in the Agreement). This Voting Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but such
counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

 

Dated this 7th day of January, 2014.
