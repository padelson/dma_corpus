Section 4.2 Surrender and Payment.

  



  

(a) _Paying Agent; Payment Fund_. Prior to the Merger Effective
Time, Buyer shall appoint a paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to act as
the agent for the purpose of paying the Cash Merger Consideration for: (i) the
Certificates; and (ii) the Book-Entry Shares. At or promptly following the
Merger Effective Time, Buyer shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation
to deposit, with the Paying Agent, sufficient funds to pay the aggregate Cash
Merger Consideration that is payable in respect of all of the Common Shares
represented by the Certificates and the Book-Entry Shares (other than: (A)
shares to be cancelled and retired in accordance with _Section 4.1(a)_ ; and
(B) Dissenting Shares) (the " _Payment Fund_ ") in amounts and at the times
necessary for such payments. If for any reason the Payment Fund is inadequate
to pay the amounts to which holders of shares shall be entitled under
_Section 4.1(b)_ , Buyer shall take all steps necessary to enable or cause the
Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit in trust additional cash with the
Paying Agent sufficient to make all payments required under this
Agreement. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. All
charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent in connection with
the exchange of Common Shares for the Cash Merger Consideration, the RandWI
Expense (as defined in _Section 11.1_ ) and any unpaid Broker Fees, as
defined in _Section 5.20_ (collectively, the " _Merger Fees_ "), shall be
deducted from the Gross Amount pursuant to _Section 4.1(b)_. All charges and
expenses, including those of the Rights Agent (as defined in the Contingent
Value Rights Agreement) and those described in Section 3.2(p) of the
Contingent Value Rights Agreement, in connection with the Contingent Value
Rights Agreement, and any Broker Fees payable in connection with the
Contingent Value Rights Agreement (collectively, the " _CVR Fees_ ") shall be
deducted from the contingent value payable pursuant to the Contingent Value
Rights Agreement pursuant to _Section 4.1(b)_. Promptly after the Merger
Effective Time, Buyer shall send, or shall cause the Paying Agent to send, to
each record holder of Common Shares immediately prior to the Merger Effective
Time, a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to
the Paying Agent, and which letter of transmittal will be in customary form
and have such other provisions as Buyer and the Surviving Corporation may
reasonably specify) for use in such exchange.

  



    

 | 22| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Procedures for Surrender; No Interest_. Each holder of Common
Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in
respect of the Common Shares represented by a Certificate or Book-Entry Share
only upon: (i) in the case of a Certificate, surrender to the Paying Agent of
such Certificate, together with a duly completed and validly executed letter
of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the
Paying Agent; or (ii) in the case of a Book-Entry Share, receipt of an
"agent's message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in respect of such Book-
Entry Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, and
subject to the terms set forth in _Section 4.3_ , each such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share, as applicable, shall represent after the Merger Effective
Time for all purposes only the right to receive, in accordance with this
Agreement and upon compliance by the holder thereof with _Section 4.2_
hereof, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof. No
interest shall be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration. After the
Merger Effective Time, no dividend or other distribution shall be paid in
respect of any Common Share, Class A Preferred Share or other share of any
class or series of capital stock of the Company and each Certificate or
Certificates or Book-Entry Share or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered or
transferred, as the case may be, shall immediately be cancelled and retired
(except for the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article 4)_.

  



  

(c) _Investment of Payment Fund_. Until disbursed in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the cash in the Payment
Fund will be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation, in: (i) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the
United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States with a maturity of no more than 30
days; (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively; or
(iii) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements, or banker's
acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based
on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly
available). No losses with respect to any investments of the Payment Fund will
affect the amounts payable to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares. Any income from investment of the Payment Fund will be payable
to Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as Buyer directs.

  



  

(d) _Payments to Non-Registered Holders_. If any portion of the
Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Book-Entry Share,
as applicable, is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that:
(i) such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in
proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly
transferred; and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Paying Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such payment
to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share, as applicable, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

(e) _Full Satisfaction_. All Merger Consideration paid upon the
surrender of Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Common Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, and from and after the Merger Effective
Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of Common Shares on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Merger
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled (and, to the extent the holders
thereof are entitled thereto, exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided
for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this _Section 4.2_
).

  



    

 | 23| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund
that remains unclaimed by the holders of Common Shares nine months after
the Merger Effective Time shall be returned to Buyer, upon demand, and any
such holder who has not exchanged Common Shares for the Merger Consideration
in accordance with this _Section 4.2_ prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat, or
other similar laws), as general creditors thereof, for payment of the
Merger Consideration without any interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Buyer shall not be liable to any holder of Common Shares for any amounts paid
to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat, or
similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Common Shares two
years after the Merger Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior
to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property
of any governmental entity) shall become, to the extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements, the property of Buyer free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(g) _Dissenting Shares Merger Consideration_. Any portion of the
Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent in respect of any
Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Buyer, upon demand.

  



  

(h) _Outstanding Indemnification Amount_. If any Losses included in
any Outstanding Indemnification Amount (as defined in the
Indemnification Agreement) (i) reduced the Cash Merger Consideration pursuant
to clause (H) of _Section 4.1(b)(x)_ and (ii) are subsequently determined in
a final judgment or award of a court of competent jurisdiction which is either
not subject to any further appeals or the time for giving notice to take such
appeals has lapsed and no such notice was filed to be lower than the amount
that actually reduced the Cash Merger Consideration pursuant to clause (H) of
_Section 4.1(b)(x)_ , then Buyer shall transfer the difference between such
amounts to the Paying Agent for further payment by the Paying Agent as Cash
Merger Consideration consistent with the provisions of this Article 4, which
payment shall be (i) deemed to have occurred as of the time that it would have
otherwise been due pursuant to this Agreement but for its inclusion in
Outstanding Indemnification Amount and (ii) made to the Persons
entitled hereunder taking the foregoing clause (i) into account, it being
agreed that the foregoing shall not affect any rights of any
Buyer Indemnified Parties against Fortress pursuant to the Indemnification
Agreement if such Losses are determined in such final judgment or award to be
higher than the amount that actually reduced the Cash Merger Consideration
pursuant to clause (H) of _Section 4.1(b)(x)_.

  



    

 | 24| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(i) _Set-Off; Surviving Indemnification Claims_. Notwithstanding
this Agreement or the Contingent Value Rights Agreement to the contrary, (i)
to the extent that Buyer shall exercise its set-off right pursuant to the
Fortress Restrictive Covenants Agreement or the Lu Restrictive Covenants
Agreement against any amount payable pursuant to Section 4.1(b), then such
set-off amount shall reduce the payment obligation of Buyer, Merger Sub, the
Company or their Affiliates or assigns under, and such amount shall not be
required to be paid by the foregoing pursuant to, this Agreement or the
Contingent Value Rights Agreement to the extent that such amount does not
exceed the portion(s) of the amount(s) otherwise payable hereunder or
thereunder to Fortress (or its assigns) or Lucy Lu (or her heirs or assigns),
respectively, from time to time, and the Company, Buyer and the Paying Agent
(or the Rights Agent (as defined in the Contingent Value Rights Agreement),
if applicable) shall cooperate with each other to appropriately and equitably
distribute the amount payable hereunder or thereunder by the Paying Agent (or
the Rights Agent (as defined in the Contingent Value Rights Agreement), if
applicable) to holders of Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Merger Effective Time (other than: (i) shares to be cancelled
and retired in accordance with _Section 4.1(a)_ ; and (ii) Dissenting
Shares), taking such set-off into account and in a manner that reduces the
amount that Fortress (or its assigns) or Lucy Lu (or her heirs or assigns),
as applicable are paid, (ii) with respect to any Post-Closing Indemnification
Amount, if Fortress has actually paid in full to Buyer the Fortress Portion
multiplied by such Post-Closing Indemnification Amount in accordance with the
Indemnification Agreement, then the Company's (or its Affiliates' or
assigns') obligation to make a payment pursuant to the Contingent Value
Rights Agreement shall be reduced by the Non-Fortress Portion multiplied by
such Post-Closing Indemnification Amount, and such amount shall not be
required to be paid thereunder by the foregoing, to the extent that such
product does not exceed the amount payable thereunder excluding the portion
thereof payable to Fortress (or its assigns), and the Company and the Rights
Agent (as defined in the Contingent Value Rights Agreement) shall cooperate
with each other to appropriately and equitably distribute the amount payable
thereunder by the Rights Agent (as defined in the Contingent Value Rights
Agreement) to holders of Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Merger Effective Time (other than: (i) shares to be cancelled and
retired in accordance with _Section 4.1(a)_ ; and (ii) Dissenting Shares),
taking such reduction into account and in a manner that reduces the
amount that such holders (other than Fortress) are paid, (iii) with respect
to any Post-Closing Indemnification Amount, if Fortress has not paid to Buyer
the Fortress Portion multiplied by such Post-Closing Indemnification Amount in
accordance with the Indemnification Agreement, then the Company's (or its
Affiliates' or assigns') obligation to make a payment pursuant to the
Contingent Value Rights Agreement shall be reduced by such Post-Closing
Indemnification Amount, and such amount shall not be required to be paid
thereunder by the foregoing, and the Company and the Rights Agent (as defined
in the Contingent Value Rights Agreement) shall cooperate with each other to
appropriately and equitably distribute the amount payable thereunder by the
Rights Agent (as defined in the Contingent Value Rights Agreement) to holders
of Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time (other than: (i) shares to be cancelled and retired in
accordance with _Section 4.1(a)_ ; and (ii) Dissenting Shares), taking such
reduction into account and in a manner that reduces the amount that all such
holders are paid, and (iv) if any Post-Closing Indemnification Amount is due,
then the Company and the Rights Agent (as defined in the Contingent Value
Rights Agreement) shall cooperate with each other to appropriately and
equitably distribute the amount payable by the Rights Agent (as defined in the
Contingent Value Rights Agreement) under the Contingent Value Rights
Agreement to the holders of Common Shares issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time (other than: (i) shares to be
cancelled and retired in accordance with _Section 4.1(a)_ ; and (ii)
Dissenting Shares) such that the Non-Fortress Portion multiplied by the
reasonable and documented legal fees and expenses incurred by Fortress in
defending the Surviving Indemnification Claim relating to such Post-Closing
Indemnification Amount shall first be paid by the Rights Agent (as defined in
the Contingent Value Rights Agreement) pursuant to the Contingent Value
Rights Agreement to Fortress (to the extent that it does not exceed the
amount payable thereunder) and the remaining amount payable by the Rights
Agent (as defined in the Contingent Value Rights Agreement) under the
Contingent Value Rights Agreement shall be payable thereunder to all holders
of Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time (other than: (i) shares to be cancelled and retired in
accordance with _Section 4.1(a)_ ; and (ii) Dissenting Shares). If any Losses
included in any Post-Closing Indemnification Amount (i) reduced the amount
payable by the Company or its Affiliates or assigns under the Contingent
Value Rights Agreement pursuant to this _Section 4.2(i)_ and (ii) are
subsequently determined in a final judgment or award of a court of competent
jurisdiction which is either not subject to any further appeals or the time
for giving notice to take such appeals has lapsed and no such notice was
filed to be lower than the amount that actually reduced the amount payable by
the Company or its Affiliates or assigns under the Contingent Value Rights
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 4.2(i)_ , then the Company shall transfer
the difference between such amounts to the Rights Agent (as defined in the
Contingent Value Rights Agreement) for further payment by it pursuant to
_Section 2.4_ thereof, which payment shall be (i) deemed to have occurred as
of the time that it would have otherwise been due pursuant to the Contingent
Value Rights Agreement but for this _Section 4.2(i)_ and (ii) made to the
Persons entitled thereunder taking the foregoing clause (i) into account.
Notwithstanding this Agreement or the Contingent Value Rights Agreement to
the contrary, if any Losses included in any Post-Closing
Indemnification Amount (i) reduced the amount payable by the Company or its
Affiliates or assigns under the Contingent Value Rights Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 4.2(i)_ and (ii) are subsequently determined in a final judgment
or award of a court of competent jurisdiction which is either not subject to
any further appeals or the time for giving notice to take such appeals has
lapsed and no such notice was filed to be higher than the amount that
actually reduced the amount payable by the Company or its Affiliates or
assigns under the Contingent Value Rights Agreement pursuant to this _Section
4.2(i)_ , then the difference between such amounts shall be deemed to be a
new Post-Closing Indemnification Amount with respect to which (x) the
provisions of Section 2(g) of the Indemnification Agreement shall apply and
(y) the provisions of this Section 4.2(i) shall apply to further reduce the
amounts required to be paid by the Company or its Affiliates or assigns
pursuant to the Contingent Value Rights Agreement. Notwithstanding this
Agreement or the Contingent Value Rights Agreement to the contrary, if any
Losses included in any Outstanding Indemnification Amount (as defined in the
Indemnification Agreement) (i) reduced the Cash Merger Consideration pursuant
to clause (H) of _Section 4.1(b)(x)_  and (ii) are subsequently determined in
a final judgment or award of a court of competent jurisdiction which is either
not subject to any further appeals or the time for giving notice to take such
appeals has lapsed and no such notice was filed to be higher than the amount
that actually reduced the Cash Merger Consideration pursuant to clause (H) of
_Section 4.1(b)(x)_ , then the difference between such amounts (the "
_Adjusted Pre-Closing Indemnification Amount_ ") shall be deemed to be
a Post-Closing Indemnification Amount with respect to which (x) the
provisions of _Section 2(g)_ of the Indemnification Agreement shall apply and
(y) the provisions of this _Section 4.2(i)_ shall apply to reduce the amounts
required to be paid by the Company or its Affiliates or assigns pursuant to

indemnification limitations contained in Section 2(b) of the Indemnification
Agreement, shall apply on a pro rata basis (based on the Fortress Portion,
with respect to Fortress and its Affiliates and assigns, and the Non Fortress
Portion, with respect to all holders of Common Shares issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time (other than: (i) shares to be

Section 4.3 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, including _Section 4.1_ , Common Shares
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time (other
than shares cancelled in accordance with _Section 4.1(a)_ ) and held by a
holder who has properly exercised appraisal rights of such shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and has not subsequently failed to
perfect or otherwise waived, withdrawn, or lost such holder's appraisal rights
under the DGCL with respect to such shares (such Common Shares being referred
to collectively as the " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such holder
fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws, or loses such holder's
appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall not be
converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead shall
be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if, after the Merger Effective Time, such
holder fails to perfect, waives, withdraws, or loses such holder's right to
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such Common Shares shall be treated as
if they had been converted as of the Merger Effective Time into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 4.1(b)_ , without
interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly representing
such share or transfer of such Book-Entry Share, as the case may be. The
Company shall provide Buyer prompt written notice of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of Common Shares, any waiver or withdrawal of any
such demand, and any other demand, notice, or instrument delivered to the
Company prior to the Merger Effective Time that relates to such demand, and
Buyer shall have the opportunity and right to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Buyer, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or
settle, or offer to settle, any such demands.

  



  

Section 4.4 Changes to Capital Stock; Adjustments to Merger
Consideration. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if
at any time during the period between the Signing Date and the Merger
Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Company shall occur, including by reason of any issuance (including upon
exercise of warrants), reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange, readjustment of
shares, or similar transaction, or any stock dividend or distribution paid in
stock, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement shall be equitably adjusted to proportionately reflect such change;
_provided_ , _however_ , that this sentence shall not be construed to permit
the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

Section 4.5 Withholding Rights. Each of the Paying Agent, Buyer,
Merger Sub, and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under any Tax laws. To the extent
that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Paying Agent, Buyer, Merger
Sub, or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which the Paying Agent, Buyer, Merger Sub, or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.

  



  

Section 4.6 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, or destroyed and, if
required by Buyer, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Buyer or the Paying Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against Buyer or the Surviving Corporation with respect to
such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost,
stolen, or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the Common Shares formerly represented by such Certificate as
contemplated under this _Article 4_.

    



  

Section 4.7 Treatment of Stock Options, Other Stock-Based
Compensation and Warrants.

action so that, prior to the Merger Effective Time, each option to
acquire Common Shares (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") that is then-
outstanding under any Company Plan (as in effect at the Signing Date and
previously disclosed to Buyer), whether or not then vested or exercisable,
shall become vested and exercisable and, if the fair market value of a Common
Share (which, for this purpose, shall be the closing price per Common Share
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time) is then in excess of the per
share exercise price of the Company Stock Option, such Company Stock Option
shall be exercised pursuant to the terms and conditions of the applicable
Company Stock Option award agreement (with any Taxes withheld with respect to
such exercise), with each Common Share received by the former holder of a
Company Stock Option in connection with such exercise entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 4.1(b)_. For the avoidance of
doubt, in the event that the per share exercise price under any Company Stock
Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time is
equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option
shall be cancelled as of the Merger Effective Time without payment therefor
and shall have no further force or effect.

(b) _Company Restricted Shares_. The Company shall take all
requisite action so that, immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time,
each Common Share subject to vesting, repurchase, or other lapse of
restrictions (a " _Company Restricted Share_ ") that is outstanding under any
Company Plan immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, vest
in full and become free of restrictions (with any Taxes withheld with
respect to the fair market value of such Company Restricted Share, which, for
this purpose, shall be the closing price per Common Share immediately prior
to the Merger Effective Time) and shall be cancelled and converted
automatically, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Agreement,
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
4.1(b)_.

  



  

(c) _Company Restricted Share Units_. The Company shall take all
requisite action so that, immediately prior to the Merger Effective
Time, each unit of Company Restricted Shares (a " _RSU_ "), that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, shall be
accelerated in full and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any such
RSU shall be entitled to receive a number of Common Shares as is equal to (i)
the total number of Common Shares subject to such RSU, less (ii) a number of
Common Shares that would otherwise be issued to the holder pursuant to the
RSU to be withheld by the Surviving Corporation in satisfaction of the tax
withholding obligations arising as a result of the vesting and settlement of
such RSU equal to a number of Common Shares having a fair market value
(which, for this purpose, shall be the closing price per Common Share
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time) equal to the amount necessary
to satisfy the withholding obligation based on the minimum applicable
statutory withholding rates for federal, state and local income tax and
payroll tax purposes (rounded up to the nearest whole share). Each such
Common Share issued to a former holder of an RSU shall be entitled to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 4.1(b)_.

  



  

(d) _Warrants_. Promptly after the Signing Date, the Company shall
take all requisite action so that, prior to the First Stage Closing, each
warrant to issue any Company Securities (each, a " _Company Warrant_ ") that
is outstanding shall be (i) exercised by the holder thereof, and converted
into Common Shares, and such Company Warrant shall be cancelled without any
Liability to the Company, or (ii) amended in writing (subject to Buyer's
prior review and consent to such amendment, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld), and fully executed by the Company and the applicable
holder thereof, solely to provide that such Company Warrant
shall, immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, automatically, and
without any action of the holder thereof or the Company, be converted into
Common Shares, and that such Company Warrant shall be cancelled without any
Liability to the Company.

  



  

(e) _Resolutions and Other Company Actions_. Prior to the Merger
Effective Time or the First Stage Closing, as applicable, the Company, the
Company's Board of Directors, and the compensation committee of such board,
as applicable, shall have adopted any resolutions and taken any actions
(including obtaining any employee consents) that may be necessary to
effectuate the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this
_Section 4.7_.

Section 4.8 Further Assurances. If, at any time from and after the
Merger Effective Time, the Company or Buyer reasonably believes or is
advised that any further instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances are
reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate the Merger or to carry out
the purposes and intent of this Agreement at or after the Merger Effective
Time, then the Company, Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and their respective
officers and directors shall execute and deliver all such proper deeds,

representatives such additional information regarding the Company as Buyer,
its Affiliates and their representatives may from time to time
reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that such access will be
provided upon reasonable notice, during normal business hours, and in a
manner that will not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business
of the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Company will not be required to disclose any information to Buyer if such
disclosure would (i) invalidate any attorney-client privilege or (ii)
contravene any applicable Legal Requirement or fiduciary duty. The
Company acknowledges that Buyer may be subject to obligations under Legal
Requirements, including obligations under the federal Physician Payments
Sunshine Act and similar Legal Requirements relating to payments and gifts
made to healthcare practitioners and Legal Requirements relating to fraud and
abuse such as the False Claims Act, Anti-Kick Back Statute, Physician Self-
Referral Law (Stark law), the Exclusion Provisions and the Civil Monetary
Penalties Law, and that Buyer may require the Company's support
and cooperation to comply with such statutory obligations. The Company hereby
agrees to reasonably cooperate with Buyer and to take all actions necessary,
including providing information, to enable Buyer to comply with such
obligations. No investigation pursuant to this _Section 8.2_ or information
provided, made available or delivered pursuant to this _Section 8.2_ or
otherwise, or any knowledge that any Person may have shall affect any
representations or warranties or conditions or rights contained in
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

Section 8.3 No Solicitation.

  



  

(a) The Company shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates not to),
and shall not authorize or permit its directors, officers, employees, agents,
advisors, legal counsel, investment bankers and other representatives (the
foregoing Persons are referred to herein as " _Representatives_ ") to, and
shall instruct each of its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (x)
solicit, initiate, or knowingly facilitate or encourage the submission of any
Takeover Proposal or the making of any proposal that could reasonably be
expected to lead to any Takeover Proposal, or (y) subject to _Section 8.3(b)_
: (i) conduct or engage in any discussions or negotiations with, disclose any
non-public information relating to the Company to, afford access to the
business, properties, assets, books, or records of the Company to, or
knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate, or encourage any effort by, any
third party that is seeking to make, or has made, any Takeover Proposal; (ii)
(A) amend or grant any waiver under any standstill or similar agreement with
the party providing such Takeover Proposal with respect to the applicable
class of equity securities of the Company, or (B) approve any transaction
under, or any third party becoming an "interested stockholder" under, Section
203 of the DGCL; or (iii) enter into any agreement in principle, letter of
intent, term sheet, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement, or other Contract
relating to any Takeover Proposal (each, a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_
"). Except as expressly permitted by _Section 8.3(d)_ , the Board of
Directors of the Company shall not effect a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change. The Company shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) cease
immediately and cause to be terminated, and shall not authorize or knowingly
permit any of its Representatives to continue, and shall instruct each such
Representatives to terminate, any and all existing activities, discussions, or
negotiations, if any, with any third party conducted prior to the Signing
Date with respect to any Takeover Proposal and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause any such third party (and the Affiliates and
Representatives of the Company or its Affiliates) in possession of non-public
information in respect of the Company that was furnished by or on behalf of
the Company to return or destroy (and confirm destruction of) all such
information.

  



    

 | 56| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Notwithstanding  _Section 8.3(a)_ , prior to the Requisite
Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company, directly or
indirectly through any Representative, may, subject to _Sections 8.3(c)_ and
_(d)_ : (i) participate in negotiations or discussions with any third party
that has made (and not withdrawn) a bona fide, unsolicited Takeover Proposal
in writing that the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and independent financial advisor,
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal;
and (ii) thereafter furnish to such third party non-public
information relating to the Company ( _provided_ , that the Company shall,
substantially concurrently with the delivery to such Person, provide to Buyer
any non-public information concerning the Company that is provided or made
available to such Person or its Representatives unless such non-public
information has been previously provided to Buyer) pursuant to an executed
confidentiality and standstill agreement (a copy of which confidentiality and
standstill agreement shall be promptly (in all events within 24 hours)
provided for informational purposes only to Buyer) no less favorable to the
Company than the Confidentiality Agreement, but in each case referred to in
the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), only if the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and independent
financial advisor, that the failure to take such action in connection with
such written (and not withdrawn) Takeover Proposal would reasonably be
expected to result in the Company Board to be in breach of its fiduciary
duties under applicable Legal Requirements (and with such activities to be
terminated immediately in connection with any withdrawal of such Takeover
Proposal or, in the case of any changes to such Takeover Proposal, if such
changes would have not led to such determination had those changes been in
effect at the time of the original determination). Nothing contained herein
shall prevent the Company Board from disclosing to the Company's stockholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act with regard to a Takeover Proposal, if the Company determines,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to disclose such
position would reasonably be expected to result in a violation of applicable
Legal Requirements. If any disclosure or other action pursuant to the
preceding sentence of this _Section 8.3(b)_ includes or has the substantive
effect of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, it shall be deemed to be a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change (and subject to the obligations with
respect thereto) for all purposes under this Agreement.

  



  

(c) The Company Board shall not take any of the actions referred to
in clauses (i) or (ii) of _Section 8.3(b)_ unless the Company shall have
delivered to Buyer a prior written notice advising Buyer that it intends to
take such action. The Company shall notify Buyer promptly (but in no event
later than 24 hours) after it (or any of its Representatives) receives any
Takeover Proposal, any inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Takeover Proposal, or any request for non-public information relating to the
Company or for access to the business, properties, assets, books, or records
of the Company by any third party. In such notice, the Company shall identify
the third party making, and details of the material terms and conditions of
(along with the latest draft of the proposed Takeover Proposal agreement and
all other related documents with respect to such Takeover Proposal), any such
Takeover Proposal, indication or request. The Company shall keep Buyer fully
informed, on a current basis (and in any event with material updates within
twenty-four (24) hours), of the status and material terms of any such Takeover
Proposal, indication or request, including any material amendments or
proposed amendments as to price and other material terms thereof. The Company
shall provide Buyer with at least 48 hours prior notice of any meeting of the
Company Board (or such lesser notice as is provided to the members of the
Company Board, but in no event less than 24 hours prior notice) at which the
Company Board is reasonably expected to consider any Takeover Proposal. The
Company shall promptly provide Buyer with a list of any non-public information
concerning the Company's business, present or future performance, financial
condition, or results of operations, provided to any third party, and, to
the extent such information has not been previously provided to Buyer, copies
of such information.

(d) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 8.3(d)_ , the
Company Board shall not effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement. At any time prior to the receipt
of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, subject to the Company having complied
with _Sections 7.1_ , _7.2_ and _8.3_ in all respects, the Company Board may
effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or enter into a Company
Acquisition Agreement, if: (i) the Company promptly notifies Buyer, in
writing, at least five Business Days (the " _Superior Proposal Notice Period_
") before making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or entering into a
Company Acquisition Agreement, of its intention to take such action with
respect to a Superior Proposal, which notice shall state expressly that the
Company has received a Takeover Proposal that the Company Board intends to
declare a Superior Proposal and that the Company Board intends to effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or the Company intends to enter
into a Company Acquisition Agreement; (ii) the Company attaches to such notice
the most current version of the proposed agreement and any related documents
(which version(s) shall be updated on a prompt basis) and the identity of the
third party making such Superior Proposal; (iii) the Company shall, and shall
cause its Representatives to, during the Superior Proposal Notice Period,
negotiate with Buyer in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Takeover Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal (taking into account any termination fee and
expense reimbursement provisions applicable, including the Termination Fee),
if Buyer, in its discretion, proposes to make such adjustments (it being
agreed that in the event that, after commencement of the Superior Proposal
Notice Period, there is any material revision to the terms of a Superior
Proposal, including any revision in price, the Superior Proposal Notice Period
shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least five Business Days
remain in the Superior Proposal Notice Period subsequent to the time the
Company notifies Buyer of any such material revision (it being understood that
there may be multiple extensions)); (iv) the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consulting with its outside legal counsel and independent
financial advisor, that such Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal after taking into account any adjustments made by
Buyer during the Superior Proposal Notice Period in the terms and conditions
of this Agreement; and (v) prior to or simultaneously with entering into any
Company Acquisition Agreement, the Company shall have terminated this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.5(b)_ and paid the Termination Fee to
Buyer.

their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all requisite consents of or
waivers from Third Parties.

  



  

(b) To the extent that the execution or delivery by the Company of
this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements, or the performance by the
Company of its obligations under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Agreements, or the consummation of the Stock Purchase Transaction, the Merger
or any other transaction contemplated hereby or thereby causes or would cause
a breach of any Company Contract, permit or right or gives any Person other
than the Company the ability to terminate any such Company Contract, permit or
right, the Company shall use reasonable commercial efforts to obtain as
promptly as practicable the consent of any Third Parties required to prevent
or cure such breach or termination.

  



  

Section 8.5 Regulatory and Other Authorizations.

  



  

(a) Subject to the following sentence with respect to filings under
the HSR Act, the Company and Buyer will (i) use their reasonable best
efforts to obtain as promptly as reasonably practicable all authorizations,
consents, orders, actions and approvals, and to make all filings with and to
give all notices to all Governmental Authorities required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) cooperate fully with the
other parties hereto in promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations,
consents, orders, actions and approvals and to make all such filings and give
such notices and (iii) provide such other information to any Governmental
Authority as such Governmental Authority may reasonably request in connection
therewith. Following the First Stage Closing, each party hereto agrees to
make, upon the earlier of (A) January 1, 2021, and (B) the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Section 10.3(a)_ , any required filings under the
HSR Act with respect to the Merger Transaction and to supply as promptly as
reasonably practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authorities any
information and documentary material that may be reasonably requested in
connection with such HSR Act filings. Each of the Company and Buyer will pay
half of any fees associated with any filings under the HSR Act in connection
with this Agreement. The Company will pay all fees or make other payments
provided for under Legal Requirements to any Governmental Authority in order
to obtain any such authorizations, consents, orders or approvals.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither Buyer
nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to avoid or eliminate any
impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Legal
Requirement that may be asserted by any antitrust or competition
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, including (i)
negotiating, committing to and effecting by consent decree, hold separate
orders, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of the assets,
properties or businesses of Buyer or its Affiliates (or after the Second Stage
Closing, the Company), or (ii) entering into such other arrangements as are
necessary in order to avoid the entry of, and the commencement of litigation
seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding,
which would otherwise have the effect of materially delaying or preventing
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(c) The Company and Buyer will each promptly notify the other party
of any communication that it or any of its Affiliates receives from any
Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this
Agreement and permit, when practicable, the other party to review in advance
any proposed communication by such party (or the Company) to any Governmental
Authority. Neither the Company nor Buyer will agree to participate in any
meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings,
investigation (including any settlement of the investigation), litigation, or
other inquiry until it consults with the other party in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. The Company and Buyer
will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such
information and providing such assistance as the other party may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination
of any applicable waiting periods, including under the HSR Act. The Company
and Buyer will provide each other with copies of all correspondence, filings
or communications between them or any of their representatives, on the one
hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other
hand, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that materials may be redacted (w) to
remove references concerning the valuation of the Common Shares or the
business of the Company, (x) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements, (y) as necessary to address reasonable privilege or
confidentiality concerns and (z) as necessary to address competitive or
regulatory concerns; however, both parties shall assess on a case-by-
case basis in good faith whether the redacted information may be exchanged
between outside competition counsel for the purpose of any merger control
proceedings.

  



  

(d) Buyer and the Company will, or will cause their respective
Affiliates to, notify their respective employees in respect of whom
notification is required under applicable Legal Requirements or by contract
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements.

occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event of which it is aware that will or is
reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions for the benefit of such
other party set forth in Article 9 or Article 10, as applicable, of this

Section 8.9 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

  



  

(a) Buyer and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation by the Company now existing in favor
of each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or
who becomes prior to the Merger Effective Time, an officer or director of the
Company (each an " _Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in the certificate
of incorporation (including any certificate of designations) or by-laws of
the Company, in each case as in effect on the Signing Date, or pursuant to
any other contracts in effect on the date hereof, shall be assumed by the
Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Merger
Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall remain in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms, and, in the event that any proceeding
is pending or asserted or any claim made during such period, until the final
disposition of such proceeding or claim.

  



  

(b) For six years after the Merger Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law, Buyer and the Surviving
Corporation (the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") shall indemnify, defend, and
hold harmless each Indemnified Party against all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments, and fines arising in whole or in part
out of actions or omissions in their capacity as such occurring at or prior
to the Merger Effective Time (including in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), and shall reimburse each Indemnified Party
for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party
in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments, and fines as such expenses
are incurred, subject to the Surviving Corporation's receipt of an undertaking
by such Indemnified Party to repay such legal and other fees and expenses
paid in advance if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified under applicable
Legal Requirements; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation
will not be liable for any settlement effected without the Surviving
Corporation's prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed).

  



    

 | 64| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Buyer shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to: (i) maintain in effect for a period of six
years after the Merger Effective Time, if available, the current policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time ( _provided_ , that the
Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies, of at least the same
coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are not less
advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company when compared to
the insurance maintained by the Company as of the date hereof); or (ii)
obtain as of the Merger Effective Time "tail" insurance policies with a claims
period of six years from the Merger Effective Time with at least the same
coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are not less
advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company, in each case with
respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred before
or at the Merger Effective Time (including in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event
will the Surviving Corporation be required to expend an annual premium for
such coverage in excess of 200 percent of the last annual premium paid by the
Company for such insurance prior to the Signing Date, which amount is
determined in accordance with _Schedule 8.9_ (the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If
such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at an annual premium equal to or
less than the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation will obtain, and
Buyer will cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain, that amount of
directors' and officers' insurance (or "tail" coverage) obtainable for an
annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium.

  



  

(d) The obligations of Buyer and the Surviving Corporation under
this _Section 8.9_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party to whom this _Section 8.9_  applies without the consent of
such affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the
Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 8.9_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 8.9_ , each of whom may enforce the
provisions of this _Section 8.9_ ).

(e) In the event Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns: (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in

Stage Closing:

  



  

(1) by either the Company or Buyer if the First Stage Closing has not
occurred by June 30, 2019; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to

(2) by either the Company or Buyer in the event that any Governmental
Authority has enacted, issued, enforced or entered into any statute, rule,
regulation, injunction or other order, restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the Stock Purchase Transaction that will have become final and
non-appealable;

  



    

 | 69| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(3) by Buyer if either the Requisite Stockholder Approval or the Non-
Affiliate Stockholder Approval is not obtained at the Company
Stockholder Meeting;

(b) This Agreement may be terminated by the Company at any time
prior to the Requisite Stockholder Approval being obtained at the

the Company complied with Section 8.3 in all respects, (ii) the Company has

reimbursement provisions applicable, including the Termination Fee),

reasonably expected by the Company Board to be consummated on the terms
proposed, (ii) to the extent financing is required, such financing is then
fully committed by creditworthy financial institutions of nationally
recognized reputation and (iii) such Superior Proposal is on terms that the
Company Board determines in its good faith judgment (based on the advice of
the Company's outside legal counsel and independent financial advisor) to be

financial point of view than the Transactions (taking into account any

any of its covenants and agreements set forth in _Sections 7.1_ , _7.2_ or
_8.3_ (other than, individually or in the aggregate, insignificant breaches
of _Sections 7.1_ , _7.2_ or _8.3(a)-(c)_ ).

  



  

(d) This Agreement may be terminated by Buyer at any time prior to
the First Stage Closing if there shall have been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement on the part of the Company
set forth in this Agreement such that the conditions to the First
Stage Closing set forth in _Section 9.3(b)_ or _Section 9.3(c)_ , as
applicable, would not be satisfied and, in either such case, such breach is
incapable of being cured by June 30, 2019; _provided_ that Buyer shall have
given the Company at least 30 days written notice prior to such termination
stating Buyer's intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 9.5(d)_ ; _provided further_ , that Buyer shall not have the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.5(d)_ if Buyer or

(e) In the event of termination of this Agreement under _Section

and there will be no liability on the part of either party to this Agreement
except (i) that _Sections 2.1_ , _9.5(e)_ ,  _9.6_ and _12_ will survive any
termination of this Agreement and (ii) to the extent that such termination
results from the willful breach by a party of any of its representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement, or from the breach by a party of any
of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.6 Fees and Expenses Following Termination.

  



  

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by (1) Buyer or
the Company pursuant to _Section 9.5(a)(1)_ , only if at such time the
Company has failed to hold the Company Stockholder Meeting and Buyer is not in
breach of its obligations under _Section 8.5_  (other than, individually or
in the aggregate, any insignificant breaches thereof) or (2) Buyer pursuant to
_Section 9.5(d)_ , then, in either case, the Company shall pay to Buyer the
Termination Fee within two (2) Business Days of such termination. In
the event that this Agreement is terminated and a bona fide Takeover Proposal
shall have been publicly disclosed or privately made to the Company Board
after the date hereof and not clearly withdrawn or terminated in good faith
prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting (in the case of termination pursuant
to _Section 9.5(a)(3)_ ), prior to the termination date (in the case of
termination pursuant to _Section 9.5(a)(1)_ ) or prior to the breach giving
rise to the right of termination (in the case of termination pursuant to
_Section 9.5(d)_ ) then, in any case, the Company shall pay to Buyer the
Termination Fee within two (2) Business Days of such termination. In the
event that this Agreement is terminated and within 12 months of the date this
Agreement is terminated, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to any Takeover Proposal or consummates the transactions
contemplated by any Takeover Proposal ( _provided_ that for purposes of this
sentence, the references to "15%" in the definition of Takeover Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to "50%"), then the Company shall pay to
Buyer the Termination Fee on the date of entry into such agreement or, if
earlier, consummation of such Takeover Proposal.

  



  

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Buyer solely
pursuant to _Section 9.5(a)(3)_ , then the Company shall reimburse Buyer for
up to $500,000 in Buyer's and its Affiliates' documented aggregate out-of-
pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions
(including the fees of outside counsel and other advisors, and whether
incurred before or after the date of this Agreement and including costs, fees
and expenses incurred in connection with the investigation,
structuring, negotiation, due diligence, and financial, operating, legal and
other analysis with respect to the Transactions); _provided_ , that any such
amounts paid by the Company pursuant to this _Section 9.6(b)_ shall be
deducted from any Termination Fee that may subsequently become payable
pursuant to _Section 9.6(a)_ above.

  



    

 | 71| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant
to _Section 9.5(c)_ , then the Company shall pay to Buyer the Termination Fee
within two (2) Business Days of such termination.

  



  

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to _Section 9.5(b)_ , then the Company shall pay to Buyer the
Termination Fee prior to or concurrently with such termination.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the fee referred to in this _Section 9.6(a)_ on more than one
occasion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
parties agree that the payment of the Termination Fee shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy available to Buyer and Merger Sub with respect to this
Agreement and the Transactions in the event any such payment becomes due and
payable and is paid, and, upon payment of the Termination Fee, the Company
(and the Company's Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives)
shall have no further liability to Buyer and Merger Sub under this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be relieved or released
from any liabilities or damages arising out of its willful and material
breach of _Section 7.1_ , _Section 7.2_ or _Section 8.3_ ; _provided_ , 
_further_ , that the aggregate amount of damages determined by a court to be
payable by the Company pursuant to the foregoing proviso shall be reduced by
the amount of any Termination Fee paid to Buyer pursuant to this _Section
9.6_.

  



  

(f) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
_Section 9.6_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and that,
without these agreements, the parties would not have entered into this
Agreement. Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to _Section 9.6_ shall be
paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by Buyer in writing and shall be reduced by any amounts required to
be deducted or withheld therefrom under applicable Legal Requirement in
respect of Taxes.

awards, costs, expenses, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses, interest
and penalties, diminution in value and lost profits (including any reasonable
legal, accounting or other expenses for investigating, initiating or

") asserted against, imposed upon or sustained or incurred as a result of,
arising out of or in connection with any breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty of the Company contained herein or in any
Ancillary Agreement (provided, that for purposes of determining if there is
any such breach or inaccuracy and for purposes of calculating any Losses
arising from such breach or inaccuracy, such representations and warranties
shall be read as if they were not qualified by any concept of "material,"
"materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" or a similar qualification). The

Fortress has been given an Indemnification Notice at or prior to the Second
Stage Closing shall survive the Second Stage Closing or any termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.5_ ). The covenants and agreements of
the parties shall survive the First Stage Closing and Second Stage Closing, as
applicable, in accordance with their respective terms.

Party shall have any obligation to pursue the Company for any Losses relating
to any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the Company

Requirements or by the requirements of any stock exchange on which the
securities of a party hereto or any of its Affiliates are listed, no party to
this Agreement will make, or cause to be made, any press release or public
announcement in respect of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the

news media with respect to the foregoing without prior notification to the
other parties, and the parties to this Agreement will consult with each other
and cooperate as to the form, timing and contents of any such press release,

unenforceable or invalid under applicable Legal Requirements, such
provision will be ineffective only to the extent of such unenforceability or
invalidity, and the parties will negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so that the unenforceable or invalid provision is replaced by such
valid and enforceable provision which the parties consider, in good faith, to
match as closely as possible the invalid or unenforceable provision and to

Section 12.7 Assignment. No party hereto may assign, in whole or in
part, or delegate all or any part of its rights, interests or obligations

in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard for its

Section 12.10   Specific Performance. Each party acknowledges and agrees
that the other party would be irreparably damaged if the provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their terms and that any
breach of this Agreement and the non-consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby by either party could not be adequately compensated in
all cases by monetary damages alone. Accordingly, in addition to any remedy to
which such other party may be entitled under _Section 12.11_ , provisional
measures and injunctive relief necessary to protect the possibility of
each party to seek specific performance from the other from the tribunal
referred to in _Section 12.11_ can be sought from any court of competent
jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto (i) agrees that it shall not oppose
the granting of any such relief and (ii) hereby irrevocably waives any
requirement for the security or posting of any bond in connection with any
such relief (it is understood that clause (i) of this sentence is not
intended to, and shall not, preclude any party hereto from litigating on the
merits the substantive claim to which such remedy relates).

  



  

Section 12.11 Submission to Jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto
irrevocably agrees that any Proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the
rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement
of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder brought by any other party hereto or its successors or
assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware, or in the event (but only in the event) that such
court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such action or
proceeding, in the federal courts sitting in the State of Delaware. Each of
the parties hereto agrees that mailing of process or other papers in
connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in
_Section 12.4_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable
Legal Requirements, will be valid and sufficient service thereof. Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or
proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court or tribunal
other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense,
counterclaim, or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this
Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition
and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights
and obligations arising hereunder: (a) any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other
than the failure to serve process in accordance with this _Section 12.11_ ;
(b) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of
any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise); and (c) to the
fullest extent permitted by the applicable Legal Requirements, any claim that
(i) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper, or
(iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or
by such courts.

JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY TO
THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL
ACTION; (B) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (C)
SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 12.12_.

no such waiver shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument
duly executed by or on behalf of the party waiving such term or condition,
and no waiver by any party of any default, misrepresentation, or breach of
warranty or covenant hereunder, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or
subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty, covenant or
agreement hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any
such prior or subsequent occurrence. No failure or delay of any party in
exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof,
and no waiver by any party of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any
one or more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the
same or any other term or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion.

  



  

Section 12.14 Counterparts; Facsimile Signature. This Agreement may be
executed in one (1) or more counterparts, by original or facsimile (or
other such electronically transmitted) signature, each of which will be
deemed an original, but all of which will constitute one and the same
instrument. Any party executing this Agreement by facsimile (or other such
electronically transmitted) signature shall, upon request from another party
hereto, promptly deliver to the requesting party an original counterpart of
such signature.

parties under this Agreement will be cumulative, and the exercise of one or
more rights or remedies will not preclude the exercise of any other right or
remedy available under this Agreement or applicable Legal Requirements. After
the Merger Effective Time, the Company shall have the sole right to pursue
damages or other remedies on behalf of the holders of Common Shares at the
Merger Effective Time.
