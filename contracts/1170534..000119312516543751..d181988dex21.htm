DGCL) as agreed by Parent and the Company and specified in the Certificate of
Merger (the " _Effective Time_ "). As a result of the Merger, the separate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue its
existence as a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Parent under the Law of
the State of Delaware. The Company, in its capacity as the corporation
surviving the Merger, is sometimes referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Surviving Corporation_."

 

(b) The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement, the
Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, subject to _Section 6.06_, (i) by virtue of the
Merger, the certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended in
its entirety to read as set forth in _Exhibit A_, and (ii) the Parties shall
cause the bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time to be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, except that the name of
the corporation set forth therein shall be changed to the name of the Company,
in each case, until thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL and as
provided in such certificate of incorporation or bylaws.

 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be, in
accordance with the DGCL and as provided in the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time,
the officers of the Company

 



-23-  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case
may be, in accordance with the DGCL and as provided in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 2.03 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock of the Company and Merger
Sub_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or their respective
shareholders or stockholders, as applicable:

 

(a) all Shares that are owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) or the Company (including Shares held as
treasury stock or otherwise) or any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries, in each
case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be automatically cancelled
and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor;

(b) each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than (i) shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.03(a)_
and (ii) Appraisal Shares subject to the provisions of _Section 2.06_) shall
be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, subject to the other
provisions of this  _ARTICLE 2_, $3.12 in cash, without interest (such
amount for each such Share, the " _Cash Consideration_ ") and 1.3100 fully
paid and non-assessable Parent Common Shares, without interest (the "
_Share Consideration_ ," and together with the Cash Consideration and any
cash in lieu of a fractional Parent Common Share as specified in _Section
2.05_, the " _Merger Consideration_ ");

 

(c) each holder of a Share cancelled and converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.03(b)_ (i) represented by a
certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") or (ii) held in book-entry form (" _Book-
Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
(A) the amount of Merger Consideration due to such holder pursuant to this
_Section 2.03_ and (B) the right to receive any other amounts, dividends and
distributions as expressly provided herein, without interest, subject to
compliance with the procedures set forth in _Section 2.07_; and

(d) each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one (1) validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(e) The Surviving Corporation shall issue 100,000 shares of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation to Merger Sub Parent or Parent in consideration for
the payment of the Merger Consideration.

Section 2.04 _Certain Adjustments_. Without limiting the provisions of this
Agreement, if, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the
outstanding Parent Common Shares or Shares shall have been changed into, or
exchanged for, a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of
any stock 

 



-24-  dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination, exchange of shares, or similar transaction, the Merger
Consideration and any items on which the calculation of the Merger
Consideration depends, as the case may be, shall be correspondingly adjusted
as appropriate to provide the holders of Shares (including the holders of
Company Stock Option Awards, Company RSU Awards and Company Performance Share
Awards) the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event.

Section 2.05 _Fractional Shares_. In lieu of any fractional Parent Common
Share that otherwise would be issuable pursuant to the Merger, each holder of
Shares who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fraction of a Parent
Common Share pursuant to the Merger will be paid an amount in cash (without
interest) equal to such holders respective proportionate interest in the
proceeds from the sale or sales in the open market by the Exchange Agent, on
behalf of all such holders, of the aggregate fractional Parent Common Shares
deemed issued pursuant to the Merger. No fractional Parent Common Shares
shall be issued by virtue of the Merger, no dividends or other distributions
with respect to Parent Common Shares shall be payable on or with respect to
any such fractional share interest, and such fractional share interest will
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder
of Parent. As soon as practicable following the completion of the Merger, the
Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (i) the number of Parent Common
Shares issuable to the former holders of Shares pursuant to the Merger
(including fractional shares), over (ii) the number of Parent Common Shares to
be distributed to such former holders (excluding fractional shares) (such
excess, the " _Excess Merger Parent Shares_ "). Parent shall instruct the
Exchange Agent, as agent and trustee for the former holders of Shares, to sell
as promptly as reasonably practicable the Excess Merger Parent Shares. The
sales of the Excess Merger Parent Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be
executed on the NASDAQ through one or more member firms of the NASDAQ and
shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the proceeds
of such sales have been distributed to the former holders of Shares to whom
fractional Parent Common Shares otherwise would have been issued in the
Merger, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for such former
holders. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash
to be paid to former holders of Shares in respect of any fractional Parent
Common Shares, the Exchange Agent shall distribute such amounts to such former
holders.

 

Section 2.06 _Appraisal Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand and properly
demands appraisal of such Shares and who has not effectively withdrawn or lost
such Persons right to appraisal of such Shares (" _Appraisal Shares_ ")
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL ("
_Section 262_") shall not be converted into the Merger Consideration as
provided in  _Section 2.03_, but rather the holders of Appraisal Shares
shall be entitled to payment by the Surviving Corporation of the "fair value"
of such Appraisal Shares to the extent permitted by and in accordance with
Section 262;  _provided_ , _however_ , if any such holder shall fail to
perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal
under Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of
such holders Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal

 



-25-  Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into,
and to have become exchangeable solely for, the Merger Consideration as
provided in _Section 2.03_. The Company shall provide prompt notice to
Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Shares,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to
Section 262 received by the Company, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or
settle, offer to settle or waive any failure to timely deliver in writing in
accordance with the DGCL, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

 

Section 2.07 _Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) Prior to the mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Parent shall
enter into a customary exchange agreement, reasonably acceptable to the
Company, with a nationally recognized financial institution designated by
Parent, which (at Parents option) may be the transfer agent for Shares or
Parent Common Shares, or such other Person reasonably acceptable to
the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). At or immediately following the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause Merger Sub Parent to deposit
with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of Shares, for exchange
in accordance with this _ARTICLE 2_, through the Exchange Agent, subject to
_Section 2.07(b)(ii)_, book-entry shares representing the full number of
whole Parent Common Shares issuable pursuant to _Section 2.03_ in exchange
for outstanding Shares. At or immediately following the Effective Time, (i)
the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall provide to
the Exchange Agent from its bank accounts in the United States cash in an
aggregate amount equal to the amount set forth in _Section 8.02(e)_, or such
lesser amount as Parent shall have specified by written notice to the Company,
delivered at least one (1) day prior to the Closing Date (the " _Company
Cash Consideration_ ") and (ii) Parent shall provide or shall cause Merger
Sub Parent to provide to the Exchange Agent cash in an aggregate amount
necessary to pay the remaining cash portion of the aggregate Merger
Consideration, and Parent shall, after the Effective Time on the appropriate
payment date, if applicable, provide or cause to be provided to the Exchange
Agent any dividends or other distributions payable on such Parent Common
Shares pursuant to _Section 2.07(c)_ which had not theretofore been
surrendered for exchange or been exchanged pursuant to _Section 2.07(b)(ii)_
(such Parent Common Shares and cash provided to the Exchange Agent, together
with any dividends or other distributions with respect thereto, are
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). In the event the Exchange
Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments in connection with the
aggregate Merger Consideration contemplated by _Section 2.03_ (including as
a result of any losses resulting from the investments contemplated in _Section
2.07(i)_), Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional
funds or Parent Common Shares, as applicable, with the Exchange Agent in an
amount that is equal to the deficiency. The Exchange Agent shall deliver the
aggregate Merger Consideration to be issued pursuant to _Section 2.03_ out of
the Exchange Fund (subject to _Section 2.05_). Except as provided in
_Section 2.07(i)_, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 



-26- (b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail, as soon
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later
than the fifth Business Day following the Effective Time, to each holder of
record of a Certificate whose Shares were converted into the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.03_, (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form, be reasonably acceptable to the
Company, and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as
may be appointed by Parent, together with a letter of transmittal, duly
executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and
deliver in exchange thereof as promptly as practicable, the Merger
Consideration due to such holder subject to, and in accordance with  _Section
2.03(c)_, and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
_Section 2.07(c)(i)_, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled; _provided_ , that any amount of Parent Common Shares so paid and
delivered as part of such Merger Consideration shall be in book-entry form. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of a Share that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made and shares may be issued
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of
the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is
not applicable. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate.

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be
required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the
Exchange Agent to receive the applicable form of Merger Consideration that
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this _ARTICLE 2_. Each holder
of record of one (1) or more Book-Entry Shares whose Shares were converted
into the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.03_ shall be entitled to
receive, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration due
to such holder, subject to, and in accordance with _Section 2.03(c)_, and any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.07(c)(ii)_,
and the Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be cancelled;
_provided_ , that any amount of Parent Common Shares so paid and delivered as
part of such Merger Consideration shall be in book-entry form. No interest
shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon conversion of any Book-Entry
Shares.

 



-27- (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent
Common Shares with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to
the holder of any Certificate formerly representing Shares, and no cash
payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant
to _Section 2.05_, until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance
with this _ARTICLE 2_. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any
such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the Parent Common
Shares issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the time
of delivery of such Parent Common Shares by the Exchange Agent pursuant to
_Section 2.07(b)(i)_, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
Parent Common Shares and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to such delivery of such Parent Common Shares by the Exchange Agent
pursuant to  _Section 2.07(b)(i)_, and a payment date subsequent to such
delivery of such Parent Common Shares by the Exchange Agent pursuant to
_Section 2.07(b)(i)_, payable with respect to such Parent Common Shares.

 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Subject to applicable Law, there shall be paid to
the holder of the Parent Common Shares issued in exchange for Book-Entry
Shares in accordance with this _ARTICLE 2_, without interest, (A) at the time
of delivery of such Parent Common Shares by the Exchange Agent pursuant to
_Section 2.07(b)(ii)_, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
Parent Common Shares and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to the time of such delivery by the Exchange Agent pursuant to
_Section 2.07(b)(ii)_, and a payment date subsequent to the time of such
delivery by the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.07(b)(ii)_, payable
with respect to such Parent Common Shares.

(d) The Merger Consideration issued and paid in accordance with the terms of
this  _ARTICLE 2_ upon the surrender of the Certificates (or, immediately,
in the case of the Book-Entry Shares) shall be deemed to have been issued and
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares (other than
the right to receive dividends or other distributions, if any, in accordance
with _Section 2.07(c)_). After the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly
representing Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this _ARTICLE 2_.

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the
former holders of Shares for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any former holder of
Shares who has not theretofore complied with this _ARTICLE 2_ shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving

 



-28-  Corporation for payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration and any
dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Shares as
contemplated by _Section 2.07(c)_.

 

(f) Any portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration deposited with the
Exchange Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.07_ to pay for Shares for which
appraisal rights shall have been perfected pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation upon the Surviving
Corporations demand.

 

(g) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Parent Common
Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any Merger Consideration
remaining unclaimed by former holders of Shares immediately prior to such
time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit and indemnification, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the
Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in reasonable amount as
Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration and any unpaid dividends or
other distributions that would be payable or deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to _Section 2.07(c)_ had such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate been surrendered as provided in this _ARTICLE 2_.

 

(i) The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , no such investment income or
gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Shares.
Any interest, gains and other income resulting from such investments shall be
the sole and exclusive property of Parent (or Merger Sub Parent, as the case
may be) payable to Parent (or Merger Sub Parent, as the case may be) upon its
request, and no part of such interest, gains and other income shall accrue to
the benefit of holders of Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , any investment
of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations
of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest
by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available), and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect
the amounts payable to holders of Shares pursuant to this _ARTICLE 2_.

 



-29- (j) Parent, Merger Sub Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to any former holder of Shares pursuant to this Agreement such amounts
as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or
non-U.S. tax Law. Any amount deducted or withheld pursuant to this _Section
2.07(j)_ and paid over to the relevant taxing authority shall be treated as
having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction
or withholding was made. Parent shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, all
amounts so deducted or withheld to the appropriate taxing authority within the
period required under applicable Law. The Parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that payment of the Merger Consideration is not subject to any
withholding Tax imposed by Canada or any political subdivision therein under
applicable Law in effect on the date hereof.

 

Section 2.08 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall determine that any actions are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to take all such
actions as may be necessary or desirable to vest all right, title or interest
in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

 

Section 2.09 _Company Stock Based Plans_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, each award of options to purchase shares of
Company Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "
_Company Stock Option Award_ "), regardless of whether vested or unvested,
shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, the Surviving Corporation shall
pay to each former holder of any such cancelled Company Stock Option Award as
soon as practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event later than
five (5) Business Days thereafter, by a payroll payment an amount in cash
(without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax)
equal to the product of (i) the excess of the Per Share Cash Value over the
exercise price per share of Company Stock underlying such Company Stock Option
Award  _multiplied by_ (ii) the number of shares of Company Stock underlying
such Company Stock Option Award; _provided_ , that Parent may, in its sole
discretion, cause the Exchange Agent, on behalf of the Surviving Corporation,
to make the payments described in this _Section 2.09(a)_ rather than the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders hereof, each Company RSU Award and Company Performance
Share Award that is outstanding and (x) is vested as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, (y) that vests as a result of the consummation of the
Transactions, or (z) that is held by any non-employee member of the Company
Board (a " _Company_

 



-30-   _Vested Award_ "), shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, the
Surviving Corporation shall pay to each former holder of any such cancelled
Company Vested Award as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, but
in no event later than five (5) Business Days thereafter, by a payroll payment
an amount in cash (without interest, and subject to deduction for any required
withholding Tax) equal to the product of (i) the Per Share Cash Value
_multiplied by_ (ii) the number of shares of Company Stock underlying such
Company Vested Award; _provided_ , that Parent may, in its sole discretion,
cause the Exchange Agent, on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, to make the
payments described in this _Section 2.09(b)_ rather than the Surviving
Corporation.

(c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, each Company RSU Award that is outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time and is not a Company Vested Award
shall be assumed by Parent and converted into restricted share units (each,
an " _Adjusted RSU Award_ ") representing the right to receive, on the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company RSU Award, that
number of Parent Common Shares equal to the product of (i) the number of
shares of Company Stock underlying such Company RSU Award immediately prior to
the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (ii) the quotient of (A) the Per Share Cash
Value divided by (B) the Parent Average Closing Price (the " _Equity Award
Exchange Ratio_ "), with any fractional shares rounded down to the nearest
lower whole number of shares. Except as specifically provided above, following
the Effective Time, each Adjusted RSU Award shall continue to be governed by
the terms and conditions applicable to the corresponding Company RSU Award

the part of the holders thereof, each Company Performance Share Award that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is not a Company
Vested Award shall be assumed by Parent and converted into performance shares
(each, an " _Adjusted Performance Share Award_ ") representing the right to
receive, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
Company Performance Share Award, that number of Parent Common Shares equal to
the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Stock underlying such
Company Performance Share Award immediately prior to the Effective Time
(which shall be 100% of the target number of shares of Company Stock set forth
in the applicable award agreement governing the Company Performance Share
Award) _multiplied by_  (ii) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with any
fractional shares rounded down to the nearest lower whole number of shares.
Except as specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each
Adjusted Performance Share Award shall continue to be governed by the terms
and conditions applicable to the corresponding Company Performance Share Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including all time-based vesting
conditions; _provided_ , that each Adjusted Performance Share Award shall
only be subject to time-based vesting provisions following the Effective Time.
The number of Parent Common Shares underlying any such Adjusted Performance
Share Award will be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements
of Section 409A of the Code.

Time, no holder of a Company Stock Option Award, Company RSU Award or Company
Performance Share Award or any participant in a Company Plan or other employee
benefit arrangement of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or under any
employment agreement, shall have any right hereunder to acquire any capital
stock or other equity interests (including any "phantom" stock or stock
appreciation rights) in the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 2.10 _Tax Treatment_. The Parties shall treat the payment pursuant to
the Merger of the Company Cash Consideration and any cash portion of the

and shall take no position for U.S. federal income Tax purposes inconsistent
therewith except to the extent otherwise required by a good faith resolution
of a Tax contest.

(a) The Company has filed with or furnished to the SEC (including following
any extensions of time for filing provided by Rule 12b-25 promulgated under
the Exchange Act) all reports, schedules, forms, statements, prospectuses,
registration statements and other documents required to be filed or furnished,
as the case may be, by the Company since December 31, 2013 (collectively,
together with any exhibits and schedules thereto and other information
incorporated therein, the " _Company SEC Documents_ ").

 

(b) As of its filing date (or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of
the most recent amendment or supplement filed prior to the date of this
Agreement), each Company SEC Document complied in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as
the case may be.

(c) As of its filing date (or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of
the most recent amendment or supplement filed prior to the date of this
Agreement), each Company SEC Document filed or furnished pursuant to the
Exchange Act did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading in any material respect.

(d) Each Company SEC Document that is a registration statement, as amended or
supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the Securities Act, as of the
date such registration statement or amendment became effective, and as of the
date of such supplement, did not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in any material
respect.

 

(e) The Company has heretofore furnished or made available to Parent complete
and correct copies of all comment letters from the SEC since December 31,
2013 through the date of this Agreement with respect to any of the Company SEC
Documents, together with all written responses of the Company thereto, to the
extent that such comment letters and written responses are not
publicly available on EDGAR. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC
staff with respect to any of the Company SEC Documents, and, to the Knowledge
of the Company, none of the Company SEC Documents are subject to ongoing SEC
review.

(f) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Such
disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files
or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms,
including controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is
timely accumulated and communicated to the Companys management,

 



-37-  including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure of such
information in the Companys periodic and current reports required under the
Exchange Act. For purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive officer"
and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms
in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The management of the Company has completed an
assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and
procedures as of December 31, 2015, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective as of such date. 

(g) The Company has established and maintains a system of internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) (" _internal controls_ "). Such internal controls are sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Companys
consolidated financial reporting and the preparation of Company consolidated
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and
applicable Law. The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation
of internal controls prior to the date of this Agreement, to the
Companys auditors and audit committee (i) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in internal controls. As of December 31, 2015, neither the
Company nor its auditors had identified any significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses in the Companys internal controls and, as of the date of
this Agreement, to the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has come to the
attention of the Company that has caused the Company to believe that there
are any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in such internal
controls. To the Knowledge of the Company, since December 31, 2015, no
complaints from any source regarding accounting, internal controls
or auditing matters have been received by the Company, which, if the
allegations underlying such complaints were true, would be reasonably likely
to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and the
Company has not received any complaints through the Companys whistleblower
hotline or equivalent system for receipt of employee concerns regarding
possible violations of applicable Law.

 

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has extended or maintained
credit, arranged for the extension of credit, or renewed an extension of
credit, in the form of a personal loan to or for any executive officer (as
defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director of the Company in
violation of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 

(i) The Company is in compliance, and has complied since December 31, 2013, in
each case in all material respects, with the applicable provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(j) Each of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of
the Company (or each former principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the Company, as applicable) have made all certifications
required by Rule 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and
906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley 

 



-38-  Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and the
NASDAQ, and the statements contained in any such certifications are complete
and correct in all material respects.

 

(k) Since the Company Balance Sheet Date, there has been no transaction, or
series of similar transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings,
nor is there any proposed transaction as of the date of this Agreement, or
series of similar transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries was or is to be a party, that
would be required to be disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K

Documents filed or furnished with the SEC at least one (1) Business Day prior
to the date hereof(but (i) without giving effect to any amendment thereof
filed with, or furnished to the SEC after one (1) Business Day prior to the

applicable representations and warranties would be reasonably apparent to an
individual who has read that disclosure and such representations and
warranties, Parent and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company that:

 

Section 4.01 _Corporate Existence and Power_. Parent is a corporation duly
incorporated and validly existing under the Law of Canada. Merger Sub is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the

each jurisdiction (to the extent the concept of good standing or its
equivalent is applicable under the Laws of such jurisdiction) where such
qualification is necessary, except where any failure to have such power or
authority or to be so qualified would not reasonably be expected, individually
or in the aggregate, (i) to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (ii) to
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent to
perform its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the
Transactions. Prior to the date of this Agreement, Parent has made available
to the Company true and complete copies of the organizational documents of

except for the required approval of Merger Sub Parent as the sole stockholder
of Merger Sub, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of Parent and Merger Sub, except for the required approval of the

applicable requirements of the HSR Act and any non-U.S. Competition Law, (c)
compliance with any applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the

Section 4.06 _SEC Filings and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act_.

 

(a) Parent has filed with or furnished to the SEC (including following any
extensions of time for filing provided by Rule 12b-25 promulgated under the
Exchange Act) all reports, schedules, forms, statements, prospectuses,
registration statements and other documents required to be filed or furnished,
as the case may be, by Parent since December 31, 2013 (collectively, together
with any exhibits and schedules thereto and other information incorporated
therein, the " _Parent SEC Documents_ ").

(b) As of its filing date (or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of
the most recent amendment or supplement filed prior to the date of this
Agreement), each Parent SEC Document complied in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
as the case may be.

 

(c) As of its filing date (or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of
the most recent amendment or supplement filed prior to the date of this
Agreement), each Parent SEC Document filed or furnished pursuant to the
Exchange Act did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading in any material respect.

(d) Each Parent SEC Document that is a registration statement, as amended or
supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the Securities Act, as of the
date such registration statement or amendment became effective, and as of the
date of such supplement, did not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state

 



-59-  any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading in any material respect.

 

(e) Parent has heretofore furnished or made available to the Company complete
and correct copies of all comment letters from the SEC since December 31,
2013 through the date of this Agreement with respect to any of the Parent SEC
Documents, together with all written responses of Parent thereto, to the
extent that such comment letters and written responses are not
publicly available on EDGAR. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC
staff with respect to any of the Parent SEC Documents, and, to the Knowledge
of the Parent, none of the Parent SEC Documents are subject to ongoing SEC
review.

(f) Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure
controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by Parent in reports that it files or submits under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, including controls and
procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and
communicated to Parents management, including its principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure of such information in Parents
periodic and current reports required under the Exchange Act. The
management of Parent has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of
Parents disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2015, and such
assessment concluded that such controls were effective as of such date.

 

(g) Parent has established and maintains a system of internal control over
financial reporting sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of Parents consolidated financial reporting and the preparation
of Parents consolidated financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP and applicable Law. Parent has disclosed, based on
its most recent evaluation of internal controls prior to the date of this
Agreement, to Parents auditors and audit committee (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in internal controls. As of December 31, 2015,
neither Parent nor its auditors had identified any significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses in Parents internal controls and, as of the date of this
Agreement, to the Knowledge of Parent, nothing has come to the attention of
Parent that has caused Parent to believe that there are any material
weaknesses or significant deficiencies in such internal controls. To the
Knowledge of Parent, since December 31, 2015, no complaints from any source
regarding accounting, internal controls or auditing matters have been received
by Parent, which, if the allegations underlying such complaints were true,
would be reasonably likely to be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, and Parent has not received any complaints

 



-60-  through Parents whistleblower hotline or equivalent system for receipt of
employee concerns regarding possible violations of applicable Law.

 

(h) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has extended or maintained
credit, arranged for the extension of credit, or renewed an extension of
credit, in the form of a personal loan to or for any executive officer (as
defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director of Parent in
violation of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 

(i) Parent is in compliance, and has complied since December 31, 2013, in each
case in all material respects, with (i) the applicable provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate governance
rules and regulations of the NASDAQ.

 

(j) Each of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of
Parent (or each former principal executive officer and principal financial
officer of Parent, as applicable) have made all certifications required by
Rule 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the
SEC and the NASDAQ, and the statements contained in any such certifications
are complete and correct in all material respects.

(k) Since the Parent Balance Sheet Date, there has been no transaction, or
series of similar transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings,
nor is there any proposed transaction as of the date of this Agreement, or
series of similar transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings to
which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries was or is to be a party, that would be
required to be disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated under
the Securities Act that has not been disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents
publicly filed or furnished with the SEC following the Parent Balance Sheet
Date.

 

Section 4.07 _Financial Statements_. The audited consolidated financial
statements and unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of Parent
included or incorporated by reference in the Parent SEC Documents (including
all related notes and schedules thereto) (the " _Parent Financial Statements_
") (a) fairly present in all material respects, in conformity with GAAP
(except, in the case of unaudited consolidated interim financial statements,
as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis (except as
may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto), the consolidated financial
position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof
and their consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods
then ended (subject to normal year-end audit adjustments in the case of any
unaudited interim financial statements), (b) comply in all material respects
with the applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (c) have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and except, in the
case of the unaudited interim statements, as may be permitted under Form 10-Q
of the Exchange Act).

 



-61- Section 4.08 _Disclosure Documents_. None of the documents required to be
filed by Parent with the SEC after the date hereof in connection with the
Transactions will, on the date of such filing, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. In furtherance and
not in limitation of the foregoing, and subject to the last sentence of this
_Section 4.08_, none of the information supplied by or on behalf of Parent
or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (a)
the Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement
becomes effective under the Securities Act (or, with respect to any post-
effective amendment or supplement, at the time such post-effective amendment
or supplement becomes effective), contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (b) the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, at the date it is first mailed to the Company
stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this  _Section 4.08_, no representation or warranty
is made by Parent with respect to information or statements made or
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus which were not supplied by or on behalf of Parent or
Merger Sub.

Section 4.09 _Financing_.

 

(a) Assuming the truth and accuracy of the Companys representations and
warranties and compliance by the Company with its covenants and agreements
(in each case solely to the extent that a breach of such representation or
warranty or noncompliance with such covenant or agreement would adversely
affect the satisfaction by Parent of the conditions set forth in the
Commitment Letter) herein and assuming the Debt Financing has been received,
at the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall have available cash
resources and financing in an aggregate amount which, together with the
available cash resources of the Company, are sufficient to enable Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions, to refinance any indebtedness
required to be refinanced in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions, and to pay related fees and expenses. Parent has delivered
to the Company an accurate and complete copy of a fully executed debt
commitment letter (together with all annexes, schedules and exhibits thereto)
from the financial institutions party thereto (collectively, the " _Lenders_
") together with the executed fee letter(s) related thereto of even date
therewith (which fee letter(s) may be redacted so long as no such redaction
covers terms that would adversely affect the aggregate amount, conditionality,
availability, or termination of the debt financing contemplated therein) and
any related exhibits, schedules, annexes, supplements, term sheets or other
agreements (other than fee letters) (collectively, the " _Commitment Letter_
"), pursuant to the terms, but subject to the conditions expressly set forth
therein, of which certain of the Lenders have committed to provide Parent and
Merger Sub with debt financing in the amounts set forth therein for purposes
of partially financing the Transactions (such debt financing or any debt
securities issued in lieu thereof, the " _Debt Financing_ ").

 



-62- (b) The Commitment Letter is, and each definitive agreement with respect to
the Debt Financing (which definitive agreements are referred to collectively
in this Agreement as the " _Definitive Financing Agreements_ ") entered into
after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time (if any),
will be, in each case, a legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of
Parent (to the extent party thereto) and Merger Sub (to the extent party
thereto) and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto in
accordance with their respective terms and subject to: (i) the respective
conditions expressly set forth therein; and (ii) the Enforceability
Limitations. As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letter and the
commitments contained therein have not been withdrawn, modified, terminated
or rescinded in any respect, amended, restated or otherwise modified or waived
(and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no such withdrawal, modification,
termination, amendment, restatement or waiver is contemplated). As of the date
hereof, there are no conditions precedent or contingencies related to the
funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing, other than as expressly set
forth in the Commitment Letter in the form delivered to the Company and
assuming the truth and accuracy of the Companys representations and
warranties and compliance by the Company with its covenants and agreements
herein (in each case solely to the extent that a breach of such representation
or warranty or noncompliance with such covenant or agreement would adversely
affect the satisfaction by Parent of the conditions set forth in the
Commitment Letter), Parent does not have any reason to believe that the
conditions to the Debt Financing will not be satisfied or that the Debt
Financing will not be available to Parent at the Effective Time. As of the
date hereof, there are no, and there are not contemplated to be any, side
letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements related to the funding
or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Debt Financing, other
than any customary engagement letters, fee letters and non-disclosure
agreements that do not impact the conditionality for the Debt Financing to
occur or amount of the Debt Financing.

 

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which would
constitute a breach or default (or an event which with notice or lapse of
time or both would constitute a default), in each case, on the part of Parent
or Merger Sub under the Commitment Letter or which would otherwise result in
any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable. As
of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub is aware of any
material inaccuracies in any of the representations or warranties of Parent or
Merger Sub in the Commitment Letter. To the extent required, Parent has fully
paid all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid prior to the date
of this Agreement pursuant to the Commitment Letter.

Section 4.10 _Absence of Certain Changes_.

Adverse Effect.

 



-63- Section 4.11 _No Undisclosed Material Liabilities_. There are no liabilities
or obligations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that would be required by
GAAP, as in effect on the date hereof, to be reflected on the consolidated

otherwise provided for in the Parent Balance Sheet or in the notes thereto;

deemed to be a representation or warranty regarding the infringement or
misappropriation of the Intellectual Property Rights of any Person, for which
the sole representations and warranties are set forth in _Section 4.14(b)_.

 

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, the conduct of the business of Parent

any software routine designed to disable a computer program automatically
with the passage of time or under the positive control of a Person other than

conditions of all licenses for any Open Source Materials used by Parent and/

employee of Parent or its Subsidiaries who reports directly to the Chief
Executive Officer (in each case, whether current, former or retired) or their
beneficiaries, the consummation of the Transactions will not (either alone or
together with any other event) (i) entitle any such individual (or
beneficiary, as applicable) to severance pay under a material Parent Plan
(ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or
funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits
under any material Parent Plan, (iii) increase the amount payable or

indemnify or otherwise reimburse any officer or director of Parent or its
Subsidiaries or any employee of Parent or its Subsidiaries who reports

or retired) or their beneficiaries for any Tax incurred by such individual

contractually or by operation of law.

Permits.

(c) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, there are no actions,
activities, circumstances, facts, conditions, events or incidents, including

Subsidiaries, or to the Knowledge of Parent, against any Person whose
liability for such Environmental Claims Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has
retained or assumed either contractually or by operation of law.

 

Section 4.18 _Anti-Corruption; Sanctions; Anti-Money Laundering_.

influencing any official act or decision of such Public Official; (ii)
inducing such Public Official to do or omit to do any act in violation of his
lawful duty; or (iii) securing any improper advantage in each case in
violation of applicable anti-corruption Law. No officer or director of Parent

employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, that is not a
director or officer) is a non-U.S. Public Official.

 

(b) In the last five (5) years, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries nor
any director or officer of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries nor, to Parents
Knowledge, (x) any agent or representative of Parent or any of its

in noncompliance with any, been subject to actual, pending, or threatened
civil, criminal or administrative actions, suits, demands, claims, hearings,
written notices of violation, investigations, proceedings, demand

to any Governmental Authority in any way relating to anti-corruption or anti-
money laundering Law or Law related to terrorism financing. Parent has
instituted policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure compliance
by Parent, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives with applicable anti-corruption Law, anti-money laundering Law
and applicable Law related to terrorism financing.

(c) In the last five (5) years, Parent, its Subsidiaries, their respective
directors and officers and, to Parents Knowledge, their respective agents,
representatives and employees acting on their behalf, (i) have complied in all
material respects with all sanctions, export control, anti-boycott, or customs
Laws, and (ii) have not been subject to actual, pending, or threatened civil,
criminal or administrative actions, suits, demands, claims, hearings, written
notices of violation, investigations, proceedings, demand letters, settlements
or enforcement actions or made any voluntary disclosures to any Governmental
Authority relating to material violation of sanctions, export control, anti-
boycott, or customs Laws. Parent has instituted policies and procedures
reasonably designed to ensure material compliance by Parent,
its Subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives
acting on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with applicable
sanctions, export control, anti-boycott, and customs Laws.

 

Section 4.19 _Insurance_. Each of the insurance policies and self- insurance
programs and arrangements relating to the business, assets and operations of
Parent is in full force and effect and are valid and enforceable and cover
against the risks as are customary in all material respects for companies of
similar size in the same or similar lines of business and all premiums due
thereunder have been paid. As of the date of this Agreement, since December
31, 2013, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written
notice regarding any actual or possible: (a) cancellation or invalidation of
any such insurance policy, other than such cancellation or invalidation that
would not constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect; or (b) written notice
of refusal of any coverage or rejection of any claim under any such insurance
policy that if not paid would constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
With respect to each Proceeding that

 



-70-  has been filed or investigation initiated against Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries since December 31, 2013, no insurance carrier has issued a denial
of coverage with respect to any such Proceeding or investigation, or informed
any of Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries of its intent to do so, other than
such denial that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.20 _Finders  Fees, etc._. Except for Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner
and Smith Incorporated, there is no investment banker, broker or finder that
has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries who might be entitled to any fee or commission from Parent or any
of its Affiliates in connection with the Transactions (excluding the Debt
Financing).

Section 4.21 _Ownership of Company Shares; Anti-Takeover Law_. Neither Parent
nor any of its respective Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) "beneficially
owns" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act) any Shares, nor have any
of them during the past three years "owned" any Shares within the meaning
of Section 203 of the DGCL. Parent is not subject to any "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share acquisition," "interested stockholder," "business
combination" or similar restriction set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL or,
to the Knowledge of Parent, set forth in any other Law, that would apply to
the Transactions.

 

Section 4.22 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Parent Board has received the
opinion of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, financial
advisor to Parent, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and
based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the
Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Shares pursuant to this
Agreement is fair to Parent from a financial point of view, and a copy of such
opinion will be delivered to the Company concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement for informational purposes.

 

Section 4.23 _No Additional Representations_. Except for the representations
and warranties expressly made by the Company in  _ARTICLE 3_, each of Parent
and Merger Sub acknowledges that neither the Company nor any other Person
makes, and that neither Parent nor Merger Sub have relied upon, any express or
implied representation or warranty whatsoever and specifically (but without
limiting the foregoing), that neither the Company nor any Representative of
the Company makes, nor has either Parent or Merger Sub relied upon, any
representation or warranty with respect to (a) the Company or
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, operations, assets,
liabilities, conditions (financial or otherwise), prospects or any other
matter relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries or (b) any documentation,
forecasts, budgets, projections, estimates or other information (including
the accuracy or completeness of, or the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying, such documentation, forecasts, budgets, projections, estimates or
other information) provided by the Company or any Representative of the
Company, including in any "data rooms" or management presentations.

Proposal is not withdrawn or (B) there has been a Company Intervening Event;
(II) in the case of a Company Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board
concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Company Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal; and (III) the Company Board
concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel, that the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , none of the Company, the Company
Board or any committee thereof shall make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change and/or authorize the Company to enter into any Alternative Company
Acquisition Agreement _unless_ :

 

(i) the Company Board provides Parent at least five (5) days prior written
notice of its intention to take such action (it being understood that the
delivery of such notice and any amendment or update thereto and the
determination to so deliver such notice, update or amendment shall not, by
itself, constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change), which notice
shall include, as applicable, (A) the information with respect to the Company
Superior Proposal that is specified in _Section 5.02(c)_, as well as a copy
of such Company Acquisition Proposal and any related Alternative Company
Acquisition Agreement, or (B) the facts and circumstances in reasonable
detail of the Company Intervening Event;

 



-78- (ii) during the five (5) days following such written notice described in the
foregoing clause (i) (or such shorter period as is specified in this _Section
5.02(b)_ below), the Company Board and its Representatives have negotiated in
good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding
any revisions to the terms of this Agreement that may, at Parents sole
discretion, be proposed by Parent in response to such Company Superior
Proposal or Company Intervening Event, as applicable; and

 

(iii) at the end of the five (5) day period described in the foregoing clause
(i) (or such shorter period as specified in this  _Section 5.02(b)_ below),
the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisors (and taking into
account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement
proposed and irrevocably committed to in writing by Parent and capable of
acceptance by the Company), that, as applicable (A) the Company Acquisition
Proposal continues to be a Company Superior Proposal or (B) the
Company Intervening Event continues to warrant a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and, in each case, that the failure to make such Company
Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties
of the Company Board under applicable Law.

Any amendment or modification to the conditionality, price or form of
consideration of any Company Superior Proposal will be deemed to be a new
Company Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this _Section 5.02_, and the
Company shall promptly (but in any event within 24 hours of occurrence) notify
Parent of any such new Company Acquisition Proposal and the Parties shall
comply with the provisions of this _Section 5.02(b)_ with respect thereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the "matching period" set forth above shall in
such circumstance expire on the later of three (3) days after the Company
Board provides written notice of such new Company Acquisition Proposal to
Parent and the end of the original five (5) day period described in clause
(ii) above; _provided_ , _further_ , (x) whether or not there is a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with _Section 9.01_, the Company Board shall submit this Agreement
for approval by the Company stockholders at the Company Stockholders
Meeting; and (y) in the event there is a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change made in compliance with this _Section 5.02(b)_ with respect to a
Company Superior Proposal, the Company shall only enter into an Alternative
Company Acquisition Agreement with respect thereto by terminating this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.01(h)_.

(c) In addition to the obligations of Parent and the Company set forth in
_Section 5.02(a)_ and _Section 5.02(b)_, the Company (i) shall promptly (and
in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent in writing of any inquiries,
proposals or offers with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal that are
received by, or any non-public information with regard to such Company
Acquisition Proposal is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are
sought to be initiated regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal with, the
Company (or any of its Representatives), indicating, in connection with such
notice, the identity of the Person or group of Persons making the inquiry,
proposal or offer and the material terms and conditions of any such
inquiries, proposals or offers (and

 



-79-  providing copies of all related written inquiries, proposals or offers,
including proposed agreements) and (ii) thereafter shall keep Parent
reasonably informed, on a reasonably prompt basis (and, in any event, within
24 hours) of the status of any material discussions or negotiations with
respect to any such inquiries, proposal or offers and the details of any
material changes to the status and material terms of any such
inquiries, proposals or offers (including any material amendments thereto or
any change to the scope or material terms or conditions thereof, and including
copies of any written inquiries, proposals or offers, including proposed
agreements and material modifications thereto).

Section 5.03 _Company Stockholders Meeting_. The Company shall duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Company
Stockholders Meeting_ ") as promptly as practicable after the date the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act (except
as provided in this  _Section 5.03_) for the purpose of voting on the
approval and adoption of this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL. In
connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall (i)
subject to _Section 5.02(b)_, recommend approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Transactions by the Companys stockholders in the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and (ii) otherwise comply with all legal
requirements applicable to such meeting. Subject to  _Section 5.02(b)_, the
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders
proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and take all other actions
reasonably necessary or advisable to secure the adoption of this Agreement by
the Companys stockholders. The Company shall keep Parent and Merger Sub
reasonably updated with respect to proxy solicitation results as reasonably
requested by Parent or Merger Sub, and shall direct its proxy
soliciting agent to provide Parent and its Representatives with the results
of all proxy tabulations provided by such proxy soliciting agent to the
Company. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ , _however_
, the Company shall have the right to adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting: (i) after consultation with Parent, for not more than
two (2) periods not to exceed ten (10) Business Days each if on the date on
which the Company Stockholders Meeting is then-scheduled, the Company has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of Shares to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval; (ii) if on the date on which the Company
Stockholders Meeting is then-scheduled, there are insufficient Shares
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting; or (iii) after
consultation with Parent, if the failure to adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting would reasonably be expected to be a violation of
applicable Law for the distribution of any required amendment or supplement to
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be timely provided to the holders of
Shares. Once the Company has established a record date for the Company
Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or
establish a different record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting
without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), unless required to do so by applicable Law or the
Companys organizational documents. Without the prior written consent of
Parent, the adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions (including the
Merger) and compensation matters related to the Transactions shall be the only
matters (other than matters of procedure and matters required by
applicable Law to be voted on by the

 



-80-  Companys stockholders in connection with the approval of this Agreement and
the Transactions) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the
stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting. Regardless
of whether there is a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company
Stockholders Meeting shall be held in accordance with the terms hereof unless
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with  _ARTICLE 9_.

Section 5.04 _Company ESPP and Compensation Arrangements_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Company shall take such actions as are necessary to suspend
the Company ESPP and all amounts then credited to the accounts of participants
in the Company ESPP which have not been used to purchase Shares prior to the
date of this Agreement shall be returned to such participants (without
interest thereon, except as otherwise required by applicable Law) as soon as
practicable and in accordance with Section 11.1 of the Company ESPP and, prior
to the Closing, the Company shall take such actions as are necessary to
terminate the Company ESPP effective as of no later than immediately prior to
the Closing.

(b) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Effective Time, the Company and the Company Board (or an appropriate
committee of non-employee directors thereof) shall take such actions
(including adopting a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of
the SEC) as are required to cause the disposition of Shares, Company Stock
Option Awards, Company RSU Awards and Company Performance Share Awards and in
connection with the Transactions by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company, to be, to the greatest extent reasonably possible under
applicable Law and interpretations of the SEC, exempt from Section 16(b) of
the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the
compensation committee of the Company Board, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of _Section 2.09_.

to obtain and deliver to Parent no later than five (5) Business Days prior to
the Effective Time customary payoff letters with respect to (i) the
satisfaction and release of all of the Company and its Subsidiaries
liabilities and obligations (including all indebtedness for borrowed money,
if any, of the Company and its Subsidiaries outstanding as of the Closing, but
excluding any indemnification obligations that survive termination) under the
Contracts set forth in _Section 5.05_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
(the " _Loan Documents_ "), (ii) the termination of the Loan Documents and
(iii) the release of all Liens held pursuant to or otherwise related to the
Loan Documents.

 

Section 5.06 _Acceleration of Certain Company Stock Option Awards_ , _Company
RSU Awards and Company Performance Share Awards_. The Company shall,

 



-81-  prior to the Effective Time, cancel all Company Stock Option Awards, Company
RSU Awards and Company Performance Share Awards held by any individual
providing services to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who is
considered a "disqualified individual" within the meaning of Code Section
4985, including the individuals listed on _Section 1.01(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedules and all members of the Company Board, or by a member of
such individuals family (as defined in Code Section 267), and in exchange
therefor, pay to each such former holder on the Business Day immediately prior
to the Closing Date (a) in respect of each Company Stock Option Award held by
such former holder, an amount in cash (without interest, and subject to
deduction for any required withholding Tax) equal to the product of (i) the
excess of the Per Share Cash Value over the exercise price per share of
Company Stock underlying such Company Stock Option Award _multiplied by_ (ii)
the number of shares of Company Stock underlying such Company Stock Option
Award; (b) in respect of each Company RSU Award held by such former holder,
an amount in cash (without interest, and subject to deduction for any
required withholding Tax) equal to the product of (i) the Per Share Cash Value
_multiplied by_ (ii) the number of shares of Company Stock underlying such
Company RSU Award; and (c) in respect of each Company Performance Share Award
held by such former holder, an amount in cash (without interest, and subject
to deduction for any required withholding Tax) equal to the product of (i) the
Per Share Cash Value _multiplied by_ (ii) the number of shares of Company
Stock underlying such Company Performance Share Award (which shall be 100% of
the target number of shares of Company Stock set forth in the applicable award
agreement governing the Company Performance Share Award).

Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnishing to any Person (other than the Company,

Parent or destroyed any confidential information that has been provided to
any Person during any such communications, discussions or negotiations
occurring in the six (6) months prior to the date of this Agreement. From and
after the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the Effective
Time or the date of termination of this Agreement in accordance with _ARTICLE
9_, Parent shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor
shall it authorize or knowingly permit any of its Representatives to (and
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause such Persons not to), directly or
indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of

_Alternative Parent Acquisition Agreement_ "), (D) enter into, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Parent

_however_ , if, prior to the receipt of the Parent Shareholder Approval,
following the receipt of a bona fide written Parent Acquisition Proposal that
the Parent Board determines in good faith, after consultation with Parents
outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, is or could reasonably
be expected to lead to a Parent Superior Proposal and that was not solicited
in violation of this  _Section 6.03(a)_ and made after the date of this
Agreement, Parent may, in response to such Parent Acquisition Proposal, and
subject to compliance with _Section 6.03(b)_, furnish information with
respect to Parent to the Person making such

 



-86-  Parent Acquisition Proposal and engage in discussions or negotiations with
such Person regarding such Parent Acquisition Proposal _;_ _provided_ , that
(1) prior to furnishing, or causing to be furnished, any such nonpublic
information relating to Parent to such Person, Parent enters into a
confidentiality agreement with the Person making such Parent Acquisition
Proposal (an " _Acceptable Parent Confidentiality Agreement_ ") that (x) does
not contain any provision that would prevent Parent from complying with its
obligation to provide any disclosure to the Company required pursuant to this
_Section 6.03_ and (y) contains provisions that in the aggregate are no less
restrictive on such Person than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement as in effect immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement
(provided, that such agreement does not need to contain any provision
prohibiting (including, any direct or indirect "standstill" or similar
provisions that prohibit) the making of any Parent Acquisition Proposal), and
(2) promptly (but in any event within 24 hours) following furnishing any such
nonpublic information to such Person, Parent furnishes such nonpublic
information to the Company (to the extent such nonpublic information has not
been previously so furnished to the Company or its Representatives).

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to the
receipt of the Parent Shareholder Approval, the Parent Board may effect a
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change if (and only if): (I) (A) a written
Parent Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited in violation of _Section
6.03(a)_ is made to Parent by a Third Party and such Parent
Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn or (B) there has been a Parent
Intervening Event; (II) in the case of a Parent Acquisition Proposal, the
Parent Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with Parents outside
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Parent Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal; and (III) the Parent Board
concludes in good faith, after consultation with Parents outside legal
counsel, that the failure to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change
would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Parent Board under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , none of Parent, the Parent Board or
any committee thereof shall make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change
and/or authorize Parent to enter into any Alternative Parent Acquisition
Agreement _unless_ :

(i) the Parent Board provides the Company at least five (5) days prior
written notice of its intention to take such action (it being understood that
the delivery of such notice and any amendment or update thereto and the
determination to so deliver such notice, update or amendment shall not, by
itself, constitute a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change), which notice shall
include, as applicable, (A) the information with respect to the Parent
Superior Proposal that is specified in  _Section 6.03(b)_, as well as a copy
of such Parent Acquisition Proposal and any related Alternative Parent
Acquisition Agreement, or (B) the facts and circumstances in reasonable detail
of the Parent Intervening Event;

 

(ii) during the five (5) days following such written notice described in the
foregoing clause (i) (or such shorter period as is specified in this _Section
6.03(b)_ below), the Parent Board and its Representatives have negotiated in
good faith with the Company (to the extent the Company desires to negotiate)
regarding any revisions to the terms of this Agreement that may, at the
Companys sole discretion, be

 



-87-  proposed by the Company in response to such Parent Superior Proposal or
Parent Intervening Event, as applicable; and

 

(iii) at the end of the five (5) day period described in the foregoing clause
(i) (or such shorter period as specified in this  _Section 6.03(b)_ below),
the Parent Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with Parents
outside legal counsel and financial advisors (and taking into account any
adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed and
irrevocably committed to in writing by the Company and capable of acceptance
by Parent), that, as applicable (A) the Parent Acquisition Proposal continues
to be a Parent Superior Proposal or (B) the Parent Intervening
Event continues to warrant a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change and, in
each case, that the failure to make such Parent Adverse Recommendation Change
would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Parent Board to
Parent under applicable Law.

Any amendment or modification to the conditionality, price or form of
consideration of any Parent Superior Proposal will be deemed to be a
new Parent Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this _Section 6.03_, and
Parent shall promptly (but in any event within 24 hours of occurrence) notify
the Company of any such new Parent Acquisition Proposal and the Parties shall
comply with the provisions of this _Section 6.03(b)_ with respect thereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the "matching period" set forth above shall in
such circumstance expire on the later of three (3) days after the
Parent Board provides written notice of such new Parent Acquisition Proposal
to the Company and the end of the original five (5) day period described in
clause (ii) above; _provided_ , _further_ , (x) whether or not there is a
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with _Section 9.01_, the Parent Board shall submit
the Parent Share Issuance for approval by the Parent shareholders at the
Parent Shareholders Meeting; and (y) in the event there is a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change made in compliance with this _Section 6.03_ with
respect to a Parent Superior Proposal, Parent shall only enter into an
Alternative Parent Acquisition Agreement with respect thereto by terminating
this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.01(h)_.

(c) In addition to the obligations of Parent and the Company set forth in
_Section 6.03(a)_ and _Section 6.03(b)_, Parent shall promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours) notify the Company in writing of any inquiries,
proposals or offers with respect to a Parent Acquisition Proposal that are
received by, or any non-public information with regard to such Parent
Acquisition Proposal is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are

Section 6.04 _Parent Shareholders Meeting_. Parent shall duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a special and annual meeting of its shareholders
(the " _Parent Shareholders Meeting_ ") as promptly as practicable after the
date the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act
(except as provided in this _Section 6.04_) for the purpose of voting on the
approval of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Shares as part of the
Merger Consideration (the " _Parent Share Issuance_ ") and the approval of
such other matters to be considered at an annual meeting of Parents
shareholders. In connection with the Parent Shareholders Meeting, Parent shall
(i) subject to _Section 6.03(b)_, recommend approval of the Parent Share
Issuance by the Parents shareholders in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
and (ii) otherwise comply with all legal requirements applicable to such
meeting. Subject to _Section 6.03(b)_, Parent will use its reasonable best
efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of the approval of
the Parent Share Issuance and take all other actions reasonably necessary or
advisable to secure the approval of the Parent Share Issuance. Parent shall
keep the Company reasonably updated with respect to proxy solicitation results
as reasonably requested by the Company, and shall direct its proxy soliciting
agent to provide Company and its Representatives with the results of all proxy
tabulations provided by such proxy soliciting agent to the Parent. Parent
shall not, without the prior written consent of Company, adjourn or postpone
the Parent Shareholders Meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , Parent shall have
the right to adjourn or postpone the Parent Shareholders Meeting: (i) after
consultation with Company, for not more than two (2) periods not to exceed
ten (10) Business Days each if on the date on which the Parent Shareholders
Meeting is then-scheduled, Parent has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of Parent Common Shares to obtain the Parent Shareholder
Approval; (ii) if on the date on which the Parent Shareholders Meeting is
then-scheduled, there are insufficient Parent Common Shares represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct
the business of the Parent Shareholders Meeting; or (iii) after consultation
with the Company, if the failure to adjourn or postpone the Parent
Shareholders Meeting would reasonably be expected to be a violation of
applicable Law for the distribution of any required amendment or supplement
to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be timely provided to the holders
of Parent Common Shares. Once Parent has established a record date for the
Parent Shareholders Meeting, Parent shall not change such record date or
establish a different record date for the Parent Shareholders Meeting without
the prior written consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), unless required to do so by applicable Law or the
Parents organizational documents. Regardless of whether there is a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change, the Parent Shareholders Meeting shall be held
in accordance with the terms hereof unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with _Article 9_.

Section 6.05 _Approval by Sole Stockholder of Merger Sub_.
Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Parties hereto, Merger Sub Parent, as sole stockholder of Merger Sub, shall
adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger and the other Transactions, in
accordance with the DGCL, by written consent.

 



-89- Section 6.06 _Director and Officer Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub agree that all
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of each
former and present director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and each person who served as a director, officer, member,
trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise if such service
was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (each, together with such persons heirs, executors or
administrators, a " _Company Indemnified Party_ "), against all claims,
losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees,
costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in
connection with any Proceeding or investigation with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including this
Agreement and the Transactions), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that
the Company Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request or for the
benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer,
member, trustee or fiduciary of another Person, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time as provided in their respective
certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational
documents) as in effect on the date of this Agreement or in any agreement to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, shall be assumed by
the Surviving Corporation and shall survive the Merger and continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms, and Parent shall cause
Surviving Corporation to comply with all such terms. For a period of no less
than six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, shall cause the certificates of incorporation
and bylaws and comparable organizational documents of the Surviving
Corporation and each Subsidiary of the Company (or such documents of any
successor to the business of the Surviving Corporation) to contain provisions
regarding exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses that are at
least as favorable as the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses provisions contained in the certificate of incorporation, bylaws and
comparable organizational documents of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
during such six-year period shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any
such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any individual who immediately prior the Effective Time was a
Company Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , all rights to
indemnification in respect of any actual or threatened Proceeding made within
such period shall continue until the disposition of such Proceeding or
resolution of such Proceeding. 

(b) For a period of no less than six (6) years after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause Surviving Corporation to,
indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of the foregoing)
each Company Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law against any costs or expenses, judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened Proceeding arising out of or
pertaining to the fact that the Company Indemnified Party is or was an officer
or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at
the request of,

 



-90-  or for the benefit of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director,
officer, member, trustee, or fiduciary of another Person, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation
shall use reasonable best efforts to assist in the defense of such matter with
the Company Indemnified Party in the defense of any such Proceeding;
_provided_ , _however_ , the Surviving Corporation shall only be required to
indemnify and hold harmless, or advance expenses to, a Company Indemnified
Party if and to the same extent such Company Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification or advancement as of the date of this Agreement by
the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to (i) the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of the
Company or the applicable Subsidiary of the Company or (ii) any
indemnification agreement between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
such Company Indemnified Party.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and fully pay the
premiums for a non-cancellable extension of the directors and officers
liability coverage of the Companys existing directors and officers
insurance policies and the Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance
policies (collectively, the " _D andO Insurance_"), in each case for a claims
reporting or discovery period of up to six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or
prior to the Effective Time from the Companys current DandO Insurance carriers
or one or more insurance carriers with the same or better credit rating as the
Companys current DandO Insurance carriers with respect to directors and
officers insurance policies in an amount and scope at least as favorable as
the DandO Insurance.

(d) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties,
rights and other assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent
shall cause the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, to succeed to or assume the applicable obligations of such Party
set forth in this _Section 6.06_.

(e) The provisions of this  _Section 6.06_ shall survive consummation of the
Merger, are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each indemnified or insured person hereunder (including the Company
Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives (who
shall, for the avoidance of doubt, be deemed third-party beneficiaries of this
Agreement for purposes of this _Section 6.06)_ and are in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution
that any such person may have by Contract, at Law or otherwise.

Section 6.07 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Parent Common Shares to be issued pursuant to this
Agreement to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ, subject to official notice
of issuance, and the TSX, subject to satisfaction of customary listing
conditions of the TSX, prior to the Effective Time.

 



-91- Section 6.08 _Employee Matters_. (a) For a period of at least one
(1)-year following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to, provide each employee of
the Company and its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Parent or its
Subsidiaries (including, for the avoidance of doubt the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries) immediately following the Effective Time (individually a
" _Continuing Employee_ " and collectively the " _Continuing Employees_ ")
with (i) base salary (or wages) and cash bonus opportunities (excluding any
equity compensation) that are no less favorable than the base salaries and
cash bonus opportunities (excluding any equity compensation) provided by the
Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii)
pension and welfare benefits (excluding defined benefit pension and retiree
health) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided by the
Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(iii) severance benefits that are no less favorable than those provided by the
Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) Parent further agrees that, from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries
to, grant all of the Continuing Employees credit for any service with the
Company or its Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor entity to
the extent such service is taken into account under the applicable plan of
the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time) earned prior to
the Effective Time and with Parent, the Surviving Corporation, and any of
their Subsidiaries or Affiliates on and after the Effective Time, (i) for
eligibility and vesting purposes and (ii) for purposes of accrued vacation or
paid time-off severance benefit determinations, and level of benefits under
any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement (except
with respect to benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan) that
may be established or that is maintained by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries on or after the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , such service shall not be recognized or credited to
the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits
provided to the Continuing Employee or to the extent that such service was not
recognized under any similar Company Plan. Without limiting the
foregoing, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause to be waived any
pre-existing conditions or limitations, exclusions, waiting periods and
required physical examinations under any welfare benefit plan maintained by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
which the Continuing Employees (or their eligible dependents) will be eligible
to participate from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent
that such pre-existing conditions or limitations, exclusions, waiting periods
or required physical examinations would not have been satisfied or waived
under the comparable Company Plan in which the Continuing Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall recognize,
or use reasonable best efforts to cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of
all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Continuing
Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in
which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such years
deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit
plans in which the Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents)
will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

 



-92- (c) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, with respect to
any Continuing Employees who (i) are based outside of the United States,
Parents obligations under this _Section 6.08_ shall be in addition to, but
not in contravention of, any obligations under the Law of the non-U.S.
countries and political subdivisions thereof in which such Continuing
Employees are based, and (ii) are covered by a Collective Bargaining
Agreement, Parents obligations under this _Section 6.08_ shall (A) be in
addition to, but not in contravention of, the terms and conditions of
employment for such Continuing Employees as set forth in such Collective
Bargaining Agreement until its expiration, modification or termination in
accordance with its terms and applicable Law and (B) apply only to the extent
permitted by applicable labor Law.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the
consummation of the Merger will constitute a "Change in Control" or "Change of
Control" (or similar term), as applicable, within the meaning of (i) each of
the Companys Change of Control Severance Agreements set forth on _Section
6.08(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter as entered into with those employees
of the Company set forth on _Section 6.08(d)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, (ii) the Companys Executive Severance Plan set forth on _Section
6.08(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, (iii) the Polycom, Inc. 2004 Equity
Incentive Plan, Polycom, Inc. 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, and Vivu, Inc. 2008
Equity Incentive Plan, and each agreement governing the awards granted under
such plans, and (iv) such plans, programs, agreements or other arrangements
set forth on _Section 6.08(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.08_, expressed or implied, shall (i)
be treated as the establishment, amendment or modification of any Company
Plan or Parent Plan or constitute a limitation on rights to amend, modify,
merge or terminate after the Effective Time any Company Plan or Parent Plan,
(ii) give any current or former employee, director or other independent
contractor of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof), or any labor organization, union, works council, employee
association, trade union, other similar employee representative body,
any third-party beneficiary or other rights under this Agreement or otherwise
or (iii) obligate Parent or any of its Affiliates to (A) maintain any
particular Company Plan or Parent Plan or (B) retain the employment or
services of any current or former employee, director or other independent
contractor of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

Section 6.09 _Company Stock Based Plans_. Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to take such actions as are necessary for the assumption and
conversion of Company RSU Awards to Adjusted RSU Awards pursuant to _Section
2.09(c)_ and the assumption and conversion of Company Performance Share
Awards to Adjusted Performance Share Awards pursuant to _Section 2.09(d)_,
including the reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Common Shares as is
necessary. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall prepare and file with
the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or similar successor form), or a
post-effective amendment to a registration statement previously filed under
the Securities Act, with respect to the Parent Common Shares subject to the
Adjusted RSU Awards and Adjusted Performance Share Awards. With respect to
those individuals, if any, who, subsequent to the Effective Time, will be
subject to the reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act, where

 



-93-  applicable, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to administer any
Adjusted RSU Awards and Adjusted Performance Share Awards in a manner that
complies with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent
any such Adjusted RSU Award or Adjusted Performance Share Award, as
applicable, complied with such rule prior to the Merger.

Party in connection with the Transactions; (ii) shall use reasonable best
efforts to obtain each consent (if any) required to be obtained (pursuant to
any applicable Law or Contract, request by a Governmental Authority

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement (and in
any event within 30 days of the date of this Agreement), Parent shall prepare
(with the Companys reasonable cooperation) and file with the SEC the
Registration Statement, including the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Each
of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that
the Registration Statement, including the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
complies as to form in all material respects with the rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act and the Securities Act and with
all other applicable Law (including any applicable Canadian securities Laws).
The Company shall ensure that the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus includes:
(i) the opinion of the financial advisor referred to in _Section 3.21_; and

Subject to _Section 7.02(d)_ and _Section 5.02_, the Joint Proxy

 



-96-  Statement/Prospectus shall include (i) a statement to the effect that the
Company Board has determined that this Agreement and the Merger are advisable

including any rules and regulations promulgated by the OSC. Parent and the
Company shall make all necessary filings with respect to the Merger and
the Transactions under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and any
necessary state or Canadian securities Laws or "blue sky" notice requirements
in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Shares. As promptly as
practicable after the Registration Statement shall have become effective,
each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to its stockholders or
shareholders, as applicable.

 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish all information concerning
such Party and its Affiliates to the other, and provide such
other assistance, as may be reasonably requested by such other Party and
shall otherwise reasonably assist and cooperate with the other in the
preparation, filing and distribution of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
the Registration Statement, and the resolution of any comments to either
received from the SEC or the OSC. If at any time prior to the later of the
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval and Parent Shareholder Approval,
any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by the Company or
Parent which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
either the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
so that either such document would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the Party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Party and an appropriate amendment
or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and, with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

(c) The Parties shall notify each other promptly of the receipt of any
comments, whether written or oral, from the SEC or the staff of the SEC (or
from the OSC or the staff of the OSC) and of any request by the SEC or the
staff of the SEC (or from the OSC or the staff of the OSC) for amendments or
supplements to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration
Statement or for additional information and shall supply each other with
copies of (A) all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on
the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC (or the OSC or the staff of
the OSC), on the other hand, with respect to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, or the Registration Statement and (B) all stop orders of
the SEC (or of the OSC) relating to the Registration Statement. Each Party
shall give the other Party and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
participate in preparing the proposed

 



-97-  response by such Party to comments received from the SEC (or from the OSC)
or its staff and to provide comments on any proposed response thereto, and
such Party shall give reasonable consideration to any such comments. Each
Party shall use reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to any comments of
the SEC (or of the OSC) or their respective staff with respect to the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement, as applicable.

(d) No amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Registration Statement will be made by Parent or the Company without the
approval of the other Parties, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , that the Company, in connection
with a Company Adverse Recommendation Change made in compliance with the
terms hereof may (and Parent shall comply with any request by the Company to)
amend or supplement the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (including by
incorporation by reference) pursuant to an amendment or supplement (including
by incorporation by reference) to the extent it contains (i) a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, (ii) a statement of the reason of the Company
Board for making such a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, and (iii)
additional information reasonably related to the foregoing; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Parent, in connection with a Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change made in compliance with the terms hereof may (and the Company shall
comply with any request by Parent to) amend or supplement the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (including by incorporation by reference) pursuant to an
amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to the
extent it contains (i) a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, (ii) a
statement of the reason of the Parent Board for making such a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change, and (iii) additional information reasonably related to
the foregoing. Notwithstanding a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the
Company shall nonetheless submit this Agreement to the Company stockholders
for approval and adoption, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with _ARTICLE 9_. Notwithstanding a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change,
Parent shall nonetheless submit this Agreement to the Parent shareholders for
approval and adoption, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
_ARTICLE 9_.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may elect, by notice to the Company
within 10 days after the date hereof, to include all of the information
related to a Parent Shareholders Meeting, including Parent Shareholder
Approval, in a proxy circular of Parent in conformity with applicable Canadian
securities Laws instead of in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, but which
will otherwise be subject to the provisions of this _Section 7.02_, mutatis
mutandis, including the timing and the consultation provisions thereof.

 

Section 7.03 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) to,
use reasonable best efforts (taking into account the expected timing of the
Marketing Period) to take all actions and to do or cause to be done all things
necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing on
the terms and

 



-98-  conditions described in the Commitment Letter (including as described in
_Section 7.03(b)(ii)_; _provided_ , _however_ , Parent may (x) amend the
Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities who had not executed the Commitment Letter as of
the date of this Agreement or (y) otherwise replace or amend the Commitment
Letter so long as such action would not reasonably be expected to delay or
hinder the Closing and the terms are not materially less beneficial to Parent,
with respect to conditionality, than those in the Commitment Letter as in
effect on the date of this Agreement. Parent shall not permit any amendment
or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision under, the
Commitment Letter without the prior written consent of the Company (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if such amendment,
supplement, modification or waiver:

(i) reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by
increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount as
compared to such fees and original issue discount contemplated by the
Commitment Letter and related fee letters (including pursuant to any "flex"
provisions thereof) in effect on the date hereof unless the Debt Financing is
increased by such amount);

(ii) (A) imposes new or additional conditions or (B) otherwise adversely
expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions precedent to the Debt
Financing, or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any other provision of the
Commitment Letter, in each case of this subsection (ii), in a manner that
would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay, hinder or
prevent the ability of Parent to consummate the Closing or in a manner that
would cause the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing
less likely to occur; or

 

(iii) would otherwise materially adversely impact the ability of Parent to
enforce its rights against other parties to the Commitment Letter or
otherwise to timely consummate the Transactions.

Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company complete executed copies of any
such amendment, modification, waiver or replacement. For purposes of this
Agreement, references to "Debt Financing" shall include the financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter as permitted to be amended, modified or
replaced by this  _Section 7.03(a)_ or _Section 7.03(c)_ and references to
"Commitment Letter" shall include such documents as permitted to be amended,
modified or replaced by this _Section 7.03(a)_ or  _Section 7.03(c)_.

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) to,
use reasonable best efforts to:

(i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter in accordance with its terms;

 

(ii) negotiate and enter into Definitive Financing Agreements with respect to
the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions contained in the Commitment
Letter (including the "flex" provisions contained in any related fee

 



-99-  letter) or on other terms in the aggregate materially no less favorable to
Parent, as to conditionality, than the terms and conditions in the Commitment
Letter (including the "flex" provisions contained in any related fee letter)
as promptly as practicable after the date hereof but in no event later than
the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , in no event shall any such Definitive
Financing Agreement contain terms (other than those included in the
Commitment Letter) that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay, hinder or prevent the Closing;

 

(iii) satisfy (or, if deemed advisable by Parent, seek the waiver of) on a
timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent that are within its control
as set forth in the Commitment Letter and to comply with all of its
obligations pursuant to the Commitment Letter;

(iv) if all of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE 8_ have been satisfied
or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waived (other than those that by their
nature can only be satisfied on the Closing Date, but subject to the
satisfaction of such conditions on the Closing Date or waiver by the Party
entitled to waive such conditions), (A) cause the funding of the Debt
Financing at or prior to the Closing (together with other sources of funds,
with respect to amounts required to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration and
the cash portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration and to consummate the
Transactions); and (B) otherwise enforce its rights under the Commitment
Letter;

 

(v) take each of the actions required of the Company and its Subsidiaries in
_Section 7.03(d)_ below (but not the proviso at the end thereof) with
respect to itself and its Affiliates as necessary; and

(vi) (A) give the Company prompt notice of any material breach (or material
breach threatened in writing) by any party to the Commitment Letter of which
Parent has become aware or any termination of the Commitment Letter and (B)
otherwise keep the Company reasonably and promptly informed of the status of
its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing (or any Alternate Financing);
_provided_ that in no event shall Parent be under any obligation to disclose
information that would waive the protection of attorney-client privilege if
such party shall have used reasonable best efforts to disclose such
information in a way that would not waive such privilege. Without limiting the
foregoing, Parent agrees to notify the Company promptly if at any time any
Lender notifies Parent that such source no longer intends to provide
financing on the terms set forth therein.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing contained
in this _Section 7.03_ shall require, and in no event shall the reasonable
best efforts of Parent be deemed or construed to require, Parent or any
Affiliate thereof to pay any fees in excess of those contemplated by
the Commitment Letter (including pursuant to the "flex" provisions contained
in any fee letter relating to the Debt Financing).

(c) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter or the Commitment Letter

 



-100-  is terminated or modified in a manner materially adverse to Parent for any
reason, Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing and shall use
reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from
alternative sources for such portion as promptly as practicable following such
event on terms no less favorable to Parent in any material respect as those
contained in the Commitment Letter and in an amount sufficient, together with
cash, if any, on hand of the Parent and its Subsidiaries and the Company, to
fund the aggregate Cash Consideration and to consummate the Transactions (the
" _Alternate Financing_ ") and, if obtained, will provide the Company with a
copy of, a new financing commitment that provides for at least the same amount
of financing as provided under the Commitment Letter originally issued, to the
extent needed to fund the aggregate Cash Consideration and any other
cash portion of the Merger Consideration, to consummate the Transactions, to
refinance any indebtedness required to be refinanced in connection herewith
and to pay related fees and expenses, and on terms and conditions (including
all terms, termination rights, flex provisions and funding conditions) not
materially less favorable in the aggregate to Parent than those included in
the Commitment Letter (an " _Alternate Commitment Letter_ "). Parent shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) to, use reasonable
best efforts (taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period)
to take all actions and things necessary, proper or advisable to comply with
the terms of _Section 7.03(a)_ as though the references therein to
Commitment Letter and Debt Financing were instead references to the Alternate
Commitment Letter and the Alternate Financing, respectively. Parent and Merger
Sub shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts
(taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) to take all
actions and things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange promptly and
consummate the Alternate Financing on the terms and conditions described in
any Alternate Commitment Letter, including by complying with its obligations
under _Section 7.03(b)_ as though the references therein to Commitment Letter
and Debt Financing were instead references to the Alternate Commitment Letter
and the Alternate Financing, respectively.

(d) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, use its and their reasonable best efforts to provide, and
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to
use reasonable best efforts to provide, Parent such cooperation as may be
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing or the
Alternate Financing. Such cooperation shall include:

(i) as promptly as reasonably practical, (x) furnishing Parent and the
Lenders and their respective Representatives with the Required Information and

of any facts that would likely require the restatement of such financial
statements for such financial statements to comply with GAAP;

(ii) participating in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road
shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating
agencies in connection with the Debt Financing and assisting Parent in
obtaining ratings as contemplated by the Debt Financing;

presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank

documents required in connection with the Debt Financing, including the
execution and delivery of customary representation letters in connection with
bank information memoranda to be included in offering documents contemplated
by the Debt Financing;

(iv) using reasonable best efforts to cause its independent auditors to
provide, consistent with customary practice, (A) consent to offering

Companys consolidated financial information and their reports thereon, in
each case, to the extent such consent is required, (B) reasonable assistance
in the preparation of pro forma financial statements by Parent, (C) customary

be included in any offering documents; _provided_ , that Parent shall have
provided the Company with information relating to the proposed debt and
equity capitalization that is required for such pro forma financial
information in financial reports;

(vi) using reasonable best efforts to provide (x) monthly financial
statements (excluding footnotes) within fifteen (15) Business Days of the end

Leases, rights of way and other encumbrances and the Company Material
Contracts as of the Closing;

(ix) using reasonable best efforts to permit the Lenders involved in the Debt
Financing to evaluate the Companys and its Subsidiaries current assets, cash

-102-  assist with other reasonable and customary collateral audits and due
diligence examinations);

 

(x) taking all corporate actions reasonably requested by Parent that are
necessary or customary to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing and

of its Subsidiaries, if any (not needed for other purposes), to be made
available at the Closing to consummate the Transactions; and

 

(xi) providing all documentation and other information about the Company and
its Subsidiaries as is required by applicable "know your customer" and anti-
money laundering rules and regulations, including the PATRIOT Act and the
Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (Canada) to
the extent reasonably requested at least five (5) Business Days prior to the
anticipated Effective Time;

_provided_ , _however_ , (w) no obligation of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any Lien on any of their respective assets, in connection
with the Debt Financing or the Alternate Financing shall be effective until
the Effective Time; none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
Representatives of any of the foregoing shall be required to pay any

required to execute any agreement, certificate, document or instrument with
respect to the Debt Financing or the Alternate Financing that would be
effective prior to the Effective Time; (y) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action contemplated by this
_Section 7.03(c)_ that, in the good faith determination of the Company, would
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (z) neither the Company
nor its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide any information or take any
action that will conflict with or violate its organizational documents or
applicable Law, or would result in a violation or breach or default under any
agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or which
would result in the waiver of a legal privilege ( _provided_  that in the
event that the Company or any other Subsidiary thereof does not provide any
information in reliance on this clause (z), the Company or such Subsidiary (as
applicable) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide notice to
the Parent promptly upon obtaining knowledge that such information is being
withheld, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to communicate, to the
extent permitted, the applicable information in a way that would not have such
an effect and to eliminate such restrictions).

confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except that
Parent and Merger Sub will be permitted to disclose such information (i) as is

their respective counsel and auditors) in each case so long as such Persons
are subject to confidentiality undertakings customary for financings of the
same type as such Debt Financing or Alternate Financing.

 

(f) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to periodically update any
Required Information provided to Parent as may be necessary so that such
Required Information is (i) Compliant and (ii) meets the applicable
requirements set forth in the definition of "Required Information" and (iii)
would not, after giving effect to such update(s), result in the Marketing
Period to cease to be deemed to have commenced. For the avoidance of doubt,
Parent may, to most effectively access the financing markets, require (subject
to the qualifications included in _Section 7.03(d)_) the cooperation of the
Company under _Section 7.03(d)_ at any time, and from time to time and on
multiple occasions, between the date hereof and the Closing.

 

(g) The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos
in connection with the Debt Financing or Alternate Financing; _provided_ ,
that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or
reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company and its Subsidiaries or the
reputation or goodwill of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

(h) Parent shall promptly, at any time from and after the termination of this
Agreement, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket

except (A) information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Company and
its Subsidiaries for use therein and (B) to the extent arising from the
willful misconduct, gross negligence, fraud or intentional misrepresentation

shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, their
obligations hereunder, including their obligations to consummate the Closing,
are not subject to, or conditioned on, receipt of any Debt Financing or
Alternate Financing.

 



-104- (k) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Companys
breach of any of its covenants required to be performed by it under this
_Section 7.03_ will not be considered in determining the satisfaction of the
conditions in _Section 8.02(b)_ unless such breach results in, or is a cause
of, Parent being unable to obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing or
Alternate Financing prior to or at the Closing.

Section 7.04 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect
to the execution of this Agreement and the Transactions shall be a joint press

consult with the other Party before (a) participating in any media
interviews, (b) engaging in meetings or calls with analysts, institutional
investors or other similar Persons or (c) providing any statements (including

the contents of prior Public Statements which have been previously approved by
both Parent and the Company. In addition, Parent and the Company (unless the
Company Board has made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or the Parent
Board has made a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change) agree to cause their
respective directors and executive officers to refrain from taking any
position in any such Public Statement that is, without limiting the
obligations set forth in  _Section 6.02_, (x) contrary to the positions
previously taken by Parent and the Company with respect to this Agreement and
the Transactions, including the Merger, or (y) reasonably likely to have a
significant, adverse impact on the ability of the Parties to consummate the
Transactions. None of the limitations set forth in this _Section 7.04_ shall
apply to any disclosure of any information concerning this Agreement or the
Transactions (i) required by applicable Law or Order; or (ii) in connection
with any dispute among the Parties regarding this Agreement or the
Transactions.

_Section 7.05_ shall not (i) affect or be deemed to modify any
representation, warranty, covenant, right, remedy, or condition to any
obligation of any Party or (ii) update any section of the Company Disclosure
Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter.

restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the
extent that: (i) any applicable Law requires such Party to restrict or
otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information; (ii) access to
such documents or information would waive any attorney-client privilege, work

any Company Acquisition Proposal or Parent Acquisition Proposal, as the case
may be; _provided_ , that, in the case of each of clauses (i), (ii) and

efforts to cause the documents or information that are subject to
such restriction or prohibition to be provided in a manner that would not
reasonably be expected to violate such restriction or prohibition.

_Section 7.06_ shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business of the Party providing such access

by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to the Repatriation
Loans (including with respect to the repayment thereof pursuant to the
immediately preceding proviso) or the Repatriation Distributions, including
any such Taxes, costs, expenses and losses with respect to additional amounts
received pursuant to this sentence, and including losses attributable to the
utilization by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any Tax assets or
attributes in connection with any of the foregoing, such that the Company and
its Subsidiaries are in the same after-Tax position as if no actions pursuant
to any Repatriation Notice had been taken and no indemnification payments had
been received.

Section 7.13 _Section 7874 Matters_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither (i) a
change or proposed change in Section 7874 of the Code, Section 4985 of the
Code, or any similar provision of any applicable Tax law or a change in or
issuance of, or proposed change in or issuance of, any rules or regulations
promulgated thereunder or official interpretations thereof (a " _Tax Law
Change_ "), or any event, development, occurrence, consequence, circumstance,
state of facts or change resulting from such Tax Law Change, nor (ii) a
decline in the trading price of a Parent Common Share that, taking into
account the Share Consideration and, to the extent provided under Section 7874
and

 



-109-  the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and official
interpretations thereof, the Cash Consideration and such other facts,
circumstances, transactions and events as required thereby, would result in
Parent being treated as a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as of the Effective Time (each of clauses (i) and (ii), a " _Section
7874 Event_ ") shall constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect, Company
Intervening Event, Parent Material Adverse Effect, or Parent Intervening
Event, nor shall the Company or Parent have any right to avoid or delay
Closing or terminate this Agreement as a result of such Section 7874 Event.

 

(b) If there is a Section 7874 Event that would result in Parent being treated
as a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes as of the
Effective Time, then the Company shall consider in good faith any changes
reasonably proposed in writing by Parent to the structure of the transaction
or to the structure of the Company and its Subsidiaries that would avoid
or materially reduce the adverse consequences to Parent and its Affiliates
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company and its Subsidiaries) of
such Section 7874 Event (each, a " _Restructuring Action_ "). To the
extent that, after such good faith consideration, the Company agrees to any
such Restructuring Action, then the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use
commercially reasonable efforts (in the manner reasonably requested in writing
by Parent) to implement such Restructuring Action. Notwithstanding the
foregoing:

(i) with respect to any Restructuring Action proposed by Parent
entailing changes in the structure of the transaction, the Company shall in
no event be obligated to consider or agree to any changes which would: (A)
decrease the aggregate value of the Merger Consideration, (B) increase the
conditionality of the Merger or (C) have any other adverse consequences to
the stockholders of the Company, or to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
relative to consequences of the Merger and the Transactions in the absence of
such Restructuring Action, including any consequences during the pendency of
the Merger; and

(ii) with respect to any Restructuring Action proposed by Parent entailing
changes in the structure of the Company and its Subsidiaries, no change shall
be required to be made to the extent that such change would be subject to
withholding or other Taxes and such withholding or other Taxes would be
required to be paid over to the relevant Governmental Authority in advance of
the Effective Time or at any time if the Effective Time does not occur because
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.01, unless Parent shall
have agreed in writing to indemnify the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to any such Taxes and other reasonable related costs, expenses and
losses incurred, including any such Taxes, costs, expenses and losses with
respect to additional amounts received pursuant to this sentence, and
including losses attributable to the utilization by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries of any Tax assets or attributes in connection with any of the
foregoing, such that the Company and its Subsidiaries are in the same after-
Tax position as if no Restructuring Action had been taken and no
indemnification payment had been received.

Section 10.01 _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any schedule,
certificate, instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement
shall survive the Effective Time. This _Section 10.01_ shall not limit
_Section 9.02_, _Section 9.03_ or any covenant or agreement of the Parties
which by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time.

Section 10.02 _Amendment and Modification_. Subject to applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented in any and all respects,
whether before or after any vote of the stockholders of the Company
contemplated hereby, by written agreement of the Parties hereto at any time
prior to the Closing Date with respect to any of the terms contained herein;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, there shall be no amendment or waiver that would require the
further approval of the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law
without such approval having first been obtained; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that after the receipt of the Parent Shareholder Approval, there shall be
no amendment or waiver that would require the further approval of the
shareholders of the Parent under applicable Law without such approval having
first been obtained; _provided_ , _further_ , no amendments or other
modifications to or waivers of any FS Provision shall be effective without
the prior written consent of the Financing Source Parties. A termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01_ or a material amendment or waiver
of this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 10.02_ or _Section 10.03_ shall, in
order to be effective, require, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company, action by their respective board of directors (or a committee
thereof), as applicable.

 

Section 10.03 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the Parties may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c)
subject to the proviso of _Section 10.02_, waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Except as required by
applicable Law, no waiver of this Agreement shall require the approval of the
shareholders or stockholders, as applicable, of any of Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise by any Party of any of its
rights under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such
rights or any other rights under this Agreement.

Section 10.04  _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the Party
incurring such cost or expense. The Company (or the applicable Subsidiary)

or that Parent reasonably notifies the Company in writing are required by
applicable law with respect to all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,

Section 10.06 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each Party shall have received
a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other Parties. Until and unless
each Party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other Parties, this
Agreement shall have no effect and no Party shall have any right or obligation
hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication). The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or
otherwise) by electronic mail transmission (including in portable document
format (pdf) or otherwise) or by facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the
Parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

Section 10.07 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the Exhibits hereto and the documents and the instruments referred
to herein), the Confidentiality Agreement and any agreements entered into
contemporaneously herewith (a) constitute the entire agreement and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , (x) any provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement conflicting
with this Agreement shall be superseded by this Agreement and (y) all
standstill or similar provisions set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement
shall be superseded to the extent necessary to permit Parent and the Company
to make additional proposals under _Section 5.02(b)_ or _Section 6.03(b)_,
respectively, and (b) are not intended to confer any rights, benefits,
remedies, obligations or liabilities upon any Person other than the Parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided_ ,
_however_ , notwithstanding the foregoing clause (b), following the Effective
Time, the provisions of _Section 6.06_ shall be enforceable by each Party
entitled to indemnification hereunder and his or her heirs and his or her
representatives; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Lenders, any arrangers,
investors, potential agents, potential arrangers, potential lenders,
potential investors, underwriters, initial purchasers and placement agents
providing or potentially providing, or acting in connection with, any Debt
Financing, and each of their respective Affiliates and their respective
current, former and future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling
persons, stockholders, agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general or
limited partners, officers, directors, employees, advisors, attorneys or
representatives and each of their respective successors and assigns (each, a
" _Financing Source Party_ ", collectively, the " _Financing Source Parties_
") shall be

 



-122-  express third party beneficiaries with respect to _Section 9.03_, _Section
10.02_, this _Section 10.07_, _Section 10.10_, _Section 10.12_ and 
_Section 10.13_ (collectively, the " _FS Provisions_ ").

Section 10.08 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy,
the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated, so long as the economic and legal substance
of the Transactions, taken as a whole, are not affected in a manner
materially adverse to any Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the
fullest extent possible.

Section 10.09 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties
hereto in whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without
the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void; _provided_ ,
_however_ , Parent may designate, prior to the Effective Time, by written
notice to the Company, another wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary to
be a party to the Merger in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all references
herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other Subsidiary
(except with respect to representations and warranties made herein with
respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement) and all
representations and warranties made herein with respect to Merger Sub as of
the date of this Agreement shall also be made with respect to such other
Subsidiary as of the date of such designation; _provided_ , _further_ , such
assignment shall not relieve Parent of its obligations hereunder or otherwise
enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other Party or due to Parent or
such other Subsidiary. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be
void. This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

 

Section 10.10 _Governing Law; Exclusive Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) Except with respect to the fiduciary duties of the Parent Board, which are
exclusively governed by the CBCA, this Agreement shall be governed and
construed in accordance with the Law of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof or of any other
jurisdiction that would result in the application of the Law of any other
jurisdiction, except that, notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise
set forth in the Commitment Letter as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, any legal suit, action, litigation, proceeding or claim (whether at
law, in equity, in contract, in tort, or otherwise) against any of the
Financing Source Parties shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Law of the State of New York; _provided_ , _however_ ,
with respect to the Commitment Letter: (i) the interpretation of the
definition of Target Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Commitment
Letter) and whether or not a Target Material Adverse Effect has occurred, (ii)
the determination of the accuracy of any Specified Purchase Agreement

 



-123-  Representations (as defined in the Commitment Letter) and whether as a
result of any inaccuracy thereof Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
Affiliates have the right (determined without regard to any notice
requirement) to terminate its obligations under this Agreement, or to decline
to consummate the Transactions and (iii) the determination of whether such
transactions have been consummated in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, in each case, shall be governed by, and construed and
interpreted solely in accordance with, the Law of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to conflicts of law principles that would result in the
application of the Law of any other jurisdiction.

(b) The Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or if that court does not have
jurisdiction, a federal court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware, or if such
federal court does not have jurisdiction, any court of the State of Delaware
having jurisdiction in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the
provisions of this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this
Agreement, and in respect of the Transactions, and hereby waive, and agree not
to assert, as a defense in any Proceeding for the interpretation or
enforcement hereof or thereof, that it is not subject thereto or that such
Proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that
the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such
document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the Parties
irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such Proceeding shall be
heard and determined in such courts. The Parties hereby consent to and grant
any such court jurisdiction over the person of such Parties and over the
subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other
papers in connection with any such Proceeding in the manner provided in
_Section 10.05_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable
Law, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each of the Parties agrees that it will not bring or support any
Proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing Source Party in any
way relating to this Agreement, the Debt Financing or any of the Transactions,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Commitment
Letter or any other letter or agreement related to the Debt Financing or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than any State or Federal court
sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York.

 

(c) Each Party hereby irrevocably consents and agrees, for the benefit of each
other Party, that any legal action, suit or proceeding against it with
respect to the confirmation and/or enforcement of an award rendered in a
Delaware court pursuant hereto (an " _Award_ ") may be brought in the courts
of Ontario or any court in a jurisdiction where the assets of such Party
are located, and hereby irrevocably accepts and submits to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of each such court with respect to any such action, suit or
proceeding to confirm or enforce an Award. Each Party waives any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the
aforesaid actions, suits or proceedings brought in any such court to confirm
an Award and hereby further waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any
such court that any such action or proceeding brought therein has been
brought in an inconvenient forum.

 



-124- Section 10.11 _Remedies; Enforcement_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Each Party agrees that in the
event of any breach or threatened breach by any other Party of any covenant or
obligation contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching Party shall
be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it
whether in law or equity, including, subject to _Section 9.03_, monetary
damages) to obtain (i) a decree or order of specific performance to enforce
the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation and (ii) an
injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach.

(b) Each Party further agrees that (i) it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein
on the basis that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity and (ii) no other Party or any other Person shall be required to
obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or
as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 10.11_,
and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the
obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

 

Section 10.12 _No Recourse; Waiver of Claims_. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, the Company (on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries,
stockholders, Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and Representatives)
hereby waives any rights or claims against any Financing Source Party in
connection with this Agreement, the Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing
(or any Alternate Commitment Letter or Alternate Financing, as applicable),
whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and the Company
(on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, stockholders, Affiliates, officers,
directors, employees and Representatives) agrees not to commence a Proceeding
against any Financing Source Party in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions (including any Proceeding relating to the Debt Financing or the
Commitment Letter (or any Alternate Financing or Alternate Commitment Letter,
as applicable) or the transactions contemplated thereby). In furtherance and
not in limitation of the foregoing waiver, it is agreed that no Financing
Source Party shall have any liability for any claims, losses, settlements,
liabilities, damages, costs, expenses, fines or penalties to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, stockholders, Affiliates, officers, directors,
employees and Representatives in connection with this Agreement or
the Transactions (including the Debt Financing or the Commitment Letter or
the transactions contemplated thereby). Nothing in this _Section 10.12_ shall
in any way (a) expand the circumstances in which Parent may be liable under
this Agreement or as a result of the Transactions (including as a result of
the Debt Financing or Alternate Financing) or (b) limit or qualify the
obligations and liabilities of the parties to the Commitment Letter to each
other thereunder or in connection therewith.

Section 10.13 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY,
INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY

 



-125-  LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS (INCLUDING ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING AGAINST THE FINANCING SOURCE
PARTIES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE TRANSACTIONS, THE COMMITMENT LETTER
(OR ALTERNATE COMMITMENT LETTER), THE DEBT FINANCING (OR ALTERNATE FINANCING)
OR THE PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES WITH RESPECT THERETO).
