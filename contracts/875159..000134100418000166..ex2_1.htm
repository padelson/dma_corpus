ARTICLE III 
  
 EFFECT ON THE SHARE CAPITAL OF THE CONSTITUENT ENTITIES; 
  PAYMENT OF CONSIDERATION

  

Section 3.01 _Effect of Merger on the Share Capital of Merger Sub and the
Company_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the occurrence of the Merger,
and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any
holder of any common shares, par value $0.01 per common share, of the Company
(" _Company Shares_ ") or any shares, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
(" _Merger Sub Shares_ "):

  

(a) _Share Capital of Merger Sub_. Each Merger Sub Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
canceled and converted into and

  

 

 


 

 

  

17   

 


 

 

 

  

become one duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
common share, par value $0.01 per common share, of the Surviving Company.

  

(b) _Cancelation of Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares; Treatment of
Shares Held by Company Subsidiaries_. Each Company Share that is (i) owned by
the Company as treasury shares or (ii) owned by Parent (other than the
Exception Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor nor any repayment of
capital made in respect thereof. Each Company Share held by Merger Sub, any
other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or a wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company (other than the Exception Shares), if any, shall be
converted into a number of shares of the Surviving Company such that each such
entity owns the same percentage of the outstanding shares of the Surviving
Company immediately following the Effective Time as such entity owned of the
Company Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

(c) _Conversion of Company Shares_. Subject to _Section 3.01(b)_ and _Section
3.05_ , each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, excluding Company Restricted Shares, shall automatically be
canceled and converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to $57.60, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). Subject to _Section 3.05_ , as of the Effective Time, all
such Company Shares shall no longer be issued and outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced any Company
Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ ") or uncertificated Company Shares
represented by book-entry immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "
_Book-Entry Share_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration pertaining to the Company
Shares represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, to
be paid in consideration therefor, in accordance with _Section 3.02(b)_
without interest.

  

Section 3.02 _Exchange Fund_.

  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Not less than ten (10) business days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ")
for the payment and delivery of the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to
holders of Company Shares in accordance with this _Article III_ and, in
connection therewith, shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent
prior to the Closing Date in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company.
Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited
with the Paying Agent an amount in cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration payable to holders of Company Shares (such cash, and the cash
referred to in the immediately following sentence, being hereinafter referred
to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Pending its disbursement in accordance with
this _Section 3.02_ , the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent
as directed by Parent in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United
States of America, (ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith and
credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment
of principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated the highest
quality by either Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's
Ratings Services or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements
or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital

  

 

 


 

 

  

18   

 


 

 

 

  

exceeding $5,000,000,000. Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Company to
promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that
the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the
Paying Agent to make all payments to former holders of Company Shares of the
Merger Consideration. No investment losses resulting from investment of the
funds deposited with the Paying Agent shall diminish the rights of any former
holder of Company Shares to receive the Merger Consideration. The Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than the payment to holders of
Company Shares of the Merger Consideration or payment to the Surviving Company
as contemplated in _Section 3.01(c)_.

  

(b) _Letter of Transmittal; Exchange of Company Shares_. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than three (3)
business days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Company or Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate a
form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in such form and have such other
customary provisions as the Surviving Company may specify, subject to the
Company's reasonable approval (to be obtained prior to the Effective Time)),
together with instructions thereto, setting forth, inter alia, the procedures
by which holders of Certificates may receive the Merger Consideration. Upon
the completion of such applicable procedures by a holder and the surrender of
such holder's Certificates, and without any action by any holder of record of
Book-Entry Shares, the Paying Agent shall deliver to such holder (other than
any holder of Company Shares representing Dissenting Shares), (A) in the case
of Book-Entry Shares, a notice of the effectiveness of the Merger and (B) cash
in an amount equal to the number of Company Shares represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Merger Consideration, and such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall forthwith be canceled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is
to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a Certificate
surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (x) the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall have
established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Company that any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder either has been
paid or is not applicable. Until satisfaction of the applicable procedures
contemplated by this _Section 3.02_ and subject to _Section 3.05_ , each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable
with respect to Company Shares pursuant to this _Article III_.

  

(c) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Company, the posting by such Person of a bond, in
such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Surviving
Company shall cause the Paying Agent to pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration.

  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. At any time following the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Company shall be entitled to
require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto) that had been delivered
to the Paying Agent and which has not been disbursed to former holders of

  

 

 


 

 

  

19   

 


 

 

 

  

Company Shares, and thereafter such former holders shall be entitled to look
only to Parent and the Surviving Company for, and Parent and the Surviving
Company shall remain liable for, payment of their claims of the Merger
Consideration. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at
which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the property of Parent or its designee, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

(e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, none of the parties, the Surviving Company or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable state, federal or other abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

  

(f) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. The
Merger Consideration paid in respect of each Company Share in accordance with
the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares previously
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, subject to _Section
3.05_. At the Effective Time, the share transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the share transfer books of the Surviving Company of Company Shares that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after
the Effective Time, the holders of Company Shares formerly represented by
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such underlying Company Shares,
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. Subject to the
last sentence of _Section 3.02(d)_ , if, at any time after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Company for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article
III_.

  

(g) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Company and the Paying Agent
(without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or under any provision of other applicable Tax Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if Parent, the Surviving Company or the Paying
Agent determines that any amount is so required to be deducted and withheld,
(a) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to provide the Company with
written notice of such determination at least ten (10) business days prior to
the Closing Date, and (b) Parent, the Surviving Company and the Paying Agent
shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate in good faith with the Company
to reduce or eliminate the deduction and withholding of such amount and
provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to provide forms or other
documentation that would exempt such amounts from deduction and withholding.
Any amounts that are deducted and withheld from the amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be timely
paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority. To the extent amounts are
so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, the
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding
were made.

Section 3.03 _Company Equity Awards_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any duly-authorized committee thereof administering
the Company Share Plans) shall adopt such resolutions and take such other
actions as may be required to provide the following, effective upon the
Effective Time, subject to _Section 3.02(g)_ :

  

(a) Except as otherwise agreed by Parent and the holder thereof in writing,
each restricted Company Share granted under a Company Share Plan (a " _Company
Restricted Share_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, to the extent not vested, become fully vested, and shall be
canceled and converted into the right to receive a lump-sum amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the Merger Consideration;

  

(b) Except as otherwise agreed by Parent and the holder thereof in writing,
each performance unit award in respect of Company Shares granted under a
Company Share Plan (a " _Company PSU Award_ ") that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, to the extent not vested, become fully
vested, and shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive a lump-
sum amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the Merger
Consideration and (ii) the number of Company Shares subject to such Company
PSU Award; _provided_ that for purposes of determining the number of Company
Shares subject to such Company PSU Award, (1) with respect to any Company PSU
Award with a Performance Period that has been completed as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the number of Company Shares subject to such
Company PSU Award shall be determined based on the actual level of performance
achieved, and (2) with respect to any Company PSU Award with a Performance
Period that has not been completed as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, any applicable performance-based vesting requirements shall be deemed to
be achieved immediately prior to the Effective Time at the target level of
achievement;

  

(c) Except as otherwise agreed by Parent and the holder thereof in writing,
each restricted share unit award in respect of Company Shares granted under a
Company Share Plan (a " _Company RSU Award_ ") that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, to the extent not vested, become fully
vested, and shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive a lump-
sum amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the Merger
Consideration and (ii) the number of Company Shares subject to such Company
RSU Award; and

  

(d) Except as otherwise agreed by Parent and the holder thereof in writing,
each option to purchase Company Shares granted under a Company Share Plan (a "
_Company Stock Option_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, whether vested or unvested, be deemed to be fully vested
and shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive a lump-sum
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the excess, if
any, of (1) the Merger Consideration, over (2) the per share exercise price of
such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (B) the total number of Company
Shares subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ , that any Company Stock Option with an exercise price per
Company Share that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall
be canceled for no consideration.

  

Section 3.04 _Payments with Respect to Company Equity Awards_. Promptly after
the Effective Time (but in any event, no later than thirty (30) days following
the Effective Time), the

  

 

 


 

 

  

21   

 


 

 

 

  

Surviving Company shall pay to the holders of Company Awards, through its
payroll systems, any amounts due, less applicable Tax withholdings, pursuant
to _Section 3.03_ and _Section 6.10(g)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the
extent any such payment would cause an impermissible acceleration event under
Section 409A of the Code (" _Section 409A_ "), such amounts will be paid at
the earliest time such payment would not cause an impermissible acceleration
event under Section 409A.

  

Section 3.05 _Shares of Dissenting Holders_.

  

(a) At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall automatically be
canceled and, unless otherwise required by applicable Law, converted into the
right to receive, the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_ , and
any holder of Dissenting Shares shall, in the event that the fair value of a
Dissenting Share as appraised by the Supreme Court of Bermuda under Section
106(6) of the Bermuda Companies Act (the " _Appraised Fair Value_ ") is
greater than, the Merger Consideration, be entitled to receive such difference
from the Surviving Company by payment made within thirty (30) days after such
Appraised Fair Value is finally determined pursuant to such appraisal
procedure.

  

(b) In the event that a holder fails to exercise, effectively withdraws or
otherwise waives any right to appraisal (each, an " _Appraisal Withdrawal_ "),
such holder shall have no other rights with respect to such Dissenting Shares
other than as contemplated by _Section 3.01_.

  

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) written notice of (A) any demands for
appraisal of Dissenting Shares or Appraisal Withdrawals and any other written
instruments, notices, petitions or other communication received by the Company
in connection with the foregoing and (B) to the extent that the Company has
Knowledge thereof, any applications to the Supreme Court of Bermuda for
appraisal of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares and (ii) to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the opportunity to participate with the Company
in any settlement negotiations and proceedings with respect to any demands for
appraisal under the Bermuda Companies Act. The Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to,
offer to settle or settle any such demands or applications, or waive any
failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or to timely take any
other action to exercise appraisal rights in accordance with the Bermuda
Companies Act. Payment of any amount payable to holders of Dissenting Shares
shall be the obligation of the Surviving Company.

  

Section 3.06 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this _Article
III_ to the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective

recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect such share dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction.

acceleration of vesting) of any amounts of benefits that will be an "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. The Company
and its Subsidiaries are not a party to, and are not otherwise obligated
under, any contract, agreement, plan or arrangement that provides for the
gross-up of a Tax, interest or penalties imposed by Section 409A, 457A or 4999

relating to any such plan that would reasonably be likely to adversely affect
any such approval or good standing.

first sentence of _Section 6.02(a)_ has occurred for purposes of this _Section
6.02(b)_ , the Company's obligation to use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its Representatives to comply with the first sentence of _Section
6.02(a)_ shall be a covenant (without qualification of reasonable best
efforts) to cause its Representatives to comply with clauses (i) and (ii) of
_Section 6.02(a)_ ), then (i) the Company and its Representatives may contact
such Person or group of Persons making the Takeover Proposal solely to clarify
the terms and conditions thereof or to request that any Takeover Proposal made
orally be made in writing and (ii) if the Company Board determines in good
faith after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel
that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to
lead to a Superior Proposal, then the Company and its Representatives may (x)
enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the Person or group of
Persons making the Takeover Proposal and furnish pursuant thereto information
(including non-public information) with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person or group of Persons who has made such Takeover

copies of such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (2) any material non-
public information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is
provided to any Person given such access that was not previously provided to
Parent or its Representatives and (y) after entering into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, engage in or otherwise participate in discussions
or negotiations with the Person or group of Persons making such Takeover
Proposal.

  

(c) The Company shall promptly notify Parent in the event that the Company or

doubt, all information provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.02_ will
be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(d) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (x)(A) withhold
or withdraw the Company Board Recommendation, (B) modify, qualify or amend the
Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent, (C) fail to
include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (D) approve
or publicly endorse or recommend any Takeover Proposal, or refrain from
recommending against any Takeover Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange
offer, within ten (10) business days after the commencement of such tender
offer or exchange offer pursuant to Rule 14d-2 of the Exchange Act or (E) fail
to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within ten (10) business
days after receipt of a written request by Parent to make such public
reaffirmation following the receipt by the Company of a public Takeover
Proposal (other than in the case of a Takeover Proposal in the form of a
tender offer or exchange offer which shall be governed by clause (D)) that has
not been withdrawn; _provided_ , that Parent may make any such request only
once in any ten (10) business day period and only once for each such public
Takeover Proposal and once for each public material amendment to such Takeover
Proposal (any prohibited action described in this clause (x) being referred to
as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (y) authorize, cause or permit
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, amalgamation agreement or other agreement related to
any Takeover Proposal, other than any Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
pursuant to _Section 6.02(b)_ (each, a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, prior to the time the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, the
Company Board may:

  

(i) in response to an Intervening Event, if the Company Board has determined
in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel,
that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, make an Adverse Recommendation Change;
and

  

(ii) in response to a Superior Proposal, if the Company Board has determined
in good faith, after consultation with the Company's financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (A) make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or (B) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)(ii)_ , pay the Company Termination Fee and enter
into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal;

  

 _provided_ that the Company has given Parent at least four (4) business days'
prior written notice (a " _Company Notice_ ") of its intention to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change or cause the Company to terminate the Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)(ii)_ , which notice (I) in the case of an
Intervening Event, specifies the material changes, developments, effects,
circumstances, states of facts or events comprising such Intervening Event and
(II) in the case of a Superior Proposal, discloses (1) the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person or group
of Persons making such Superior Proposal and its or their financing sources,
if applicable, and (2) a copy of the most current version of the Company
Acquisition Agreement (if any) with respect to such Superior Proposal and any
agreement in the Company's possession relating to the financing of such
Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _further_ , that, (X) during such four (4)
business day period (it being understood and agreed that any change to

  

 

 


 

 

  

54   

 


 

 

 

  

the financial or other material terms and conditions of a Superior Proposal
shall require an additional Company Notice to Parent of two (2) business days
running from the date of such notice), the Company shall have, and shall have
caused its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the
extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such commercially reasonable
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the
Company Board to no longer make an Adverse Recommendation Change or a
determination that a Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (Y)
the Company Board shall have determined following the end of such four (4)
business day period (as it may be extended pursuant to this _Section 6.02(d)_
), after considering the results of such negotiations and the revised
proposals made by Parent, if any, after consultation with the Company's
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, (i) that the Superior Proposal
giving rise to such Company Notice continues to be a Superior Proposal or (ii)
that failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in respect of the
applicable Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

  

(e) Nothing in this _Section 6.02_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof from (i)
taking and disclosing to shareholders of the Company a position or
communication contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any
disclosure or communication to shareholders of the Company that the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, is required by the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law or otherwise by applicable Law;
_provided_ that, if any such public disclosure by the Company or the Company
Board contemplated by clause (i) or (ii) above relating to a Takeover Proposal
has the substantive effect of withdrawing, withholding or adversely modifying,
qualifying or amending the Company Board Recommendation or approving or
endorsing a Takeover Proposal and meets the requirements set forth in _Section
6.02(d)_ , such disclosure shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation
Change unless the Company Board reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in
such disclosure (it being understood that any "stop, look or listen"
communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) shall not, in and of itself, be deemed
to be an Adverse Recommendation Change).

  

(f) As used in this _Section 6.02_ , "group" has the meaning ascribed to it in
Rule 13d-5 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  

Section 6.03 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Shareholders Meeting_.

  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, the Company (with the assistance and cooperation of Parent as
reasonably requested by the Company) shall prepare the Proxy Statement and
file it with the SEC. Subject to _Section 6.02_ , the Company Board shall make
the Company Board Recommendation to the holders of Company Shares and shall
include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Parent shall provide to
the Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub as may be
reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the Proxy Statement and
shall otherwise assist and cooperate with the Company in the preparation of
the Proxy Statement and the resolution of any comments thereto received from
the SEC. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement if and to the

  

 

 


 

 

  

55   

 


 

 

 

  

extent such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect. Each of the Company and Parent shall notify the other promptly in
writing after the receipt of any comments from the SEC and of any request by
the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information and shall supply the other with copies of all written
correspondence between such party or any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement.
Each of the Company and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments
received from the SEC concerning the Proxy Statement and to resolve such
comments with the SEC, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to its shareholders as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the resolution of any such comments.
Prior to the filing of the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or any dissemination thereof to the holders of Company Shares, or
responding to any comments from the SEC with respect thereto, the Company
shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose
comments on such document or response, which the Company shall consider in
good faith.

  

(b) Subject to _Section 6.03(_ a), the Company shall take all necessary
actions in accordance with applicable Law, the Company Organizational
Documents and the rules of the New York Stock Exchange and the Bermuda Stock
Exchange, to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
shareholders (including any adjournment, recess, reconvening or postponement
thereof, the " _Company Shareholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining
the Company Shareholder Approval, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement. Subject
to _Section 6.02_ , the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Company Shareholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may, with Parent's consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
adjourn, recess, reconvene or postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting if (x)
the Company reasonably believes that (i) such adjournment, recess, reconvening
or postponement is necessary to ensure that any required supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the holders of Company Shares
within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Shareholders
Meeting, (ii) after consultation with Parent, as of the time for which the
Company Shareholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the
Proxy Statement), (A) there will be an insufficient number of Company Shares
present (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Company Shareholders Meeting or (B) there will be
an insufficient number of proxies to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval
or (iii) such adjournment, recess, reconvening or postponement is required by
Law or a court or other Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction in
connection with any Actions in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions or has been requested by the SEC or its staff or (y) Parent
requests such adjournment, recess, reconvention or postponement. The Company
shall keep Parent updated with reasonable frequency with respect to proxy
solicitation results.

  

(c) Notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement
has been validly terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_ , (i) the
Company shall hold the Company Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of
obtaining approval of the Company Bye-Law Amendment and obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval, and nothing contained herein shall relieve the Company
of such obligation and (ii) the Proxy Statement and any and all accompanying
materials may include appropriate disclosure with respect to such Adverse

  

 

 


 

 

  

56   

 


 

 

 

  

Recommendation Change if and to the extent the Company Board determines after
consultation with outside legal counsel that the failure to include such
disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Laws or otherwise required by applicable Law.

  

Section 6.04 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to

advisable to fulfill all conditions to Closing applicable to such party

each and every impediment under any applicable Law that may be asserted by, or
judgment, decree and order that may be entered with, any Governmental
Authority with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any other Transaction
so as to enable the Closing to occur, in the most expeditious manner
reasonably practicable, including using reasonable best efforts to take any of
the foregoing actions requested by any Governmental Authority, or necessary,
proper or advisable to (i) obtain all Consents of Governmental Authorities
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions and secure the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act,
(ii) resolve any objections that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority
with respect to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby and
(iii) prevent the entry of, and have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned,
any judgment, decree or order of Governmental Authorities that would prevent,
prohibit, restrict or delay the consummation of the Merger or any other
Transaction contemplated hereby.

  

(c) In furtherance of and without limiting the foregoing, (i) Parent shall
file a "Form A" Acquisition of Control with the Insurance Commissioner of the

Insurance Commissioner of the State of Louisiana and a Section 1506 filing
with the Superintendent of Financial Services of the State of New York within

(d) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall consult with one another
with respect to the obtaining of all Consents of Governmental Authorities
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions and each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall keep the others reasonably apprised on a
prompt basis of the status of matters relating to such Consents. Parent and
the Company shall have the right to review in advance and, to the extent
practicable, and subject to any restrictions under applicable Law, each shall
consult the other on, any filing made with, or written materials submitted to,
any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions and each party
agrees to in good faith consider and reasonably accept comments of the other
parties thereon. Parent and the Company shall promptly furnish to each other
copies of all such filings and written materials after their filing or
submission, in each case subject to applicable Laws. Parent and the Company
shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any
Governmental Authority whose Consent is required to consummate the
Transactions, including promptly furnishing each other copies of any written
or electronic communication, and shall promptly advise each other when any
such communication causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any such Consent will not be obtained or that the receipt of
any such Consent will be materially delayed or conditioned. Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to,
permit any of their respective Representatives to participate in any live or
telephonic meeting with any Governmental Authority (other than routine or
ministerial matters) in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry
relating to the Transactions unless it consults with the other party in
advance and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and by such
Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else
contained in this Agreement, no party shall be obligated to provide
information to another party if such party determines, in its reasonable
judgment, that (i) doing so would violate applicable Law or a Contract,
agreement or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third party, jeopardize
the protection of an attorney-client privilege or expose such party to risk of
liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal information (it being
understood that the parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to enable such information to be
furnished or made available to the requesting party or its Representatives
without so jeopardizing privilege or protection, incurring liability or
contravening applicable Law or Contract, agreement or obligation, including by
entering into a customary joint defense agreement or common interest agreement
with the requesting party to the extent such an agreement would preserve the
applicable privilege

  

 

 


 

 

  

58   

 


 

 

 

  

or protection) or (ii) such information is not directly related to the
Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 6.04(d)_ (except for
the immediately preceding sentence) shall not apply with respect to Tax
matters.

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall a party or any of such party's Affiliates be required by a
Governmental Authority to agree to take, or enter into any action, which
action is not conditioned upon the Closing.

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall Parent or any of its Affiliates be required to (and in no event
shall the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company agree to without the prior
written consent of Parent) take any action, including entering into any
consent decree, hold separate order or other arrangement, or to permit or
suffer to exist any material restriction, condition, limitation or requirement
that (when taken together with all other such actions, restrictions,
conditions, limitations and requirements) would have, or would reasonably be
expected to have, a material adverse effect on the business, operations,
results of operations, assets, liabilities or condition (financial or
otherwise) of (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii)
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (provided that for purposes of
determining the foregoing clause (ii), the business, operations, results of
operations, assets, liabilities or condition (financial or otherwise) of
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, shall be deemed to be of the
same scale as those of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole)
(any such action, restriction, condition, limitation or requirement,
individually or together with all other such other actions, restrictions,
conditions, limitations or requirements, a " _Parent Burdensome Condition_ ").

  

Section 6.05 _Transfer Taxes_. Subject to _Section 3.02_ , all share transfer,
real estate transfer, documentary, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes ("
_Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred in connection with the Transactions shall be paid
by Parent or the Surviving Company, and, prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent in preparing, executing and filing any
applicable Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes.

  

Section 6.06 _Public Announcements_. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, shall consult with each other before
issuing, and give each other reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the
Transactions, and shall not (and shall not cause or permit their respective
Subsidiaries or Representatives to) issue any such press release or make any
such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by
applicable Law, court process or the rules and regulations of any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system and except for as
otherwise explicitly provided in _Section 6.02_. The parties agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the Transactions following
execution of this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the
parties. The Company shall not make any internal announcements or other
communications to its employees, customers, brokers or reinsurance providers
with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions without Parent's prior
written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Company may make any
oral or written public or internal announcements, releases or statements
without complying with the foregoing requirements if the substance of such
announcements, releases or statements, was publicly or internally disclosed
and previously subject to the foregoing requirements.

  

 

 


 

 

  

59   

 


 

 

 

  

Section 6.07 _Access to Information_. Subject to applicable Law, upon
reasonable notice, the Company shall afford to Parent and Parent's
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the
Company's officers, employees, agents, properties, books, Contracts and
records and the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent and Parent's
Representatives such information concerning its business, personnel, assets,
liabilities and properties as Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ that
Parent and its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be
obligated to provide such access or information if the Company determines, in
its reasonable judgment, that doing so could violate applicable Law or a
Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third party, waive the
protection of an attorney-client privilege or other legal privilege or expose
the Company to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal
information. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that the Company
does not provide access or information in reliance on the immediately
preceding sentence, it shall provide notice to Parent that it is withholding
such access or information and the basis for such withholding and shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to enable such information to be furnished
or made available to the requesting party or its Representatives without so
jeopardizing privilege or protection, incurring liability or contravening
applicable Law or Contract, agreement or obligation, including by entering
into a customary joint defense agreement or common interest agreement with the
requesting party to the extent such an agreement would preserve the applicable
privilege or protection). All requests for information made pursuant to this
_Section 6.07_ shall be directed to the Person designated by the Company.

  

Section 6.08 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Company to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each
individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective
Time was, a director or officer of the Company, a Subsidiary of the Company or
any other Person in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries owns any
equity interests at the request of the Company (each, together with such
Person's heirs, executors and administrators, an " _Indemnitee_ " and,
collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all claims, liabilities,
losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in
settlement or compromise) and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal
counsel) in connection with any Action (whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on or arising out
of, in whole or in part, (A) the fact that an Indemnitee is or was a director
or officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions by an
Indemnitee in the Indemnitee's capacity as a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the Company
or such Subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the request of the
Company or such Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or
fiduciary of another Person (including any employee benefit plan)), in each
case under clause (A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time
(including any Action relating in whole or in part to the Transactions or
relating to the enforcement of this provision or any other indemnification or
advancement right of any Indemnitee), to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law; _provided_ that no Indemnitee shall be indemnified against any
liability which by virtue of any rule of law attaches to such Indemnitee in
respect of any fraud or dishonesty of which such Indemnitee is guilty in
relation to the Company as finally determined by the Supreme Court of Bermuda;
and (ii)

  

 

 


 

 

  

60   

 


 

 

 

  

assume all obligations of the Company and such Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees
in respect of indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in the
Company Organizational Documents and the Organizational Documents of such
Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement or in any agreement in
existence as of the date of this Agreement providing for indemnification
between the Company and any Indemnitee. Without limiting the foregoing,
Parent, from and after the Effective Time, shall cause, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, the memorandum of association and bye-laws of
the Surviving Company to contain provisions no less favorable to the
Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and
officers and indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this
Agreement in the Company Organizational Documents, which provisions shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, from the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to,
advance any expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) of any
Indemnitee under this _Section 6.08_ (including in connection with enforcing
the indemnity and other obligations referred to in this _Section 6.08_ ) as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ that
the individual to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay
such advances if it shall be finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction that such Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to
this _Section 6.08(a)_.

  

(b) None of Parent or the Surviving Company shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual Action,
litigation, claim or proceeding relating to any acts or omissions covered
under this _Section 6.08_ (each, a " _Claim_ ") for which indemnification has
been sought by an Indemnitee hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or
consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all
liability arising out of such Claim or such Indemnitee otherwise consents in
writing to such settlement, compromise or consent. Each of Parent, the
Surviving Company and the Indemnitees shall cooperate in the defense of any
Claim and shall provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably
requested and furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and
testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

  

(c) For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Company shall maintain in effect the current directors' and
officers' liability insurance of the Company and its Subsidiaries covering
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to
those individuals who are currently (and any additional individuals who prior
to the Effective Time become) covered by the directors' and officers'
liability insurance policies of the Company and its Subsidiaries on terms and
scope with respect to such coverage, and in amount, no less favorable to such
individuals than those of such policies in effect on the date of this
Agreement (or Parent may substitute therefor policies, issued by reputable
insurers, of at least the same coverage with respect to matters existing or
occurring prior to the Effective Time, including a "tail" policy); _provided_
, _however_ , that, if the annual premium for such insurance shall exceed 300%
of the current annual premium (such 300% threshold, the " _Maximum Premium_
"), then Parent shall provide or cause to be provided a policy for the
applicable individuals with the best coverage as shall then be available at an
annual premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium. The Company may prior to
the Effective Time purchase, for an aggregate amount not to exceed the
aggregate Maximum Premium for six

  

 

 


 

 

  

61   

 


 

 

 

  

(6) years, a six-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing
at least substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the
Effective Time, including the Transactions. If such prepaid "tail" policy has
been obtained by the Company, it shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to
obtain insurance pursuant to this _Section 6.08(c)_ and the Surviving Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such policy to be maintained in
full force and effect, for its full term, and to honor all of its obligations
thereunder.

  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.08_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and
his or her Representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such
individual may have under the Company Organizational Documents, by Contract or
otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company under this
_Section 6.08_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this _Section 6.08_
applies unless (x) such termination or modification is required by applicable
Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to
whom this _Section 6.08_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 6.08_ ).

  

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates or amalgamates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving company or entity of such
consolidation, amalgamation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company shall assume all of the obligations
thereof set forth in this _Section 6.08_.

  

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 6.08_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

  

Section 6.09 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to cause dispositions
of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the
Transactions by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company
subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  

Section 6.10 _Employee Matters_.

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time through the end of the calendar year
following the year in which the Effective Time occurs (the " _Continuation
Period_ "), Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Company to
provide, each individual who is employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Company_

  

 

 


 

 

  

62   

 


 

 

 

  

 _Employee_ ") with (i) a base salary or wage rate that is no less than that
provided to such Company Employee by the Company and any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) target annual plus target long-
term incentive compensation opportunity that is substantially similar, in the
aggregate, to the target annual incentive compensation plus target long-term
incentive compensation opportunity provided to such Company Employee by the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding for all purposes any special, one-time or transaction-based
compensation opportunities), it being understood that the form of such
incentives shall be in Parent's discretion, and (iii) other compensation and
employee benefits that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those
provided to such Company Employee by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding annual and long-term
incentives, special, one-time or transaction-based compensation and benefits).
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall provide, or
shall cause the Surviving Company to provide, each Company Employee who
experiences a termination of employment (or has been given notice of a
termination of employment) from Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective Affiliates during the Continuation Period with severance benefits
that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those that would have been
provided to such Company Employee by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
had such termination occurred prior to the Effective Time.

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.10(a)_ , from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to honor
and continue all of the Company's employment, severance, retention,
termination and change-in-control plans, policies, programs, agreements and
arrangements maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as set forth
in _Section 6.10(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, in each case, as in
effect at the Effective Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits
or rights arising as a result of the Transactions (either alone or in
combination with any other event), subject, in each case, to the terms and
conditions of such arrangements.

  

(c) With respect to all employee benefit plans of the Surviving Company and
its Subsidiaries, including any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA) (including any paid time off and severance plans) in which
Company Employees are eligible to participate following the Effective Time
(the " _New Benefit Plans_ "), for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, level of benefits and vesting, each Company Employee's service
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as service with any
predecessor employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent
service with the predecessor employer was recognized by the Company or such
Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with the Surviving Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (or in the case of a transfer of all or substantially all the
assets and business of the Surviving Company, its successors and assigns);
_provided_ , _however_ , that for the avoidance of doubt such service need not
be recognized for purposes of any retiree health or welfare arrangements, any
frozen benefit plan, benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or
to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of
benefits for the same period of service.

  

(d) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.10(a)_ , Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Company to, waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-
existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and
waiting periods under any New Benefit Plan that is a welfare benefit plan in
which Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be

  

 

 


 

 

  

63   

 


 

 

 

  

eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time, except to the
extent that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-
work requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived
under the comparable Company Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time.
With respect to such New Benefit Plans, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Company to, recognize the dollar amount of all co-payments,
deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or
her eligible dependents) prior to the Effective Time during the calendar year
in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such year's
deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans
in which they will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective
Time.

  

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of any Company Plan containing a
definition of "change in control" or "change of control" (or term of similar
import) that relates to the Company, the occurrence of the Closing shall be
deemed to constitute a "change in control" or "change of control" (or such
term of similar import) of the Company under such Company Plan.

  

(f) With respect to any Company Employee whose principal place of employment
is outside of the United States, Parent's obligations under this _Section
6.10_ shall be modified to the extent necessary to comply with applicable Law
of the foreign countries and political subdivisions thereof in which such
Company Employee primarily performs his duties.

  

(g) Except as otherwise agreed by Parent and the holder thereof, subject to
_Section 3.02(g)_ , each restricted cash unit award in respect of Company
Shares (a " _Company RCU Award_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, to the extent not vested, become fully vested, and
shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive a lump-sum amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration
and (ii) the number of Company Shares in respect of the Company RCU Award. The
Company RCU Award shall be paid in accordance with _Section 3.04_.

  

(h) Parent shall honor, in accordance with its terms each deferred cash award
(each, a " _Company DC Award_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and the obligations thereunder, including any rights arising as
a result of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in
combination with any other event, including termination of employment);
_provided_ , that if a Company Employee experiences an Involuntary Termination
within the two-year period immediately following the Effective Time, such
Company Employee shall receive a lump sum cash payment in the amount of his or
her outstanding Company DC Awards no later than thirty (30) days following
such Involuntary Termination (or, to the extent such payment would cause an
impermissible acceleration event under Section 409A, such amounts will be paid
at the earliest time such payment would not cause an impermissible
acceleration event under Section 409A).

  

(i) In the event that the Effective Time occurs prior to the Company paying
annual incentives in respect of its 2018 fiscal year, the Company shall pay to
each eligible participant (each, a " _Company Eligible Participant_ ") in a
Company Plan that is an annual incentive plan (" _2018 AIP_ ") a cash bonus in
respect of calendar year 2018 in an amount equal to the cash bonus amount
payable under the applicable Company Plan based on the actual level of
achievement of the applicable performance criteria, as determined by the
Surviving Company's management

  

 

 


 

 

  

64   

 


 

 

 

  

team in consultation with Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that at the
conclusion of 2018, the 2018 AIP pool shall be funded at the greater of the
target level of performance or the actual level of performance (including,
without limitation, adjustments to account for non-recurring items and any
costs and expenses, in each case to the extent associated with the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement) as determined by the Company (the
" _2018 AIP Pool_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that the aggregate bonus
payments made to all Company Eligible Participants shall be no less than the
amount equal to the 2018 AIP Pool. If a Company Employee experiences a
Qualifying Termination following the Effective Time and prior to the payment
of the bonus (the " _2018 Bonus Amount_ "), such Company Employee shall
receive a lump sum cash bonus equal to such Company's Employee's 2018 Bonus
Amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
from and including January 1, 2018 through and including the date of such
Company Employee's termination of employment, and the denominator of which is
365; _provided_ , _however_ , (1) if the Qualifying Termination occurs during
the fourth calendar quarter of 2018, then the annual bonus shall not be
prorated and shall paid in full and (2) any annual bonus paid pursuant to this
sentence shall not be duplicative of any annual bonus otherwise payable to the
applicable Company Eligible Participant in connection with such Qualifying
Termination pursuant to any Company Plan. Such bonus amounts shall be paid,
less any required withholding Taxes, on or about the date on which the Company
would normally pay annual bonuses in the first calendar quarter of 2019 and in
no event later than March 15, 2019 (or such later date in accordance with
applicable Law).

  

For purposes of this _Section 6.10(i)_ ,

  

" _Qualifying Cause_ " has the meaning of "cause" set forth in the Company
Eligible Participant's employment agreement or the Company's Executive
Severance Benefit Plan (if the Company Eligible Participant is a participant);
otherwise, Qualifying Cause means (a) the conviction of the Company Eligible
Participant of a felony involving moral turpitude or dishonesty, (b) the
Company Eligible Participant, in carrying out his or her duties for the
Employer, has been guilty of (i) gross neglect or (ii) willful misconduct;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any act or failure to act by the Company
Eligible Participant shall not constitute Cause for this purpose if such act
or failure to act was committed, or omitted, by the Company Eligible
Participant in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in the
overall best interests of the Employer, (c) the Company Eligible Participant's
continued willful refusal to obey any appropriate policy or requirement duly
adopted by the Employer and the continuance of such refusal after receipt of
notice or (d) the Company Eligible Participant's sustained failure to perform
the essential duties of the Company Eligible Participant's role after receipt
of notice. The determination of whether the Company Eligible Participant acted
in good faith and that he or she reasonably believed his or her action to be
in the Employer's overall best interest will be in the reasonable judgment of
the Employer.

  

" _Qualifying Good Reason_ " has the meaning of "good reason" set forth in the
Company Eligible Participant's employment agreement or the Company's Executive
Severance Benefit Plan (if the Company Eligible Participant is a participant);
otherwise, Qualifying Good Reason means, unless done with the prior written
consent of the Company Eligible Participant, where notice of termination is
provided as described below (a) a material reduction in the Company Eligible
Participant's annual base salary or target annual bonus or (b) the Employer
requiring the Company Eligible Participant's primary office to be more than
fifty (50) miles from its then

  

 

 


 

 

  

65   

 


 

 

 

  

current location but only if the new office is also more than fifty (50) miles
from the Company Eligible Participant's principal residence; _provided_ that
the Company Eligible Participant must provide written notice of his or her
intention to terminate employment for Qualifying Good Reason to the Employer
within sixty (60) days of having actual knowledge of the events giving rise to
such Qualifying Good Reason, which sets forth in reasonable detail the facts
and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination for Qualifying
Good Reason, the Employer shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of such
notice to remedy the condition, in which case Qualifying Good Reason shall no
longer exist with regard to such condition, and any date of termination for
Qualifying Good Reason shall not be more than one hundred and eighty (180)
days after the Qualifying Good Reason event occurs. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall Qualifying Good Reason exist solely as a result
of the Company ceasing to be an independent publicly held company (including
as a result of a diminution of the applicable Company Eligible Participant's
authorities, duties, responsibilities or line of reporting as a result
thereof), unless such Company Eligible Participant has a contractual right to
such treatment with respect to his or her 2018 Bonus Amount as of the date
hereof pursuant to an employment agreement or as a participant in the
Company's Executive Severance Benefit Plan.

  

" _Qualifying Termination_ " means the termination of a Company Employee's
employment by the Employer without Qualifying Cause or by such Company
Employee for Qualifying Good Reason.

  

(j) The provisions of this _Section 6.10_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this _Section 6.10_ is intended
to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to
any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise and, except as
otherwise explicitly provided for in this Agreement, no current or former
employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for
any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement or have the right
to enforce the provisions hereof. Nothing contained in this Agreement is
intended to prevent Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates
from, after the Effective Time, (i) amending or terminating any of their
benefit plans in accordance with their terms or (ii) terminating the
employment of any Company Employee.

  

Section 6.11 _Notification of Certain Matters; Shareholder Litigation_. During
the period from the date of this Agreement through the earlier of the Closing
and the termination of this Agreement, Parent shall give prompt notice to the
Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, of any Actions
commenced or, to such party's Knowledge, threatened against such party which
relates to this Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement or the Transactions.
Subject to applicable Law, each party shall give the other party the
opportunity to participate, at such other party's sole cost and expense, in
the defense and settlement of any litigation by any shareholder of the Company
against the first party or its directors relating to this Agreement, the
Statutory Merger Agreement or the Transactions, and no such settlement shall
be agreed to without such other party's prior written consent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  

Section 6.12 _Merger Sub Shareholder Approval_. Immediately following the
execution of this Agreement, Parent shall execute and deliver, in accordance
with Section 106 of the Bermuda Companies Act and in its capacity as the sole
shareholder of Merger Sub, a written

  

 

 


 

 

  

66   

 


 

 

 

  

consent approving this Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the
Merger (the " _Merger Sub Shareholder Approval_ ").

  

Section 6.13 _Financing Cooperation; Existing Indebtedness_.

  

(a) Subject to _Section 6.13(c)_ , from and after the date of this Agreement,
and through the earlier of the Closing and the date on which this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_ , if reasonably requested by
Parent, the Company shall provide commercially reasonable cooperation to
Parent and Merger Sub (including providing reasonably available financial and
other information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries for use in
marketing and offering documents and to enable Parent to prepare customary pro
forma financial statements) in the arrangement of any bank debt financing or
any capital markets debt financing for the purposes of financing the payment
of the Merger Consideration and any other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions (collectively, the "
_Debt Financing_ "); _provided_ , however, that no obligation of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries under any definitive documentation relating to such
Debt Financing shall be effective prior to the Closing and any such
obligations shall terminate without liability to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries upon the termination of this Agreement.

  

(b) Subject to _Section 6.13(c)_ , from and after the date of this Agreement,
and through the earlier of the Closing and the date on which this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_ , if reasonably requested by
Parent, the Company shall provide commercially reasonable cooperation to
Parent and Merger Sub in taking such actions as are necessary, proper or
advisable under (x) the indentures listed in item (iii) of Section 4.16 of the
Company Disclosure Letter and (y) the credit agreements listed in _Section
4.03(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (collectively, " _Existing Debt
Documents_ ") in respect of the Transactions, including delivering or causing
a Subsidiary to deliver any such notices, agreements, documents or instruments
necessary, proper or advisable to comply with the terms thereof, including the
delivery of any officer certificates and opinions of counsel required to be
delivered thereunder in connection with the Transactions. If and to the extent
reasonably requested by Parent in writing, the Company shall provide
commercially reasonable cooperation to Parent and Merger Sub in either (A)
arranging for the termination of Existing Debt Documents (and the related
repayment or redemption thereof, or, with respect to outstanding letters of
credit, the cash collateralization thereof or the providing of "backstop"
letters of credit with respect thereto) at the Closing (or such other date
thereafter as agreed to by Parent and the Company), which repayment,
redemption, cash collateralization or providing of "backstop" letters of
credit shall be the sole responsibility of Parent, and the procurement of
customary payoff letters and other customary release documentation in
connection therewith or (B) obtaining any consents required under any Existing
Debt Documents to permit the consummation of the Transactions thereunder and
obtaining any amendments to or other consents under the Existing Debt
Documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent, and in each case, if
reasonably requested by Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, execute and deliver such customary notices, agreements,
documents or instruments necessary in connection therewith.

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.13_ to the contrary, in no
event shall the Company be required in connection with its obligations under
this _Section 6.13_ to (i) incur or agree to incur any out-of-pocket expenses
unless they are promptly reimbursed by Parent,

  

 

 


 

 

  

67   

 


 

 

 

  

(ii) incur or agree to incur any commitment, tender, consent, amendment fee or
any fee similar to any of the foregoing unless Parent provides the funding to

upon the occurrence of the Closing, (v) take any actions that would

Company reasonably believes could (A) violate its or its Subsidiaries'
certificate of incorporation or bye-laws (or comparable documents), (B)
violate any applicable Law, (C) constitute a default or violation under, or
give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any
right or obligation of the Company or its Subsidiaries or to a loss of any
benefit to which the Company or its Subsidiaries is entitled under any
provision of, any Contract, or (D) result in the creation or imposition of any
Lien on any asset of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (vii) waive or amend any
terms of this Agreement, (viii) take any action that could reasonably be

_Article VII_ to fail to be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this
Agreement, (ix) provide access to or disclose information that the Company
determines would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, (x) fund any repayment, redemption, cash
collateralization or provide any "backstop" letters of credit prior to the
Closing or (xi) result in any of the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries'
Representatives incurring any personal liability with respect to any matters
relating to this _Section 6.13_.

  

(d) Parent shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from, against and in respect
of any and all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines,
penalties, costs and expenses (including fees of legal counsel) resulting from
or incurred in connection with the cooperation required pursuant to this
_Section 6.13_ or any information utilized in connection therewith.
Notwithstanding this _Section 6.13_ or anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of the parties hereto agrees that it is not a condition to the
Closing that the Debt Financing, payoff letters, consents, amendments or other
related or similar actions described in this section be obtained.

  

Section 6.14 _Catastrophe Losses_. Following the date of this Agreement, (a)
Parent and the Company agree to discuss in good faith, from time to time, the
purchase of additional ceded reinsurance or other risk mitigation structures
(" _Catastrophe Protection_ ") for the Company and its Subsidiaries, and the
Company agrees to give due consideration to any views and concerns identified
by Parent and its Representatives and (b) the Company will implement
Catastrophe Protection as set forth in Section 6.14 of the Company Disclosure
Letter, assuming the availability of such Catastrophe Protection on
commercially reasonable terms acceptable to Parent. In the event that this
Agreement terminates other than pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(iii)_ , _Section
8.01(c)_ or _Section 8.01(d)(ii)_ , then Parent shall reimburse the Company
for all net costs (including premiums ceded and net recoveries) incurred by

terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, are capable of being satisfied on
that date), then the Walk-Away Date shall automatically be extended to March
5, 2019; _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any party if
the breach by such party of its representations and warranties set forth in
this Agreement or the failure of such party to perform any of its obligations
under this Agreement, including its failure to use its reasonable best efforts
to consummate the Transactions as required by and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, has been a principal cause of or resulted in the
failure of the Merger to be consummated on or prior to such date (it being
understood that Parent and Merger Sub shall be deemed a single party for
purposes of the foregoing proviso);

  

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in _Section 7.01(c)_ shall
be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ , that
the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.01(b)(ii)_ shall have performed in all material respects its obligations
under this Agreement, including to use its reasonable best efforts to prevent
the entry of and to remove such Restraint in accordance with its obligations
under this Agreement (it being understood that Parent and Merger Sub shall be
deemed a single party for purposes of the foregoing proviso); or

  

(iii) if the Company Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the
Company Shareholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof at which a vote on the matter has been taken;

  

(c) by Parent:

  

(i) if the Company shall have breached any of its representations or
warranties or failed to perform any of its obligations or agreements set forth
in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to
the failure of a

  

 

 


 

 

  

71   

 


 

 

 

  

condition set forth in _Section 7.02(a)_ or _Section 7.02(b)_ and (B) is not
reasonably capable of being cured prior to the Walk-Away Date or, if
reasonably capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within thirty
(30) days following receipt by the Company of written notice of such breach or
failure to perform from Parent stating Parent's intention to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(c)(i)_ and the basis for such
termination (or in any event has not been cured by the Walk-Away Date);
_provided_ that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.01(c)(i)_ if Parent or Merger Sub is then in
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements hereunder; or

  

(ii) prior to receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, if (A) the Company
Board shall have effected an Adverse Recommendation Change or (B) there shall
have occurred any Willful Breach of _Section 6.02_ or _Section 6.03_ by the
Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent's right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(c)(ii)(A)_ shall expire ten (10) business
days after the date on which such Adverse Recommendation Change is made in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement; or

  

(d) by the Company:

  

(i) if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached any of its representations or
warranties or failed to perform any of its obligations or agreements set forth
in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.03(a)_ or _Section 7.03(b)_
and (B) is not reasonably capable of being cured prior to the Walk-Away Date
or, if reasonably capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within
thirty (30) days following receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of written notice
of such breach or failure to perform from the Company stating the Company's
intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(d)(i)_
and the basis for such termination (or in any event has not been cured by the
Walk-Away Date); _provided_ that the Company shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(d)(i)_ if the Company
is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements hereunder; or

  

(ii) prior to receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, in connection with
entering into a Company Acquisition Agreement in accordance with clause (ii)
of the second sentence of _Section 6.02(d)_ ; _provided_ that prior to or
concurrently with such termination the Company pays the amounts due under
_Section 8.03_ in accordance with the terms thereof.

  

Section 8.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section 8.01_ , written notice thereof shall be
given to the other party or parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant
to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become
null and void (other than this _Section 8.02_ , _Section 8.03_ and _Article
IX_ , the last sentence of _Section 6.07_ and the last sentence of _Section
6.14_ , all of which shall survive termination of this Agreement), and there
shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or their
respective directors, officers and Affiliates, except (a) as liability may
exist pursuant to the provisions specified in the immediately preceding
parenthetical that survive such termination and (b) subject to _Section 8.03_
, no such termination shall relieve any party from

  

 

 


 

 

  

72   

 


 

 

 

  

liability for any Willful Breach by such party of any provision of this
Agreement or actual fraud by such party (which shall not include constructive
fraud or similar claims).

  

Section 8.03 _Termination Fee_.

  

(a) In the event that:

  

(i) (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.01(c)(i)_ (other than a termination because of a breach of _Section 4.06(b)_
), (B) at any time after the date hereof and prior to the breach giving rise
to Parent's right to terminate under _Section 8.01(c)(i)_ , a Takeover
Proposal shall have been publicly announced or publicly made known to the
holders of Company Shares and not withdrawn at least three (3) business days
prior to such breach and (C) within twelve (12) months after such termination,
the Company either consummates any Takeover Proposal or enters into a
definitive written agreement to consummate any Takeover Proposal and the
Company thereafter consummates any Takeover Proposal (whether or not within
such twelve (12) month period), the Company shall pay to Parent or its
designee the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds within
two (2) business days after the consummation of the Takeover Proposal;
_provided_ that for purposes of this _Section 8.03(a)(i)_ , the references to
"20%" in the definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references
to "50%";

  

(ii) (A) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant
to _Section 8.01(b)(iii)_ , (B) at any time after the date hereof and prior to
the Company Shareholders Meeting, a Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly
announced or publicly made known to the holders of Company Shares and not
publicly withdrawn at least ten (10) business days prior to the Company
Shareholders Meeting and (C) within twelve (12) months after such termination,
the Company either consummates any Takeover Proposal or enters into a
definitive written agreement to consummate any Takeover Proposal and the
Company thereafter consummates any Takeover Proposal (whether or not within
such twelve (12) month period), the Company shall pay to Parent or its
designee the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds within
two (2) business days after the consummation of the Takeover Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Takeover Proposal that is consummated by
the Company does not involve the Person who made the Takeover Proposal
described in clause (B) or an Affiliate of such Person, the amount payable
under this _Section 8.03(a)(ii)_ shall be reduced to fifty percent (50%) of
the Company Termination Fee (the " _Alternate Fee_ "); _provided_ , _further_
, that for purposes of this _Section 8.03(a)(ii)_ , the references to "20%" in
the definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%";

  

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.01(d)(ii)_ , the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to Parent or
its designee by wire transfer of same-day funds simultaneously with such
termination; or

  

(iv) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(c)(ii)_
, the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to Parent or its designee
by wire transfer of same-day funds within two (2) business days after such
termination.

  

 

 


 

 

  

73   

 


 

 

 

  

In no event shall the Company be required to pay (x) the Company Termination
Fee or the Alternate Fee more than once or (y) both of the Company Termination
Fee and the Alternate Fee.

  

(b) Each of the parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section 8.03_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that without
these agreements, the other parties would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to
this _Section 8.03_ , and, in order to obtain the payment, Parent commences an
Action which results in a judgment against the Company for the payment set
forth in this _Section 8.03_ , the Company shall pay Parent for its reasonable
and documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented
attorneys' fees) in connection with such Action, together with interest on
such amount at the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date such
payment was actually received.

  

ARTICLE IX 
  
  MISCELLANEOUS

  

Section 9.01 _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_. This _Article
IX_ and the agreements of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub contained in
_Article III_ , _Section 6.08_ and _Section 6.10_ shall survive the Effective
Time. No other representations, warranties, obligations or agreements in this
Agreement shall survive the Effective Time.

  

Section 9.02 _Amendment or Supplement_.

  

(a) At any time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended or
supplemented in any and all respects, whether before or after receipt of the
Company Shareholder Approval, by written agreement of the parties, by action
taken by the Parent Board and the Company Board; _provided_ , _however_ , that
following receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, there shall be no
amendment or change to the provisions hereof which by applicable Law would
require further approval by the shareholders of the Company without such
approval.

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the provisions
in this _Section 9.02(b)_ , _Section 9.06_ , _Section 9.07(c)_ , _Section
9.09_ and _Section 9.14_ may not be amended in a manner that is material and
adverse to a Financing Source that has committed to provide or arrange Debt
Financing or that has otherwise entered into Financing Documents or its
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, controlling
persons, agents, representatives, successors and assigns without the prior
written consent of such Financing Source.

  

Section 9.03 _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc._ At any time prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and the Company may, subject to applicable Law, (a)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party, (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
acts of the other party or (c) subject to the requirements of applicable Law,
waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements contained
herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive any of such party's
conditions (it being understood that Parent and Merger Sub shall be deemed a
single party for purposes of the foregoing). Notwithstanding

  

 

 


 

 

  

74   

 


 

 

 

  

the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the
part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

  

Section 9.04 _Assignment_.

  

(a) Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or
otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior written consent of the
other parties. No assignment by any party shall relieve such party of any of
its obligations hereunder. Subject to the immediately preceding two sentences,
this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this _Section 9.04_
shall be null and void.

  

(b) Parent may transfer all the shares of Merger Sub to another wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent identified to the Company in writing no later than
twenty-five (25) days after the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that such
transfer shall be completed promptly after such Subsidiary is identified to
the Company and (ii) Parent shall notify the Company promptly in writing after
any such transfer.

  

Section 9.05 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or electronic mail), each of which shall
be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute
one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other parties.

  

Section 9.06 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and
supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among the parties and their Affiliates, or any of them, with respect to
the subject matter hereof. This Agreement is not intended to and shall not
confer upon any Person other than the parties any rights or remedies hereunder
except for (a) if the Effective Time occurs, (i) the right of the holders of
Company Shares to receive the Merger Consideration payable in accordance with
_Article III_ , (ii) the right of the holders of Company Awards and the
holders of Company DC Awards to receive the consideration payable in
accordance with _Article III_ , _Section 6.10(g)_ or _Section 6.10(h)_ , as
applicable, and (iii) the provisions set forth in _Section 6.08_ of this
Agreement and (b) the right of each of the Financing Sources as an express
third party beneficiary of _Section 9.02(b)_ , this _Section 9.06_ , _Section
9.07(c)_ , _Section 9.09_ and _Section 9.14_. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company shall have the right to recover, through an Action brought by the
Company, damages from Parent in the event of a breach of this Agreement by
Parent, in which event the damages recoverable by the Company for itself and
on behalf of the holders of Company Shares and Company Awards shall be
determined by reference to the total amount that would have been recoverable
under the circumstances of such breach by such holders if all such holders
brought an action against Parent and were recognized as third party
beneficiaries hereunder. The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties

  

 

 


 

 

  

75   

 


 

 

 

  

and are for the sole benefit of the parties and may, in certain instances, be
qualified, limited or changed by confidential disclosure letters. Any
inaccuracies in such representations or warranties or failure to perform or
breach of such covenants or agreements are subject to waiver by the parties in
accordance with _Section 9.03_ without notice or liability to any other
Person. In some instances, the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties of
risk associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of
the parties. Consequently, Persons other than the parties may not rely upon
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

  

Section 9.07 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to be
performed entirely within that state, regardless of the laws that might
otherwise govern under any applicable conflict of laws principles, except to
the extent the provisions of the laws of Bermuda are mandatorily applicable to
the Merger.

  

(b) All Actions arising out of or relating to the interpretation and
enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and in respect of the
Transactions (except to the extent any such proceeding mandatorily must be
brought in Bermuda) shall be heard and determined in the Delaware Court of
Chancery, or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of
Delaware, or, if both the Delaware Court of Chancery and the federal courts
within the State of Delaware decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any other state court within the State of Delaware, and, in each case,
any appellate court therefrom. The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts in any such Actions and
irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum or lack of jurisdiction
to the maintenance of any such Action. The consents to jurisdiction and venue
set forth in this _Section 9.07(b)_ shall not constitute general consents to
service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any
purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer
rights on any Person other than the parties. Each party agrees that service of
process upon such party in any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement shall be effective if notice is given by overnight courier at the
address set forth in _Section 9.10_ of this Agreement. The parties agree that
a final judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in the
foregoing shall restrict any party's rights to seek any post-judgment relief
regarding, or any appeal from, a final trial court judgment.

  

(c) Without in any way limiting any other provision relating to the Financing
Sources and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties
hereto acknowledge and irrevocably agree (i) that any claim, action or
proceeding, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or tort or
otherwise, brought against the Financing Sources arising out of or related to
the transactions contemplated hereby, the Debt Financing or the performance of
services thereunder or related thereto shall be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Tribunal de

  

 

 


 

 

  

76   

 


 

 

 

  

Commerce de Paris and (ii) that any such claim, action or proceeding shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of France.

  

Section 9.08 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
for which monetary relief, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not performed
in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached, including if
the parties fail to take any action required of them hereunder to consummate
this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The
parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the right of the
Company to cause the Merger to be consummated on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement) in the courts described in _Section
9.07(b)_ without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement and (b) the right
of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without
that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this
Agreement. The parties agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any
reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law.
The parties acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section
9.08_ shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction. If, prior to the Walk-Away Date
(or following the Walk-Away Date if, (i) in the case of the Company, the
termination right in _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ is unavailable to Parent or (ii) in
the case of Parent, the termination right in _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ is
unavailable to the Company), any party brings any action, in each case, in
accordance with this _Section 9.08_ , to enforce specifically the performance
of the terms and provisions hereof by any other party, the Walk-Away Date
shall automatically be extended (x) for the period during which such action is
pending, plus ten (10) business days or (y) by such other time period
established by the court presiding over such action, as the case may be.

  

Section 9.09 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY (INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE FINANCING SOURCES). EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER,
(C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN

  

 

 


 

 

  

77   

 


 

 

 

  

INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER
AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.09_.

  

Section 9.10 _Notices_. All notices, requests and other communications to any
party hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered
personally, facsimiled (which is confirmed), emailed (which is confirmed) or

following addresses:

hereafter specify by like notice to the other parties. All such notices,
requests and other communications shall be deemed received on the date of
actual receipt by the recipient thereof if received prior to 5:00 p.m.,
Bermuda time, and such day is a business day in Bermuda. Otherwise, any such
notice, request or communication shall be deemed not to have been received
until the next succeeding business day in the place of receipt.

  

Section 9.11 _Severability_. If any term, condition or other provision of this
Agreement is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any applicable Law or
public policy, all other terms, provisions and conditions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party or such party waives its rights under this _Section 9.11_
with respect thereto. Upon such determination that any term, condition or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties shall negotiate to attempt to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the
Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

  

Section 9.12 _Fees and Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated,
all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement
and the other Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring or required to
incur such fees or expenses, except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement.

  

Section 9.13 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party shall be cumulative with,
and not exclusive of, any other remedy contained in this Agreement, at law or
in equity. The exercise by a party of any one remedy shall not preclude the
exercise by it of any other remedy.

  

Section 9.14 _No Recourse_. None of the Financing Sources shall have any
liability or obligation to the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Debt Financing, whether at
law, or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary of the Company shall have any rights or claims against any of
the Financing Sources hereunder or thereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing shall not limit the rights of the parties to any Financing Document
to enforce such Financing Document in accordance with its terms.
