         THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of
August 24, 2001, is by and among Career Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the "Parent"), CB Merger Sub, Inc., a Georgia corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Parent (the "Merger Sub"), and HeadHunter.NET, Inc., a Georgia
corporation (the "Company").

         WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Parent, the Merger
Sub and the Company have determined that it would be advisable and in the best
interests of their respective stockholders for the Parent to acquire the Company
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

         WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, the Merger Sub will make a
cash tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under
this Agreement, the "Offer") to purchase all of the issued and outstanding
shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Company Common Stock"),
of the Company, including the associated junior participating preferred stock
purchase right (the "Rights" and, together with the Company Common Stock, the
"Shares") issued pursuant to a Shareholder Protection Rights Agreement, dated as
of April 15, 2000, between the Company and American Stock Transfer and Trust
Company, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to the Shareholder Protection Rights
Agreement, dated as of February 27, 2001 (the "Rights Agreement"), at a price of
$9.25 per Share, net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

         WHEREAS, to effectuate such acquisition, following consummation of the
Offer, the Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company
continuing as the surviving corporation in such merger (the "Merger");

         WHEREAS, in connection with such acquisition, the Parent and the Merger
Sub have entered into certain Stockholder Agreements, dated as of the date
hereof (collectively, the "Stockholder Agreements") with certain of the
stockholders of the Company; and

         WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has (i) determined that
the Offer and the Merger are fair to, and in the best interest of, the Company
and its stockholders; (ii) approved this Agreement and the Stockholder
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the
Offer and the Merger, in accordance with the Business Corporation Code of the
State of Georgia (the "GBCC") and (iii) resolved to recommend that the holders
of the Shares accept the Offer and approve this Agreement;

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
Parent, the Merger Sub and the Company agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                              THE CASH TENDER OFFER

         1.1      The Offer.

                  (a)      Commencement of the Offer; Acceptance of Shares.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable
after the date of this Agreement, the Merger Sub shall commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act")), within seven business days of the public announcement of this
Agreement by the Parties, the Offer to purchase any and all outstanding Shares
at a price of $9.25 per Share, net to the seller in cash, without interest
thereon (the "Offer Consideration"). On the terms and subject to the prior
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, the
Merger Sub shall accept for payment all Shares validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as legally permitted to do so under
applicable law and shall pay for all such Shares promptly after acceptance. The
obligation of the Parent and the Merger Sub to commence the Offer and to accept
for payment and pay for Shares validly tendered in the Offer and not properly
withdrawn shall be subject to the condition that there shall be validly tendered
and not withdrawn immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer such number
of Shares that would constitute at least a majority of the Shares that in the
aggregate are outstanding determined on a fully diluted basis (after giving
maximum effect to the exercise of all options, warrants and other rights to
purchase, and the conversion or exchange of all securities convertible or
exchangeable into, Shares outstanding at the expiration date of the Offer,
whether or not vested, exercised or converted at the time of determination) (the
"Minimum Condition") and to the conditions set forth in Annex I to this
Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Offer and this Agreement,
the Merger Sub shall, and the Parent shall cause the Merger Sub to, accept for
payment, and pay for, all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer that the Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment, as soon
as legally permitted to do so under applicable law, after the expiration of the
Offer, and in any event in compliance with the obligations respecting prompt
payment pursuant to Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act.

                  (b)      Expiration Date; Extensions and Amendments;
Subsequent Offering Period. The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be
the 20th business day after commencement of the Offer (determined in accordance
with Rules 14d-1(g)(3) and 14d-2 under the Exchange Act). The Merger Sub
expressly reserves the right, subject to compliance with the Exchange Act, to
waive, amend or modify any term or condition of the Offer in its sole
discretion; provided, however, that, without the prior consent of the Company,
the Merger Sub shall not:

                           (i)      change the form of consideration payable in
                  the Offer, decrease the Offer Consideration or decrease the
                  number of Shares sought pursuant to the Offer;


                                     - 2 -

                           (ii)     extend the expiration date of the Offer
                  except (A) as required by applicable law (including for any
                  period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or
                  position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")
                  or the staff thereof), (B) that if, immediately prior to the
                  scheduled expiration date of the Offer (as it may be
                  extended), any condition to the Offer has not been satisfied
                  or waived, the Merger Sub may, in its sole discretion, extend
                  the expiration date of the Offer for one or more periods (not
                  in excess of 10 business days each), (C) that if, immediately
                  prior to the scheduled expiration date of the Offer (as it may
                  be extended), the Shares validly tendered and not properly
                  withdrawn pursuant to the Offer constitute at least the
                  Minimum Condition but less than 90% of the outstanding Shares,
                  the Merger Sub may, in its sole discretion, extend the Offer
                  for one or more periods not to exceed an aggregate of five
                  business days, notwithstanding that all conditions to the
                  Offer are satisfied as of such expiration date of the Offer,
                  (D) in connection with an increase in the consideration to be
                  paid pursuant to the Offer so as to comply with applicable
                  rules and regulations of the SEC, or (E) in the Merger Sub's
                  sole discretion, for any other reason for one or more periods
                  not to exceed an aggregate of five business days;

                           (iii)    amend or waive the Minimum Condition;

                           (iv)     amend any material term of the Offer in any
                  manner adverse to holders of Shares; or

                           (v)      impose any condition to the Offer not set
                  forth in Annex I. The Merger Sub may, without the consent of
                  the Company, elect to provide a subsequent offering period for
                  the Offer in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act
                  following its acceptance for payment of Shares in the Offer.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the provisions of Section
9.1(b)(i)(y), if on the initial expiration date of the Offer or any subsequent
expiration date (related to an extension of the Offer), (x) the HSR Condition
(as defined in Annex I) has not been satisfied or (y) any of the events set
forth in clauses (ii)(A) or (B) of Annex I shall have occurred and be continuing
and the Company shall be contesting such event to the extent required by Section
7.2 (and the condition in Annex I with respect to the applicable clause shall
not have been waived by the Merger Sub) then, in each such case, the Merger Sub
shall extend the Offer from time to time, provided that in no event shall the
Merger Sub be required to extend the Offer to a date which is more than 75 days
after the execution of this Agreement.

                  (c)      Schedule TO and Offer Documents. On the date of
commencement of the Offer, the Parent and the Merger Sub shall file with the SEC
a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments and
supplements thereto, the "Schedule TO") with respect to the Offer. The Schedule
TO shall contain an offer to purchase (the "Offer to Purchase"), a form of the
related letter of transmittal (the "Letter of Transmittal"), and ancillary


                                     - 3 -
<PAGE>   10

documents and instruments pursuant to which the Offer will be made
(collectively, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the "Offer
Documents"). The Parent and the Merger Sub agree that the Offer Documents shall
comply in all material respects with the requirements of applicable U.S. federal
securities laws and, on the date first filed with the SEC and on the date first
published, sent or given to the Company's stockholders, shall not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except
that no representation or warranty is made by the Parent or the Merger Sub with
respect to information supplied by the Company or any of its stockholders in
writing for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents. The
Parent and the Merger Sub shall take all steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares, as and to the extent required
by applicable U.S. federal securities laws. The Parent, the Merger Sub and the
Company each shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in
the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and
the Parent and the Merger Sub shall take all steps necessary to amend or
supplement the Schedule TO and, as applicable, the Offer Documents and to cause
the Schedule TO as so amended and supplemented to be filed with the SEC and the
Offer Documents as so amended and supplemented to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal
securities laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon the Offer Documents and any amendments
thereto prior to the filing thereof with the SEC or dissemination to the
stockholders of the Company. The Parent and the Merger Sub shall provide the
Company and its counsel with a copy of any written comments or telephonic
notification of any oral comments the Parent, the Merger Sub or their counsel
may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer promptly after
the receipt thereof, shall consult with the Company and its counsel prior to
responding to any such comments, and shall provide the Company and its counsel
with a copy of any written responses thereto and telephonic notification of any
oral responses thereto of the Parent or the Merger Sub or their counsel.

                  (d)      Provisions of Funds by the Parent. The Parent shall
provide or cause to be provided to the Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds
necessary to purchase any and all Shares that the Merger Sub becomes obligated
to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

                  (e)      Tax Withholding. The Merger Sub shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the
Offer such amounts as the Merger Sub reasonably determines that it is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or under any other
applicable law.

         1.2      Company Actions.

                  (a)      The Company hereby approves of and consents to the
Offer and the Merger and represents and warrants that the Board of Directors of
the Company (the "Company Board"), at a meeting duly called and held, has, by
unanimous vote of all members of the


                                     - 4 -
<PAGE>   11

Company Board (i) determined that each of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, and the Stockholder Agreements
are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders,
(ii) duly adopted and approved this Agreement, the Stockholder Agreements, and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Offer and the
Merger, which adoption and approval are sufficient to (X) satisfy the
requirements of Section 14-2-1111 of the GBCC and (Y) render the restrictions
under Section 14-2-1132 of the GBCC on "business combinations" (as defined in
Section 14-2-1131 of the GBCC) with an "interested shareholder" (as defined
under Section 14-2-1110 of the GBCC), inapplicable to this Agreement, the
Stockholder Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including the Offer and the Merger and (iii) after consideration of its
fiduciary duties under applicable laws, resolved to recommend acceptance of the
Offer and adoption and approval of the Merger by the holders of the Shares. The
Company Board has approved an amendment to the Rights Agreement so as to provide
that (i) neither the Parent nor the Merger Sub will become an "Acquiring Person"
and (ii) no "Stock Acquisition Date" or "Flip-In Date" (as such terms are
defined in the Company Rights Plan) will occur in each case, as a result of the
approval, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Stockholder
Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger in each case in accordance with
their terms.

                  (b)      Schedule 14D-9. As soon as practicable after the
commencement of the Offer, the Company shall file with the SEC a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule
14D-9") and disseminate the Schedule 14D-9, to the extent required by Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act and any other applicable laws, to the
stockholders of the Company. Subject to Section 7.1, the Offer Documents and the
Schedule 14D-9 shall contain the recommendation of the Company Board in favor of
the Offer and the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, and the Company hereby consents to the inclusion
in the Offer Documents of such recommendation. The Company agrees that the
Schedule 14D-9 shall comply in all material respects with the requirements of
applicable U.S. federal securities laws and on the date first filed with the SEC
and, on the date first published, sent or given to the Company's stockholders,
shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, except that no representation or warranty is made by the Company
with respect to information supplied by the Parent or the Merger Sub in writing
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9. The Company,
the Parent and the Merger Sub each shall promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such

The Company shall provide the Parent and its counsel with a copy of any written
comments or telephonic notification of any oral comments the Company or its
counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer promptly
after the receipt thereof, shall consult with the Parent and its counsel prior
to responding to any such comments, and shall provide the Parent and its counsel
with a copy of any written responses thereto and telephonic notification of any
oral responses thereto of the Company or its counsel.

                  (c)      Provision of Information for Offer Documents. The
Company shall promptly supply to the Parent and the Merger Sub in writing, for
inclusion in the Offer Documents, all information concerning the Company

Sub in connection with the preparation of the Offer Documents.

                  (d)      Intention to Tender of Directors and Officers. The
Company represents that each member of the Company Board and each executive
officer of the Company has advised the Company that his or her current intention
is to tender all Shares, if any, beneficially owned by him or her pursuant to
the Offer.

                  (e)      Stockholder Lists. The Company shall promptly furnish
(or cause its transfer agent or agents to furnish) to the Merger Sub or its
designated agent mailing labels containing the names and addresses of (i) the

the Shares subsequent to such date and updated on a daily basis, together with
copies of all security position listings and all other computer files and other
information in the Company's possession or control regarding the record holders
and beneficial owners of the Shares, and shall furnish to the Merger Sub such

request for the purpose of communicating the Offer to the Company's
stockholders. From and after the date of this Agreement, all such information
concerning the Company's record and, to the extent known, beneficial holders
shall be made available to the Merger Sub. Subject to the requirements of
applicable laws and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the
Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Parent and
the Merger Sub shall, until consummation of the Offer, hold in confidence the

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, if this Agreement shall be
terminated in accordance with Section 9.1 of this Agreement, shall, upon
request, deliver to the Company all copies of such information then in their
possession or under their control.

         1.3      Directors.

                  (a)      Promptly after the acceptance for payment of, and
payment by the Merger Sub for, any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, and
from time to time thereafter as Shares are


                                     - 6 -
<PAGE>   13

accepted for payment and paid for by the Merger Sub, the Merger Sub shall be
entitled to designate such number of members of the Company Board (the "Merger
Sub Designees"), rounded up to the nearest whole number, as will give the Merger
Sub representation on the Company Board equal to the product of the total number
of members of the Company Board (after giving effect to the directors elected
pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the number of
Shares beneficially owned by the Parent or the Merger Sub at such time
(including Shares so accepted for payment) bears to the total number of Shares
then outstanding; provided that in no event shall the Merger Sub Designees
constitute less than a majority of the Company Board. In furtherance thereof,
the Company shall, upon the request of, and as specified by, the Merger Sub,
promptly (and in any event within one business day) either increase the size of
the Company Board or secure the resignations of such number of the Company's
incumbent directors, or both, as is necessary to enable the Merger Sub Designees
to be so elected or appointed to the Company Board and the Company shall take
all actions available to the Company to cause the Merger Sub Designees to be so
elected or appointed. At such time, the Company shall, if requested by the
Merger Sub, also take all action necessary to cause persons designated by the
Merger Sub to constitute at least the same percentage (rounded up to the next
whole number) as is on the Company Board of (i) each committee of the Company
Board, (ii) each board of directors (or similar body) of each subsidiary of the
Company and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each such board, in each
case only to the extent permitted by applicable law or the rules of any stock
exchange or trading market on which the Company Common Stock is listed and
traded. The provisions of this Section 1.3 are in addition to and shall not
limit any rights which the Merger Sub, the Parent or any of their affiliates (as
such term is defined in Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the "Securities Act")) ("Affiliates") may have as a holder or
beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of applicable law with respect to the
election of directors or otherwise.

                  (b)      Compliance with Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. The
Company shall take all actions required in order to fulfill its obligations
under Section 1.3(a), including mailing to its stockholders the information
required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated
thereunder as part of the Schedule 14D-9. The Parent and the Merger Sub shall
supply to the Company in writing any information with respect to the Parent and
the Merger Sub and the Merger Sub Designees to the extent required by such
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

                  (c)      Independent Directors. Notwithstanding the provisions
of this Section 1.3, the parties hereto shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to ensure that at least two of the members of the Company Board
shall, at all times prior to the Effective Time (as defined in Section 2.3), be
directors of the Company who were directors of the Company on the date hereof
(the "Independent Directors"), provided that, if there shall be in office less
than two Independent Directors for any reason, the Company Board shall cause the
person designated by the remaining Independent Director to fill such vacancy who
shall be deemed to be an Independent Director for all purposes of this
Agreement, or if no Independent Directors then remain, the other directors of
the Company then in office shall designate two persons to fill such vacancies
who will not be directors, officers, employees or Affiliates of the Parent or
the Merger Sub and such persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for
all purposes of this Agreement. From and after


                                     - 7 -
<PAGE>   14

the time, if any, that the Merger Sub Designees constitute a majority of the
Company Board and prior to the Effective Time, subject to the terms hereof, any
amendment or modification of this Agreement, any termination of this Agreement
by the Company, any extension of time for performance of any of the obligations
of the Parent or the Merger Sub hereunder, any waiver of any condition to the
Company's obligations hereunder or any of the Company's rights hereunder may be
effected only if (in addition to the approval of the Board of Directors as a
whole) there are in office one or more Independent Directors and such action is
approved by at least one of the Independent Directors then in office.


                                   ARTICLE II

                                   THE MERGER

be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time (as defined in Section

obligations of the Merger Sub in accordance with the GBCC.

         2.2      Closing. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set

cannot be satisfied until the time of the Closing but subject to the fulfillment
or waiver of such conditions), at the offices of Hale and Dorr LLP, 11951
Freedom Drive, Suite 1400, Reston, Virginia, or at such other time, date or
place agreed to in writing by the Parent and the Company. The date on which the

Date, a certificate of merger or other appropriate documents (in any such case,
the "Certificate of Merger") shall be duly prepared, executed and acknowledged
by the parties in accordance with the relevant provisions of the GBCC and filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Georgia. The Merger shall become
effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Georgia or at such subsequent time or date as the Parent
and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger. The time
at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the

incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended as provided

         2.6      Directors and Officers. The directors of the Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation, and the officers of the Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time will be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in
each case until their successors are elected and qualified. Prior to the

or her resignation as a director of the Company effective upon the Effective
Time.

                                  ARTICLE III

                     CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER

         3.1      Effect of Merger on Capital Stock.

                  (a)      Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Merger Sub, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or the holder of any of the following
securities:

                           (i)      each share of Company Common Stock issued
                  and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
                  than shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant
                  to clause (ii) below and any Dissenting Shares (as defined in
                  Section 3.1(b)) shall be automatically cancelled and
                  extinguished and be converted into and become the right to
                  receive from the Surviving Corporation $9.25 in cash per share
                  (or any such higher price per Share as may be paid in the
                  Offer) without any interest thereon (the "Merger
                  Consideration");

                           (ii)     each share of Company Common Stock issued
                  and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that
                  is owned by the Parent, the Merger Sub or the Company or any
                  direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company, including all
                  shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury
                  stock, shall automatically be cancelled and retired, and no
                  payment shall be made with respect thereto; and

                           (iii)    each share of the Merger Sub's capital stock
                  issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
                  shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
                  paid and nonassessable share of the same class of capital
                  stock of the Surviving Corporation.

                  (b)      Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, shares (the "Dissenting Shares") of the Company
Common Stock that are issued and


                                     - 9 -
<PAGE>   16

outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any
holder who is entitled to demand and who properly demands appraisal of such
shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of
Article 13 of the GBCC ("Article 13") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.1(a)(i), but instead
such holder shall be entitled to payment of the appraised value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Article 13.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Article 13
or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Article 13, then the right of such holder to
be paid the appraised value of such holder's Dissenting Shares under Article 13
shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at
the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 3.1(a)(i). The Company shall give the
Parent and the Merger Sub prompt notice of any demands for payment, or notices
of intent to demand payment, received by the Company with respect to shares of
Company Common Stock, and the Parent and the Merger Sub shall have the right to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of the Parent and the Merger Sub, make any payment with
respect to, or settle, or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any
of the foregoing.

                  (c)      Treatment of Company Stock Options and Company
Warrants. The Company Stock Options (as defined in Section 4.2(b)) and Company
Warrants (as defined in Section 4.2(b)) shall be treated in the manner set forth
in Section 7.8.

         3.2      Exchange of Certificates.

                  (a)      Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent
shall select a bank or trust company (or such other person as shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Company) to act as agent (the "Paying Agent") for
the payment after the Effective Time of the Merger Consideration upon surrender
of stock certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares which Shares were converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(i) (each, a "Certificate"). From time
to time after the Effective Time, the Parent shall provide, or cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide, to the Paying Agent, on a timely basis as and
when needed, cash necessary for payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 3.1(a)(i) upon surrender of Certificates (such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the "Exchange Fund").

                  (b)      Exchange Procedure. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, but in any event, not later than the fifth business
day following the Effective Time the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate (i) a Letter of Transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate shall
pass, only upon delivery of the Certificate to the Paying Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as the Parent may reasonably specify)
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificate in
exchange for the Merger


                                     - 10 -
<PAGE>   17

Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the Parent,
together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and properly executed,
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
amount of cash into which the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section
3.1(a)(i) into the right to receive, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common
Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of the Company,
payment may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting
such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of the Parent that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash, without
interest, into which the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by
such Certificate have been converted pursuant to Section 3.1. No interest shall
be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

                  (c)      No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock.
The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance
with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate. Upon the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article III.

                  (d)      Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for
twelve months after the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to
the Parent, upon demand, and any holder of a Certificate who has not theretofore
complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to the Parent for
payment of the Merger Consideration, but shall have no greater rights against
the Parent than may be accorded to general unsecured creditors of the Parent
under applicable law.

                  (e)      No Liability. None of the Parent, its Affiliates, the
Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be
liable to any person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to five years
after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the
Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to
or become the


                                     - 11 -
<PAGE>   18

property of any court, arbitrational tribunal, administrative agency or
commission or other governmental or regulatory authority, agency or
instrumentality (a "Governmental Entity"), any such cash in respect of such
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest
of any person previously entitled thereto.

                  (f)      Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall
invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by the Parent. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the
Parent.

                  (g)      Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall pay to such holder the Merger
Consideration required pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(i), in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the holder thereof with such assurances as the Parent, in its discretion and as
a condition precedent to the payment of the Merger Consideration, may require of
the holder of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.

                  (h)      Withholding Rights. The Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as it reasonably determines that it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other
applicable law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority by the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

The Company represents and warrants to the Parent and the Merger Sub as follows,
taking into account the information included in the disclosure schedule attached
hereto (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"). The Company Disclosure Schedule
shall be arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and lettered
paragraphs contained in this Article IV and the disclosure in any paragraph
shall qualify only such specifically enumerated paragraph.

         4.1      Organization, Standing and Power; Subsidiaries.

                  (a)      Organization, Standing and Power. Each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 4.1(b)) is a corporation or limited
liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation, has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as now being conducted and as


                                     - 12 -
<PAGE>   19

proposed to be conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing as a foreign entity in each jurisdiction where the character of its
properties owned, operated or leased or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification necessary, except for such failures to be so organized, qualified
or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, which have not had, and
are reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" means any change, event,
circumstance, development or effect that is or is reasonably likely to have a
materially adverse effect on (i) the business, assets, liabilities, condition
(financial or other), or results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (ii) the ability of the Company to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that in no
event shall any of the following be taken into account (alone or in combination
with any other event identified in this proviso) in determining whether there
has been such a Material Adverse Effect: (i) any change, event, circumstance,
development or effect that results from or arises out of the public announcement
or pendency of the Offer, the Merger or of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; (ii) any change, event, circumstance, development or effect
attributable to conditions generally affecting the industry as a whole in which
the Company participates; (iii) changes in United States generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") for companies operating in the industry in which
the Company participates; or (iv) actions or omissions of the Company taken with
the prior written consent of the Parent or the Merger Sub.

                  (b)      Subsidiaries. Section 4.1(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list of all of the
Company's Subsidiaries as of the date hereof and the Company's direct or
indirect equity interest therein. Except as so listed, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries directly or indirectly owns any equity, membership,
partnership or similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for any equity, membership, partnership or similar
interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability
company or other business association or entity, whether incorporated or
unincorporated except for publicly traded securities of unaffiliated entities
where the Company's beneficial ownership constitutes less than five percent of
such entity's outstanding capital stock. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has at any time been a general partner or managing member of any
general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company or other
entity, except for Headhunters L.L.C. As used in this Agreement, the word
"Subsidiary" means, with respect to a party, any corporation, partnership, joint
venture, limited liability company or other business association or entity,
whether incorporated or unincorporated, of which (i) such party or any other
Subsidiary of such party is a general partner or a managing member (excluding
partnerships, the general partnership interests of which held by such party
and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries do not have a majority of the voting
interest in such partnership), (ii) such party and/or one or more of its
Subsidiaries holds voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or
other governing body performing similar functions, or (iii) such party and/or
one or more of its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, owns or controls more
than 50% of the equity, membership, partnership or similar interests.

                  (c)      Organizational Documents. The Company has delivered
to the Parent complete and accurate copies of the Articles of Incorporation and
By-laws of the Company, each


                                     - 13 -
<PAGE>   20

as amended, and the charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of each
Subsidiary of the Company as in effect as of the date hereof.

         4.2      Capitalization.

                  (a)      Authorized and Outstanding Capitalization. The
authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 45,500,000 shares of Company
Common Stock and 12,500,000 shares of preferred stock, $.01 par value per share
("Preferred Stock"). As of August 24, 2001, (i) 20,406,872 shares of Company
Common Stock were issued and outstanding, (ii) no shares of Company Common Stock
were held in the treasury of the Company or by Subsidiaries of the Company, and
(iii) no shares of the Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding. Section
4.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all issued and outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock that are subject to a repurchase or redemption
right or right of first refusal in favor of the Company and whether (and to what
extent) such rights will terminate as a result of the transactions contemplated

                  (b)      Documentation Relating to Company Employee Plans.
With respect to each Company Employee Plan, the Company has furnished to the
Parent, a complete and accurate copy of (i) such Company Employee Plan (or a
written summary of any unwritten plan), (ii) the most recent annual report (Form
5500) filed with the Internal Revenue Service, (iii) each trust agreement, group
annuity contract and summary plan description, if any, relating to such Company
Employee Plan, (iv) the most recent financial statements for each Company
Employee Plan that is funded, (v) all personnel, payroll and employment manuals
and policies, (vi) all


                                     - 29 -
<PAGE>   36

employee handbooks, and (vii) all reports regarding the satisfaction of the
nondiscrimination requirements of Sections 410(b), 401(k) and 401(m) of the
Code.

                  (c)      Administration of Company Employee Plans. Each
Company Employee Plan has been administered in all material respects in
accordance with ERISA, the Code and all other applicable laws and the
regulations thereunder and in accordance with its terms and each of the Company,
the Company's Subsidiaries and their ERISA Affiliates has in all material
respects met its obligations with respect to such Company Employee Plan and has
made all required contributions thereto (or reserved such contributions on the
Company Balance Sheet). All filings and reports as to each Company Employee Plan
required to have been submitted to the Internal Revenue Service or to the United
States Department of Labor have been timely submitted. With respect to the
Company Employee Plans, no event has occurred, and there exists no condition or
set of circumstances in connection with which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries could be subject to any liability under ERISA, the Code or any
other applicable law.

                  (d)      Benefit Obligations. With respect to the Company
Employee Plans, there are no benefit obligations for which contributions have
not been made or properly accrued and there are no benefit obligations which
have not been accounted for by reserves, or otherwise properly footnoted in
accordance with GAAP, on the financial statements of the Company. The assets of
each Company Employee Plan which is funded are reported at their fair market
value on the books and records of such Employee Benefit Plan.

                  (e)      Qualification of Company Employee Plans. All the
Company Employee Plans that are intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code have received determination letters from the Internal Revenue Service
to the effect that such Company Employee Plans are qualified and the plans and
trusts related thereto are exempt from federal income taxes under Sections
401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, no such determination letter has
been revoked and revocation has not been threatened, and no such Employee
Benefit Plan has been amended or operated since the date of its most recent
determination letter or application therefor in any respect, and no act or
omission has occurred, that would adversely affect its qualification or
materially increase its cost. Each Company Employee Plan that is required to
satisfy Section 401(k)(3) or Section 401(m)(2) of the Code has been tested for
compliance with, and satisfies the requirements of Section 401(k)(3) and Section
401(m)(2) of the Code, as the case may be, for each plan year ending prior to
the Closing Date.

                  (f)      Absence of Certain Obligations. Neither the Company,
any Subsidiary of the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has (i) ever maintained a
Company Employee Plan which was ever subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title
IV of ERISA or (ii) ever been obligated to contribute to a "multiemployer plan"
(as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA). No Company Employee Plan is funded
by, associated with or related to a "voluntary employee's beneficiary
association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. No Company
Employee Plan holds securities issued by the Company, any of the Company's
Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates.

<PAGE>   37

                  (g)      Ability to Amend or Terminate. Each Company Employee
Plan is amendable and terminable unilaterally by the Company and any of the
Company's Subsidiaries which are a party thereto, or covered thereby at any time
without liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result thereof
and no Company Employee Plan, plan documentation or agreement, summary plan
description or other written communication distributed generally to employees by
its terms prohibits the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from amending or
terminating any such Company Employee Plan. The investment vehicles used to fund
the Company Employee Plans may be changed at any time without incurring a
material sales charge, surrender fee or other similar expense.

                  (h)      Employment Related Agreements. Except as set forth in
Section 4.13(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries is a party to any oral or written (i) agreement with any
stockholders, director, executive officer or other key employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (A) the benefits of which are contingent, or the
terms of which are materially altered, upon the occurrence of a transaction
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of the nature of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) providing any term of
employment or compensation guarantee or (C) providing severance benefits or
other benefits after the termination of employment of such director, executive
officer or key employee; (ii) agreement, plan or arrangement under which any
person may receive payments from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that may
be subject to the tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or included in the
determination of such person's "parachute payment" under Section 280G of the
Code, without regard to Section 280G(b)(4); or (iii) agreement or plan binding
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including any stock option plan, stock
appreciation right plan, restricted stock plan, stock purchase plan or severance
benefit plan, any of the benefits of which will be increased, or the vesting of
the benefits of which will be accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the value of any of the benefits
of which will be calculated on the basis of any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. The Company has provided to the Parent the information
necessary to accurately calculate any excise tax due under Section 4999 of the
Code as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which
the Company or the Parent may directly or indirectly become liable and the
amount of deductions that may be disallowed under Section 280G of the Code as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (i)      Retiree Benefits. None of the Company Employee Plans
promises or provides retiree medical or other retiree welfare benefits to any
person, except as required by applicable law.

                  (j)      No employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(i) to the knowledge of the Company, is in violation of any term of any patent
disclosure agreement, non-competition agreement, or any restrictive covenant to
a former employer relating to the right of any such employee to be employed by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries because of the nature of the business
conducted or presently proposed to be conducted by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or to the use of trade secrets or proprietary information of
others, or (ii) in the


                                      -31-
<PAGE>   38

case of any key employee or group of key employees, has given notice to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that such employee or any employee in a group
of key employees intends to terminate his or her employment with the Company.

         4.14     Compliance With Laws. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries
has complied with, is not in violation of, and has not received any notice
alleging any violation with respect to, any applicable provisions of any
statute, law or regulation with respect to the conduct of its business, or the
ownership or operation of its properties or assets, except which, individually
or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

         4.15     Permits. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have all
permits, licenses and franchises (the "Company Permits") from Governmental
Entities required to conduct their businesses as now being conducted, except for
such permits, licenses and franchises the absence of which, individually or in
the aggregate, have not resulted in, and are not reasonably likely to result in
a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance
with the terms of the Company Permits except for such failures to so comply
which, individually or in the aggregate, have not had, and are not reasonably
likely to a Material Adverse Effect. No material Company Permit will cease to be
effective as a result of the consummation of transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

         4.16     Labor Matters.

                  (a)      Labor Unions and Collective Bargaining Agreements.
None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their employees is a party to or
otherwise bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other
agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is the subject of any proceeding asserting
that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor
practice or is seeking to compel it to bargain with any labor union or labor
organization which, individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect, nor is there pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened, any labor strike, dispute, walkout, work stoppage,
slow-down or lockout involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Section
4.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all employees of the Company
who are not citizens or permanent resident aliens of the United States.

                  (b)      Employment Practices. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is in compliance with all Federal, foreign (as applicable), and
state laws regarding employment practices, including laws relating to workers'
safety, sexual harassment or discrimination, except where the failure to so be
in compliance, individually or in the aggregate, has not, and is not reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         4.17     Insurance. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries maintains
insurance policies (the "Insurance Policies") with reputable insurance carriers
against all risks of a character and in such amounts as are usually insured
against by similarly situated companies in the same or similar businesses.
Section 4.17 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the insurance


                                      -32-
<PAGE>   39

coverages maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries and a history of any
claims made and claims paid since January 1, 2000. Each Insurance Policy is in
full force and effect and is valid, outstanding and enforceable, and all
premiums due thereon have been paid in full. None of the Insurance Policies
shall terminate or lapse (or be affected in any other materially adverse manner)
by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and
each of its Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with the
provisions of each Insurance Policy under which it is the insured party. No
insurer under any Insurance Policy has canceled or generally disclaimed
liability under any such policy or indicated any intent to do so or not to renew
any such policy. All material claims under the Insurance Policies have been
filed in a timely fashion.

         4.18     Affiliate Transactions. Section 4.18 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a complete list of each contract or agreement to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or bound with any Affiliate of the
Company (other than any Subsidiary which is a direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company). Complete and accurate copies of all the agreements,
contracts and arrangements set forth in Section 4.18 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule have heretofore been furnished to the Parent. Except as disclosed in
the Company's proxy statement filed on April 30, 2001, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any transaction with any director,
officer or other Affiliate of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
transaction that would be subject to proxy statement disclosure pursuant to Item
404 of Regulation S-K.

         4.19     Assets. The Company or one of its Subsidiaries owns or leases
all tangible assets necessary for the conduct of their businesses as presently
conducted. All of such tangible assets which are owned, are owned free and clear
of all mortgages, security interest, pledges, liens and encumbrances ("Liens")
except for Liens which individually and in the aggregate, do not materially
interfere with the ability of the Company and its Subsidiaries to conduct their
business as currently conducted and have not resulted in, and are not reasonably
likely to result in, a Material Adverse Effect. The tangible assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are free from material defects,
have been maintained in accordance with normal industry practice, are in good
operating condition and repair (subject to normal wear and tear) and are
suitable for the purpose for which they are presently used.

         4.20     Warranty. Except as set forth in Section 4.20 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, no product or service manufactured, sold, leased, licensed,
delivered or otherwise provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
subject to any guaranty, warranty, right of return or other indemnity.

         4.21     Customers and Suppliers. Section 4.21 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule accurately identifies, and provides an accurate and complete
breakdown of the revenues received from, each customer of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that represented 5% or more of the Company's consolidated
revenues in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000 or in the seven-month period
ended July 31, 2001 (a "Material Customer"). No Material Customer has indicated
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that it will stop, or decrease the
rate of,


                                      -33-
<PAGE>   40

buying materials, products or services from the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in Section 4.21 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no material supplier of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
indicated to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that it will stop, or
decrease the rate of, supplying materials, products or services to them.

         4.22     Opinion of Financial Advisor. The financial advisor of the
Company Credit Suisse First Boston (the "Financial Advisor") has delivered to
the Company a written opinion dated the date of this Agreement to the effect, as
of such date, that, on the basis of and subject to the assumptions set forth
therein, the cash consideration of $9.25 per Share to be received by holders of
Shares pursuant to the Offer and the Merger is fair to the holders of Shares
from a financial point of view (the "Fairness Opinion"). The Company has
delivered to the Parent and the Merger Sub a signed copy of the Fairness
Opinion, together with the Financial Advisor's written consent to the inclusion
of or reference to the Fairness Opinion in the Schedule TO, the Offer Documents,
the Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement.

         4.23     Rights Agreement. The Company has duly entered into an
amendment to the Rights Agreement, a signed copy of which has been delivered to
the Parent (the "Rights Agreement Amendment"), and taken all other action
necessary or appropriate so that the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and/or the Stockholder Agreements do not and will not result in the
ability of any person to exercise any of the Rights under the Rights Agreement
Amendment or enable or require the Rights issued thereunder to separate from the
shares of Company Common Stock to which they are attached or to be triggered or
become exercisable or cease to be redeemable.

         4.24     Brokers. No agent, broker, investment banker, financial
advisor or other firm or person is or shall be entitled, as a result of any
action, agreement or commitment of the Company or any of its Affiliates, to any
broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission in
connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except
the Financial Advisor, whose fees and expense will be paid by the Company. The
Company has delivered to the Parent a complete and accurate copy of all
agreements pursuant to which the Financial Advisor is entitled to any fees and
expenses in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE V

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
                        OF THE PARENT AND THE MERGER SUB

         The Parent and the Merger Sub each represents and warrants to the
Company as follows:

         5.1      Organization, Standing and Power. Each of the Parent and the
Merger Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of its incorporation, has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as now being conducted, and is duly


                                      -34-
<PAGE>   41

qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in
each jurisdiction where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, would materially impair the ability of the
Parent or the Merger Sub to perform its obligations hereunder.

         5.2      Authority; No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

                  (a)      Power and Authority; Execution and Delivery. Each of
the Parent and the Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority to
enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Parent and
the Merger Sub and the consummation by the Parent and the Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of each of the Parent and the Merger Sub
(including the approval of the Merger by the Parent in its capacity as the sole
stockholder of the Merger Sub). This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by each of the Parent and the Merger Sub and assuming due and valid
authorization, execution, and delivery by the other parties to this Agreement,
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of each of the Parent and the
Merger Sub, enforceable in accordance with its terms (except in all cases as
such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, receivership, conservatorship, moratorium, or similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and except that the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive
relief is subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding may
be brought).

                  (b)      Absence of Conflicts. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by each of the Parent and the Merger Sub does not, and the
consummation by the Parent and the Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will not, (i) conflict with, or result in any violation or
breach of, any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the
Parent or the Merger Sub, (ii) conflict with, or result in any violation or
breach of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) a
default (or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of
any obligation or loss of any material benefit) under, or require a consent or
waiver under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, lease, license, contract or other agreement, instrument or
obligation to which the Parent or the Merger Sub is a party or by which either
of them or any of their properties or assets may be bound, or (iii) subject to
compliance with the requirements specified in clauses (i) through (v) of Section
5.2(c), conflict with or violate any permit, concession, franchise, license,
judgment, injunction, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation
applicable to the Parent or the Merger Sub or any of their properties or assets,
except in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) of this Section 5.2(b) for any such
conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations,
accelerations or losses which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
materially impair the ability of the Parent or the Merger Sub to perform their
obligations hereunder.

                  (c)      Absence of Required Consents. No consent, approval,
license, permit, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration, notice
or filing with any Governmental Entity is required by or with respect to the
Parent or the Merger Sub in connection with the


                                      -35-
<PAGE>   42

execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation by the Parent or
the Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for
(i) the pre-merger notification requirements under the HSR Act, (ii) the filing
of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Georgia
and appropriate corresponding documents with the Secretaries of State of other
states in which the Company is qualified as a foreign corporation to transact
business, (iii) required filings under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act,
(iv) such consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,
declarations and filings as may be required under applicable "takeover" or state
securities laws and (v) such consents, approvals, orders, registrations,
declarations and filings, the failure of which to make or obtain would not
individually or in the aggregate, materially impair the ability of the Parent or
the Merger Sub to perform their obligations hereunder.

         5.3      Information Provided. The written information supplied by or
on behalf of the Parent or the Merger Sub for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9,
on the date the Schedule 14D-9 is filed with the SEC, and on the date the
Schedule 14D-9 is first published, sent or given to stockholders of the Company,
shall comply in all material respects with the provisions of applicable
securities laws, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. If, at any time prior to Closing, any event
relating to the Parent or Merger Sub should be discovered by the Parent which
should be set forth in an amendment to the Schedule 14D-9, the Parent shall
promptly inform the Company.

         5.4      Interim Operations of the Merger Sub. The Merger Sub was
formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, has not engaged in any other business activities and has
conducted its operations only as contemplated hereby.

         5.5      Financing. At the expiration of the Offer and at the Effective
Time, the Parent and the Merger Sub will have available all the funds necessary
to purchase all the Shares pursuant to the Offer and the Merger and to pay all
fees and expenses payable by the Parent or the Merger Sub related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Parent and the Merger Sub have
entered into an Investment Agreement with certain stockholders of the Parent,
which provides sufficient funding for the Parent and the Merger Sub to satisfy
all of their funding obligations under this Agreement. The execution and
delivery of the Investment Agreement by all of the parties thereto have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the parties
thereto, and the Investment Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation
of each of the parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with its terms (except
in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, receivership, conservatorship, moratorium, or
similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and except
that the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance or
injunctive relief is subject to the discretion of the court before which any
proceeding may be brought), and do not (i) conflict with, or result in any
violation or breach of, any provision of the organizational documents of the
parties thereto, (ii) conflict with, or result in, any violation or breach of,
or constitute with or without notice or lapse of time, or both,


                                      -36-
<PAGE>   43

a default (or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration
of any obligation or loss of any material benefit) under, or require consent or
waiver under, any of the terms, conditions, or provisions of any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, lease, license, contract or other agreement, instrument or
obligation to which any of the parties thereto is a party or by which any of
their properties or assets may be bound, or (iii) conflict with or violate any
permit, concession, franchise, license, judgment, injunction, order, decree,
statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to any of the parties to
the Investment Agreement or any of their properties or assets. Under the terms
of the Investment Agreement, a copy of which has been provided to the Company,
the Company has been granted third-party beneficiary rights and no material
conditions are required to be satisfied prior to the funding provided for under
Investment Agreement being made available to the Parent and the Merger Sub.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                               CONDUCT OF BUSINESS

         6.1      Conduct Prior to Effective Time. Except as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement, as consented to in writing by the Parent, from
and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms or the Effective Time, the Company
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, act in the Ordinary Course
of Business, and use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain and preserve
its and each Subsidiary's business organization, assets, and properties, keep
available the services of its present officers and employees and preserve its
advantageous business relationships with customers, strategic partners,
suppliers, distributors and others having business dealings with it to the end
that its goodwill and ongoing business shall be unimpaired at the Effective
Time. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the date
of this Agreement until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms or the Effective Time, the Company shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, without the
prior written consent of the Parent:

                  (a)      (A) declare, set aside or pay any dividends on, or
make any other distributions (whether in cash, securities or other property) in
respect of, any of its capital stock (other than dividends and distributions by
a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company to its parent); (B)
split, combine or reclassify any of its capital stock or issue or authorize the
issuance of any other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution
for shares of its capital stock or any of its other securities; or (C) purchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of its capital stock or any other
securities or any rights, warrants or options to acquire any such shares or
other securities;

                  (b)      issue, deliver, sell, grant, pledge or otherwise
dispose of or encumber any shares of its capital stock, any other voting
securities or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for, or any
rights, warrants or options to acquire, any such shares, voting securities or
convertible or exchangeable securities (other than the issuance of Shares upon
the exercise of


                                      -37-
<PAGE>   44

Company Stock Options or Company Warrants outstanding on the date of this
Agreement in accordance with their present terms);

                  (c)      amend its articles of incorporation, by-laws or other
comparable charter or organizational documents, except as expressly provided by
this Agreement;

                  (d)      acquire (A) by merging or consolidating with, or by
purchasing all or a substantial portion of the assets or any stock of, or by any
other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership, joint venture,
limited liability company, association or other business organization or
division thereof or (B) any assets that are material, in the aggregate, to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, except purchases of inventory
and components in the Ordinary Course of Business;

                  (e)      except in the Ordinary Course of Business, sell,
lease, license, pledge, or otherwise dispose of or encumber any properties or
assets of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries;

                  (f)      whether or not in the Ordinary Course of Business,
sell, dispose of, or otherwise transfer any assets material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (including any accounts, leases, contracts or
intellectual property or any assets or the stock of any Subsidiaries, but
excluding the sale or non-exclusive license of products in the Ordinary Course
of Business);

                  (g)      adopt or implement any stockholder rights plan or,
except as provided in Section 4.23, alter or further amend the Rights Agreement
or the Rights;

                  (h)      enter into an agreement with respect to any merger,
consolidation, liquidation or business combination, or any acquisition or
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets or securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries;

I or Article VIII.

         6.2      Confidentiality. The parties acknowledge that the Parent and
the Company have previously executed a confidentiality agreement, dated as of
August 6, 2001 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), which Confidentiality
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms,
except as expressly modified herein.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

         7.1      No Solicitation.

                  (a)      Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall, and the Company shall cause its or their directors, officers, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other agents, advisors or
representatives (such directors, officers, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants, other agents, advisors and representatives,
collectively, "Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit,
initiate, participate, encourage or take any other action which facilitate, any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in
Section 7.1(f)) or (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or


                                      -40-
<PAGE>   47

negotiations regarding, furnish to any person any information with respect to,
assist or participate in any effort or attempt by any person with respect to, or
otherwise cooperate in any way with, any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, prior to the acceptance for payment of any Shares pursuant to the
Offer (the "Specified Time"), the Company may, to the extent required by the
fiduciary obligations of the Company Board, as determined in good faith by the
Company Board after consultation with outside counsel, in response to a Superior
Proposal (as defined in Section 7.1(f)) that did not result from a breach of
this Section 7.1, and subject to compliance with Section 7.1(c), (x) furnish
information with respect to the Company to the person making such Superior
Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive
of the other party than the Confidentiality Agreement and (y) participate in
discussions or negotiations with such person regarding any Superior Proposal.
Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 7.1(a) by any Representative of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such person is purporting to
act on behalf of the Company or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of
this Section 7.1(a) by the Company.

                  (b)      The Company Board shall recommend the Offer and the
Merger to the Company stockholders, and neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall (i) except as set forth in this Section 7.1, withdraw or
modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the Parent or
the Merger Sub, the approval or recommendation by the Company Board or any such
committee of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger; (ii) cause or permit the
Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar
agreement (an "Acquisition Agreement") constituting or relating to any
Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) adopt, approve or recommend, or propose to adopt,
approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to the Specified Time and from the third business day following the
Parent's receipt of written notice advising the Parent that the Company Board
has decided to accept a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the person making such
Superior Proposal, the Company Board may, in response to a Superior Proposal
that did not result from a breach of this Section 7.1, withdraw or modify the
recommendation by the Company Board of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger
or terminate this Agreement, if the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations (and concurrently therewith causes
the Company to enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal). Nothing in this Section 7.1 shall be deemed to permit the Company to
take any action described in clauses (ii) or (iii) of the first sentence of this
Section 7.1(b) unless it has terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.1(e) and paid to the Parent the fees specified in Section 9.3.

                  (c)      The Company shall immediately advise the Parent
orally, with written confirmation to follow within 24 hours, of any Acquisition
Proposal or any request for nonpublic information in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry with respect to, or that could reasonably
be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and
conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and the identity of the
person making any


                                      -41-
<PAGE>   48

such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall not provide any
information to or participate in discussions or negotiations with the person or
entity making any Superior Proposal until two business days after the Company
has first notified the Parent of such Acquisition Proposal as required by the
preceding sentence. The Company shall (i) keep the Parent informed of the status
and details (including any change to the terms) of any such Acquisition Proposal
or inquiry, and (ii) if the Parent shall make a counterproposal, consider and
cause its financial and legal advisors to negotiate on its behalf in good faith
with respect to the terms of such counterproposal. Contemporaneously with
providing any information to a third party in connection with any such Superior
Proposal or inquiry, the Company shall furnish a copy of such information to the
Parent.

                  (d)      Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed
to prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party required
pursuant to Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act;
provided, however, that, except as set forth in Section 7.1(b), in no event
shall the Company Board or any committee thereof withdraw or modify, or propose
to withdraw or modify, its position with respect to this Agreement, the Offer or
the Merger or adopt, approve or recommend, or propose to adopt, approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal.

                  (e)      The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and its and their Representatives to, cease immediately all discussions and
negotiations regarding any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have all copies of all nonpublic information it or
its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives have distributed on or prior
to the date of this Agreement to other potential purchasers returned to the
Company as soon as possible.

                  (f)      For purposes of this Agreement:

                  "Acquisition Proposal" means (i) any inquiry, proposal or
offer for a merger, consolidation, dissolution, sale of substantial assets,
tender offer, recapitalization, share exchange or other business combination
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any proposal for the
issuance by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of over 15% of its equity
securities (provided that, so long as the Stockholder Agreements are in full
force and effect without material breach thereof solely for purposes of Section
9.3(b)(iii), such percentage shall be 40% of its equity securities) or (iii) any
proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, over 15%
(provided that, so long as the Stockholder Agreements are in full force and
effect without material breach there of solely for purposes of Section
9.3(b)(iii), such percentage shall be 40%) of the equity securities or
consolidated total assets of the Company, in each case other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                  "Superior Proposal" means any unsolicited, bona fide written
proposal made by a third party to acquire substantially all the equity
securities or assets of the Company, pursuant to a tender or exchange offer, a
merger, or a sale of its assets, (i) on terms which the Company Board
determines, at a duly constituted meeting of the Company Board or by unanimous
written


                                      -42-
<PAGE>   49

consent, in its reasonable good faith judgment to be reasonably likely to be
more favorable, both financially and otherwise, to the holders of Company Common
Stock than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after receiving the
advice of the Company's independent financial advisor that the value of the
consideration provided for in such proposal exceeds the value of the
consideration provided for in the Merger), taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any proposal by the
Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement) and (ii) that in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with outside counsel) is
reasonably capable of being completed timely on the terms proposed, taking into
account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal; and
for which financing, to the extent required, is then committed or which, in the
reasonable good faith judgment of the Company Board, as expressed in a
resolution adopted at a duly constituted meeting (based on the advice of the
Company's independent financial advisor), is reasonably capable of being
obtained by such third party.

         7.2      Efforts; Consents, Notices and Approvals.

                  (a)      General. Subject to the terms and conditions herein
provided, each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, as
promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Stockholder Agreements, and to cooperate with each of the other parties hereto
in connection with the foregoing, including using its reasonable best efforts:
(A) to obtain all necessary waivers, consents and approvals from third parties;
(B) to obtain all necessary consents, approvals and authorizations as are
required to be obtained under any federal, state or foreign laws or regulations;
(C) to lift or rescind any injunction or restraining order or other order
adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby; (D) to effect all necessary registrations and filings,
including filings under the HSR Act and submissions of information requested by
governmental authorities; and (E) to fulfill all conditions to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
connection with any filing or submission required or action to be taken by
either the Parent or the Company to effect the Offer, the Merger and to
consummate the other transactions contemplated hereby, the Company shall not,
without the Parent's prior written consent, commit to any divestiture
transaction, and neither the Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be required
to divest or hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action that
limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, the
Company or any of the businesses or assets of the Parent or any of its
Affiliates or that otherwise would result in a change, event, circumstance,
development or effect that is or is reasonably likely to have a materially
adverse effect on the business, assets, liabilities, capitalization, prospects,
condition (financial or other), or results of operations of the Parent and the
Affiliates of Parent which are controlled by Parent ("Controlled Parent
Affiliates"), taken as a whole, or of any of Parent's other Affiliates.

                  (b)      Without limitation, for purposes of the foregoing,
the obligation of the Parent and the Merger Sub to use "reasonable best efforts"
to obtain waivers, consents and


                                      -43-
<PAGE>   50

approvals to loan agreements, leases and other contracts shall not include any
obligation to agree to a modification of the terms of such documents, or to make
any guaranty or monetary payment in consideration of such waiver, consent or
approval.

                  (c)      Notifications by Company. The Company shall confer
with the Parent on a regular and frequent basis as reasonably requested by the
Parent concerning operational matters and promptly advise the Parent orally and
in writing of any change or event having, or which, insofar as reasonably can be
foreseen, could have, a Material Adverse Effect. The Company shall promptly
provide to the Parent (or its counsel) copies of all filings made by the Company
with any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

                  (d)      State Takeover Law. Without limiting the generality
of Section 7.2(a), if any "fair price" or "business combination" or "control
share acquisition" or "anti-takeover" statute, or other similar statute or
regulation or any state "blue sky" statute shall become applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by the Stockholder Agreements,
the Company and the Company Board shall grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated
hereby and thereby, and otherwise act to minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

         7.3      Notification of Certain Matters.

                  (a)      By the Company. The Company shall give prompt notice
to the Parent of (i) the inaccuracy of representation or warranty made by the
Company contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality becoming
untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any such representation or warranty that
is not so qualified becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or
(ii) the failure by the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by
it under this Agreement; provided, however, that no such notification shall be
deemed to cure any breach or otherwise affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the Company or the conditions to the obligations of
the parties hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall,
promptly and in any event within 24 hours after it has notice of any of the
following, notify the Parent of:

                           (i)      any notice or other communication from any
                  person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be
                  required in connection with the transactions contemplated by
                  this Agreement;

                           (ii)     any notice or other communication from any
                  Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
                  contemplated by this Agreement; and


                                      -44-
<PAGE>   51

                           (iii)    any actions, suits, claims, investigations
                  or proceedings commenced or, to the best of its knowledge,
                  threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
                  affecting the Company or any Subsidiary which, if pending on
                  the date of this Agreement would have been required to have
                  been disclosed pursuant to this Agreement or which relate to
                  the consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby.

                  (b)      By the Parent. The Parent shall give prompt notice to
the Company of (i) any representation or warranty made by the Parent or the
Merger Sub contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality
becoming untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any such representation or
warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect, or (ii) the failure by the Parent or the Merger Sub to comply with or
satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by them under this Agreement; provided, however, that
no such notification shall be deemed to cure any breach or otherwise affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parent or the Merger
Sub or the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereunder.

         7.4      Company Stockholder Approval of the Merger.

                  (a)      Calling of Company Stockholders Meeting. If the
approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company is required under
the GBCC in order to consummate the Merger, the Company shall, acting through
the Company Board, at the Parent's request, as soon as practicable following the
acceptance for payment of, and payment for, Shares by the Merger Sub in the
Offer (coordinating the timing thereof with the Parent), duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholders
Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining such stockholder approval. The Company
shall, through the Company Board, recommend to its stockholders that they
approve this Agreement and approve the Merger. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to the first
sentence of this Section 7.4(a) shall not be affected by (i) the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any
Acquisition Proposal or (ii) the withdrawal or modification by the Company Board
of its approval or recommendation of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of the
Parent shall acquire at least 90% of the outstanding Shares, the parties shall,
at the request of the Parent, take all necessary and appropriate action to cause
the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after the expiration of
the Offer without a stockholders meeting in accordance with Section 14-2-1104 of
the GBCC. To the extent permitted by the GBCC and Article 7.1 of the Company's
Articles of Incorporation, as amended, and in accordance with all relevant
provisions thereof, at Parent's request, the Company shall take all necessary
and appropriate action to obtain the requisite approval and adoption by the
Company's stockholders of this Agreement and the Merger by written consent
without a meeting.

                  (b)      Preparation of Proxy Statement. If the approval of
this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company is required under the GBCC in
order to consummate the Merger,


                                      -45-
<PAGE>   52

the Company shall, at the Parent's request, as soon as practicable following the
acceptance for payment of, and payment for, shares by the Merger Sub in the
Offer, prepare and file with the SEC a proxy or information statement (the
"Proxy Statement") in accordance with the Exchange Act and any other applicable
laws, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond to any
comments of the SEC or its staff and to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed
to the Company's stockholders as promptly as practicable after responding to all
such comments to the satisfaction of the staff. The Company shall notify the
Parent promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or
any other government officials and of any request by the SEC or its staff or any
other government officials for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement
or for additional information, and shall supply the Parent with copies of all
correspondence between the Company or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC, or its staff, or any other government officials on the other
hand with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall consult with the
Parent and its counsel prior to responding to any comments from the SEC or its
staff or any other government officials. If at any time prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting there shall occur any event that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly
prepare and mail to its stockholders and file with the SEC any such amendment or
supplement. The Company shall not mail any Proxy Statement, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, to the Company's stockholders unless it has first obtained
the consent of the Parent to such mailing, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

                  (c)      Voting of Shares by the Parent and the Merger Sub.
The Parent shall cause all Shares purchased by the Merger Sub pursuant to the
Offer and all other Shares owned by the Parent or the Merger Sub or any other
subsidiary of the Parent to be voted in favor of the approval of this Agreement.

         7.5      Access to Information. The Company shall, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries and the Company's and such Subsidiaries' Representatives to,
afford to the Parent and its Representatives reasonable access, at all
reasonable times, during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of the
Company's and any of its Subsidiaries', properties, books, records, contracts,
commitments and personnel and shall furnish the Parent all financial, operating
and other data and information as the Parent may reasonably request. Unless
otherwise required by law, the Parent will hold any such information which is
nonpublic in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall, within two
business days of any request therefor, provide to the Parent the information
described in Rule 14a-7(a)(2)(ii) under the Exchange Act and any information to
which a holder of Company Common Stock would be entitled under Section 14-2-1602
of the GBCC (assuming such holder met the requirements of such section). The
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to secure for the Company
access to and copies of the workpapers of its independent public accountants. No
information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section
or otherwise shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
contained in the Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
to consummate the Offer or the Merger.


                                      -46-
<PAGE>   53

         7.6      Public Disclosure. Except as may be required by law or stock
market regulations, (i) the press release announcing the execution of this
Agreement shall be issued only in such form as shall be mutually agreed upon by
the Company and the Parent and (ii) the Parent and the Company shall each use
its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party before issuing, and
provide each other with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any
other press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger,
and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
prior to using such efforts; provided that nothing in this Section 7.6 shall be
deemed to prohibit any party from making any disclosure which its counsel deems
necessary or advisable in order to satisfy such party's disclosure obligations
imposed by law.

         7.7      Indemnification.

                  (a)      For a period of six years from and after the
Effective Time, in the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding, or investigation, whether civil, criminal, or administrative,
including, without limitation, any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation in which any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to
the date of this Agreement, a director or officer of the Company (the
"Indemnified Parties") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole
or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the
fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, or employee of the Company,
or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether
in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest
extent permitted by law, each such Indemnified Party against any liability
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding, or investigation to each Indemnified
Party to the fullest extent permitted by law upon receipt of any undertaking
required by applicable law in form and substance which is reasonably
satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation), judgments, fines, and amounts paid
in settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, proceeding, or investigation, and in the event of any such threatened or
actual claim, action, suit, proceeding, or investigation (whether asserted or
arising before or after the Effective Time), the Indemnified Parties may retain
counsel reasonably satisfactory to them; provided, however, that (a) the
Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and
upon such assumption the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to any
Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof, except that if the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such
defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises the
Indemnified Parties that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest
between the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified
Parties may retain one (but only one) counsel reasonably satisfactory to them
and Surviving Corporation, and in such instance the Surviving Corporation shall
pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
Parties, (b) the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent, and (c) the Surviving Corporation
shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court
of competent jurisdiction shall


                                      -47-
<PAGE>   54

ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final and
nonappealable, that indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law.

                  (b)      The Surviving Corporation agrees that all rights to
indemnification and all limitations on liability existing in favor of the
directors, officers, and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the
"Covered Parties") as provided in their respective articles of incorporation,
bylaws, or similar governing instruments as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect, and shall be
honored by such entities or their respective successors as if they were the
indemnifying party thereunder, without any amendment thereto, for a period of
six years after the Effective Time; provided, further, however, that nothing
contained in this Section 7.7(b) shall be deemed to preclude the liquidation,
consolidation, or merger of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, in which case
all of such rights to indemnification and limitations on liability shall be
deemed to so survive and continue notwithstanding any such liquidation,
consolidation, or merger. Without limiting the foregoing, in any case in which
approval by the Surviving Corporation is required to effectuate any
indemnification, the Parent shall direct, at the election of the Indemnified
Party, that the determination of any such approval shall be made after
consultation with independent counsel mutually agreed upon between the Surviving
Corporation and the Indemnified Party.

                  (c)      The Parent, from and after the Effective Time, will
directly or indirectly cause the persons who served as directors or officers of
the Company at or before the Effective Time to be covered by the Company's
existing directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (provided that the
Parent may substitute therefor policies of substantially similar coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous than
such policy), provided that the Parent shall not be required to pay an annual
premium for such insurance in excess of 200% of the last annual premiums paid
prior to the date hereof (which premiums the Company has disclosed to the
Parent), but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as possible for such
amount. Such insurance coverage shall commence at the Effective Time and will be
provided for a period of no less than six years after the Effective Time.

                  (d)      If the Parent or any of its successors or assigns
shall consolidate with or merge into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving person of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer
all or substantially all of its assets to any person, then and in each case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Parent
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.7.

         7.8      Company Stock Options; Warrants; Convertible Debt.

                  (a)      Payment for Company Stock Options. As soon as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt
such resolutions or take such other actions as are required to adjust the terms
of all outstanding Company Stock Options heretofore granted under any


                                      -48-
<PAGE>   55

Company Stock Plan to provide that each Company Stock Option outstanding shall
be canceled in exchange for a cash payment by the Company at the Effective Time
of an amount equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration
per Share over (y) the exercise price per Share subject to such Company Stock
Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of Shares for which such Company Stock
Option shall not theretofore have been exercised. The Company shall use its best
efforts to obtain all consents of the holders of the Company Stock Options as
shall be necessary to effectuate the foregoing. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, payment shall, at the Parent's request, be
withheld in respect of any Company Stock Option until all necessary consents are
obtained.

                  (b)      Withholding. All amounts payable pursuant to this
Section 7.8 shall be subject to any required withholding of Taxes and shall be
paid without interest.

                  (c)      Termination of Company Stock Plans. The Company Stock
Plans shall terminate as of the Effective Time, and the provisions in any other
Company Employee Plan providing for the issuance, transfer or grant of any
capital stock of the Company or any interest in respect of any capital stock of
the Company shall terminate and be deleted as of the Effective Time or (if
permissible) at the Merger Sub's request, upon the initial acceptance of the
Shares pursuant to the Offer, and the Company shall ensure that following the
Effective Time no holder of a Company Stock Option or any participant in any
Company Stock Plan or other Company Employee Plan shall have any right
thereunder to acquire any capital stock of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation.

                  (d)      Payment of Company Warrants. As soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board shall adopt such
resolutions or take such other actions as are required to adjust the terms of
all outstanding Company Warrants heretofore granted to provide that each Company
Warrant outstanding shall be canceled in exchange for a cash payment by the
Company at the Effective Time of an amount equal to (i) the excess, if any, of
(x) the Merger Consideration per Share over (y) the exercise price per Share
subject to such Company Warrant, multiplied by (ii) the number of Shares for
which such Company Warrant shall not theretofore have been exercised. The
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents of
the holders of the Company Warrants as shall be necessary to effectuate the
foregoing.

                  (e)      Treatment of Convertible Debt. The Company shall take
all actions necessary to block the conversion into Company Common Stock of any
unpaid principal and interest outstanding under that certain Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement, dated February 27, 2001, between the Company and
Omnicom Finance, Inc., as amended (the "Company Credit Agreement") including,
but not limited to issuing a conversion blockage notice and prepaying any unpaid
principal and interest thereunder in cash within ten business days after the
delivery of such conversion blockage notice. The Company shall repay all unpaid
amounts of principal and interest under the Company Credit Agreement in full
prior to the Effective Time. Unless the obligation to make such repayment is
waived by Parent, Parent shall provide financing on


                                      -49-
<PAGE>   56

commercially reasonable terms in light of the nature of this transaction in
amounts sufficient to satisfy such obligation to Omnicom Finance, Inc. under the
terms of the Company Credit Agreement as in effect on the date of this
Agreement.

         7.9      Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As soon as practicable following
the date of this Agreement, the Company Board or, if appropriate, any committee
administering the Company 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"), shall,
if permitted by the terms of the ESPP, adopt such resolutions or take such
actions as are required to (i) cancel all options under such plan and (ii)
terminate such plan prior to the Effective Time and return all payroll
deductions credited to the participants in such plan entitled thereto.

         7.10     Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall keep the Parent
fully informed of any stockholder litigation against the Company and its
directors relating to any Transaction; provided, however, that no settlement of
any such litigation shall be agreed to without the Parent's consent.

         7.11     401(k) Plan. In the event Closing occurs before October 1,
2001, the Company will amend its 401(k) Plan to provide that it covers only
employees of the Company.

                                   CONDITIONS

         8.1      Conditions to Obligation of Each Party to Effect the Merger.
The respective obligations of each party to effect the Merger shall be subject
to the fulfillment at or prior to the Effective Time of each of the following
conditions:

                  (a)      the Parent or the Merger Sub shall have made, or
caused to be made, the Offer on the terms and conditions set forth therein and
shall have purchased, or caused to be purchased, all Shares validly tendered and
not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer;

                  (b)      this Agreement and the Merger shall have been
approved and adopted by the requisite vote or consent of the stockholders of the
Company, if any, required by the GBCC and the Company's Articles of
Incorporation, as amended;

                  (c)      any requisite waiting period (and any extension
thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act and any
other applicable competition, merger, control, antitrust or similar law or
regulation shall have expired or been terminated; and

                  (d)      no temporary restraining order, preliminary or
permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling issued by a court of
competent jurisdiction or by any Governmental Entity nor any statute, rule,
regulation or executive order promulgated or enacted by any Governmental Entity
shall be in effect, which would make the acquisition or holding by the Parent or
its subsidiaries of the Shares or shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation illegal or otherwise prevent the consummation of the Merger.

                        TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

         9.1      Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Effective Time, whether prior to or after approval by the
stockholders of the Company, as follows:

                  (a)      subject to Section 1.3(c), by mutual written consent
of the Parent and the Company;

                  (b)      by either the Parent or the Company:

                           (i)      if (x) as a result of the failure of any of
                  the offer conditions set forth in Annex I the Offer shall have
                  terminated or expired in accordance with its terms without the
                  Merger Sub having accepted for payment any Shares pursuant to
                  the Offer or (y) the Merger Sub shall not have accepted for
                  payment any Shares pursuant to the Offer on or before November
                  20, 2001, provided that if on such date each of the offer
                  conditions other than the HSR Condition has been fulfilled or
                  is capable of being fulfilled, then such date shall be
                  extended to January 20, 2002 (as applicable, the "Outside
                  Date"); provided, further, however, that the right to
                  terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(b)(i)
                  shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill
                  any obligations under this Agreement has been a principal
                  cause of or resulted in the failure of the Offer to be
                  consummated on or before the Outside Date; or

                           (ii)     if any Governmental Entity issues an order,
                  decree or ruling or takes any other action permanently
                  enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the acceptance
                  for payment of, or payment for, any Shares pursuant to the
                  Offer or the Merger and such order, decree, ruling or other
                  action shall have become final and nonappealable; provided,
                  however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
                  to this Section 9.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to any party
                  which has not performed its obligations under Section 7.2;

                  (c)      by the Parent prior to the purchase of Shares
pursuant to the Offer:

                           (i)      in the event of a breach by the Company of
                  any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement
                  contained in this Agreement which (X) would give rise to the
                  failure of a condition set forth in paragraph (ii)(E) or
                  (ii)(F) of Annex I and (Y) cannot be or has not been cured
                  within 20 days after the giving of written notice to the
                  Company; or

                           (ii)     if the Parent is entitled to terminate the
                  Offer as a result of the occurrence of any event set forth in
                  paragraph (ii)(G) of Annex I or if the Company breaches
                  Section 7.1.


                                      -51-
<PAGE>   58

                  (d)      by the Company, prior to the purchase of any Shares
pursuant to the Offer, if the Parent or the Merger Sub breaches or fails to
perform in any material respect any of their respective representations,
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to
perform materially impairs the Parent's and the Merger Sub's ability to
consummate the Offer or the Merger and which breach or failure to perform cannot
be or has not been cured within 20 days after the giving of written notice to
the Parent of such breach (provided that the Company is not then in material
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement);
or

                  (e)      by the Company in connection with entering into a
definitive agreement as permitted by Section 7.1(b), provided the Company has
complied with all provisions thereof, including the notice provisions therein,
and that the Company makes simultaneous payment to the Parent of funds as
required by Section 9.3(b).

         9.2      Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 9.1, all obligations and agreements of the
parties set forth in this Agreement shall forthwith terminate and be of no
further force or effect, and there shall be no liability on the part of the
Parent, the Merger Sub or the Company hereunder, except as set forth in 4.24,
Section 5.5, Section 6.2, this Section 9.2, Section 9.3 and Article X, which
provisions shall survive such termination; provided that the foregoing shall not
relieve any party for liability for a willful or intentional breach of this
Agreement.

         9.3      Fees and Expenses.

                  (a)      General. Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.2
or this Section 9.3, each party shall bear all of the fees and expenses incurred
by it in connection with the negotiation and performance of this Agreement, and
no party may recover any such fees and expenses from the other parties upon any
termination of this Agreement.

                  (b)      Payment of Fees by the Company to the Parent. The
Company shall immediately pay to the Parent the following amounts under the
circumstances and on the terms set forth as follows, in cash by wire transfer of
same-day available funds if:

                           (i)      the Company terminates this Agreement
                  pursuant to Section 9.1(e), the Company shall pay the
                  Termination Fee (as defined in Section 9.3(c)) within one
                  business day following such termination;

                           (ii)     the Parent terminates this Agreement
                  pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(ii) or as a result of the Company's
                  breach of or failure to perform Section 7.1, the Company shall
                  pay the Termination Fee within one business day following such
                  termination; and

                           (iii)    the Parent terminates this Agreement
                  pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(i) and after the date hereof and
                  prior to such termination an Acquisition Proposal shall have
                  been made (x) the Company shall pay the Expenses of the Parent
                  upon


                                      -52-
<PAGE>   59

                  demand, and (y) if concurrently therewith or within nine
                  months thereafter, the Company enters into a merger agreement,
                  acquisition agreement or similar agreement (including a letter
                  of intent) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or an
                  Acquisition Proposal is consummated, then, the Company shall
                  pay the Termination Fee upon the earlier of the execution of
                  such agreement or upon consummation of such Acquisition
                  Proposal.

                  (c)      Termination Fee and Expenses. For the purpose of this
Agreement, (i) "Expenses" means documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses
incurred or paid by or on behalf of the Parent and/or the Merger Sub in
connection with the Offer, the Merger or the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including all fees and expenses of
law firms, investment banking firms, accountants, experts and consultants to the
Parent and/or the Merger Sub, and (ii) "Termination Fee" means $8,000,000, less
the aggregate amount of Expenses paid to the Parent pursuant to this Agreement.

         9.4      Amendment. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties may amend, modify and supplement this Agreement in any and all respects,
whether before or after any vote of the stockholders of the Company contemplated
hereby; provided, however, that after any such stockholder approvals shall have
been obtained, no amendment shall be made which, under applicable law, requires
the further approval of such stockholders without such approval. Any such
amendment, modification or supplement shall be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer on behalf
of each of the parties.

         9.5      Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties of the other parties contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, or (c)
subject to the proviso in Section 9.4, waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions of the other parties contained in this Agreement. Any
agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by a duly
authorized officer on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

         9.6      Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver. A
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1, an amendment,
modification or supplement of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.4 or an
extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.5 shall, in order to
be effective, require, in the case of the Merger Sub or the Company, action by
its Board of Directors or the duly authorized designee of its Board of Directors
(which, in the case of the Company, shall include the approval contemplated by
Section 1.3(c)).

         10.3     Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Schedules and
Exhibits hereto) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto and
supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among
the parties hereto, or any of them, written or oral, with respect to the subject
matter hereof; provided that the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in
effect in accordance with its terms.

         10.4     No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Section
7.7 above, this Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer
any rights or remedies upon any other person other than the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns, to create any agreement of
employment with any person or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary
hereto.

         10.5     Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in
whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto
without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except that the
Parent and/or the Merger Sub may assign this Agreement to any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Parent without the consent of the Company,
provided that the Parent and/or the Merger Sub, as the case may be, shall remain
liable for all of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

         10.6     Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or
unenforceable, the


                                      -55-
<PAGE>   62

parties hereto agree that the court making such determination shall have the
power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to
replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision
that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention
of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be
enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power
granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such
invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and
other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.

         10.7     Counterparts and Signature. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile transmission.

         10.8     Interpretation. When reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or a Section of this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of defined
terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the
language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of
strict construction shall be applied against any Party. Whenever the context may
require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding
masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns and pronouns
shall include the plural, and vice versa. Any reference to any federal, state,
local or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise.
Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, including Annex I, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." For purposes of this Agreement, the Company shall not be
deemed to be an Affiliate or Subsidiary of the Merger Sub or the Parent. No
summary of this Agreement prepared by any party shall affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

         10.9     Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of
laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware; except to
the extent that the laws of the State of Georgia apply to the Merger and the
rights of the Company stockholders relative to the Merger.

         10.10    Remedies. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with
and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon
such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that


                                      -56-
<PAGE>   63

irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

         10.11    Submission to Jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto (a)
consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal
court sitting in the State of Delaware in any action or proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding
may be heard and determined in any such court, (c) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request
for leave from any such court, and (d) agrees not to bring any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement in any other court. Each of the
parties hereto waives any defense or inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other
security that might be required of any other party with respect thereto. Any
party hereto may make service on another party by sending or delivering a copy
of the process to the party to be served at the address and in the manner
provided for the giving of notices in Section 10.2. Nothing in this Section
10.11, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in
any other manner permitted by law.

         10.12    WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARENT, THE MERGER SUB AND
THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARENT, THE MERGER SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

                                     ANNEX I

                             CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER

         Capitalized terms used in this Annex I but not defined herein have the

restriction referred to above, the payment for, any tendered Shares, and may
terminate or amend the Offer as to any Shares not then paid for, if:

         (i)      prior to the expiration date of the Offer, (A) the Minimum
Condition shall not have been satisfied, or (B) any waiting period under the HSR
Act pursuant to the Offer shall not have expired or been terminated ("HSR
Condition"), or

         (ii)     at any time on or after the date of the Agreement and prior to
the expiration date of the Offer, any of the following conditions shall exist
and be continuing:

                  (A)      there shall be threatened in writing, instituted or
pending any suit, action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity (1) seeking to
challenge, or which could reasonably be expected to make illegal, impede, delay
or otherwise directly or indirectly restrain, prohibit or make materially more
costly, the transactions contemplated by the Agreement or the Stockholder
Agreements, including the Offer and the Merger, or seeking to obtain from the
Company or (to the extent it relates to the transactions contemplated by the
Agreement or the Stockholder Agreements, including the Offer or the Merger) the

all matters properly presented to the Company's stockholders, (6) seeking to

(7) seeking to impose material limitations on the ability of the Merger Sub, or
rendering the Merger Sub unable, to accept for payment, pay for or purchase all
of the Shares pursuant to the Offer and the Merger, or (8) that otherwise has
resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a Material Adverse
Effect;

                  (B)      there shall be any action taken, or any statute,
rule, regulation, legislation, interpretation, judgment, order or injunction
enacted, promulgated, entered, enforced, amended or issued, by any Governmental
Entity, which is applicable to or deemed applicable to (x) the Parent, the
Merger Sub, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or (y) the Offer, the
Merger, the Agreement or the Stockholder Agreements, other than the routine
application to the Offer, the Merger or the transactions contemplated by the

result in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, directly or indirectly,
any of the consequences referred to in paragraph (ii)(A) above;

                  (C)      any change or event shall have occurred which has had

indirectly involving the United States, or (6) in the case of any of the
foregoing existing at the date of the Agreement, an acceleration or worsening
thereof;

                  (E)      (I) the representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in Section 4.2 of the Agreement shall be inaccurate in any respect
except for de minimis amounts as of the date of the Agreement or the scheduled
or extended expiration date of the Offer, (II) the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in Section 4.3 of the Agreement shall be
inaccurate in any material respect as of the date of the Agreement or the
scheduled or extended expiration date of the Offer or (III) the representations
and warranties of the Company set forth


                                      A-2
<PAGE>   67

in the Agreement (other than Sections 4.2 and 4.3 of the Agreement) shall be
inaccurate as of the date of the Agreement or the scheduled or extended
expiration date of the Offer (except to the extent that any such representation
or warranty refers specifically to a particular date, in which case such
representation or warranty shall be true and correct as of such date) unless the
inaccuracies (without giving effect to any materiality or Material Adverse
Effect qualification or expectations contained therein) under such
representations and warranties, taking all the inaccuracies under all such
representations and warranties together in their entirety, do not result in a
Material Adverse Effect;

                  (F)      the Company shall have failed to perform in any
material respect any obligation or to comply in any material respect with any
agreement or covenant of the Company to be performed or complied with by it
under the Agreement;

                  (G)      (1) the Company Board or any committee thereof shall
have (A) withdrawn or modified, or proposed to withdraw or modify, in a manner
adverse to the Parent or the Merger Sub its approval or recommendation of the
Offer, the Merger, the Agreement or the Stockholder Agreements, or (B) approved
or recommended, or proposed to approve or recommend, or announced a neutral
position with respect to, any Acquisition Proposal (2) the Company shall have
entered into, or publicly announced its intention to enter into, any agreement
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or (3) the Company Board or any
committee thereof shall have resolved to do any of the foregoing;

                  (H)      beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 25% or more of the Shares has been
acquired by any person or group (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange
Act), provided, that in the case of ITC such beneficial ownership shall not have
been increased above 28%;

                  (I)      the Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with its terms; or

                  (J)      all consents necessary to the consummation of the
Offer or the Merger including, without limitation, consents from parties to
loans, contracts, leases or other agreements shall not have been obtained, other
than consents the failure to obtain which would not have a Material Adverse
Effect;

which in the sole judgment of the Parent and the Merger Sub, in any such case
and regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such condition, makes it
inadvisable to proceed with the Offer or with acceptance for payment or payment
for Shares.

         The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of the Parent and the
Merger Sub and may be asserted by the Parent and the Merger Sub regardless of
the circumstances giving rise to any such condition and may be waived by the
Parent or the Merger Sub (except for the Minimum Condition), in whole or in
part, at any time and from time to time, in their respective sole


                                      A-3
<PAGE>   68

discretion. The failure by the Parent or the Merger Sub at any time to exercise
any of the foregoing rights will not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the
waiver of any such right with respect to any particular facts and circumstances
shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances
and each such right will be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any
time and from time to time.
