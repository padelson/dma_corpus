indemnify such Manager or Helen Quinn, as the case may be, and keep them
indemnified against any increased liability to United Kingdom capital gains
tax arising as a result of a loss of taper relief, which would not have
otherwise arisen but for such termination.

  

## 3.4 **Adjustment**

  

3.4.1 The parties shall comply with the requirements set out in schedule 8.

  

3.4.2 Where the Actual Working Capital Amount is a larger negative number
than the Working Capital Deficit then the Cash Recipients shall pay to the
Purchaser (pro rata based on their respective portions of the Completion Cash
Consideration), an amount equal to (i) the amount by which the Actual Working
Capital Amount is a larger negative number than the Working Capital Deficit
(the " **Decrease Amount** ") _multiplied by_ (ii)(A) the Escrow Deposit
_divided by_ (B) the Holdback Amount, up to a maximum amount equal to the
Escrow Deposit, provided that the maximum aggregate liability of each Cash
Recipient pursuant to this clause 3.4.2 in respect of its Completion Cash
Consideration shall not exceed such Cash Recipients pro rata portion of the
Escrow Deposit. Any payments to be made to the Purchaser pursuant to this
clause 3.4.2 shall be settled by payment in cash from the Escrow Deposit
(together with any interest accrued on the portion of the Escrow Deposit so
paid).

  

3.4.3 Where the Actual Working Capital Amount is a smaller negative number
than the Working Capital Deficit or is a positive number then the Purchaser
shall:

  

(a) pay an amount in cash equal to (i) the difference between the Actual
Working Capital Amount and the Working Capital Deficit, _multiplied by_ (ii)
(A) the Completion Cash Consideration _divided by_ (B) the Purchase Price, to
an account designated in writing by the Vendors Representative at least 5
Business Days prior to Completion (and such payment shall satisfy in full the
Purchasers obligations under this clause 3.4.3(a)), which amount shall then
be further allocated to each Cash Recipient pro rata (based on the percentage
of the Completion Cash Consideration payable to such Cash Recipient);

  

(b) issue to each Optionholder and each Manager (other than Bernard Robert
Norman) additional loan notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to such
Optionholders or Managers, as the case may be, Pro Rata Holdback Amount
_plus_ such Optionholders or Managers, as the case may be, pro rata portion
of the difference between the Actual Working Capital Amount and the Working
Capital Deficit, based on the percentage of the total Purchase Price payable
to such Optionholder or such Manager (ignoring for these purposes, in the
case of the Optionholders, the amount of the Purchase Price that each such
Optionholder receives in cash in respect of such Optionholders Cash Option
Shares), which additional loan notes shall contain terms

     

   

and conditions identical in all material respects to the Purchaser
Loan Notes, and such issuance shall (subject to clause 3.4.4 below) satisfy
in full the Purchasers obligations under this clause 3.4.3(b);

  

(c) if additional loan notes are issuable pursuant to clause 3.4.3(b), pay to
each Optionholder and each Manager (pro rata based on the percentage of the
total Purchase Price payable to such Optionholder or such Manager (ignoring
for these purposes, in the case of the Optionholders, the amount of the
Purchase Price that each such Optionholder receives in cash in respect of
such Optionholders Cash Option Shares)), on the first interest payment date
after the Working Capital Statement has become final and binding in
accordance with the provisions of schedule 8, an amount in cash equal to the
interest that would have accrued between Completion and the date on which
such additional loan notes were actually issued pursuant to clause 3.4.3(b)
if such additional loan notes had been issued at Completion.

  

3.4.4 If the principal amount of additional loan notes issuable pursuant to
clause 3.4.3(b) exceeds the principal amount of loan notes provided for in
the Deed governing the Purchaser Loan Notes, then the Purchaser will create a
new Deed, on terms and conditions identical in all material respects to the
Deed in respect of the Purchaser Loan Notes issued at Completion, and will
procure the provision of a guarantee in respect of the additional loan notes
issuable pursuant to such new Deed, in each case in order to comply with its
obligations set forth in clause 3.4.3(b).

  

3.4.5 Not later than 5 Business Days following the Working Capital Statement
becoming final and binding in accordance with the provisions of schedule 8,
(i) the Escrow Agent shall (A) make any cash payment required to be made
pursuant to clause 3.4.2 and (B) thereafter, disburse to an account
designated in writing by the Vendors Representative at least 5 Business Days
prior to Completion the balance, if any, of the Escrow Deposit (together with
any interest accrued on such balance), which amount shall then be further
allocated to the Cash Recipients pro rata based on their respective portions
of the Completion Cash Consideration, (ii) if there is a Decrease Amount, the
Purchaser shall issue to each Optionholder and Manager (other than Bernard
Robert Norman) Purchaser Loan Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to
(A) such Optionholders or Managers, as the case may be, Pro Rata Holdback
Amount _less_ (B) such Optionholders or Managers, as the case may be, pro
rata portion (based on the percentage of the total Purchase Price payable to
such Optionholder or such Manager (ignoring for these purposes, in the case
of the Optionholders, the amount of the Purchase Price that each such
Optionholder receives in cash in respect of such Optionholders Cash Option
Shares)) of an amount equal to (1) the Decrease Amount _multiplied by_ (2)(I)
the Loan Note Holdback Amount _divided by_ (II) the Holdback Amount and (iii)
if applicable, the Purchaser will take the steps set forth in clause 3.4.3
above.

  

## 3.5 **Effect of Adjustment**

  

3.5.1 Any payments required to be made under clause 3.4.2, 3.4.3 or 3.4.4
above shall, for the avoidance of doubt, be an adjustment to the Purchase
Price.

this Agreement it shall be an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

a Warrantor, an Optionholder, an Investor and/or Bernard Robert Norman fails
to be true and correct in all material respects as if originally made on and
as of the Completion Date,

  

and the consequence of (i) such breach or failure (together with any other
breach(es) or failure(s) arising out of the same or similar facts and
circumstances) is that the Group would, or would reasonably be expected to,
(A) suffer a reduction in its annual profit of in excess of £400,000 or (B)
incur a liability in excess of £400,000 in the aggregate, in respect of which
FTD Group would be required to create a reserve in its consolidated financial

other breach(es) or failure(s)) is that the Group would, or would reasonably
be expected to, (A) suffer an aggregate reduction in its annual profit of in

£1,000,000 in the aggregate, in respect of which FTD Group would be required

not been remedied within 5 Business Days of the Purchaser having notified the
Vendors of such breach(es) or failure(s) (and in any event by 9.00 am London
time on the Completion Date), the Purchaser shall, at any time prior to

an Investor and/or Bernard Robert Norman **** set forth in paragraphs 17.2,
21.3, 33, 36, 43 and 44 of schedule 6, as applicable fail to be true and

7.2 If, at any time prior to Completion, any member of the Group receives
written notice(s) from any governmental authority enjoining, restraining or
otherwise challenging the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then
the Purchaser shall, at any time prior to Completion, be entitled by notice

Agreement (other than the Surviving Provisions), without liability on the
part of the Purchaser.

  

7.3 The Purchaser Guarantor hereby warrants to the Vendors that as of the
date hereof, none of Michael Soenen, Heath Mielke, Carrie Wolfe, Jandy Tomy
or Jon Burney has actual knowledge of any fact made available to him or her

negotiations for which are in progress on that day; and

  

##### (ii) in respect of which he had contact with any customer, client or
agent of or supplier to any Group Company during the Contact Period.

  

## 8.3 By written notice to the Warrantors, the Purchaser may, by one or
more stages, vary the terms of any part of this clause 8 as it may apply to
the Warrantors by reducing (but not increasing) the period during and/or
the activities to which the restrictions are to apply.

  

## 8.4 Each of the restrictions in this clause 8 may be waived in whole or
in part by the Purchaser in writing, subject to any terms and conditions that
it may impose.

  

## 8.5 None of the restrictions in clauses 8.2(a), 8.2(b), 8.2(c) and 8.2(e)
shall:

  

#### (a) prohibit any activities by a Warrantor which are not in direct or
indirect competition with any business being carried on by any Group Company
at the Completion Date; nor

  

#### (b) preclude any Warrantor from holding (directly or through nominees)
investments traded on London Stock Exchange as long as he does not hold more
than 1 per cent of the issued shares or other securities of any class of any
company.

  

## 8.6 Each Warrantor agrees that the restrictions imposed on him by
this clause 8 extend to any actions by the Warrantor:

  

#### (a) on his own account;

  

#### (b) on behalf of any firm, company or other Person;

  

#### (c) whether alone or jointly with any other Person; or

  

#### (d) as a director, manager, partner, shareholder, employee or consultant
of any other Person.

  

## 8.7 Each Warrantor agrees that, having regard to all the circumstances,
the restrictions in this clause 8 are reasonable and necessary for the
protection of the Purchaser and that they do not bear harshly on him. The
parties agree that:

     

   



  

#### (a) each restriction shall be read and construed independently of the
other restrictions so that if one or more are found to be void or
unenforceable as an unreasonable restraint of trade or for any other reason
the remaining restrictions shall not be affected; and

  

#### (b) if any restriction is found to be void but would be valid and
enforceable if some part of it were deleted, the restriction shall apply with
the deletions that are necessary to make it valid and enforceable.

  

## 8.8 If any restriction or undertaking is found by any court or
other competent authority to be void or unenforceable the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to replace such void or unenforceable restriction or
undertaking with a valid provision which, as far as possible, has the same
commercial effect as the provision which it replaces.

  

# **9.** **_WARRANTIES_**

  

## 9.1 The Warrantors severally warrant to the Purchaser as at the date
of this Agreement that, save as fairly disclosed in or by the Disclosure
Letter, each of the Warranties set out in schedule 6 (other than paragraphs
43 and 44 of schedule 6) is true and correct and not misleading. The
Warranties are deemed to be repeated, subject to clause 9.19, on the
Completion Date and any reference made to the date of this Agreement (whether
express or implied) in relation to any Warranty shall also be construed, in
relation to such repetition, as a reference to the Completion Date.

  

## 9.2 Each of the Investors, Bernard Robert Norman and
Optionholders severally warrant to the Purchaser, solely with respect to
itself/himself that each of the Warranties numbered 43 and 44 is true and
correct and not misleading. The Warranties given by each of the Investors,
Bernard Robert Norman and Optionholders under this clause ** ** 9.2 are
deemed to be repeated on the Completion Date and any reference made to the
date of this Agreement (whether express or implied) in relation to such
Warranties shall also be construed, in relation to such repetition, as a
reference to the Completion Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the Warrantors
shall have no liability for any breach of the Warranties numbered 43 and 44.

  

## 9.3 Where "so far as the Warrantors are aware" or any other
expression which qualifies a statement by reference to the Warrantors
knowledge or belief is used in schedule 6 or in the Disclosure Letter, it
shall mean to the best of the knowledge, information and belief of the

only in the area of responsibility indicated after their name:

  

Lynn Davies  **Marketing**

  

Adrian Pritchard  **E-commerce**

## 9.4 Where "so far as the Warrantors are actually aware" or any
other expression which qualifies a statement by request to the Warrantors
actual knowledge or actual belief is used in schedule 6 or in the Disclosure
letter, it shall mean to the best of the knowledge, information and belief of
the Warrantors without enquiry having been made.

  

## 9.5 The statements set out in part 3 of schedule 6 are warranted by each of
the Warrantors individually in that no Warrantor shall have any liability to
the Purchaser in respect of a breach of any such Warranties by any of the
other Warrantors.

  

## 9.6 Subject to clauses 9.10 and 9.20, the total liability of each
Warrantor for all claims under the Warranties and the Tax Covenant is limited
to the amount set against his name in column 4 of part 1 of schedule 1.

  

## 9.7 Subject to clauses 9.10 and 9.20, no liability shall attach to
the Warrantors for claims under the Warranties or the Tax Covenant unless
the aggregate cumulative amount payable by the Warrantors for all those
claims exceeds £25,000. If it does exceed £25,000, subject to clause 9.6
the Warrantors shall be liable for the whole amount of those claims and not
just for the excess.

  

## 9.8 Subject to clause 9.10, all claims under the (i) Warranties shall be
made in writing to the Warrantors claimed against (specifying particulars
of the claim in reasonable detail based on the information in the possession
of the Purchaser) no later than the date six months after receipt by the
Purchaser of the audited consolidated accounts of the Group for the year
ended or current on 31 May 2008 and (ii) Tax Covenant shall be made in
writing to the Warrantors claimed against (specifying particulars of the
claim in reasonable detail based on the information in the possession of the
Purchaser) no later than the seventh anniversary of Completion save that such
claims shall be deemed to be withdrawn, if not previously satisfied or
withdrawn, if proceedings in respect of such claims have not been served on
the Managers within one year from notification of the claim.

  

## 9.9 If the Purchaser makes a claim against any of the Warrantors for
breach of the Warranties or under the Tax Covenant, none of the Warrantors
shall have or pursue any claim or third party action to join in, claim
against, seek a contribution form or otherwise claim or seek damages or
compensation from any Group Company or from any officer or employee of the
Group other than the Warrantors.

  

## 9.10 The limitations on claims under the Warranties and the Tax Covenant
in this clause 9 shall not apply:

  

#### (a) to claims against a Warrantor; and/or

  

#### (b) where there has been a delay in discovering a claim against a
Warrantor

  

which in each case arises as a result of fraud, wilful default or wilful
concealment by that Warrantor.

  

## 9.11 The Warranties shall survive Completion.

  

## 9.12 If any act event or default would otherwise render the
Warrantors liable to a claim both under the Warranties and under the Tax
Covenant, such claim shall first be made under the Warranties and only the
excess shall be claimed under the Tax Covenant. Any amount payable under the
Tax Covenant to the Purchaser shall be reduced to the extent of the amount
received by the Purchaser in respect of the same matter.

     

   



  

## 9.13 Upon the Purchaser becoming aware that matters have arisen which
will give rise to a claim, the Purchaser will notify the Warrantors as soon
as practicable in writing of the potential claim and of the matters which
will give rise to such claim and upon request will disclose in writing to
the Warrantors all information and documents relating to the claim (unless
such disclosure would result in the loss of any applicable privilege or
breach of any applicable confidentiality obligation).

  

## 9.14 Subject to being indemnified and secured by the Warrantors to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall procure
that each Group Company promptly and diligently takes all such actions as the
Warrantors may reasonably request to avoid dispute, resist, compromise,
defend or appeal any claims against each Group Company and shall not make any
admission of liability, agreement or compromise in respect of such claim or
otherwise settle such claims without the prior written consent of the
Warrantors which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided that
under no circumstances shall the Purchaser or any Group Company be required
to take (or be prevented from taking) any action in circumstances where it
reasonably believes the business or interests of any Group Member may be
materially adversely affected as a result.

  

## 9.15 Where the Purchaser or a Group Company or their respective
successors or assigns (as the case may be) is entitled to recover any sum
from some other Person firm or company (including for the avoidance of doubt
HMRC) in respect of any matter giving rise to a claim under this Agreement
the Purchaser shall procure that it or such Group Company or their respective
successors and assigns (as the case may be) shall reasonably endeavour to
take all appropriate steps to enforce such recovery subject to being
indemnified and secured by the Warrantors to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Purchaser against all losses liabilities costs and expenses incurred in
such recovery and shall account to the Warrantors for any amount so recovered
(not exceeding any amount paid by the Warrantors under this Agreement or
under the Tax Covenant but including any expenses borne by the Warrantors)
and neither the Purchaser nor any Group Company will settle abandon or
otherwise resolve such claim for recovery against the third party without the
prior written consent of the Warrantors which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

  

## 9.16 The Purchaser shall immediately reimburse to the Warrantors an
amount equal to any sum paid in respect of any claim under this Agreement
which is subsequently recovered by or paid to the Purchaser or any member of
the Purchasers Group or any Group Company by any third party less any costs
and expenses reasonably incurred by the Purchaser in connection with the
recovery or payment of such sum.

  

## 9.17 The Warrantors shall not be liable under this Agreement to the
extent that:

  

### 9.17.1 such liability arises or is increased as a result of increases in
rates of Tax made after Completion

  

### 9.17.2 such liability would not have arisen but for something voluntarily
done or omitted to be done by the Purchaser, any Group Company or their
agents after Completion (otherwise than in the ordinary and proper course of
the business of such Group Company as carried on at Completion) which they
were aware was or was likely to result in a claim;

  

### 9.17.3 such liability arises or is increased as a result of the passing of
or any change in law or regulation or in its interpretation or administration
by the English courts, by HMRC or by any other monetary fiscal or
regulatory authority (whether or not having the force of law) or by the
withdrawal after completion of any published concession or general practice
previously made by any Tax Authority or by the withdrawal of any

     

   



  

### relief or allowance available at the date hereof;

  

### 9.17.4 the liability arises as a result of any change in the
accounting reference date or in the accounting principles practices or bases
of any Group Company introduced or having effect after Completion;

  

### 9.17.5 the liability relating to the subject of the claim is recovered by
any Group Company or the Purchaser under any policy of insurance;

  

### 9.17.6 the claim is for Tax arising in the ordinary course of business of
any Group Company after Completion;

  

### 9.17.7 an amount by which any Tax which any Group Company or the Purchaser
is or may be liable for (whether actually paid or payable or not) is reduced
or extinguished as a consequence of the matter giving rise to the claim;

  

### 9.17.8 the subject matter of the claim is taken into account in
determining an adjustment to the purchase consideration for the Shares in
accordance with the provisions of clause 3.4 and schedule 8.

  

## 9.18 Nothing in this Agreement shall in any way diminish the Purchasers
or any Group Companys common law duty to mitigate its loss.

  

## 9.19 A Warrantor, an Investor or Bernard Robert Norman may elect at any
time to notify the Purchaser in writing of the occurrence, or failure to
occur, of any event which occurrence or failure would cause any Warranty of
such Person contained herein to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect at any time from the date hereof to the Completion Date when the
Warranties will be deemed repeated, and such written notice shall be deemed
to cure the breach of any such Warranty and amend and/or supplement the
section of the Disclosure Letter relating to such Warranty so that, following
Completion, the Warrantors, the Investors and Bernard Norman shall have no
liability in respect of such breach save that nothing in this clause shall in
any way prejudice the Purchasers right to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with clause 7.1.

  

## 9.20 None of the limitations in this clause 9 on claims under the
Warranties or the Tax Covenant shall apply to a claim against any of the
Vendors or Bernard Robert Norman for breach of any of the Warranties
contained in paragraphs 17.2, 21.3, 33, 36, 43 and 44, as applicable, of
schedule 6 **.**

  

## 9.21 The Purchaser warrants to the Vendors, as at the date of this
Agreement that the warranty set forth in paragraph 2 of schedule 7 is true
and correct and not misleading in all respects and each of the other
warranties of the Purchaser set out in schedule 7 is true and correct and not
misleading in all material respects. The warranties in schedule 7 are deemed
to be repeated on the Completion Date and any reference made to the date of
this Agreement (whether express or implied) in relation to any of the
warranties in schedule 7 shall also be construed, in relation to such
repetition, as a reference to the Completion Date. Subject to clause 9.22,
all claims under the (i) Warranties of the Purchaser set out in Schedule 7
shall be made in writing to the Purchaser (specifying particulars of the
claim in reasonable detail based on the information in the possession of the
person asserting such claim) no later than 2 years from date of Completion,
save that such claims shall be deemed to be withdrawn, if not previously
satisfied or withdrawn, if proceedings in respect of such claims have not
been served on the Purchaser within one year from notification of the claim.

     

   



  

9.22 The limitations on claims under the Warranties of the Purchaser set out
in Schedule 7 set forth in clause 9.21 shall not apply:

  

#### (a) to claims against the Purchaser; and/or

  

#### (b) where there has been a delay in discovering a claim against the
Purchaser

  

which in each case arises as a result of fraud, wilful default or wilful
concealment by the Purchaser.

  

9.23 The Warranties of the Purchaser set out in Schedule 7 shall survive
Completion.

  

9.24 The Purchaser agrees to indemnify each Manager and Helen Quinn against
any UK income tax liability or primary UK national insurance contributions
liability incurred by such Manager or Helen Quinn arising as a direct result
of the grant and/or exercise of the put and call options contemplated by the
Put/Call Agreements (the " **Put/Call Options** ") which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall include any Tax arising under Section 222 Income
Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (" **ITEPA** ") and any Tax arising in
connection with a payment made to such Manager or Helen Quinn pursuant to
this clause 9.24. Each Manager and Helen Quinn shall enter into an election
pursuant to Section 431(1) of ITEPA in respect of the Put/Call Options on the
date of this Agreement and upon the exercise of the Put/Call Options.

  

9.25 The Purchaser shall indemnify each Manager and Helen Quinn against any
increased liability to United Kingdom capital gains tax arising as a result
of a loss of business asset taper relief (i) as a result of the transactions
undertaken pursuant to this Agreement differing from the transaction steps
described in the PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP letter of 16 June 2006 to HM
Revenue and Customs seeking clearance under section 138 of TCGA 1992
and section 707 of ICTA 1988 and which would not otherwise have arisen but
for such difference and (ii) in respect of any payment under this clause
9.25.

Clause 11.1 shall not apply if and to the extent that the party using or
disclosing Confidential Information can demonstrate that:

Agreement on the due date, then FTD guarantees that it shall (on demand by a
Vendor) immediately perform and discharge the obligations of the Purchaser

provision of this clause 12) FTDs liability under this clause 12 shall be no
greater than the Purchasers liability under the terms of this Agreement.

  

12.2 FTDs liability under clause 12.1 shall not be affected by any
concession, time or indulgence granted by a Vendor to the Purchaser or by any
other dealing or thing (whether relating to the Purchaser or any other
Person) which would, but for this clause 12.2, operate to discharge or reduce
that liability.

  

12.3 If anything (including any legal limitation on the part of the
Purchaser) causes any of the Purchasers obligations under this Agreement
and/or the guarantee set out in clause 12.1 to be or become invalid or

obligations under this Agreement as if they were the primary obligations of

suppliers of any Group Company, or to all or any of the employees of any
Group Company) concerning the provisions or subject matter of this Agreement
or containing any information about any other party without the prior written
approval of the Investors and the Purchaser (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

  

## 13.2 **Permitted announcements**

  

Clause 13.1 shall not apply (i) if, and to the extent that, an announcement

14.1 This Agreement is Personal to the parties to it. Accordingly, without
the prior written consent of the other, neither the Vendors nor the Purchaser
may assign, hold on trust or otherwise transfer the benefit of all or any of
the others obligations under this Agreement or any benefit arising under or
out of this Agreement provided, however, that the Purchaser shall, without
the prior consent of any other party hereto, be entitled to (a) assign this
Agreement, in whole or in part, to any of its Affiliates, but in no event

and the assignee shall only be entitled to enforce the benefit assigned to it
whilst it remains an Affiliate of the Purchaser (b) collaterally assign its
rights under this Agreement to any Person providing financing related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation,
the lenders under the Debt Financing. In the event that any assignment is
effected, the liability of any Party hereunder for breach of any term of or
obligation under this Agreement or any covenant or indemnity contained in or
entered into pursuant to this Agreement shall nonetheless be limited to the
liability which would have arisen in the absence of any such assignment.

  

# **15.** **_ENTIRE AGREEMENT_**

other parties in respect of, arising out of, or in any way relating to the
sale and purchase of the Shares.

Parties.

of any provision of this Agreement, nor shall it affect any rights or
obligations under or pursuant to this Agreement which have already accrued up
to the date of variation and the rights and obligations under or pursuant to
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect except and only to the
extent that they are varied.

statute).

  

17.2 No delay or omission by any party to this Agreement in exercising any
right, power, privilege or remedy provided by law or under this Agreement
shall in any way impair or affect the exercise thereof or operate as a waiver
thereof in whole or in part.

provided by Law or under this Agreement shall not preclude any further or
other exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power, privilege
or remedy.

Except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, time is of the essence of each
provision of this Agreement.

unenforceable in any respect under the laws of any jurisdiction then such
provision shall be deemed to be severed

damages or other sum payable by virtue of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Documents the liability of the Vendors or the Purchaser (as the
case may be) shall be increased to include interest on such sum from the date
when payment is due to the date of actual payment (both before and after
judgment) at that annual rate which is 2 basis points above the base rate of
HSBC Bank from time to time in effect during such period. Such interest shall
accrue from day to day and shall be payable without prejudice to any other
remedy available to the Vendors or the Purchaser (as the case may be) in
respect of such default.

  

# **22.** **_COSTS_**

  

22.1 The Purchaser shall pay the Transaction Expenses at Completion

  

22.2 Subject to clause 22.1 above and except as otherwise stated in this
Agreement, each party shall bear their own costs arising out of or in
connection with the preparation, negotiation and implementation of this
Agreement and all other Transaction Documents.

  

# **23.** **_NOTICES_**

  

23.1 A notice may be given by any party to any other party either:

  

### 23.1.1 Personally;

  

### 23.1.2 by sending it via overnight courier; or

  

### 23.1.3 by sending it by prepaid first class post or airmail

  

to such partys address stated in this Agreement or to any other address
supplied by him to the other parties for the purpose of giving notice to him.
A notice delivered Personally shall be deemed to have been given when left at
the partys address. A properly addressed notice sent by (i) overnight
courier shall be deemed to have been served after the expiration of 24 hours
after the notice is posted and (ii) prepaid first class post or airmail shall
be deemed to have been served at an address within the United Kingdom at the
expiry of 72 hours after the notice is posted and to have been served at an
address outside the United Kingdom at the expiry of 96 hours after the notice
is posted.

  

# **24.** **_COUNTERPARTS_**

  

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by parties
on separate

least one counterpart. Each counterpart shall constitute an original of this
Agreement but all the counterparts together shall constitute but one and the
same instrument.

  

# **25.** **_CONTRACTS (RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES) ACT 1999_**

  

No Person who is not a party to this Agreement shall have any right under the
Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this

26.1 This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
English Law.

  

26.2 In relation to any legal action or proceedings to enforce this Agreement
or arising out of or in connection with this Agreement (" **Proceedings**

the grounds of venue or on the grounds that the Proceedings have been brought
in an inappropriate forum.

  

# **27.** **_VENDORS  REPRESENTATIVE_**

  

Each Vendor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints Rhys Hughes as the
Vendors Representative, who shall have the power to take each
action contemplated by this Agreement to be taken by the Vendors
Representative, including, without limitation, to act on behalf of each
Vendor and to make all decisions and agreements on their behalf in connection
with schedule 8 hereto. The Purchaser shall not be required to make any
enquiry of, or reach any agreement with, any of the Vendors or Interflora
Members in connection with any of the matters delegated to the Vendors
Representative herein.

  

# **28.** **_PROCESS AGENT_**

  

FTD irrevocably appoints the Company as its process agent to receive on its
behalf service of process in England in any legal action or
proceedings arising out of this Agreement following Completion, service upon
whom shall be deemed completed whether or not forwarded to or received by
FTD. If for any reason the process agent ceases to be able to act as process
agent, or no longer has an address in England, FTD irrevocably agrees to
appoint a substitute process agent with an address in England acceptable to
the Vendors Representative and to deliver to the Vendors Representative a
copy of the substitute process agents acceptance of that appointment within
20 Business Days. In the event that FTD fails to appoint a substitute process
agent, it shall be effective service for the Vendors Representative to serve
the process upon the last known address in England of the last known process
agent for FTD notified to the Vendors Representative, notwithstanding that
such process agent is no longer found at such address or has ceased to act.

#### (e) all reasonable costs and expenses properly incurred by the Purchaser
and/or the Company in connection with any such Tax liability of the Company,
or Demand from which it appears to the Purchaser or the Company that any such
Tax liability may arise or has arisen, or in successfully taking or defending
any action under this covenant.

  

## 2.2 For the purposes of this covenant the amount of a Tax liability of
the Company falling within paragraph 1.6(c) or 1.6(d) of this schedule shall
be taken to be as follows:

  

#### (a) in the case of a Tax liability within paragraph 1.6(c):

  

##### (i) where such Accounts Relief is a right to repayment of Tax, the
amount of the Relief so denied, lost, used or set off;

  

##### (ii) where such Accounts Relief is a deduction from or set off against
income, profits or gains, or Tax thereon, the Tax that would otherwise have
been saved for the accounting period in which the Accounts Relief arose but
for such denial, loss, use or set off; or

  

##### (iii) if in such accounting period no Tax would otherwise have been
saved because of an insufficiency of income, profits or gains, or Tax
thereon, against which such Accounts Relief could have been offset, the Tax
that would otherwise have been saved for the accounting period or periods in
which income, profits or gains, or Tax thereon, arises or arose, against
which such Accounts Relief could have been offset but for such denial, loss,
use or set off,

  

and in either case 2.2(a)(ii) or 2.2(a)(iii), on the assumption that the
Accounts Relief in question would have been offset to the extent allowed in
priority to any other Relief available in such period or periods; and

  

#### (b) in the case of a Tax liability within paragraph 1.6(d), the amount
of Tax for which the Company would, but for such use or setting-off, have
been liable and in respect of which a claim could have been made against the
Warrantors under this covenant.

  

## 2.3 Any amount paid by the Warrantors to the Purchaser in respect of
a charge to inheritance tax within paragraph 2.1(b) of this schedule
shall be applied first to discharge the liability, if any, of the Company to
such inheritance tax and secondly to discharge the liability of the Person
primarily liable to pay such tax.

   

80   

 

  

# **3.** **_LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS_**

  

## 3.1 The Warrantors shall not be liable under the covenants contained
in paragraph 2.1(a) in respect of any Tax liability of the Company (or in
respect of any costs and expenses arising therefrom under paragraph 2.1(e)):

  

#### (a) to the extent that specific provision or reserve was made in the
balance sheet in the Accounts in respect of such Tax liability, or to the
extent that payment or discharge of such Tax liability was taken into account
therein;

  

#### (b) to the extent that such Tax liability arises or is increased by
reason of the imposition of or increase in the rates of Tax as a consequence
of any change occurring after Completion in law, or in published practice or
concession of general application, and having retrospective effect, which was
not announced before Completion;

  

#### (c) arising from the ordinary course of the normal business of the
Company as a consequence of any Event which occurred, or in respect of or by
reference to any income, profits or gains earned, accrued or received, after
the Accounts Date but on or before Completion and for the purposes of this
paragraph a Tax liability that is not to be regarded as arising in the
ordinary course of the normal business of the Company shall include (but not
be limited to) a liability arising as a consequence of any of the following:

  

##### (i) any distribution or deemed distribution for Tax purposes;

  

##### (ii) the disposal (which shall include any deemed disposal or deemed
appropriation for Tax purposes) of any asset (including trading stock) or the
supply of any service or business facility of any kind where the
consideration (if any) received for such disposal or supply is less than the
consideration deemed to have been received for Tax purposes (but only to the
extent that it is less than such deemed consideration);

  

##### (iii) any Event which gives rise to a Tax liability on deemed (rather
than actual) income, profits or gains;

  

##### (iv) any Event which results in a Tax liability arising in the Company
where such liability is chargeable on or attributable primarily to a Person
other than the Company (including any liability under Part VIII of the Taxes
Management Act 1970);

  

##### (v) the Company ceasing, for Tax purposes, to be a member of any group
or associated with any other company;

  

##### (vi) pursuant to any provision contained in Part XVII of the ICTA 1988;
or

  

#### (d) to the extent that it would not have arisen but for a voluntary act
of the Purchaser (or Person deriving title from it) or the Company after
Completion (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the
presentation for stamp duty purposes of any document where such presentation
is actually needed in order to register the title of the Company to any asset
or for the purpose of adducing a document in evidence in civil proceedings)
which the Purchaser knew or ought reasonably to have known would give rise to
the Tax liability and which could reasonably have been avoided, unless such
act was carried out:

     

   



  

##### (i) pursuant to an obligation of the Company incurred prior to the
Completion Date; or

  

##### (ii) in compliance with any law, regulation or request of any Tax
Authority; or

  

##### (iii) with the written agreement or at the written request of the
Warrantors (or any of them); or

  

##### (iv) in the ordinary course of business of the Company or the
Purchaser.

  

#### (e) any Relief (other than an Accounts Relief or a Purchasers Relief)
is available (or is made available at no cost to the Company) to the Company
to reduce or eliminate a Tax liability and the Purchaser is made aware of the
availability of such Relief by the Warrantors in writing in sufficient time
and detail to enable the Relief to be utilised;

  

#### (f) to the extent that such liability arises because of any change in
accounting or Tax policy or practice of a Group Company introduced after
Completion, any change after Completion of the date to which any Group
Company makes up its accounts, or the cessation after Completion of a trade
or a major change in the nature or conduct of a trade carried on by a Group
Company;

  

#### (g) to the extent that an underpayment of corporation tax by way of
installments made prior to Completion arises as a result of any Group
Companys taxable profits for the accounting period in which Completion falls
being greater than they were anticipated to be at the date of the Tax
payment;

  

#### (h) to the extent that such Tax liability will not have arisen but for
the failure or omission by any Group Company after Completion to make any
claim election surrender revocation or disclaimer or give any notice or
consent or do any other thing the making giving or doing of which was taken
into account in computing any provision or reserve for Tax in the Completion
Accounts and notice of which is given to the Purchaser at least 10 Business
Days before the statutory or procedural deadline for making the same; and

  

#### (i) to the extent that such Tax liability arises because of anything
done pursuant to instructions provided by the Purchaser under clause 5.1(ii)
of this Agreement.

  

## 3.2 The Managers shall not be liable under this schedule to the extent
that the Tax liability in question arises out of either of the following
matters:

  

#### (a) any restriction or denial of Relief in respect of interest payments
to certain of the Investors in respect of the unsecured subordinated A loan
notes issued to such Investors on 8 February 2005;

  

#### (b) any restriction or denial of Relief in respect of professional fees
paid by the Company at the time of or in relation to the acquisition by the
Company of Interflora (Florists Telegraph Delivery Association) British Unit
Limited by way of a Scheme of Arrangement in 2004; and

  

#### (c) a liability in respect of VAT in any jurisdiction other than the
United Kingdom;

  

#### (d) the treatment for Tax purposes of any consultants as employees
rather than as self-employed;

     

   



  

#### (e) Bernard Robert Normans acquisition of his Shares; and

  

#### (f) any Tax liability of the Company arising as a result of transactions
undertaken pursuant to this Agreement differing from the transaction steps
described in the PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP letter of 16 June 2006 to HM
Revenue and Customs seeking clearance under section 138 of TCGA 1992
and section 707 of ICTA 1988 and which would not otherwise have arisen but
for such difference.

  

# **4.** **_MANNER OF MAKING AND CONDUCT OF CLAIMS_**

  

## 4.1 If the Purchaser or the Company shall become aware of any Demand which
appears to the Purchaser to be relevant for the purposes of this covenant,
the Purchaser shall as soon as reasonably practicable give notice thereof to
the Warrantors setting out reasonable details of the Demand.

  

## 4.2 If the Warrantors shall, within 14 days of the date of any notice
given to them under paragraph 4.1 of any such Demand, jointly and severally
indemnify and secure the Purchaser and the Company to the Purchasers
reasonable satisfaction against all losses, costs, interest, damages and
expenses and any further liability to Tax which may be incurred thereby, then
the Purchaser shall procure that the Company will (except in a case where
fraudulent conduct is alleged by any Tax Authority) take such action as the
Warrantors may reasonably and in good time by written notice request to
avoid, dispute, resist, appeal or compromise any Demand; provided that where
the Tax liability which is the subject of the Demand has to be paid before an
appeal can be made or before any other action requested by the Warrantors can
be taken, the Purchaser shall not be obliged to procure the Company to take
any such action until the Warrantors shall have paid to the Purchaser, or at
its direction, the Company, for the purpose of discharging the Tax liability,
an amount equal to the said liability, and in connection with any action so
requested by the Warrantors:

  

#### (a) the appointment of solicitors and other professional advisers to the
Company shall be subject to the prior written approval of the Purchaser, such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed;

  

#### (b) the Warrantors shall ensure that no correspondence, pleading or
other document is sent, transmitted, issued, entered into or in any way
published in connection with the relevant Demand by the Warrantors or their
advisers without the prior approval of the Purchaser, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed;

  

#### (c) the Warrantors shall submit no computations or returns, nor make any
settlement or compromise of the subject matter of the Demand, nor agree any
matter in the conduct of any dispute in relation thereto which is likely to
affect the amount of the Demand, or the future liability of the Company to
Tax (but for the avoidance of doubt this paragraph 4.2(c) shall not apply
where the future liability of the Company to Tax will be increased because a
Relief that has been claimed in one accounting period will not be capable of
being claimed in a subsequent period), without the prior written approval of
the Purchaser, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed;

  

#### (d) if any dispute arises between the Purchaser and the Warrantors as to
whether any Demand should at any time be settled in full, or contested in
whole or in part, such dispute shall be referred for determination to a
Barrister, of at least 10 years call at the English Bar with relevant
experience (or if the dispute relates to a Demand issued by a Tax Authority
outside the United Kingdom, a tax lawyer of equivalent experience in the
jurisdiction concerned), appointed by agreement between the Purchaser and the
Warrantors or (if they do not agree) upon the application by either party to
the

     

   

#### 

  

#### President for the time being of The Law Society (or if the dispute
relates to a Demand issued by a Tax Authority outside the United Kingdom, the
head of the equivalent bar association in the jurisdiction concerned), whose
determination shall be final. The Barrister (or equivalent expert in a
jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom) so appointed shall be asked to
advise whether, in his opinion, (acting as an expert and not as an
arbitrator), an appeal against the Demand would, on the balance of
probabilities, be likely to succeed and also to determine how the costs of
obtaining his opinion should be allocated between the parties hereto. If, but
only if, such opinion is in the affirmative shall an appeal be made and that
Demand not then settled. Any further dispute arising between the parties as
to whether any further appeal should be pursued following determination of an
earlier appeal (whether or not in favour of the Company) shall be resolved in
a similar manner; and

  

#### (e) save as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Purchaser shall
procure that the Company shall give the Warrantors all reasonable co-
operation and assistance for the purposes of taking such action as aforesaid.

  

## 4.3 If the Warrantors do not request the Purchaser to take any
action within 14 days as aforesaid, or the Purchaser and the Company shall
not be indemnified at any time and secured as provided in paragraph 4.2 or
the Barrister (or equivalent expert in a jurisdiction other than the
United Kingdom) shall advise (on the balance of probabilities pursuant
to paragraph 4.2(d)) that an appeal against the relevant Demand is not
likely to succeed, or the Warrantors otherwise fail to fulfil their
obligations hereunder, the Purchaser and the Company shall be free to take
such action in relation to the Demand as it or they may in its or their
absolute discretion think fit.

  

# **5.** **_PAYMENT OF CLAIMS_**

  

## 5.1 Payments by the Warrantors pursuant to the covenants in paragraph 2
shall be made on the days specified in paragraph 5.2 below.

  

## 5.2 The days referred to in paragraph 5.1 are as follows:

  

#### (a) if the Tax liability giving rise to a claim under this covenant
involves an actual payment of Tax by the Company, the day which is the later
of five Business Days after demand is made therefore by or on behalf of the
Purchaser, and three Business Days before the date on which that Tax becomes
due and payable to the relevant Tax Authority;

  

#### (b) if the Tax liability giving rise to a claim under this covenant does
not involve an actual payment of Tax:

  

##### (i) if involving the denial, loss, use or setting off in whole or in
part of an Accounts Relief which is a right to repayment of Tax, the day
which is the later of five Business Days after demand is made therefore by or
on behalf of the Purchaser, and the day on which such Tax would otherwise
have been repaid;

  

##### (ii) if involving the denial, loss, use or setting off of any other
Accounts Relief within paragraph 2.2(a), the day which is the later of five
Business Days after demand is made therefore by or on behalf of the
Purchaser, and the day on which the Tax that would otherwise have been saved
becomes due and payable to the relevant Tax Authority;

     

   



  

##### (iii) if involving the use or setting-off of any Post-Completion Relief
within paragraph 2.2(b) the day which is the later of five Business Days
after demand is made therefore by or on behalf of the Purchaser, and the day
on which the Tax saved thereby would otherwise have become due and payable to
the relevant Tax Authority;

  

#### (c) if involving a payment for, or repayment of a payment for, Group
Relief, the day which is the later of five Business Days after demand is made
therefore by or on behalf of the Purchaser, and three Business Days before
that payment or repayment is due and payable;

  

#### (d) in any other case, five Business Days after the date on which demand
is made therefore by or on behalf of the Purchaser.

  

## 5.3 For the purposes of this paragraph 5, the date on which an amount
of corporation tax (the "Corporation Tax") does or would become due and
payable by a company, being the Company or the Purchaser (the "Relevant
Company"), shall be determined to be:

  

#### (a) in any accounting period of the Relevant Company ending on or after
1 July 1999 in which the Relevant Company is a "large company" within the
meaning of the Instalment Regulations, the date or dates upon which the
Corporation Tax would be provided to be due and payable by Regulations 4 and
5 of the Instalment Regulations on the assumption that the Corporation Tax
payable by the Relevant Company is the "total liability" of the Relevant
Company for that period within the meaning of the said Regulations 4 and 5;
or

  

#### (b) in any other accounting period of the Relevant Company, the date
which is nine months following the end of the accounting period.

  

## 5.4 For the purposes of this paragraph 5, references to the day on which
an amount of Tax which is not UK corporation tax becomes due and payable to
the relevant Tax Authority shall be the first day on which such Tax
is required by law to be paid without incurring any penalty or liability
for interest in respect thereof.

  

## 5.5 Where a Demand is being avoided, disputed, resisted, appealed
or compromised pursuant to paragraph 4.2 of this schedule, the due date for
the payment of any sum pursuant to the covenants in paragraph 2 of this
schedule shall, subject to any requirements to pay such Tax liability which
is the subject of the Demand before an appeal can be made or any other action
requested as described in paragraph 4.2 of this schedule, be adjusted to take
account of any delay in an obligation to pay Tax as a result of such
avoidance, dispute, resistance, appeal or compromise.

  

# **6.** **_NO WITHHOLDINGS, ETC_**

  

## 6.1 All sums payable by the Warrantors hereunder shall be paid free of
and without any rights of counterclaim or set off, and without deduction
or withholding on any ground whatsoever, save only as may be required by law.
If any such deduction or withholding is required by law the Warrantors shall
be obliged to pay to the Purchaser such amount as will ensure that, after any
such deduction or withholding has been made, the Purchaser shall have
received a sum equal to the amount that the Purchaser would otherwise have
received in the absence of any such deduction or withholding, as reduced by
any credit to which the Purchaser may be entitled on account of such
deduction or withholding.

  

## 6.2 If any competent authority for Tax purposes charges to Tax any sum
paid (the "original

     

   

## 

  

## payment") to the Purchaser hereunder the Warrantors shall be obliged to
pay to the Purchaser such additional amount (the "additional payment") as
will ensure that, after the payment of the Tax so charged on the original
payment and any Tax chargeable on the additional payment, there shall remain
a net sum equal to the amount of the original payment, such additional
payment to be paid five Business Days after the Purchaser has served notice
that Tax on the original payment has become due and payable, or would have
become due and payable but for the availability of a Relief.

  

## 6.3 No amount shall be payable under paragraph 6.1, or additional
payment payable under paragraph 6.2, to the extent that such amount or
additional payment would not have been due (1) had payment under the
covenants in paragraph 2 been made to the Purchaser, and not to an assignee
from or successor in title to the Purchaser, and (2) had the Purchaser
been resident for Tax purposes in the United Kingdom.

  

# **7.** **_TAX RETURNS_**

  

## 7.1 The Warrantors or their duly authorised agents shall be responsible
for and have the conduct of preparing submitting to and agreeing with the
relevant Tax Authority at the cost of the Company all tax returns and
computations of the Company in respect of the last accounting period ended on
or prior to Completion ("the Relevant Return").

  

## 7.2 The Warrantors shall keep the Purchaser fully informed of their
conduct of the Companys Tax affairs and the Relevant Return, and all
material written communications relating thereto shall be submitted to the
Purchaser or its duly authorized agents in draft for its or their comments,
and the Warrantors shall incorporate any reasonable comments made by the
Purchaser relating thereto.

  

## 7.3 The Purchaser shall procure that the Company or its duly
authorised agents afford such access to its books accounts and records and
provide all such assistance as the Warrantors or their duly authorised agents
may reasonably require in order to carry out their obligations under this
paragraph 7.

  

## 7.4 The Purchaser or its duly authorised agents shall be responsible
for and have the conduct of preparing submitting to and agreeing with the
relevant Tax Authority at the cost of the Company all tax returns and
computations of the Company in respect of the accounting period during which
Completion takes place ("the Straddle Period Return"), but shall not submit
the Straddle Period Return without giving reasonable opportunity to the
Warrantors to comment upon the Straddle Period Return and shall incorporate
any reasonable comments of the Warrantors into the Straddle Period Return
before it is so submitted. The Purchaser shall not be obliged to include any
comment that contains manifest error, but in the case of such error shall
afford to the Warrantors a reasonable opportunity to correct such error.

  

# **8.** **_CORRESPONDING SAVINGS AND REFUNDS_**

  

## 8.1 If any Tax liability which has resulted in a payment having been
made by the Warrantors under this covenant or for breach of any of the
warranties given under paragraph 27 of Schedule 6 to this Agreement (
_Warranties by the Warrantors_ ) has given rise to a Relief for the
Company or the Purchaser which would not otherwise have arisen, then:

  

#### (a) the Purchaser shall procure that full details of such Relief are
given to the Warrantors as soon as reasonably practicable; and

  

#### (b) to the extent that the liability of the Purchaser or the Company to
make an actual payment of or in respect of Tax is reduced by reason of such
Relief from the amount

     

   

#### 

  

that such liability would have been but for the availability of such Relief,
the Purchaser, if so requested by the Warrantors, shall, on the later of:

  

##### (i) the date when the Purchaser or the Company would have been under an
obligation to pay the Tax liability so reduced; and

  

##### (ii) the date when such reduction is agreed by the relevant Tax
Authority,

  

make a repayment to the Warrantors of an amount equal to the lower of the
amount by which such liability is so reduced and the amount of the payment
referred to at the beginning of this paragraph 8.1 made by the Warrantors,
and any excess of such Relief over the amount of such repayment shall be
carried forward and set off against further claims made by the Purchaser
under this schedule until such Relief has been matched in full by such
repayments.

  

## 8.2 If the Company receives a rebate from a Tax Authority of an amount
in respect of Tax already paid by the Company, such rebate shall be treated
as though it were a Relief within paragraph 8.1 above.

  

# **9.** **_COUNTER INDEMNITY BY PURCHASER_**

  

## 9.1 The Purchaser hereby warrants and undertakes with the Warrantors
and each of them to indemnify them against:

  

#### (a) any claim under section 767A and 767AA Income and Corporation Taxes
Act 1988 which is assessed on the Warrantors or any company which is
associated with the Warrantors in circumstances where the taxpayer company
(as referred to in section 767A(1)) and/or the transferred company
(as referred to in section 767AA) is a Group Company; and

  

#### (b) all reasonable costs and expenses properly incurred by the
Warrantors or any of them in connection with any Tax for which the Purchaser
is liable pursuant to paragraph 9.1(a) above.

  

## 9.2 The provisions of paragraphs 5 and 6 of this schedule shall
apply, mutatis mutandis, to any payments under this paragraph 9 as though
such payments were payments under paragraphs 2 or 6 of this schedule.
