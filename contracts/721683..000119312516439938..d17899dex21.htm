(i) During the ten (10) Business Days following delivery of a Notice of
Objection, Sellers Designee and the Purchaser shall endeavor in good faith
to resolve

 



26  the Disputed Items listed in the Notice of Objection. During such ten (10)
Business Day period and until the final determination of the Purchase Price

reasonable access, during reasonable hours and upon reasonable prior written
notice, to the financial books and records of the Company and the Company

reached within ten (10) Business Days (or such longer period as may be agreed
by Sellers Designee and the Purchaser) after the date of receipt by the
Purchaser from Sellers Designee of the Notice of Objection, the resolution of

Referee. If one or more Disputed Items are submitted to the Neutral Referee

Neutral Referee in connection with its determination pursuant to this
_Section 2.3_. Within ten (10) Business Days after the Neutral Referee has

Referee and substantially simultaneously to the other, a written statement of
its position with respect to each Disputed Item. Within five (5) Business Days
after the expiration of such ten (10) Business Day period, each of Purchaser
and Sellers Designee may deliver to the Neutral Referee its response to the
others position on each Disputed Item; _provided_ that each delivers a copy
thereof substantially simultaneously to the other. With each submission, each
of the Purchaser and Sellers Designee may also furnish to the Neutral Referee
such other information and documents as each deems relevant or such
information and documents as may be requested by the Neutral Referee; 
_provided_ that each delivers a copy thereof substantially simultaneously to
the other. The Neutral Referee may, at its discretion, conduct one or more
conferences (whether in person or by teleconference) concerning the Disputed
Items, and each of the Purchaser and Sellers Designee shall have the right
to present additional documents, materials and other information and to have
present its Representatives at all such conferences;

 

(ii) Sellers Designee and the Purchaser shall instruct the Neutral Referee to

with this _Section 2.3(c) _and based solely on the submissions of the parties
pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)(ii)_ along with a written statement delivered to
each of the Purchaser and Sellers Designee. The decision of the Neutral
Referee shall be final and binding upon each party hereto and the decision of
the Neutral Referee shall constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding
and non-appealable and upon which a judgment may be entered by a court having
jurisdiction thereover;

 



27 (iii) the Final Aggregate Cash Consideration shall be recalculated based upon
the final determination (or deemed determination) of the Neutral Referee with
respect to the Disputed Items, and the Final Aggregate Cash Consideration, as
so recalculated, shall be deemed to be final and binding;

 

(iv) the fees, costs and expenses of the Neutral Referee (A) shall be borne by
the Purchaser in the proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of all
Disputed Items that are unsuccessfully disputed by the Purchaser (as finally
determined by the Neutral Referee) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of
Disputed Items, and (B) shall be borne by the Sellers on a several and not
joint basis in the proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of Disputed
Items that are successfully disputed by the Purchaser (as finally determined
by the Neutral Referee) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of all
Disputed Items; and

(v) the Neutral Referee shall act as an expert and not as arbitrator to
determine, based upon the provisions of this _Section 2.3(c)_, only the
Disputed Items, and the determination of each amount of the Disputed Items
shall be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section
2.3(a)_. The Neutral Referee shall not assign to any item in dispute a value
that is (i) greater than the greatest value for such item assigned by the
Purchaser, on the one hand, or Sellers Designee, on the other hand, or (ii)
less than the smallest value for such item assigned by the Purchaser, on the
one hand, or Sellers Designee, on the other hand.

(d) Upon the determination, in accordance with  _Section 2.3(b)_ or _Section
2.3(c)_, of the Final Aggregate Cash Consideration, Sellers Designee and the
Purchaser shall cause the Escrow Agent to, or the Purchaser shall, as the case
may be, make the payment(s) required by this _Section 2.3(d)_. The amount
payable from the Adjustment Escrow Funds or by the Purchaser pursuant to this
_Section 2.3(d)_ is referred to herein as the "Purchase Price Adjustment".

 

(i) If the Final Aggregate Cash Consideration is greater than the Estimated
Aggregate Cash Consideration, then the Purchaser shall pay to the Sellers
Designee on behalf of and for delivery to the Sellers an aggregate amount in
cash equal to the aggregate difference between the Final Aggregate Cash
Consideration and the Estimated Aggregate Cash Consideration within three (3)
Business Days of the determination of the Final Aggregate Cash Consideration,
such amount to be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account or accounts designated by the Sellers Designee pursuant to _Section
2.2(b)_ or such other account or accounts designated in writing by the
Sellers Designee. Further, the Purchaser and Sellers Designee shall jointly
instruct the Escrow Agent to immediately release to the Sellers the remaining
balance of the Adjustment Escrow Funds in accordance with each Sellers Pro
Rata Seller Share.

 

(ii) If the Final Aggregate Cash Consideration is less than the Estimated
Aggregate Cash Consideration, then within three (3) Business Days after the
determination of the Final Aggregate Cash Consideration, the Purchaser and
Sellers Designee shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to immediately
release (A) to the 

 



28  Purchaser from the Adjustment Escrow Funds an amount equal to the amount by
which the Estimated Aggregate Cash Consideration exceeds the Final Aggregate
Cash Consideration (the "Seller Adjustment Payment"), and (B) to the Sellers,
the remaining balance of the Adjustment Escrow Funds, if any, in accordance
with each Sellers Pro Rata Seller Share. In the event that the Seller
Adjustment Payment is greater than the Adjustment Escrow Fund, the amount by
which the Seller Adjustment Payment exceeds the Adjustment Escrow Funds shall
be paid by the Sellers to the Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account designated by the Purchaser within three (3)
Business Days of the determination of the Final Aggregate Cash Consideration.

(e) In the event that the Closing occurs on a day other than the first
calendar day of a month, during the period from the Closing through the last
calendar day of the month in which the Closing occurs:

 

(i) the Purchaser shall not and shall cause the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries not to:

 

A. except as otherwise specifically contemplated by this _Section 2.3(e)_,
take any action outside of the Ordinary Course of Business that would
reasonably be expected to materially and negatively impact (after taking into
account any positive impact from such action or other action taken) the
Closing Month End Working Capital, except to the extent such impact can be
quantified and the Purchaser agrees to adjust the calculation of the Closing
Month End Working Capital to reflect such amount with the prior written
consent of Sellers Designee (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed);

B. materially alter the pricing of products sold by the Company between the
Closing and the Closing Month End;

C. except for any voluntary cessation of employment or termination "for
cause", materially reduce the overall size of the Companys sales team or
reassign a material number of members of the Companys sales team, in each
case as employed by the Company immediately prior to the Closing;

 

D. except for any voluntary cessation of employment or termination "for
cause", terminate any Key Employee or reassign any Key Employee; and

E. take any action that causes the Company not to operate as a stand-alone
division (subject to Purchasers right to provide shared services required by
business divisions generally so long as such provision of shared services, in
the reasonable determination of Purchaser, would not be expected to materially
and negatively impact Closing Month End Working Capital).

 



29 (ii) the Purchaser shall and shall cause the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries to:

A. except as otherwise specifically contemplated by this _Section 2.3(e)_,
operate the business of the Company in the Ordinary Course of Business in all
material respects;

B. maintain separate books and records for the Company as is reasonably
necessary in order to allow the calculation of Closing Month End Working
Capital; and

C. allocate capital to the Company in a manner consistent in all material
respects with the practice of the Company at or prior to the Closing,
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Purchaser determines in good faith that
it is necessary to allocate capital to the Company in excess of the amounts
allocated in the Companys past practice, such excess amounts shall not be
taken into account in the calculation of Closing Month End Working Capital.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that, (i) in the event that the Purchaser fails
to comply in all material respects with the provisions of _Section 2.3(e)_,
the Working Capital Adjustment shall be deemed to be zero ($0.00) for the
purposes of calculating Final Aggregate Cash Consideration and (ii) the
remedy set forth in the foregoing clause (i) shall be the Sellers sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to any claims the Sellers may have with respect
to any breach or violation by the Purchaser, or its Affiliates, of  _Section
2.3(e)_.

Section 2.4 _Closing; Closing Deliverables_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the sale referred
to in _Section 2.1_ (the "Closing") will take place at (i) the offices of

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS_

 

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by the Sellers to the
Purchaser (the "Seller Disclosure Letter") in connection with this Agreement,
each Seller, severally as to itself only, and not jointly or jointly and
severally, hereby represents and warrants to the Purchaser as follows:

 

Section 3.1 _Due Organization, Good Standing and Power_. Such Seller is a
corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership, duly organized
and validly existing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or
formation. Such Seller is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in
good standing (or the equivalent thereof) in each jurisdiction in 

 



32  which the character or location of the properties it owns, leases or
operates or the nature of the business it conducts makes such qualification,
license or good standing (or the equivalent thereof) necessary, except in
such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed and in
good standing (or the equivalent thereof) would not reasonably be expected to
materially impair the ability of such Seller to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or to perform its obligations under this
Agreement.

Section 3.2 _Authorization; Noncontravention_.

(a) Such Seller has the requisite legal power and authority and has taken all
necessary corporate, limited liability company or similar action to execute
and deliver this Agreement and all other instruments and agreements to be
delivered by such Seller as contemplated hereby and thereby, to perform such
Sellers obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. At the Closing, the Sellers
shall have the power and authority to cause the sale and transfer of the
Company Shares held by such Seller. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by such Seller, and the consummation by such Seller of the
transactions contemplated hereby, have been duly authorized and approved by
all necessary corporate or other action. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by such Seller and, assuming that this Agreement constitutes a
valid and binding obligation of the Purchaser, the Company and each other
Seller, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of such Seller enforceable
against such Seller in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that
its enforceability may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally and by general equitable principles.

(b) Except as would not be material to the ability of such Seller to execute,
deliver or perform this Agreement, the consummation by such Seller of the
transactions contemplated hereby or compliance by such Seller with any of the
provisions hereof and, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by such
Seller will not (i) conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of
the organizational documents of such Seller, (ii) require such Seller to make
any filing with, give any notice to, or obtain any permit, authorization,
consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity (except for any such actions
required by the HSR Act), (iii) result in a violation or breach of, or
constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or
give rise to any right of termination, modification, cancellation
or acceleration) under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, license, contract, agreement or other
instrument or obligation to which such Seller, as the case may be, is a party
or by which it or any of its respective properties or assets may be bound or
(iv) violate any Law or Order applicable to such Seller or any of such
Sellers respective properties or assets.

 

Section 3.3 _Ownership of Company Shares_.

 

(a) Such Sellers record ownership and beneficial ownership of the Company
Shares as of the date hereof is set forth in  _Section 3.3_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter. Other than the Company Shares set forth next to each
Sellers name in _Section 3.3_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, such Seller
does not own as of the date hereof, of record or beneficially, any other
equity interests of the Company or any controlled or non-controlled subsidiary
of the Company. Such Seller has (and, as of the Closing, such Seller will
have) good and valid title to all of the 

 



33  Company Shares set forth next to such Sellers name in _Section 3.3_ of the
Seller Disclosure Letter and such Company Shares are beneficially and of
record owned by such Seller, free and clear of all Liens, except for Liens
arising under applicable securities Laws. Upon the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, such Seller will convey to the
Purchaser good title to the Company Shares set forth next to such Sellers
name in _Section 3.3_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, free and clear of all
Liens, except for those created by the Purchaser or arising out of ownership
of the Company Shares by the Purchaser and other than Liens arising under
applicable securities Laws.

(b) The Sellers collectively have, and immediately prior to the Closing the
Sellers will collectively have, ownership and voting control over all of the
issued and outstanding Company Shares. Such Seller is not a party to any
outstanding Contract with any Person to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
or acquire rights in any of such Sellers Company Shares.

Section 3.4 _Litigation_. There is no Action pending or, to the Knowledge of
such Seller, threatened against such Seller or involving such Sellers assets
or properties that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to materially impair the ability of such Seller to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to perform its obligations
under this Agreement. None of such Seller nor any of such Sellers assets or
properties is subject to any outstanding order, writ, judgment, injunction or
decree of any Governmental Entity that, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to materially impair the ability of such Seller
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to perform
its obligations under this Agreement. Such Seller has not entered into any
Contract regarding the settlement or resolution of any Action (a "Settlement
Agreement") that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to materially impair the ability of such Seller to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to perform its obligations
under this Agreement, nor is any such Settlement Agreement pending approval by
any Governmental Entity.

 

Section 3.5 _Broker s or Finders Fee_. No agent, broker, Person or firm
acting on behalf of such Seller or any holder of Company Shares as of
immediately prior to the Closing that is not a Seller is, or shall be,
entitled to any fee, commission or brokers or finders fees in connection
with this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby from the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

Section 3.6 _Acknowledgment by Sellers_. Such Seller acknowledges and
agrees that except as expressly set forth in _Article V_ , none of the
Purchaser nor any of the Purchasers Subsidiaries nor any of their
Representatives has made any representation or warranty, express or implied,
at law or in equity, to such Seller or any of its Representatives with
respect to the Purchaser, its business and operations or otherwise in
connection with this Agreement or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby and none of the Purchaser nor any other Person shall be subject to any
liability to such Seller or any other Person resulting from the Purchasers
making available to such Seller or such Sellers use of such information, or
any information, documents or material made available to such Seller in the
due diligence materials provided to such Seller, in management presentations
(formal or informal) or in any other form in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the 

 



34  Purchaser makes no representation or warranty to such Seller with respect to
any financial projection or forecast relating to the Purchaser or any of the
Purchasers Subsidiaries, whether or not included in any management
presentation.

Subsidiaries are duly qualified or licensed to do business and are in good
standing (or the equivalent thereof) in each jurisdiction in which the
character or location of the properties they own, lease or operate or the
nature of the business they conduct makes such qualification, license or good
standing (or the equivalent thereof) necessary, except in such jurisdictions
where the failure to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing (or the
equivalent thereof) would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Certificate of
Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Company, copies of which have previously
been made available to the Purchaser, are true, correct, and complete copies
of such documents as currently in effect. The organizational documents of each
of the Company Subsidiaries, copies of which have previously been made

The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company, and
the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby, have been duly
authorized and approved by all necessary corporate action. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming that this
Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Purchaser and the
Sellers, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that
its enforceability may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally and by general equitable principles.

 



35 (b) Except as set forth on _Section 4.2(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
and except for the filing of a Notification and Report under the HSR Act and
any similar filings in foreign jurisdictions, none of the execution, delivery
or performance of this Agreement by the Company, the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby or compliance by the Company
with any of the provisions hereof will, (i) conflict with or result in any
breach of any provision of the organizational documents of the Company, (ii)
require the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to make any filing
with, give any notice to, or obtain any permit, authorization, consent or

hereby, (B) otherwise materially delay performance by the Company of its
material obligations under this Agreement, or (C) be or reasonably be expected
to be material to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Section 4.3 _Capitalization_.

subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments, rights agreements
or agreements of any character calling for the Company to issue, deliver or
sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold any Company Shares or any other
equity security or Voting Debt of the Company or any of the Company

(d) Each Company Subsidiary is a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company. No
Company Subsidiary is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, commitments, rights agreements or agreements of any character

or sold any of its equity securities or any securities convertible into,
exchangeable for or representing the right to subscribe for, purchase or
otherwise receive any such equity security or obligating such Subsidiary to
grant, extend or enter into any such subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,

Company, are owned by the Company free and clear of any Liens other than Liens
arising under applicable Securities laws and Liens granted in connection with

interest of, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, and (ii) neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has granted any preemptive rights,

(f) Except as set forth on _Section 4.3_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary owns any equity interest,
directly or indirectly (other than equity interests in the Company
Subsidiaries), in any Person.

 

Section 4.4 _Financial Statements_. The Financial Statements are attached to
_Section 4.4_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. The Financial Statements
(including in each case,

 



37  any related notes and schedules) (a) were prepared in all material respects
in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved and at the dates involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
to such Financial Statements, and (b) fairly present the consolidated
financial position of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the dates
thereof and the consolidated statement of income, cash flows and changes in
equity for the periods indicated, consistent with the books and records of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, except that the unaudited financial
statements are subject to normal year-end adjustments and
reclassifications which are not expected to be material in amount or effect
and lack footnote disclosure and statement of cash flows). Since December 31,
2014, except as set forth on _Section 4.4_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
there has been no material change in any accounting (or tax accounting)
policy, practice or procedure of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. The
Company and the Company Subsidiaries maintain accurate books and records
reflecting each of their assets and liabilities and maintain proper and
adequate internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the

or any Company Subsidiary of a nature required by GAAP to be reflected in a
balance sheet or the notes thereto, except for Liabilities (a) that were
reflected or reserved against on the Balance Sheet as of the Balance Sheet
Date (or the notes thereto) or in the Financial Statements, (b) permitted or
contemplated by this Agreement or incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (c) incurred in the Ordinary
Course of Business since the Balance Sheet Date.

Section 4.6  _Absence of Certain Changes_. During the period from June 30,
2015 to the date hereof, (a) there has not been any Change which has had, or
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate with
any other Changes, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (b) other than in
respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, the businesses of the Company
and each of the Company Subsidiaries have been conducted in all material
respects in the Ordinary Course of Business and (c) there has not been any
action taken of the type described in _Section 6.3_ that, had such action
occurred following the date hereof without the Purchasers approval, would be
in violation thereof.

 

Section 4.7 _Permits; Compliance with Laws_.

 

(a) Except as set forth on _Section 4.7_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in possession of, and, since
January 1, 2013, have been and are in compliance with the terms of, all
permits, licenses, authorizations, consents, approvals, grants, charters,

Title I of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, and neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary is, or may be, subject to any liability under Title IV or

of the Company Pension Plans that is intended to be a qualified plan within
the meaning of Code Section 401(a) has received a favorable determination or
opinion letter from the IRS to the effect that such Company Pension Plan meets
the requirements of Code Section 401(a). To the Knowledge of the Company,
nothing has occurred or is expected to occur that could reasonably be expected
to result in the revocation of any such determination or opinion letter or
adversely affect the qualified status of any such Company Pension Plan or
the tax-exempt status of any related trust.

(e) Except as set forth in _Section 4.9(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary provides or has agreed to
provide post-employment welfare benefits to any Company Personnel after their

Healthcare Reform Laws since March 23, 2010\. No event has occurred, and no
condition or circumstance exists, that could reasonably be expected to subject
the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company Health Plan to penalties
or excise taxes under Sections 4980D, 4980H or 4980I of the Code or any other
provision of the Healthcare Reform Laws.

 



41 (f) No material lawsuits, governmental administrative proceedings, claims
(other than routine claims for benefits) or complaints to, or by, any Person
or Governmental Entity have been filed, are pending, or to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened with respect to any Company Pension Plan, Company
Benefit Plan or Company Other Plan. There is no correspondence between the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any other ERISA Affiliate and any
Governmental Entity related to any Company Pension Plan, Company Benefit Plan
or Company Other Plan concerning any matter that would reasonably be expected
to result in any material liability to the Purchaser, the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliates or any Company Pension Plan, Company Benefit
Plan or Company Other Plan.

by applicable Law or Order, each as disclosed in  _Section 4.9(g)_ of the

Agreement nor the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by the
Agreement will (i) result in any payment becoming due to any Company
Personnel, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Company
Pension Plan, Company Benefit Plan or Company Other Plan, (iii) result in the
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any benefits under any
such plan, (iv) require any contributions or payments to fund any obligations
under any Company Pension Plan, Company Benefit Plan or Company Other Plan or
(v) provide for indemnification or a gross up payment for any tax incurred
under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code. Except as set forth on Section 4.9(g)
of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has made any legally binding commitment to establish any new
Company Pension Plan, Company Benefit Plan, or Company Other Plan, to
materially modify (other than by way of termination) any Company Pension Plan,
Company Benefit Plan, or Company Other Plan or to enter into any new Company
Pension Plan, Company Benefit Plan, or Company Other Plan.

(h) Each Company Pension Plan, Company Benefit Plan and Company Other Plan
that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of

409A of the Code, except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a
material liability to the Company or any Company Subsidiary taken as a whole.

(i) No Company Pension Plan is a "multiemployer pension plan" (as defined in
Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or a "multiple employer plan" (as
described in Section 413(c) of the Code) and (ii) no Company Benefit Plan is

applicable state or foreign law equivalent.

(k) All contributions, distributions and premiums required to be made by
either the Company or any Company Subsidiary under the terms of each Company
Pension Plan, Company Benefit Plan or Company Other Plan or by ERISA, the Code
or applicable Laws or Orders have in all respects been made in a timely
fashion in accordance with ERISA, the Code or applicable Laws or Orders and
the terms of such plans, except as would not result in a material liability.

 



42 (l) Except as provided in _Section 4.9(l)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not,
either alone or together with any other event, give rise to the payment of any
amount under any Company Pension Plan, Company Benefit Plan, Company Other
Plan or otherwise that would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of
Section 280G of the Code on account of the transactions contemplated under
this Agreement; _provided_ , however, that this _Section 4.9(l)_ shall not
apply to any arrangements entered into at the direction of Purchaser or
between Purchaser and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any Person on the
other hand ("Purchaser Arrangements") so that, for the avoidance of doubt,
compliance with this  _Section 4.9(l)_ shall be determined as if such
Purchaser Arrangements had not been entered into.

(m)  _Section 4.9(m)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth all
amounts payable by the Company at the Closing pursuing to the Option
Cancellation Agreements (all of which payments, for the avoidance of doubt,

Prior to June 30, 2010, the Company had a policy in place for all employees to

another agreement with similar language. To the extent that any Intellectual
Property Asset has been developed or created by a third party for the Company

written agreement with such third party with respect thereto and the Company
or such Company Subsidiary thereby either (i) is the exclusive owner of, or
(ii) has a license (sufficient for the Companys Business as currently
conducted) to, the Intellectual Property Assets of such third party in such
work, material or invention by operation of law or by valid assignment.

(d) The Company Intellectual Property Assets include all of the
Intellectual Property Assets necessary for the operation of the Companys
Business; provided, however, that the foregoing representation and warranty in

Company and the Company Subsidiaries immediately after the Closing Date on
terms and conditions substantially similar to those under which the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries owned or used such Company Intellectual Property
Assets immediately prior to the Closing Date, except for any impairment of
the right, title or interest of the Company or any Company Subsidiary in or to
any of the Company Intellectual Property Assets which would not reasonably be
expected to be material to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole.

(g) As of the date hereof, except as set forth on _Section 4.12(g)_ of the

alleging that the operation of the Companys Business or any use or
exploitation of the Company Intellectual Property Assets owned by the Company
infringes or misappropriates any Intellectual Property Assets owned by a third
party ("Third Party Rights") or (ii) that otherwise challenge the
registrability, enforceability, validity, ownership of or right to use the
Company Intellectual Property Assets owned by the Company.

(h) Neither the use, manufacture, sale or offer for sale of any product or
service by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries nor the operation of the
Companys Business has infringed or misappropriated or is misappropriating or
infringing any Third Party Rights, except for those infringements or
misappropriations which would not reasonably be expected to be material,
individually or in the aggregate, to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
taken as a whole.

 

(i) To the Knowledge of the Company, there is no, infringement upon or
misappropriation by any Person of any of the Company Intellectual Property
Assets.

(j) The Company Software listed on _Section 4.12(a)(ii)_ of the Company

the Company or any Company Subsidiary working within the scope of their
employment at the time of such development; or (ii) developed by agents,
consultants, contractors or other Persons who have executed written agreements
of assignment in favor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as assignee to

the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with acquisitions in which
the Company or such Company Subsidiary obtained commercially reasonable
assignment from the transferring party transferring title to the Intellectual

taken as a whole. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received

applicable Environmental Laws, which compliance includes obtaining

subleases, license agreements and other similar such agreements, including any
amendments or modifications thereto (collectively, the "Company Leases"),
pursuant to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has an interest in
the Leased Real Property. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary nor,
to the Knowledge of the Company, any other party to any Company Lease, is in
default under any of the Company Leases, except where the existence of such
defaults, would not reasonably be expected to be material, individually or in
the aggregate, to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

the properties in connection with the Company Leases, free and clear of all

obligations of the parties identified in the Commitment Letter to make the
full amount of the Financing available to the Purchaser on the terms
and conditions specified therein are not subject to any conditions precedent
or other contingencies other than as set forth therein and, as of the date
hereof, the Commitment Letter (in the form so delivered to the Company) is in
full force and effect and is the legal, valid, binding and enforceable
obligations of the Purchaser and, to the knowledge of the Purchaser, each of
the other parties thereto. The Purchaser has fully paid any and all commitment
fees or other fees that are required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the
Commitment Letter and the related fee letters on or prior to the date of this
Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, the Purchaser has no reason to
believe that it will be unable to satisfy any term or condition to be
satisfied by it as a condition to the availability of the Financing contained
in the Commitment Letter (and the payment of all associated costs and
expenses) or that the Financing will not be made available to the Purchaser at
the Closing, and no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or
breach or failure to satisfy a condition on the part of the Purchaser (or to
the Purchasers knowledge, any other party thereto) under the Commitment
Letter or would otherwise be reasonably likely to result in any portion of the
Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable. The Purchasers obligations
hereunder are not conditioned upon the availability of, or the Purchasers
obtaining of, funds to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

Section 5.5 _Solvency_. The Purchaser is not entering into the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud
either present or future creditors. Assuming (a) the satisfaction of the
conditions to the Purchasers obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and (b) the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Company in _Article IV_ and the Sellers in _Article III_
(without regard to any modification based on "materiality" or "Company
Material Adverse Effect" or any similar qualifier contained in
such representations and warranties), immediately after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any financing in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the payment
of the Final Aggregate Cash Consideration, the Payoff Indebtedness, the
Outstanding Company Expenses, any fees and expenses of or payable by the
Purchaser, any related repayment or refinancing of any indebtedness of the
Company and any other amounts required to be paid by the Purchaser in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), (i) the Company (on a consolidated basis with any and all
Subsidiaries thereof) will not have incurred at such time liabilities
(including the probable amount of contingent liabilities) beyond its ability
to pay such liabilities as they mature or become due, (ii) the then present
fair salable value of the assets of the Company (on a consolidated basis with
any and all Subsidiaries thereof) will at such time exceed the amount that
will be required to pay its probable liabilities (including the probable
amount and value of all contingent liabilities) and its respective debts as
they become absolute and matured, (iii) the assets of the Company (on a
consolidated basis with any and all Subsidiaries thereof), at a fair
valuation, will at such time exceed its respective liabilities (including the
probable amount of all contingent liabilities) (as generally determined
in accordance with applicable federal Law governing determination of the
solvency of debtors) and (iv) the Company (on a consolidated basis with any
and all Subsidiaries thereof) will not at such time have unreasonably small
capital to carry on its business as presently conducted or as proposed to be
conducted of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

 



58 Section 5.6 _Legal Proceedings_. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no
Action pending or, to the knowledge of the Purchaser, threatened against the
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or involving any of their respective
assets or properties that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably
be expected to prevent or delay materially the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. None of the Purchaser or any of
its respective Subsidiaries, or any of their respective assets or properties,
is subject to any outstanding Order that, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to prevent or delay materially the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.7 _No Other Representations or Warranties_.

 

(a) The Purchaser acknowledges that it and its Representatives (i) have
received access to such books and records, facilities, equipment, contracts
and other assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries which it and its
Representatives have desired or requested to review, (ii) have had access to
the "data site" maintained by the Company for purposes of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) have conducted an independent
investigation of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) have had full opportunity to meet
with the management of the Company and to discuss and ask questions regarding
the businesses and assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

 

(b) The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that except as expressly set forth
in _Article IV_ (which includes and is subject to the Company Disclosure
Letter), neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries nor any of
their Representatives has made any representation or warranty, express or
implied, at law or in equity, to the Company or any of their
Representatives with respect to the Company, its business and operations or
otherwise in connection with this Agreement or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby and neither the Company nor any other Person shall be
subject to any liability to the Purchaser or any other Person resulting from
the Companys making available to the Purchaser or the Purchasers use of such
information, or any information, documents or material made available to the
Purchaser in the due diligence materials provided to the Purchaser, including
in the "data site" maintained by the Purchaser for purposes of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in management presentations
(formal or informal) or in any other form in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company
makes no representation or warranty to the Purchaser with respect to any
financial projection or forecast relating to the Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not included in any management presentation.

ARTICLE VI

 

 _COVENANTS_

 

Section 6.1 _Access to Information_. From the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of (a) the Closing or (b) the date on which this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 10.1_, the Sellers shall cause the Company
and each of the Companys Subsidiaries to afford to the

 



59  officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other Representatives of the
Purchaser, reasonable access during normal business hours in a manner that
does not unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries and under the supervision of the Companys personnel
or Representatives to its properties, books, contracts, commitments and
records upon reasonable prior written notice. The Sellers shall cause the
Company and each of the Companys Subsidiaries to also provide the Purchaser
with such access to appropriate individuals (including the management
personnel, attorneys, accountants and other professionals) of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, for discussion of the Companys business,
properties and personnel as the Purchaser may reasonably request, _provided_ ,
that Purchaser shall coordinate all contact with any of the Companys or
the Subsidiaries employees through the Companys Chief Executive Officer,
Chief Financial Officer or Chief Human Resources Officer of the Company.
Purchaser shall coordinate all such contact with any of the employees of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries through the Company or its designee and
any such access or furnishing of information pursuant to this _Section 6.1_
shall be conducted at the Purchasers sole expense. No investigation pursuant
to this  _Section 6.1_ shall affect any representation or warranty in this
Agreement of any party hereto or any condition to the obligations of the
parties hereto. The Sellers shall not be required to cause the Company or the
Companys Subsidiaries to provide access to or to disclose information where
such access or disclosure would contravene any Law or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or would reasonably be
expected to violate or result in a loss or impairment of any attorney-client
or work product privilege. The Sellers will use their respective reasonable
best efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply,
provided that the Sellers shall be under no obligation to breach any such
restrictions.

Section 6.2  _Confidentiality_.

(a) The Purchaser acknowledges that the information provided to it in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including any information provided to the Purchaser pursuant to _Section
6.1_) is subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. From and as of
the Closing, the restrictions on the Purchaser related to non-disclosure of
information of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to have been terminated by the
parties thereto and shall no longer be binding.

 

(b) Vista Equity Partners and its affiliated investment funds ("Vista") have
provided, and may continue to provide after the date hereof and prior to the
Closing, the Company and certain of the Companys and the Company
Subsidiaries executives and certain other employees with access to Vistas
Standard Operating Procedures ("VSOPs") (information about which the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries may provide to the board of directors of the
Company) and certain other proprietary and confidential information of Vista
(the "Vista Confidential Information"). Purchaser agrees on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates that (i) the VSOPs and the other Vista Confidential
Information shall remain subject to the Confidentiality Agreement following
Closing and (ii) Purchaser and its Affiliates shall have no rights in the
VSOPs or other Vista Confidential Information. The foregoing provisions of
this _Section 6.2(b)_ are not intended to prevent or limit the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries from continuing to operate its business in the Ordinary
Course of Business, and the continuation of business practices engaged in by
Company and its Subsidiaries prior to Closing shall not be prohibited by this
_Section 6.2(b)_.

 



60 Section 6.3 _Conduct of Business Pending the Closing Date_. During the period
from the date of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 10.1_ or the
Closing, except (w) as may be required by a Governmental Entity or Law, (x) to
the extent the Purchaser shall otherwise consent in writing, which consent
shall not unreasonably be withheld, delayed or conditioned, (y) as otherwise
expressly provided or expressly permitted in this Agreement and (z) as
provided in  _Section 6.3_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company

Business, and in accordance, in all material respects, with all applicable
Laws and use reasonable best efforts to preserve the material assets and
properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries in good repair and condition,
keep available the services of its present officers, and, in the Ordinary
Course of Business, preserve the current material business relationships of
the Company and its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, except (1) as may be required by a Governmental Entity or Law, (2)

shall not unreasonably be withheld, delayed or conditioned, (3) as otherwise
specifically provided in this Agreement and (4) as provided in _Section 6.3_

Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the termination of this

any asset of the Purchaser or the Purchasers Subsidiaries, or (B) any asset
of the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries, in the case of this _clause

66  Company and the Companys Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (iii) agree to
any other order, action or regulatory condition of any regulatory body,

respective Subsidiaries and would have an effect that is material measured in
relation to the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of the Sellers, the
Company, or any of the Companys Subsidiaries shall propose, negotiate or
offer to commit to any sale, divestiture, license, disposition or

cooperate as requested by the Purchaser in connection with any such sale,
divestiture, license, disposition or hold separate or other action of a type
described in  _Section 6.4(c)_, so long as such sale, divestiture, license,
disposition or hold separate or other action is to be effective only as of the
Closing.

 

(e) The Purchaser acknowledges that certain consents to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement for those designated Contracts set forth on
_Section 4.2(b)(iii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter may be required and
that such consents may not be obtained in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, Purchaser agrees that the Sellers and the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall not have any liability to Purchaser (and Purchaser
shall not be entitled to assert any claims) arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain any consents that may have been or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any
designated Contract set forth on _Section 4.2(b)(iii)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter or because of the default, acceleration or termination of
or loss of right under any such Contract set forth on _Section 4.2(b)(iii)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter as a result thereof; provided that nothing in
this _Section 6.4(e)_ shall have any effect upon or otherwise modify the
condition set forth in _Section 7.2(d)_.

Section 6.5 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) For the period commencing at the Closing and ending on the date that is
twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, the Purchaser agrees to cause the
Company to maintain (i) base salary, wages and bonus opportunity and (ii) each
retirement benefit, health benefit and welfare benefit as disclosed on
_Section 4.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, but not any stock based
benefits (including in respect of any annual or programmatic grants of stock
based benefits), for the officers and employees of the Company and Company
Subsidiaries who

 



67  remain employed after the Closing Date (collectively, the "Company
Employees") at levels that are, in the aggregate, at least substantially
comparable to either (i) those in effect with respect to the Company
Employees and provided by the Company as of the date hereof or (ii) those in
effect for similarly situated employees of the Purchaser, at the Purchasers
election. The Purchaser shall, and following the Closing shall cause the
Company to, treat, and cause the applicable benefit plans in which Company
Employees are entitled to participate to treat, the service of Company
Employees with the Company or any Company Subsidiaries (including, in each
case, any predecessors thereto) attributable to any period before the Closing
as service rendered to the Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Purchaser for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting,
future vacation accruals, determination of severance amounts and for other
appropriate benefits including, but not limited to, applicability of minimum
waiting periods for participation, but excluding benefit accrual (including
minimum pension amount) and eligibility for early retirement under any
defined benefit plan of the Purchaser or eligibility for retiree welfare
benefit plans or as would otherwise result in a duplication of benefits.
Without limiting the foregoing, to the extent permitted by any insurance
carrier, the Purchaser shall cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations,
eligibility waiting periods or required physical examinations under any health
or similar plan of the Purchaser to be waived with respect to
Company Employees and their eligible dependents, to the extent waived or
satisfied under the corresponding plan in which Company Employees participated
immediately prior to the Closing Date, and any deductibles paid by the Company
Employees under any of the Companys or the Company Subsidiaries health
plans in the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs shall, to the extent
permitted by any insurance carrier, be credited towards deductibles and out-
of-pocket expenses under the health plans of the Purchaser or any Subsidiary
of the Purchaser. Company Employees shall be considered to be employed by the
Purchaser "at will" and, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to (i)
limit the ability of the Purchaser or the Company to terminate the employment
of any such Company Employee at any time, (ii) confer upon any Company
Employee, or any representative of any such Company Employee, any rights or
remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment for any
period or terms of employment, for any nature whatsoever, (iii) prevent or
restrict the Purchaser or its Affiliates from modifying the terms of
employment of any Company Employee after the Closing Date or (iv)
provided that Purchaser otherwise satisfies its foregoing obligations in the
first sentence of this paragraph, amend any employee benefit or compensation
plan, program or arrangement sponsored or contributed to by the Company or its
Affiliates. Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section 6.5(a)_, no
provision in this _Section 6.5_ shall create any third party beneficiary or
other rights in any executive officers, directors or employees of the Company,
any Company Subsidiary or any other Person other than the Purchaser or the
Company and no executive officers, directors or employees of the Sellers, the
Company or any Company Subsidiary are entitled to enforce the covenants
contained in this  _Section 6.5_.

(b) Subject to _Section 6.5(a)_, the Purchaser shall have sole discretion
with respect to the determination as to whether or when to terminate, merge
or continue any employee benefit plans and programs of the Company and the
Companys Subsidiaries. Unless the Purchaser requests otherwise in writing at
least three (3) Business Days prior to Closing, the Companys board of
directors shall adopt resolutions terminating, effective no later than the day
prior to the Closing Date, any Company Pension Plan that is intended to meet
the requirements of Section 401(k) of the Code, and that is sponsored, or
contributed to, by the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries (each, a
"Company 401(k) Plan"). At the Closing, the Company

 



68  shall provide to the Purchaser executed resolutions of the Companys board
of directors authorizing such termination. If the Company 401(k) Plan is so
terminated, Purchaser shall allow Company employees who otherwise meet
applicable age and service requirements to enroll under Purchasers 401(k)
plan as soon as administratively practicable after of the Closing, but in no
event later than 90 days after the Closing.

 

Section 6.6 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) The Purchaser agrees that any rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses, exculpation or other similar rights now existing in favor of, and
all limitations on the personal liability of, each present and former director
or officer of the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries (each, a "Covered
Party") provided for in the respective organizational documents in effect as
of the date hereof shall continue in full force and effect (and with respect
to the Company and its Subsidiaries, shall be reflected in the applicable
organizational documents of such entity), for a period of six (6) years after
the Closing Date; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to any claim
based on a claim for indemnification made by a Covered Party pursuant to
_Article IX_. During such period, the Purchaser shall not, nor shall it
following the Closing permit the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries to,
amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions for indemnification or
advancement of expenses in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any Covered Party in respect of actions or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Closing (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), unless such modification is required by Law. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Covered Party seeking to
enforce any such provisions for indemnification or advancements of expenses
shall first seek recovery against the DandO Tail Policy referenced in _Section
6.6(b)_ for any claim of exculpation or indemnification or expense
advancement or reimbursement before pursuing any right of exculpation or
indemnification or expense advancement or reimbursement directly against the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall, or if the Purchaser
is unable to, the Sellers shall, or shall cause the Company to, have arranged
for a fully paid and irrevocable "directors and officers" tail insurance
policy (the "DandO Tail Policy"), which DandO Tail Policy will provide coverage
for six (6) years following the Closing Date on terms which are no less
favorable than the existing coverage maintained by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (which policy has been provided by the Seller to the Purchaser
prior to the date hereof). The Sellers shall pay for that portion of the DandO
Tail Policy which provides substantially similar coverage as the existing
coverage maintained by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (such amount
payable by the Sellers, the " _D andO Tail Amount_"), and the Purchaser shall
pay for all incremental costs and expenses resulting from any coverage greater
than the existing coverage maintained by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to the extent such incremental costs and expenses relate to the
coverage obtained by, at the direction of or with the written consent of the
Purchaser and its Affiliates. The Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not amend
or cancel such insurance policy during such six (6)-year period and shall
reasonably cooperate with Sellers Designee (and their Affiliates), at the
sole cost and expense of Sellers Designee, with respect to the pursuit of any
claims, coverage or the enforcement of rights thereunder. The provisions of
this _Section 6.6_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each such Covered Party and such Persons estate, heirs and
representatives and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses or contribution that any
such Covered Party may have pursuant to Law, the organizational documents of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, contract or otherwise.

 



69 (c) If, following the Closing, the Purchaser or the Company or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets, then, and in each such case,
to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of the Purchaser and the Company, as the case may be, assume the
obligations set forth in this  _Section 6.6_.

Section 6.7 _Publicity_. None of the Sellers, the Purchaser or the Company
shall, and the Purchaser and the Company shall not permit any of their
respective Subsidiaries to, issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other public announcement with respect to, or otherwise make any
public statement concerning, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
without the consent of the other parties (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) other than any such disclosure
as may be required by applicable Law (including the Securities Act
or Exchange Act and any rules promulgated thereunder by the SEC) or the
applicable rules of any stock exchange, in which event such party shall
endeavor, on a basis that is commercially reasonable under the circumstances,
to provide an opportunity to the other parties to review and comment upon
such press release or other announcement to the fullest extent permitted by
law and shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested thereto.

 

Section 6.8 _Notification of Certain Matters; Supplemental Disclosure_.
Between the date hereof and the Closing, the Sellers Designee or the Company
will promptly notify the Purchaser in writing of (i) any inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty or breach of any covenant applicable to it
contained herein of which any of the Sellers or the Company is aware of that,
in either case, would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in a failure
of any condition set forth in _Article VII_ , (ii) any Change of which any of
the Sellers or the Company is aware of that has had or would reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (iii) any material
communication received by it from any Governmental Entity in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) any written
communication received by it from any Person alleging that a consent of such
Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (v) any cancelation or termination by any Top Merchant
Customer, Top Referral Provider, Top Integrated Technology Partner, or
financial institution or Card Association party to a Sponsorship Agreement or
other Primary Business Contract with the Company or any Company Subsidiary, of
its relationship with the Company or any Company Subsidiary or the receipt of
any written notice from any such Person that any such Person intends to
cancel, terminate or otherwise materially and adversely modify its
relationship with the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

 

Section 6.9 _Resignation of Members of Governing Bodies_. Prior to or at the
Closing, each Seller shall (a) cause any Person who is an employee of such
Seller, or of any controlling Affiliate of any Seller, to tender his or her
resignation from the board of directors or similar governing body of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries effective as of the Closing Date, and (b)
use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such Person who is not an
employee of any Seller to tender his or her resignation from the board of
directors or similar governing body of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
effective as of the Closing Date.

 



70 Section 6.10 _Financing and Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) The Sellers and the Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries to, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause

Closing)) and (B) materials for rating agency presentations, (iv) cooperating

are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to
harm or disparage the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _further_ ,

the request for such information is received by the Company at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date) and (x) taking all other corporate
actions, subject to the occurrence of the Closing, as may be reasonably

party. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, (1) the effectiveness of any documentation executed by the Company or
any of the Companys Subsidiaries with respect to the Financing (including all
documentation required or requested pursuant to this  _Section 6.10(a)_)
shall be subject to the occurrence of the Closing, (2) nothing herein shall
require cooperation contemplated thereby to the extent it would interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and (3) nothing herein shall require the Sellers or the Company
to cause the delivery of any legal opinions or any certificate as to solvency
by the Sellers or the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) Whether or not the Closing occurs, the Purchaser shall (i) promptly, upon
request by the Sellers or the Company, reimburse the Sellers or the Company,
as the case may be, for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) actually incurred by the
Sellers or the Company or their respective Representatives in connection with
the cooperation of the Sellers, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
contemplated by this _Section 6.10_ and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless the
Sellers, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective

information relating to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries and any
information provided by the Sellers, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or
their respective Representatives) and any assistance or activities in
connection therewith to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, except

by the Sellers, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives.

(c) Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Purchaser shall use, and shall cause the Subsidiaries of the Purchaser to use,
their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange and consummate the Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Commitment Letter and the related fee letters (including, to
the extent required, the full exercise of the "flex" provisions related
thereto) on or prior to the Closing Date, including using reasonable best
efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter and satisfy on a
timely basis (taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing
Period) all conditions to the Financing in the Commitment Letter and the
definitive agreements to be entered into pursuant thereto (other than any
condition where the failure to be so satisfied is a direct result of any of
the Sellers or the Companys failure to furnish information or perform in
all material respects its other obligations required to be delivered or
performed under this Agreement (including _Section 6.10(a)_ )), to the
extent applicable to or within the control of the Purchaser or the Purchaser
Subsidiaries, (ii) negotiate, execute and deliver definitive agreements with
respect to such Financing on terms consistent in all material respects with
the terms and conditions (including the "flex" provisions) contemplated by
the Commitment Letter and the related fee letters, and (iii) in the event that
the conditions to Closing under this Agreement and 

 



73  the conditions to the availability of the Financing under the Commitment
Letter are satisfied, draw a sufficient amount of the Financing to enable the
Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Purchaser shall keep Sellers Designee and the Company informed on a current
basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing and provide the Company with copies of all executed definitive
agreements related to the Financing (provided, that provisions related to
fees, pricing, economic "flex" terms, "securities demand", thresholds, caps
and other items not affecting conditionality have been redacted). Subject to
the terms and upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Commitment
Letter, the Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Financing Parties to provide the Financing on the Closing Date;  _provided_ ,
that, nothing in this Agreement shall require the Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries to litigate or initiate any other action or proceeding against
any Financing Party or Financing Source Related Party. In the event
any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
(including any "flex" provisions) contemplated in the Commitment Letter and
the related fee letters, and such portion is reasonably required to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including without
limitation, to pay the Final Aggregate Cash Consideration, the Payoff
Indebtedness, the Company Expenses and all other fees and expenses and other
payment obligations required to be paid by the Purchaser in connection with
this Agreement, (A) the Purchaser shall promptly notify Sellers Designee and
the Company and (B) the Purchaser shall use its, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to use their, reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain
Alternative Financing in an amount at least equal to the amount of such
portion, upon terms and conditions not materially less favorable to the
Purchaser and Purchasers Subsidiaries than the terms and conditions set
forth in the Commitment Letter as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event. The Purchaser shall promptly (and in any event
within two (2) Business Days) notify Sellers Designee and the Company in
writing (I) of any breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give
rise to any breach or default) by the Purchaser under the Commitment Letter or
any definitive agreements related thereto or, to the knowledge of the
Purchaser, any other party to the Commitment Letter or any definitive
agreements related thereto, (II) if for any reason the Purchaser at any time
believes it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on
the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Commitment
Letter or any definitive agreements related thereto and (III) of the receipt
by the Purchaser or any of its Representatives of any written notice or other
written communication (or, to the knowledge of the Purchaser, any oral notice
or other communication) from any Financing Party or any Financing Source
Related Party with respect to (x) any breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letter, any definitive agreement
related thereto or any provision of the financing contemplated pursuant to the
Commitment Letter (including any proposal by any lender named in the
Commitment Letter to withdraw, terminate, reduce the amount of financing or
materially delay the timing of financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter) or (y) any material dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to the Commitment Letter or any definitive agreement related thereto
that could result in the Purchaser not receiving or a material delay in the
Purchasers receipt of the proceeds of the Financing, and in any such case,
the Purchaser shall provide any information relating to any of the foregoing
circumstances as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within two
(2) Business Days) following the Companys reasonable request therefor;
_provided_ , that in no event shall the Purchaser be required to disclose any
information that is subject to attorney-client or

 



74  similar privilege if the Purchaser has used commercially reasonable efforts
to disclose such information in a way that would not waive such privilege. In
the event that the Purchaser does not provide access or information in
reliance on the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, the Purchaser
shall provide written notice to the Company that such access or information is
being withheld and the Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable information in a way that
would not violate the applicable obligation or risk waiver of such privilege.
The Purchaser shall not, without the Companys prior written consent, consent
to (1) any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy under, the Commitment Letter or the related fee letters if such
amendment, modification or waiver (a) imposes new or additional
conditions, or otherwise expands or makes more restrictive any of the
conditions, to the Purchasers receipt of the Financing, (b) extends the
timing of the funding of the commitments thereunder, or reduces the aggregate
cash amount of the funding commitments thereunder, or (c) otherwise amends,
modifies or waives, any provision of the Commitment Letter, in any such case
where such amendment, modification or waiver described in this clause (1)
would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially
adversely affect the ability of the Purchaser to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the " _Restricted Commitment
Letter Amendments_ ") ( _provided_ , _that_ the Purchaser may replace or
amend the Commitment Letter to add lenders, underwriters, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, initial purchasers, placement agents, syndication agents or
similar entities that have not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date
hereof) or (2) early termination of the Commitment Letter unless it has been
replaced by Alternative Financing in accordance with this _Section 6.10_.
The Purchaser shall furnish to Sellers Designee and the Company a copy of
any amendment, modification, waiver or consent of or relating to the
Commitment promptly upon execution thereof (which copy may be redacted in the
manner described in _Section 5.4_). The Purchaser shall use, and shall
cause the Purchaser Subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of the Commitment Letter or any Alternative Financing
arrangement until the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated. Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 6.10(c)_ or
in any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall the Purchaser be
required (y) to amend or waive any of the terms or conditions of this
Agreement or (z) to consummate the Closing any earlier than as required by
_Section 2.4_.

 

(d) The Sellers and the Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries to notify the Purchaser in writing if the Sellers or the Company
determine that (i) any Required Information is no longer Compliant or (ii) any
financial statements included in the Required Information must be restated.

 

(e) In the event that the Commitment Letter is amended, replaced, supplemented
or otherwise modified, including as a result of obtaining Alternative
Financing, or if the Purchaser substitutes other debt or equity financing for
all or a portion of the Financing or any Alternative Financing, (i) true,
complete and correct copies of the definitive documentation for any
such Alternative Financing (the "Alternative Financing Documents") shall be
provided by the Purchaser to the Company promptly after such Alternative
Financing commitment letter or other Alternative Financing Documents are fully
executed, (ii) the Sellers and the Company shall comply with their respective
covenants in this _Section 6.10_ with respect to the Commitment Letter as so
amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified and with respect to
such Alternative Financing or other debt or equity financing to the same
extent that the Purchaser, the

 



75  Sellers and the Company would have been obligated to comply with respect to
the Financing and (iii) no such amendment, replacement, supplement or other
modification shall result in additional or expanded covenants of the Sellers
or the Company. The representations, warranties and covenants of and other
restrictions on the Purchaser contained in this Agreement (and any other
provisions herein with respect to the Financing and the Commitment Letter)
shall apply equally to any Alternative Financing and Alternative Financing
Documents.

(f) All non-public or other confidential information provided by the Sellers,
the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives
pursuant to this _Section 6.10_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement,  _Section 6.2_ and any other applicable terms
of this Agreement; _provided_ that the Purchaser shall be permitted to
disclose such information to the Financing Parties identified in the
Commitment Letter, any provider of Alternative Financing and their respective
Representatives in connection with the Financing and any Alternative Financing
so long as such Persons agree to be bound by the confidentiality provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement or other reasonable and customary
confidentiality undertakings in respect of transactions similar to that
contemplated by the Financing or any Alternative Financing.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall any
failure to obtain any Financing (or any Alternative Financing) nor any
failure to fund any Financing (or any Alternative Financing) relieve the
Purchaser of any obligation under or in respect of this Agreement, including
the obligation to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as required hereby, and neither the obtaining nor the availability
or funding of any Financing (or any Alternative Financing) shall constitute a
condition to the Purchasers obligation to timely consummate the transactions

instruct each Person which has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement
relating to an Acquisition Proposal with or for the benefit of the Sellers,

disclose and submit to its stockholders, in a manner that meets the
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5) of the

would constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(2) of the Code on account of the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement ("Section 280G Payments"), such that the deduction of such payments
and benefits will not be limited by the application of Section 280G of the
Code in the event the requisite stockholder approval is obtained. The Company
shall use its best efforts to obtain duly executed 280G Waivers from all
individuals prior to the Company stockholders vote. The Company shall forward
to the Purchaser prior to submission to the Companys stockholders copies of
all documents that will be submitted to the Companys stockholders in
connection with this _Section 6.14_. Prior to Closing, the Company shall
deliver to the Purchaser executed copies of any such documents, a record of
all shareholder disclosures made in connection with this Section 6.14, and the
results of the shareholder vote. The parties acknowledge that for purposes of
determining Section 280G Payments pursuant to this Section 6.14, Purchaser
shall provide the Company information regarding any Purchaser Arrangements not
later than ten (10) days prior to the Closing, and, notwithstanding the
above, the Company will take into account such timely provided information
when determining whether any Section 280G Payments exist. The parties
acknowledge that to the extent that the Purchaser Arrangements are not timely
and accurately provided by the Purchaser, the Company shall not have any
liability with respect to its reliance on such information and shall not be in
violation of this Section 6.14.

 

Section 6.15 _Seller Cooperation on Certain Matters_. After the date hereof
and prior to the Closing, the Sellers and the Company shall confer with the
Purchaser on a regular and continued basis regarding the general status of the
ongoing operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and integration
planning matters and communicate and consult with such Persons identified by
the Purchaser to the Sellers with respect to the foregoing; _provided_ that
the Sellers and the Companys access and disclosure obligations under this

the earlier of the Closing or the date on which this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 10.1, (a) the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to prevent the termination
or lapse of the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries existing cyber-
security insurance policy, management liability insurance policy and crime

their respective termination and (b) the Sellers and the Company shall keep

partys failure to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement.

 



80 ARTICLE VIII

Section 8.1 _Tax Returns and Payment of Taxes_. After the Closing, the
Purchaser shall have the obligation and authority to file or cause to be

or shall cause the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, to make

provide reasonable explanation of any documents or information provided

use its commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any such disruption.

 

(b) Any request for information or documents pursuant to this _Section 8.2_

the request) provide the requested information. The requesting party shall
indemnify the other party for any reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred
by such party in this _Section 8.2_. Any information obtained under this

ARTICLE IX

_INDEMNIFICATION _

Section 9.1 _Indemnification Obligations of the Sellers_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, the Sellers shall, severally and not jointly
in accordance with each such Sellers Pro Rata Seller Share, defend and hold
harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties from, against, and in respect of,
any and all claims, liabilities, obligations, damages, losses, costs,
expenses, penalties, fines and judgments (at equity or at law, including
statutory and common) (including amounts paid in settlement, costs of
investigation and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) (each a "Loss")
incurred or suffered by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties arising out of or
relating to:

 

(i) any breach of any Company Fundamental Representation (for purposes of this
_Section 9.1(a)(i)_, such representations and warranties shall be read
without reference to materiality, Company Material Adverse Effect or similar
monetary and non-monetary qualifications);

 

(ii) any willful and intentional breach of any covenant, agreement or
undertaking made by the Company in this Agreement; or 

(iii) any Closing Indebtedness or Outstanding Company Expenses solely to the
extent not paid on or prior to the Closing Date or included in the
calculation of Final Aggregate Cash Consideration.

(b) From and after the Closing, each of the Sellers shall defend and hold
harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties from, against, and in respect of
any and all Losses incurred or suffered by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
arising out of or relating to:

 

(i) any breach by such Seller of any Seller Fundamental Representation (for
purposes of this _Section 9.1(b)(i)_, such representations and warranties
shall be read without reference to materiality, Company Material Adverse
Effect or similar monetary and non-monetary qualifications); or

 

(ii) any willful and intentional breach of any covenant, agreement or
undertaking made by such Seller in this Agreement.

 

The Losses incurred or suffered by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties arising
out of or relating to matters described in this  _Section 9.1_ as to which
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification are
collectively referred to as "Purchaser Losses."

 



82 Section 9.2 _Indemnification Obligations of the Purchaser_. From and after the
Closing, the Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller
Indemnified Parties from, against and in respect of any and all Losses
incurred or suffered by the Seller Indemnified Parties arising out of or
relating to any breach of any of the Purchaser Fundamental Representations.
The Losses incurred or suffered by the Seller Indemnified Parties described in
this _Section 9.2_ as to which the Seller Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification are collectively referred to as "Seller Losses."

Section 9.3 _Indemnification Procedure_.

 

(a) Promptly following receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice of the
commencement of any Action against such Indemnified Party by a third party (a
"Third Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party shall, if a claim with respect
thereto is to be made against any party obligated to provide indemnification
pursuant to this _Article IX_ (the "Indemnifying Party"), give such
Indemnifying Party prompt written notice of such Third Party Claim on or prior
to the expiration of the applicable Claims Period, which prompt written notice
must include the nature and amount of the Purchaser Losses or Seller Losses
related thereto, to the extent that the nature and amount thereof are actually
determinable at such time, reasonable detail in light of the circumstances
then known to such Indemnified Party, and the basis for indemnification. In
the event of a claim by a Purchaser Indemnified Party, such notice shall be
provided to Sellers Designee. The failure to promptly give such notice to the
Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability
hereunder with respect to such Third Party Claim only if, and only to the
extent that, such failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party results in the
forfeiture by the Indemnifying Party of rights and defenses otherwise
available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim.
The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice delivered to
the Indemnified Party within twenty (20) days thereafter, after acknowledging
in writing that it would have an indemnification obligation in respect of any
Purchaser Losses or Seller Losses (as the case may be) resulting from such
Third Party Claim (subject to the limitations of this _Article IX_ ), to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, to the extent such Third Party
Claim involves solely monetary damages, including the employment of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of the fees
and disbursements of such counsel; _provided_ , _however_ , that an
Indemnifying Party will not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third
Party Claim if (i) such Third Party Claim could result in criminal liability
of, or equitable remedies against, the Indemnified Party, or (ii) the
interests of the Indemnified Party, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to
the Indemnified Party, are in conflict or a potential conflict exists with the
interests of the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim,
and as a result, the Indemnifying Party could not adequately represent the
interests of the Indemnified Party in such Third Party Claim. In the event,
however, that the Indemnifying Party declines or fails to assume, or is not
permitted to assume, the defense of the Third Party Claim as set forth in
this _Section 9.3(a)_ or to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party, in either case within such twenty (20) day period, then
such Indemnified Party may employ counsel to represent or defend it in any
such Third Party Claim and the associated fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be indemnifiable losses hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay the fees and disbursements of
more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in connection with the
defense of any Third Party Claim. In any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party or the Indemnifying Party, whichever is not assuming the defense of such
Third Party Claim, shall have the right to participate in such Third

 



83  Party Claim and to retain its own counsel at such Partys own expense. The
Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party (as the case may be) shall at all
times use reasonable efforts to keep the Indemnifying Party or the
Indemnified Party (as the case may be) reasonably apprised of the status of
the defense of any Third Party Claim the defense of which it is maintaining
and to cooperate in good faith with each other with respect to the defense of
any such matter. No Indemnified Party or Indemnifying Party may settle or
compromise any Third Party Claim with respect to which indemnification is
being sought hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless such
settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of the
Indemnifying Party and its officers, directors, managers, employees and
Affiliates from all liability arising out of such claim. An Indemnifying
Party may not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to a Third Party Claim unless such
settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of
the Indemnified Party and its officers, directors, managers, employees and
Affiliates from all liability arising out of such claim, (y) does not contain
any admission or statement suggesting any wrongdoing or liability on behalf
of the Indemnified Party and (z) does not contain any equitable order,
judgment or term that in any manner affects, restrains or interferes with the
business of the Indemnified Party or any of the Indemnified Partys
Affiliates.

(b) If an Indemnified Party claims a right to indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement for any matter that is not a Third Party Claim, such Indemnified
Party shall promptly send written notice of such claim to the appropriate
Indemnifying Party and such written notice must be delivered on or prior to
the expiration of the applicable Claims Period. Such notice shall specify the
basis for such claim and the nature and amount of any Seller Losses or
Purchaser Losses related thereto, to the extent that the nature and amount
thereof are actually determinable at such time. Provided that such
notification is delivered on or prior to the expiration of the applicable
Claims Period, the failure by any Indemnified Party to so promptly notify the
Indemnified Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability
that it may have to such Indemnified Party with respect to any claim made
pursuant to this _Section 9.3(b)_, except to the extent that Indemnifying
party is actually prejudiced by such failure or delay. If the Indemnifying
Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days following
its receipt of such written notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes its
liability to the Indemnified Party under this _Article IX_ or the amount
thereof, the claim specified by the Indemnified Party in such notice shall be
conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party under this _Article
IX_ , and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such liability to the
Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after such determination. In the
event the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its liability with respect to
such claim as provided above, as promptly as possible, such Indemnified Party
and the appropriate Indemnifying Party shall establish the merits and amount
of such claim (by mutual agreement, litigation, arbitration or otherwise) and,
within five (5) Business Days following the final determination of the merits
and amount of such claim, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified
Party in immediately available funds an amount equal to such claim as
determined hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this
_Section 9.3(b)_ shall not apply in the case of a Third Party Claim, which
Third Party Claim shall be governed by _Section 9.3(a)_.

Section 9.4 _Claims Period_. The Claims Period hereunder shall begin on the
Closing Date and terminate on the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Closing Date; _provided_ , that

 



84  the Claims Period with respect to breaches of the Company Fundamental
Representations and the Seller Fundamental Representations set forth in
_Section 9.1(a)(i)_ and  _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ and the breach of any
Purchaser Fundamental Representations as set forth in _Section 9.2_ shall
begin on the Closing Date and terminate upon the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations. An Indemnifying Party shall not be liable with
respect to any claim under _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.2_, as applicable,
unless written notice of a possible claim for indemnification is given by the
claiming Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party on or before the
applicable Claims Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the
close of business on the last day of the applicable Claims Period, an
Indemnifying Party shall have been notified in writing of a Claim
for indemnity hereunder and in accordance with _Section 9.3_ hereof and such
Claim shall not have been finally resolved or disposed of at such date, such
Claim shall continue to survive and shall remain a basis for indemnity
hereunder until such Claim is finally resolved or disposed of in accordance
with the terms hereof.

Section 9.5 _Payments; Limitations_.

 

(a) Any payment pursuant to a claim for indemnification shall be made not
later than thirty (30) days after receipt by the Indemnifying Party of
written notice from the Indemnified Party, unless the claim is subject to
defense as provided in _Section 9.3_, in which case payment shall be made not
later than thirty (30) days after the amount of the claim is
finally determined.

(b) Any amounts for Purchaser Losses owed by the Sellers pursuant to this
_Article IX_ shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated in advance by Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the liability of any Seller pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall in no event
exceed the aggregate proceeds actually received by such Seller under this
Agreement. Any amounts for Seller Losses owed by the Purchaser pursuant to
this _Article IX_ shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated in advance by Sellers Designee.

Section 9.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. The parties hereto agree that, excluding (a)
any claim for specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief
as provided in _Section 11.12_, (b) any claim related to fraud by the
Sellers, the Company or the Purchaser in connection with the transactions
related to this Agreement, (c) any matter related to _Section 2.3_, or (d)
for matters related to the Escrow Agreement, the Non-Solicitation and No-Hire
Agreement, and the Mutual Release, the indemnification provisions of this
_Article IX_ , and the letter agreement among the Sellers and the Purchaser
are intended to provide the sole and exclusive remedy as to all claims either
the Sellers, on the one hand, or the Purchaser, on the other hand, may incur
arising from or relating to this Agreement from and after the Closing,
including with respect to breaches of representations and warranties or
covenants by the Purchaser, Sellers or the Company set forth herein.

 

Section 9.7 _Power of Sellers  Designee_. Without limiting the foregoing, for
purposes of _Section 9.3_ (a) if any or all Sellers comprise the
Indemnifying Party, any references to the Indemnifying Party (except
provisions relating to an obligation to make any payments) shall be deemed to
refer to Sellers Designee, and (b) if any or all Sellers comprise the
Indemnified Party, any references to the Indemnified Party (except provisions
relating to an obligation to make or a right to receive any payments) shall be
deemed to refer to Sellers Designee.

 



85 Section 9.8 _Determination of Loss Amount_. The amount of any Purchaser Losses
subject to indemnification under _Section 9.1_ and Seller Losses subject to
indemnification under _Section 9.2_ shall be calculated net of (a) any Tax
Benefit inuring to any Purchaser Indemnified Party (on account of any
such Purchaser Loss) to the extent that such Tax Benefit is realized or
utilized in the year in which the claim for indemnification or the payment
with respect to such indemnification claim is made and (b) any third party
insurance proceeds actually recovered by the Purchaser (on account of any
such Purchaser Loss) net of any deductible amounts, increases in premiums and
costs, expenses (including attorneys fees and other costs of recovery) paid
or incurred with respect to such proceeds, and Taxes paid or incurred with
respect to such proceeds. In no event shall any Purchaser Indemnified Party or
Seller Indemnified Party be entitled to recover or make a claim for any
amounts in respect of punitive damages, except to the extent punitive damages
are awarded to a third party.

Section 9.9 _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. Any indemnification payment
made pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the

warranties of the Sellers and the Company contained in this Agreement, the
Seller Disclosure Letter, the Company Disclosure Letter and the certificates
of the Sellers and the Company delivered pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)(i)_ and

9.4_. All covenants of the parties contained in this Agreement shall survive
the Closing and remain in full force and effect, regardless of any
investigation or disclosure made by or on behalf of any parties to this

in this _Section 9.10_ shall have any effect on (a) any right to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.1_ or  _Section 9.2_ in respect of
any Claim based upon any breach of a representation, warranty or covenant that
is set forth in a valid notice of claim delivered in accordance with _Section

to the Closing only as follows:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of the Purchaser and Sellers Designee;

 

(b) by either the Purchaser or Sellers Designee if any Governmental Entity of

enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that the party seeking
to terminate this Agreement shall have used its reasonable best efforts to
have such Order lifted; _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this _Section 10.1(b)_ shall not be available to any
party if the willful and intentional breach of any provision of
this Agreement by such party has been a principal cause of the issuance of
such final and non-appealable Order;

(c) by the Purchaser or Sellers Designee if the Closing shall not have been
consummated on or before July 24, 2016 (the "Termination Date"); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this  _Section
10.1(c)_ shall not be available to any party if the willful and intentional
breach of any provision of this Agreement by such party has been a principal
cause of or resulted in the failure of the Closing to be consummated on
or before such date;

(d) by the Purchaser, in the event of a material breach by any Seller or the
Company of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement
contained herein, which (i) would result in a failure of a condition set forth
in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_, and (ii) cannot reasonably be
expected to be cured by the Termination Date; _provided_ that the Purchaser
is not in breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement that would result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section
7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_;  _provided_ , _further_ , that the Purchaser
shall have given Sellers Designee and the Company written notice, delivered
at least thirty (30) days prior to such termination, stating the Purchasers
intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(d)_, a
reasonably detailed description of the basis for such termination and Sellers
Designee and the Company shall have the opportunity to cure such failure
during such thirty (30) day period; or

(e) by Sellers Designee, in the event of a material breach by the Purchaser
of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained
herein, which (i) would result in a failure of a condition set forth in
_Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_, and (ii) cannot reasonably be expected
to be cured by the Termination Date;  _provided_ that none of the Sellers or
the Company is in breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained
in this Agreement that would result in a failure of a condition set forth in
_Section 7.2(a)_ or  _Section 7.2(b)_; _provided_ , _further_ , that
Sellers Designee shall have given the Purchaser written notice, delivered at
least thirty (30) days prior to such termination, stating Sellers Designee

reasonably detailed description of the basis for such termination and the
Purchaser shall have the opportunity to cure such failure during such thirty
(30) day period. 

 



87 Section 10.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the valid termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_ by the Purchaser, on the one hand,
or Sellers Designee, on the other hand, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no effect, and there shall be no liability hereunder on the part
of any Seller, the Purchaser, or the Company, except that _Section 6.2_
(Confidentiality), _Section 6.7_ (Publicity), _Section 6.10(b)_ (Financing
Cooperation), this _Section 10.2_, the relevant defined terms in  _Article
I_ and _Article XI_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

or release any party to this Agreement of any liability or damages
arising out of such partys fraud or any willful and material breach of any
provision of this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement or any other
agreement delivered in connection herewith. For purposes of clarification, the
parties agree that (a) if Purchaser does not close the transactions
contemplated hereby in circumstances in which all of the closing conditions
set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ have been satisfied or waived
and the Closing is required to take place pursuant to _Section 2.4_, such
event shall be deemed to be a willful and material breach by the Purchaser of
this Agreement and (b) if the Sellers do not close the transactions
contemplated hereby in circumstances in which all of the closing conditions
set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.3_ have been satisfied or waived
and the Closing is required to take place pursuant to _Section 2.4_, such
event shall be deemed to be a willful and material breach by the Sellers of
this Agreement.

ARTICLE XI

 

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

 

Section 11.1 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement and _Section 6.10(b)(i)_ (Financing Cooperation), whether or
not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring
such costs and expenses including, but not limited to, any such costs and
expenses incurred by any party hereto in connection with the negotiation,
preparation and performance of and compliance with the terms of this
Agreement (including the fees and expenses of legal counsel, accountants,
investment bankers or other representatives and consultants); _provided_ that
the Company shall bear all fees and expenses of the Sellers, which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall be deemed to be Company Expenses; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Purchaser shall be solely responsible for all filing fees
under the HSR Act and any other Regulatory Law.

 

Section 11.2 _Extension; Waiver_. Subject to the express limitations herein,
at any time prior to the Closing, any party hereto may (a) extend the time

hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein by any other party or in any document, certificate or
writing delivered pursuant hereto by any other party or (c) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on
the part of any party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party
and, in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be
effective. No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise
of any right hereunder shall impair such right or be construed as a waiver
of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement herein, nor shall any single or partial

 



88  exercise of any such right preclude other or further exercise thereof or of
any other right. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be
deemed or shall constitute, a waiver of any other provisions, whether or not
similar, nor shall any waiver constitute a continuing waiver.

requests, claims, demands, waivers and other communications hereunder shall be
in writing and shall be delivered by hand or overnight courier service or sent

contained herein and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral
and written, with respect thereto, other than the Escrow Agreement, the Non-

extent of the specific obligations undertaken by such named party in such
agreement and not otherwise), no Seller Related Party

 



90  or Purchaser Related Party shall have any liability or obligation whatsoever

to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto. Other than (a)

and (y) each Seller (including Sellers Designee) may assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates without prior

Designee) of any of its obligations hereunder. Any attempted assignment in

warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the
parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any
inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by
the parties hereto in accordance with _Section 11.2_ without notice or
liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge

hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement
as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

or modified except by a written instrument executed by the Purchaser, on the
one hand, and Sellers Designee (on behalf of all of the Sellers), on the
other hand . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any amendment or
modification to _Section 11.6_, this  _Section 11.7_, _Section 11.9_,

consent of the Financing Parties.

counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, and all of
which together shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument. Signed

.pdf image.

 



91 Section 11.9 _Applicable Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement and all claims or
causes of action (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) that may be based
upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution
or performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based
upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or
in connection with this Agreement) shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. In addition, each
of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding
with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of
this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by any
party hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined
exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery, or, solely if the Delaware
Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any federal court within the State of Delaware, or, solely if both the
Delaware Court of Chancery and the federal courts within the State of Delaware
decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any other state court
within the State of Delaware, and, in each case, any appellate court
therefrom. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard
to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property,
generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the
aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any action or proceeding
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this
Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction
of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in
accordance with this _Section 11.9_ , (b) any claim that it or its property
is exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal
process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by
the applicable Law, any claim that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in such
court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action
or proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter
hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that service of process upon such party in any such action or
proceeding shall be effective if such process is given as a notice in
accordance with _Section 11.3_ or in any other manner permitted by
applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party hereto, nor any of
its Affiliates, will bring, or support the bringing of, any claim, whether at
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any
Financing Party, in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Commitment Letter or the performance thereof,
anywhere other than in (i) New York State court sitting in the County of New
York or (ii) United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York.

 

Section 11.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF ANY LITIGATION

 



92  DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY
OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

 

Section 11.11 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions
hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in
any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is
invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the
event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such invalid or unenforceable term.

 

Section 11.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that (i)
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
hereof or were otherwise breached, and (ii) the parties will be entitled to
specific performance of the terms hereof in addition to any other remedy
to which such party is entitled at law or in equity, including monetary
damages. Without limiting the foregoing, (A) the Purchaser shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions, without any proof of damages or bond or other
security being required, to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Company
or any of the Sellers and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement and (B) the Company and the Sellers shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, without any proof of damages or bond or other
security being required, to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the
Purchaser and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
performance is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any
reason. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the right of specific
enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and without such right, none of the parties would have entered
into this Agreement.

Section 11.13 _Non-Recourse to Financing Parties_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, none of the Seller Related Parties shall
have any rights or claims against any Financing Source Related Party in
connection with this Agreement, the Financing, any Alternative Financing, or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise. This _Section 11.13_ is intended to benefit
the Financing Source Related Parties and may be enforced by the Financing
Parties or provider of any Alternative Financing and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of the parties hereto.

 

Section 11.14 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have
been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and have participated jointly in the drafting of this Agreement and,
therefore, waive the application of any Law, holding or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document shall
be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

 



93 Section 11.15 _Negotiation of Agreement_. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges that it has been represented by independent counsel of its
choice throughout all negotiations that have preceded the execution of this
Agreement and that it has executed the same with consent and upon the advice
of said independent counsel. Each party hereto and its counsel cooperated in
the drafting and preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to
herein, and any and all drafts relating thereto will be deemed the work
product of the parties and may not be construed against any party by reason
of its preparation. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision that
would require interpretation of any ambiguities in this Agreement against the
party that drafted it is of no application and is hereby expressly waived.

 

Section 11.16 _Conflicts; Privileges_. The Purchaser agrees that from and
after the date of the Closing, it and the Company shall take all steps
necessary to ensure that any privilege attaching as a result of Kirkland and
Ellis LLP or other counsel from time to time retained by Sellers or the
Company prior to the Closing (collectively, "Prior Company Counsel"), whether
or not in connection with this Agreement, shall survive the Closing and shall
remain in effect. In addition, the Purchaser waives, and agrees following the
Closing to cause the Company to waive, any conflicts that may arise in
connection with (a) Prior Company Counsel representing the Sellers after the
Closing and (b) the communication by Prior Company Counsel to the Sellers, in
any such representation, of any fact known to Prior Company
Counsel, including without limitation in connection with any negotiation,
arbitration, mediation, litigation or other proceeding in any way related to a
dispute with the Purchaser or the Company following the Closing, and the
disclosure of any such fact in connection with any process undertaken for the
resolution of such dispute. The Purchaser acknowledges that it has had the
opportunity to discuss and obtain adequate information concerning the
significance and material risks of, and reasonable available alternatives to,
the waivers, permissions and other provisions of this _Section 11.16_,
including without limitation the opportunity to consult with counsel other
than Prior Company Counsel. This _Section 11.16_ is for the benefit of the
Prior Company Counsel and the Sellers, and the Prior Company Counsel and the
Sellers are intended third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 11.16_. This
_Section 11.16_ shall be irrevocable, and no term of this _Section 11.16_
may be amended, waived or modified, without the prior written consent of the
Sellers and the Prior Company Counsel affected thereby.
