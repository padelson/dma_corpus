1 AGREEMENT

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and the covenants,
premises, representations and warranties and agreements contained in this
Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound,
the parties to this Agreement agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE 1

THE MERGER 

1.1 _The Merger_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ")
wholly owned by Parent. The Merger shall be effected pursuant to Section 251
of the DGCL and shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Surviving Corporation, in each case, as provided under the DGCL.

 

(b) Subject to _Section 5.7_, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without the necessity of further action by the Company or any other
Person, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended so as to read in its entirety in the form set forth as the certificate
of incorporation of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
(except that the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
shall provide that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be ANN INC. and
the provisions of the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub relating to
the incorporator of Merger Sub shall be omitted), and as so amended shall be
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. In addition,
subject to  _Section 5.7_, the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall
take all necessary action such that, at the Effective Time, the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation shall be amended so as to read in its entirety as the
bylaws of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, and as so
amended shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall
take all necessary action such that the directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time or such other individuals designated by Parent as
of the Effective Time shall become the directors of the Surviving Corporation,
each to hold office, from and after the Effective Time, in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
their respective successors shall have been duly elected,

 



2  designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time, from and after the Effective Time, shall continue as the
officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until their respective successors shall have been duly elected, designated or
qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation. 

(d) If, at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Equity Interests of the
Company or Parent, shall occur as a result of any reorganization,
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
any dividend or distribution with a record date during such period, the Merger
Consideration and the Fractional Share Consideration will be equitably
adjusted to reflect such change.

 

1.2 _Closing and Effective Time of the Merger_. The closing of the Merger (the
" _Closing_ ") will take place at 8:00 a.m., New York City time, on the
second (2nd) Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of all of the
applicable conditions set forth in _Article 6_ (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions at the Closing), at the offices of
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, New York 10019,
unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding the satisfaction or
waiver of all of the applicable conditions set forth in _Article 6_ , Parent
and Merger Sub shall not be obligated to effect the Closing prior to
the third (3rd) Business Day following the final day of the Marketing Period,
unless Parent shall request an earlier date on two (2) Business DaysÂ’ prior
written notice to the Company (but, subject in such case, to the satisfaction
or waiver of all of the applicable conditions set forth in _Article 6_ (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions at the Closing)
(such date on which the Closing occurs hereinafter referred to as the "
_Closing Date_ "). Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, on the Closing Date, or on such other date and time to which
Merger Sub and the Company may agree in writing, Merger Sub or the Company
shall cause a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ "), to be executed and filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the DGCL and shall make all other filings required under the DGCL. The Merger
shall become effective at the time the Certificate of Merger shall have
been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such
later date and time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the
Certificate of Merger (such date and time at which the Merger becomes
effective hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



3 ARTICLE 2

 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER

 

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities:

 

(a) _Conversion of Company Shares_. Each Company Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Dissenting Shares and
Cancelled Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive (i) subject to
the following proviso, 0.68 of a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
Parent Share (the " _Stock Consideration_ ");  _provided_ , that, if the
aggregate number of Parent Shares to be issued pursuant to this _Section
2.1(a)_ together with the aggregate number of Parent Shares to be issued
pursuant to _Section 2.4_ would exceed 19.99% of the issued and outstanding
Parent Shares as of the Closing Date, as reasonably determined by Parent in
accordance with Rule 5635 of the NASDAQ Stock Market Rules (the amount equal
to 19.99% of such issued and outstanding shares rounded down to the nearest
whole share, the " _Maximum Share Number_ "), then the number of Parent Shares
to be issued pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_ and _Section 2.4_ shall be
reduced to the minimum extent necessary such that the number of Parent Shares
issuable pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_ and _Section 2.4_ equals the
Maximum Share Number, and, in such event, each Company Share (or holder of a
Company Option or Company Restricted Share Award, as applicable), shall be
entitled to receive an additional cash payment in an amount equal to the
dollar value of the Parent Shares reduced pursuant to this proviso (to be
calculated on the Closing Date based on the Parent Share VWAP) and (ii)
$37.34 in cash, without interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ " and together
with the Stock Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "), as well as the
Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable.
From and after the Effective Time, all such Company Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each applicable holder of such Company Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration therefor
upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with 
_Section 2.2_.

(b) _Merger Sub Equity Interests_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective
Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be
deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with
the immediately preceding sentence.

(c)  _Cancelled Shares_. Each Company Share that is owned directly by the
Company (or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company), Parent or Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall
be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange for such cancellation and retirement.

 



4 2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall
designate a reputable U.S. bank or trust company to act as the exchange agent
(the identity and terms of designation and appointment of which shall be
subject to the reasonable prior approval of the Company) for purposes of
effecting the payment of the Merger Consideration and the Fractional
Share Consideration in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ ").
Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, the fees and expenses of the Exchange
Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause
to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of Parent Shares
issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ in book-entry form equal to the
aggregate Stock Consideration portion of the Merger Consideration (excluding
any Fractional Share Consideration), and (ii) cash in immediately available
funds in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration portion
of the Merger Consideration and the aggregate Fractional Share Consideration
(such evidence of Parent Shares in book-entry form and cash amounts,
including any Dividend Consideration, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), in each case,
for the sole benefit of the holders of shares of Company Shares. Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make, delivery
of the Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this
Agreement. In the event the Exchange Fund shall at any time be insufficient to
pay the aggregate Cash Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and
Dividend Consideration, Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly
deposit additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal
to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly
provided for in this Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be
invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent or Merger Sub, in its
sole discretion, pending payment thereof by the Exchange Agent to the holders
of the Company Shares; _provided_ , that any such investments shall be in
obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States government. Earnings from
such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent or Merger
Sub, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of
Company Shares.

(b)  _Procedures for Surrender_.

(i) _Certificates_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no
event later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
Person that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record
of Company Shares represented by certificates (the " _Certificates_ "), which
Company Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend
Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (A) a letter
of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form as
Parent and the Exchange Agent shall reasonably agree upon and (B) instructions
for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
of the Certificates as provided in _Section 2.2(e)_) in exchange for payment
of the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the
Dividend Consideration, the forms of which letter of transmittal and
instructions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of the Company prior
to the Effective Time. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu of the Certificate as provided

 



5  in _Section 2.2(e)_) to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents
as may be appointed by Merger Sub, and upon delivery of a letter of
transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such
Certificates, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend
Consideration for each Company Share formerly represented by
such Certificates (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 2.5_), and any Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration, the Fractional
Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is registered,
it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be
paid. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share
Consideration and the Dividend Consideration as contemplated by this
Agreement, except for Certificates representing Dissenting Shares, which shall
represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of such Company
Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the
DGCL.

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, no holder of non-certificated Company Shares represented by
book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall be required to deliver a
Certificate or, in the case of holders of Book-Entry Shares held through The
Depository Trust Company, an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange
Agent to receive the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration
and the Dividend Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one
(1) or more Book-Entry Shares held through The Depository Trust Company whose
Company Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend
Consideration shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to
receive, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver to The
Depository Trust Company or its nominee, for the benefit of the holder of
such Book-Entry Shares held through it, as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, in respect of each such Book-Entry Share the Merger
Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend
Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 2.5_), and such Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall
forthwith be cancelled. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and
in no event later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time), the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Person
that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of
Book-Entry Shares not held through The Depository Trust Company (A) a letter
of transmittal, which shall be in such form as Parent and the Exchange Agent
shall reasonably agree upon and (B) instructions for returning such letter
of transmittal in exchange for the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share
Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, the forms of which letter of
transmittal and instructions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of
the Company prior to the Effective Time. Upon delivery of such

 



6  letter of transmittal, in accordance with the terms of such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Book-Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, the
Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.5_), and
such Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Payment
of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be
made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of
Book-Entry Shares. Until paid or surrendered as contemplated hereby, each
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, the Fractional
Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration as contemplated by this
Agreement, except for Book-Entry Shares representing Dissenting Shares, which
shall be deemed to represent the right to receive payment in accordance with
and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
thereafter there shall be no further recording or registration of transfers of
Company Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Company Shares except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend
Consideration payable therefor upon the surrender thereof in accordance with
the provisions of _Section 2.2_. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance
with the terms of this _Article 2_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares except for
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares representing Dissenting Shares, which shall
represent the right to receive payment in accordance with and to the extent
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged for the applicable Merger Consideration, the
Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration as provided in
this Agreement.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. Any
portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect
thereto) made available to the Exchange Agent that remains unclaimed by the
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the first (1st) anniversary of
the Effective Time will be returned to the Surviving Corporation, upon
demand, and any such holder who has not tendered its Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration
and the Dividend Consideration in accordance with  _Section 2.2(b)_ prior to
such time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for delivery of the Merger
Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend
Consideration, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law, in respect of such holderÂ’s surrender of its
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in 
_Section 2.2(b)_. Any Merger Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration or
Dividend Consideration remaining unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Entity will, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. None of the

 



7  Surviving Corporation, the Company, Merger Sub, Parent or the Exchange
Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or affiliate of any of them,
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any part of the Merger
Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend
Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_,
without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by
applicable Law. Merger Sub may, in its reasonable discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, Fractional
Share Consideration and Dividend Consideration, require the owner(s) of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in a reasonable sum
as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

 

(f) _Dividends or Distributions with Respect to Parent Stock_. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to Parent Shares with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the Parent Shares issuable to
such holder hereunder, and all such dividends and other distributions, if any,
shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the
Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in accordance with this
Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof), there
shall be paid to the holder thereof, without interest, (i) the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such Parent Shares to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent
to such surrender payable with respect to such Parent Shares (the " _Dividend
Consideration_ ").

 

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement (but subject to the provisions of this  _Section 2.3_),
Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by
a holder who has neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in
writing and who is entitled to demand, and has properly demanded, appraisal
for such Company Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects
with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Company Shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_
") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
Fractional Share Consideration or the Dividend Consideration. At the Effective
Time, all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and cease to exist, and the
holders of Dissenting Shares shall only be entitled to the rights granted
to them under the DGCL. If any such holder of Dissenting Shares fails to
perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses its right to appraisal under
Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable Law, then such Dissenting Shares
shall be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and
shall be exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger

 



8  Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend
Consideration, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice
of any demands for appraisal received by the Company or withdrawals of such
demands, in each case, prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal in respect of Dissenting Shares. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent or as
otherwise required by an Order of a Governmental Entity, voluntarily make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, or settle or offer to
settle any such demands for payment, in respect of Dissenting Shares.

 

2.4 _Treatment of Company Options and Company Restricted Share Awards_.

 

(a) Each option to purchase Company Shares granted under any of the Company
Plans (other than any such option granted under the CompanyÂ’s Associate
Discount Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ADSPP_ ")) (each, a " _Company Option_
"), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, be
fully vested and be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in respect of each Net Share covered by such Company Option.
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay or provide to the holders
of Company Options the consideration described in the immediately preceding
sentence, less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under
the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to
the making of such payment, within three (3) Business Days following the
Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, all Company Options (whether vested
or unvested) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to
exist, and each holder of a Company Option shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration described
in the first sentence of this _Section 2.4(a)_.

 

(b) Each award of restricted Company Shares (each, a " _Company Restricted
Share Award_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall, as of the Effective Time, be fully vested and be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each Company Share
subject to such Company Restricted Share Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay or provide to
the holders of Company Restricted Share Awards the consideration described in
the immediately preceding sentence, less such amounts as are required to
be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment, within three (3)
Business Days following the Effective Time. With respect to any Company
Restricted Share Award that is subject to performance-based vesting
conditions, for purposes of the first sentence of this _Section 2.4(b)_, the
total number of Company Shares subject to such Company Restricted Share Award
shall be determined assuming performance at the target level. As of the
Effective Time, all Company Restricted Share Awards shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a
Company Restricted Share Award shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the consideration described in the first
sentence of this _Section 2.4(b)_.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will adopt such resolutions and
take such other actions reasonably necessary to effectuate the actions

 



9  contemplated by _Sections 2.4(a)_ and _2.4(b)_. In addition, following the
date of this Agreement, the Company shall adopt such resolutions or take such
other actions as may be required to provide that, with respect to the ADSPP:
(i) the Offering Period (as such term is defined in the ADSPP) in effect as of
the date hereof shall terminate and conclude no later than the earlier of June
30, 2015 and the Effective Time, and amounts credited to the accounts of
participants shall be used to purchase shares in accordance with the terms of
the ADSPP; (ii) no new Offering Period shall commence following the date of
this Agreement; (iii) any individual participating in the Offering Period in
effect as of the date hereof shall not be permitted (A) to increase the amount
of his or her rate of payroll contributions thereunder from the rate in effect
as of the date of this Agreement, or (B) to make separate non-payroll
contributions to the ADSPP on or following the date of this Agreement; (iv) no
individual who is not participating in the ADSPP as of the date of this
Agreement may commence participation in the ADSPP following the date of this
Agreement; and (v) any such shares purchased shall be treated as other
outstanding Company Shares in accordance with _Section 2.1_; and (vi) the
amount of the accumulated contributions of each participant under the ADSPP
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, to the extent not used to
purchase shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ADSPP (as
amended pursuant to this _Section 2.4(c)_), be refunded to such participant
as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (without interest).

(d) Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Company and the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Company Options and
Company Restricted Share Awards such amounts that Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation, the Company or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct
and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
law. The aggregate amount required to be withheld in respect of Taxes from
any holder of Company Options or Company Restricted Share Awards in connection
with the payments described in _Sections 2.4(a)_ and

 

 _2.4(b)_ shall be applied proportionately to reduce the aggregate share
consideration otherwise payable to such holder pursuant to  _Sections
2.4(a)_ and _2.4(b)_ based on the Parent Share VWAP and the aggregate cash
consideration otherwise payable to such holder pursuant to _Sections 2.4(a)_
and _2.4(b)_. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

 

(e) Each holder of a Company Option or Company Restricted Share Award
converted pursuant to the Merger that would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a Parent Share (after aggregating all shares to be
delivered in respect of Company Options and Company Restricted Share Awards
held by such holder) shall receive from Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, in lieu thereof and upon surrender thereof, a cash payment
(without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a Parent
Share multiplied by the Parent Share VWAP.

 

(f) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of Parent Shares for delivery with respect to, and shall
include in the Form S-4 a number of Parent Shares sufficient to satisfy the
settlement of, the Company Options and Company Restricted Share Awards
contemplated by _Sections 2.4(a)_ and _2.4(b)_.

 



10 2.5 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the
Company and the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement, such amounts that Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation,
the Company or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of applicable Tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely paid over to the
applicable Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

 

2.6 _Further Actions_. As of the Effective Time, the officers and directors of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, any other actions and things to
vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation
any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights,
properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation
as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

2.7 _Fractional Shares_. No fractional Parent Shares shall be issued in
connection with the Merger, no certificate or scrip representing fractional
Parent Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle
the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Company
Shares converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled
to receive a fraction of a Parent Share (after aggregating all shares
represented by the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such
holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof and upon surrender thereof, cash,
without interest, in an amount equal to (a) such fractional part of a Parent
Share (rounded to the nearest one thousandth when expressed in decimal form),
multiplied by (b) the Parent Share VWAP, rounded to the nearest one tenth of a
cent (the " _Fractional Share Consideration_ ").

 

ARTICLE 3

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except as set forth in (i) the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date
hereof (other than any disclosures contained under the captions "Risk
Factors" or "Forward-Looking Statements," in each case to the extent they are
predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature) or (ii) the corresponding
sections of the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent and
Merger Sub concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being acknowledged and agreed that disclosure in any
section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed
disclosed with respect to all sections of this Agreement and all other
sections or subsections of the Company Disclosure Letter to the extent that
the relevance of such disclosure to such other section or subsection is
reasonably apparent on its face), the Company hereby represents and warrants
to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

3.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_.

(a) The Company is a corporation, validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of Delaware and has requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it
is now being conducted. Each of the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries (each, a "
_Company Subsidiary_ ") is a corporation or other legal entity duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions which recognize such concept) under the Laws of the jurisdiction
of its incorporation or organization and has requisite corporate or
organizational, as the case may be, power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, in each case except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business and is
in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept)
in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties or assets or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



11 (b) The Company has made available or caused to be made available to Merger
Sub true, correct and complete copies of (i) any amendments to the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the " _Company Charter_ ") not
filed prior to the date hereof with the SEC, (ii) any amendments to the
Bylaws of the Company (the " _Company Bylaws_ ") not filed prior to the date
hereof with the SEC and (iii) the certificates of incorporation and bylaws, or
equivalent organizational or governing documents, of each Company Subsidiary.
The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the provisions of
the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws.

(c)  _Section 3.1(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth as of the
date hereof a true, correct and complete list of the Company Subsidiaries,
together with the jurisdiction of organization or incorporation, as the case
may be, of each Company Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, owns any material Equity Interest in any
Person other than the Company Subsidiaries.

 

3.2 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 200,000,000
Shares, of which, as of the close of business on May 14, 2015 (the "
_Capitalization Date_ "), there were 45,992,699 Company Shares issued and
outstanding (including 894,836 Shares underlying Company Restricted Share
Awards (assuming vesting at target performance levels with respect to Company
Restricted Share Awards that are subject to performance-based vesting) and
excluding Company Shares underlying Company Options and 36,570,817 Shares held
in treasury) and (ii) 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Company (the " _Company Preferred Stock_ "), of which, as of
the Capitalization Date, no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued and
outstanding. No Company Subsidiary owns any Company Shares or has any option
or warrant to purchase any Company Shares or any other Equity Interest in the
Company. All of the outstanding Company Shares have been duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights.

 



12 (b) As of the close of business on the Capitalization Date, the Company has
no Shares or shares of Company Preferred Stock subject to or reserved for
issuance, except for (i) 1,649,882 Company Shares subject to outstanding
Company Options under the Company Plans having a weighted average exercise
price of $27.24, (ii) 1,143,000 Company Shares underlying Company Restricted
Share Awards (assuming vesting at maximum performance levels), and (iii)
3,858,343 Company Shares reserved for future issuance under the Company Plans
for awards not yet granted. All Company Shares subject to issuance under the
Company Plans, upon issuance prior to the Effective Time on the terms and
conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable,
will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free
of preemptive rights.

(c) As of the close of business on the Capitalization Date, except for Equity
Interests set forth in _Section 3.2(a)_ and the Company Options and the
options to purchase Company Shares under the ADSPP, there are no outstanding
Equity Interests or other options, warrants or other rights, relating to or
based on the value of any Equity Interests of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue,
acquire or sell any Equity Interests of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.
From the close of business on the Capitalization Date until the date of this
Agreement, the Company has not issued any Company Shares, Company Options,
Company Restricted Share Awards or other Equity Interests (including shares of
Company Preferred Stock) other than Company Shares issued upon the exercise
of any Company Options outstanding as of the close of business on the
Capitalization Date in accordance with their terms.

 

(d) Except with respect to the Company Options and Company Restricted Share
Awards pursuant to the Company Plans and the related award agreements and
options to purchase Company Shares under the ADSPP, there are no obligations
(whether outstanding or authorized) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
requiring the redemption or repurchase of, or containing any right of first
refusal with respect to, or granting any preemptive rights with respect to,
any Company Shares or other Equity Interests of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings
to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party with respect to the
voting of Company Shares or other Equity Interests of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, other than any such agreements solely between and among
the Company and any Company Subsidiary or solely between and among two or
more Company Subsidiaries. There are no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes
or other indebtedness of the Company having the right to vote (or convertible
into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any
matters on which holders of Company Shares may vote.

(e) The Company has made available to Parent a schedule that is true and
complete in all material respects as of the date hereof of all outstanding
Company Options and Company Restricted Shares Awards (collectively, the "
_Equity Awards_ "), which shows on an award-by-award basis (i) the grant date
and, if applicable, exercise price of each Company Equity Award, (ii) the
number of Company Shares underlying each Company Equity Award and (iii) the
vesting schedule applicable to each Company Equity Award.

 



13 3.3 _Authority_. The Company has requisite corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger. The
Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, has by unanimous vote (i)
determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the
Company stockholders, (ii) approved, adopted and declared advisable this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger,
(iii) directed that this Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of the
Company for its adoption at a meeting of the Company stockholders for the
purpose of adopting this Agreement (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ")
and (iv) recommended that this Agreement be adopted by the holders of the
Company Shares. Except for the adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company
Shares (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ "), no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to adopt this Agreement
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due
and valid authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub,
constitutes a legally valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditorsÂ’ rights, and to general equitable
principles, including specific performance and injunctive and other forms of
equitable relief).

 

3.4 _No Conflict_. None of the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement by the Company or the consummation by the Company of the Merger or
any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement (other than the Financing
or any Alternative Financing) will (with or without notice or lapse of time,
or both), directly or indirectly, conflict with or violate any provision of
the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws or the organizational or governing
documents of any Company Subsidiary (except, in the case of organizational or
governing documents of any Company Subsidiary, as would not have or reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect). Except as would not have or reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, none of
the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by the Company or
the consummation by the Company of the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement (other than the Financing or any Alternative
Financing) will (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both), directly
or indirectly, (a) assuming that all consents, approvals, authorizations and
permits described in _Section 3.5_ have been obtained and all filings and
notifications described in _Section 3.5_ have been made and any waiting
periods thereunder have terminated or expired, and any other condition
precedent to such consent, approval, authorization or waiver has been
satisfied, conflict with or violate any Law applicable to the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective properties or assets or (b)
require any consent, notice or approval under, violate, conflict with, result
in any breach of or any loss of any benefit under, or constitute a change of
control or default under, or result in termination or give to others any
right of termination, vesting, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or
result in the creation of a Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the
respective properties or assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
pursuant to, any Contract (other than any Company Lease) to which the Company
or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which they or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound or affected or any Company
Permit.

 



14 3.5 _Required Filings and Consents_. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub in _Section 4.5_,
none of the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by the
Company, the consummation by the Company of the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement will require (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) any consent, approval, authorization or
permit of, or filing or registration with or notification to, any Governmental
Entity, other than (a) the filing of the Certificate of Merger as required by
the DGCL, (b) compliance with the pre-merger notification obligations of the
HSR Act, (c) compliance with any applicable foreign, federal or state

statement/prospectus, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the "
_Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ ") and a registration statement on Form S-4 with
respect to the issuance of the Parent Shares in the Merger (such Form S-4, and
any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Form S-4_ ") and (f) consents,
approvals, authorizations or permits of, filings, registrations with or
notifications to, any Governmental Entity, the failure of which to obtain or
make has not had or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

3.6 _Permits; Compliance with Law_.

 

(a) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries hold all authorizations,
licenses, permits, certificates, variances, exemptions, approvals, orders,
registrations and clearances of any Governmental Entity necessary for the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their
properties and assets, and to carry on and operate their businesses as
currently conducted (collectively, the " _Company Permits_ "), except where
the failure to comply with, to obtain or have, or the suspension or
cancellation of, or failure to be valid or to be in full force and effect of,
any of the Company Permits, has not had and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Company and each Company Subsidiary is, and since February 1, 2014 has
been, in compliance with the terms of all Company Permits, except where the
failure to be in such compliance has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(b) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is, and since February 1,
2014 has not been, in conflict with, default under or violation of any Law
applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by which any property
or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or affected, except
for any conflicts, defaults or violations as have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has,
since February 1, 2014, been threatened in writing to be charged with or
been given any written notice, nor, to the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, is under
investigation with respect to, any violation of any applicable Law, except for
any violations as have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



15 3.7 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Since February 1, 2014, the Company has timely filed with or otherwise
furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (" _SEC_ ") (as
applicable) in all material respects all registration statements,
prospectuses, forms, reports, proxy statements, schedules, statements and
documents required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC under the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be (such documents and any
other documents filed or furnished by the Company with the SEC, as have been
supplemented, modified or amended since the time of filing, collectively,
the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective filing dates or, if
supplemented, modified or amended prior to the date hereof, as of the date of
the most recent supplement, modification or amendment, the Company SEC
Documents (i) did not (or, with respect to the Company SEC Documents filed
after the date hereof, will not) contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading and (ii) complied as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, the

business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which
recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing

covenants set forth in _Section 5.1(b)_ hereof.

4.12  _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no Proceeding to which
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a party pending or, to the Knowledge of

Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis as of such date, exceeds, on a
consolidated basis, the value of all "debts" of Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, contingent or otherwise, as of
such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with
applicable federal bankruptcy Laws governing fraudulent transfers;

 

(b) the present "fair value" of the "property" (on a going concern basis) of
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis as of such date,
is greater than the amount that will be required to pay the value of all
liabilities, on a consolidated basis as of such date, of their existing debts
and other liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise,

(c) Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, are able to
pay their debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as
such debts and other liabilities become absolute and matured in the ordinary
course of business, and

engaged in, and are not about to engage in, any business or transaction
contemplated as of the date hereof for which they have unreasonably small
capital.

at any time shall be computed as the amount that would reasonably be expected
to become an actual and matured liability.

 

4.17 _Available Funds; Sufficient Authorized but Unissued Shares_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub will have available all of
the funds necessary (including cash, cash equivalents, available lines of

Company stockholders shall acquire good and valid title to the Parent Shares,

(a) Parent has received and accepted executed and binding commitment letters
dated May 17, 2015 and attached hereto as  _Exhibit A_ (the " _Commitment
Letter_ ") from Goldman Sachs Bank USA (together with any assignees permitted
under _Section 5.11(c)_, the " _Lender_ "), pursuant to which the Lender has
committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the full
amount of the debt financing described therein (the " _Financing_ "). Parent
has delivered to the Company true, complete and correct copies of the executed
Commitment Letter and the fee letter related to the Commitment Letter (the "
_Fee Letter_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the fee amounts and other
economic terms set forth in the "market flex" provisions of the Fee Letter,
none of which could adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability,
availability, termination or aggregate principal amount of the Financing, may
be redacted.

 

(b) Except as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter, there are no
conditions precedent to the obligations of the Lender to provide the
Financing or any contingencies that would permit the Lender to reduce the
total amount of the Financing. There are no side letters or other agreements,
contracts or arrangements relating to the funding or investing, as applicable,
of the full amount of the Financing.

(c) As of the date hereof, assuming the accuracy of the CompanyÂ’s
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement, the performance
by the Company of its obligations hereunder and the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in _Article 6_ , Parent does not have any reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the funding of the Financing set forth
in the Commitment Letter will not be satisfied.

(d) The Commitment Letter is valid, binding and enforceable against Parent
and the other parties thereto, in each case in accordance with its terms
(except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditorsÂ’ rights, and to general equitable
principles, including specific performance and injunctive and other forms of
equitable relief), and is in full force and effect, and no
fact, circumstance, state of affairs or occurrence has occurred that, with or
without notice, lapse of time, or both, would reasonably be expected to
constitute a default or breach or a failure to satisfy a term or condition
precedent on the part of Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other
party thereto under the Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, the
Commitment Letter has not been amended, restated or otherwise modified or
waived, and the commitment contained in the Commitment Letter has not been
withdrawn, modified or rescinded on or prior to the date of this Agreement.
Parent has paid (or caused to be paid) in full any and all commitment fees or
other fees or expenses required to be paid pursuant to the terms of
the Commitment Letter on or before the date of this Agreement.

 



35 In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing by
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or any other
financing or other transactions be a condition to any of ParentÂ’s or Merger
SubÂ’s obligations hereunder, including the consummation of the Merger.

 

4.20 _Brokers_. Except for ParentÂ’s obligations to Guggenheim Securities, LLC
and to Goldman, Sachs and Co., no broker, investment banker, financial advisor
or other Person is entitled to any brokerage, findersÂ’, advisory or similar

Permits, offices and other facilities of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof, (ii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to furnish during normal business hours upon prior notice

to Parent or the Parent Representatives in a way that would not violate the
applicable Law or obligation or waive such a privilege; _provided_ , that
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be required to incur any
liabilities, expend any funds or pay any expenses or fees in
connection therewith.

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees that all information provided
to it or any Parent Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the

amended as of November 6, 2014, between the Company and Parent (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 



42 5.3 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Subject to the other clauses of this _Section 5.3_, from and after the
date hereof until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this

encourage or induce the making, submission or announcement of any offer,
proposal or indication of interest that constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into, conduct,
participate, maintain or engage in any discussions or negotiations with any
Third Party with respect to any offer, proposal or indication of interest that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition

Acquisition Proposal), (iv) approve, adopt, declare advisable or recommend an
Acquisition Proposal, (v) withdraw, amend or modify in any manner adverse

consummate any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (vii) grant
any waiver or release with the effect thereof under any standstill agreement
or anti-takeover Law for the purpose of allowing a Third Party to make an

(to the extent related to the foregoing clauses (iv) or (v)), a " _Change of
Board Recommendation_ "). The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with
any Persons (other than Parent) conducted prior to the date hereof by the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of the Company Representatives that
would reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, and shall,
as promptly as practicable, terminate access by each such Person and its
representatives to any online or other data rooms containing any non-public
information in respect of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company
shall, as soon as practicable following the date hereof, request of each
Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection
with its consideration of an Acquisition Proposal, to promptly return or
destroy all confidential information furnished prior to the execution of this
Agreement to or for the benefit of such Person by or on behalf of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(a)_,
but subject to  _Section 5.3(c)_, if at any time following the date hereof
and prior to the time that the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained (i)
the Company receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a Third
Party that was unsolicited and not otherwise obtained in violation of
_Section 5.3(a)_ and (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the CompanyÂ’s financial advisor and outside legal counsel,
that such 

 



43  Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to
a Superior Proposal, then the Company may in response to such Acquisition
Proposal (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal, its
representatives and potential sources of financing and (B) participate in
discussions or negotiations with the Third Party making such Acquisition
Proposal, its representatives and potential sources of financing regarding
such Acquisition Proposal, in each case, only if (1) the Company gives Parent
a written notice that states that the Company has received such
Acquisition Proposal and includes all the information required by _Section
5.3(c)_ in accordance with _Section 5.3(c)_ and thereafter continues to
comply with _Sections 5.3(c)_ and _5.3(d)_ , (2) prior to furnishing any non-
public information to such Person, the Company shall have an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with such Person and prior to or substantially
contemporaneously with the provision of any non-public information concerning
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to any such Person, the Company
provides such information to Parent (if such information has not previously
been furnished to Parent or the Parent Representatives) and (3) the Company
Board shall have reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation with
the CompanyÂ’s outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

 

(c) As promptly as practicable (and in any event within forty-eight (48)
hours) following the receipt by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
Company Representatives of (i) an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) any request for
information or to engage in negotiations or discussions that would reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall provide
Parent notice of (A) the receipt of such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry, (B) the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry (including of any financing arrangements to the extent
provided to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Company
Representatives) and (C) a copy of all material written materials provided by
such Person in connection with such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (
_provided_ , that the Company may redact the identity of, or any identifying
facts regarding, the Person making such Acquisition Proposal if such
disclosure would violate any Contract by which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is bound as of the date hereof). The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis, of any material
developments or material modifications to the terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(a)_,
if (i) the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that
the Company Board determines, after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may at
any time prior to the time that the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained,
(A) effect a Change of Board Recommendation with respect to such Superior
Proposal or fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule
14D-9 and/or (B) terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.1(f)_ to
enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, or
(ii) an Intervening Event has occurred and is continuing, the Company Board
may at any time prior to the Effective Time effect a Change of Board
Recommendation, in each case, subject to the requirements of this _Section
5.3(d)_. The Company shall not be entitled to effect a Change of Board
Recommendation with respect to a Superior Proposal or Intervening Event
pursuant to this

 



44   _Section 5.3(d)_ or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_
to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal
unless (A) the Company shall have provided to Parent at least three (3)
Business DaysÂ’ prior written notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") of the CompanyÂ’s
intention to take such action, which notice shall state expressly (1) that it
has received a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event has occurred, (2) in
the case of a Superior Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal (including any financing arrangements to the extent provided
to the Company and/or any Company Representatives) and the identity of the
Person making such Superior Proposal, or, in the case of an Intervening Event,
the material facts and circumstances (based on information reasonably
available) related to such Intervening Event, and (3) that it intends to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_ or effect a Change of
Board Recommendation and (B) the Company Board shall have reasonably concluded
in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the
failure to effect a Change of Board Recommendation or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_ would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. During the Notice Period, if
requested by Parent, the Company shall engage in good faith negotiations with
Parent and its financial and legal advisors regarding any amendment to this
Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and the Company Board shall consider
in good faith any adjustments and/or proposed amendments to this Agreement
(including a change to the price terms hereof) that may be irrevocably offered
in writing by Parent (the " _Proposed Changed Terms_ ") by no later than
11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the last day of the Notice Period.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.3(d)_ to the contrary, the
Company Board may not effect a Change of Board Recommendation or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_ until the expiration of the
Notice Period and unless and until the Company Board concludes in good faith,
after considering the Proposed Changed Terms (if any are proposed by Parent)
and consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect a
Change of Board Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(f)_ would still be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. In the event of any material
revisions or modifications to such Superior Proposal, the Company shall be
required to promptly (but in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) deliver
a new written notice to Parent and to again comply with the requirements of
this _Section 5.3(d)_ with respect to such new written notice, except that
the Notice Period shall be two (2) Business Days with respect to any such
revised Superior Proposal, but no such new written notice shall shorten the
original Notice Period.

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company Board
from (i) disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the
stockholders of the Company if the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such
disclosure would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law or violate applicable Law; _provided_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, such disclosure may constitute a
Change of Board Recommendation in accordance with the terms of this _Section
5.3_. The issuance by the Company or the Company Board of a "stop, look and
listen" statement pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, shall not constitute a
Change of Board Recommendation.

 



45 5.4 _Efforts_.

 

(a) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use all reasonable best efforts
to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action and do, or cause to
be done, and to assist and cooperate with the parties in doing, all things
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, (ii)
take all such actions as may be reasonably required to cause the expiration of
the notice periods under Competition Laws with respect to such transactions as

approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained by Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries to effect the
Closing by not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Outside Date
(including any such approvals required under the HSR Act), and to avoid any
action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity (including those in
connection with the pre-merger notification obligations of the HSR Act) or any
other Person, in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger and (B) from any Third Party any consents or notices that
are required to be obtained or made by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, or
any of their respective Subsidiaries, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement only to the extent that Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company reasonably determine, after consultation and cooperation with one
another, that such consent or notice should be obtained or made;  _provided_
, that none of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall be required to incur
any liabilities, expend any funds or pay any expenses or fees in connection
with obtaining such Third Party consents, (iv) cause the satisfaction of
all conditions set forth in _Article 6_, (v) defend and seek to prevent the
initiation of all actions, lawsuits or other legal, regulatory or other
Proceedings to which it is a party challenging or affecting this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each
case until the issuance of a final, nonappealable Order, (vi) seek to have
lifted or rescinded any injunction or restraining order which may adversely
affect the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, in each case until the issuance of a final, nonappealable Order, (vii)
as promptly as practicable, make or cause to be made all necessary
applications and filings (and in any event file all required HSR Act
notifications within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof), make any
other required submissions, and pay any fees due in connection therewith (all
such fees to be solely the responsibility of, and to be paid by, Parent and
Merger Sub), with respect to this Agreement and the Merger required under any
Competition Laws and the parties shall request early termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act in making such filings, (viii) prepare and
file as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary
applications, notices, petitions, filings, ruling requests, and other
documents and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, waivers,
licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, rulings, authorizations
and clearances necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity to consummate the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the " _Required
Approvals_ "), (ix) take all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain
all such consents and the Required Approvals, and (x) as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date hereof, make all necessary filings, and
thereafter make any other required submissions, and pay any fees due in
connection therewith, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger required
under any other applicable Law. No party to this Agreement shall consent to
any delay of the Closing at the

 



46  behest of any Governmental Entity without the consent of the other parties
to this Agreement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned. Parent and Merger Sub shall not, except as may be consented
to in advance in writing by the Company, directly or indirectly through one or
more of its affiliates, acquire any Person or material assets thereof or
interest therein, if such acquisition would reasonably be expected to cause a
material delay in or otherwise result in the failure to satisfy any of the
conditions contained in _Article 6_ or the consummation of the Merger.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the parties hereby agree and acknowledge that neither this _Section 5.4_ nor
the "reasonable best efforts" standard shall require, or be construed to
require, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries
or affiliates to sell, dispose of or divest any assets or businesses, other
than as would not be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on
the Company or any Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Parent or any
Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in order to obtain any required
approval from any Governmental Entity.

(b) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
5.4_, each party hereto shall (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the
making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or
Proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) keep the
other parties notified as to the status of any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or other Proceeding, (iii) promptly notify the other
parties of any oral or written communication to or from any Governmental
Entity regarding the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (iv) promptly provide to the other parties copies of any
written communications received or provided by such party, or any of its
Subsidiaries, from or to any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or
any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that
Parent and the Company may, as each reasonably and in good faith deems
advisable and necessary, designate any competitively sensitive material
provided to the other under this section as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material."
Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to
the outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by
such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient
unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the
materials (Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its legal counsel.
Each party hereto will consult and cooperate with the other parties with
respect to and provide any necessary information and assistance as the other
parties may reasonably request with respect to all notices, submissions, or
filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity or any other
information supplied by such party to, or correspondence with, a Governmental
Entity in connection with this Agreement or any transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and will permit the other parties to review and discuss in
advance and consider in good faith the views of the other parties in
connection with any filing, analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum,
brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any
Law, in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or
other Proceeding, each party hereto will consult with the other parties in
advance and give the other parties or their authorized representatives the
opportunity to be present at each meeting or teleconference relating to such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or other Proceeding and to have access
to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made
or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or other Proceeding.

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or Merger Sub,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the
Company prior to the consummation of the Merger. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete unilateral control and supervision over its business
operations.

 



47 5.5 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meetings_.

 

(a) Parent and the Company shall cooperate in preparing, and as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the date hereof, file the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Form S-4. The Proxy Statement/Prospectus will
be included in and will constitute a part of the Form S-4. The Company will
cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the CompanyÂ’s
stockholders as soon as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts,
and the Company shall cooperate with Parent, to have the Form S-4 declared
effective by the SEC and to keep the Form S-4 effective through the Closing
in order to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Parent shall also take any action required to be taken under any applicable
state securities laws in connection with the issuance and reservation of
Parent Shares in the Merger, and the Company shall furnish all information
concerning the Company and the holders of Company Shares, or holders of a
beneficial interest therein, as may be reasonably requested in connection with
any such action. Each of Parent or the Company shall, as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other parties with copies of
any written comments, and advise each other of any oral comments, with respect
to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4 received from the SEC. Parent
and the Company shall cooperate and provide each other with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 prior to filing such with the SEC, and
will provide each other with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC.
Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, no amendment or
supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 shall be made without the approval of
both the Company and Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time,
any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective
affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by Parent or the Company and
such information should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of
the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that any of such documents
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party hereto
discovering such information shall promptly notify the other parties and, to
the extent required by law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and disseminated to the stockholders of the Company in accordance with
applicable Law.

(b) The Company shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as soon as practicable
following the declaration of effectiveness of the Form S-4 by the SEC for the
purpose of obtaining the

 



48  Company Stockholder Approval. The Company shall not postpone or adjourn the
Company Stockholders Meeting except to the extent required by applicable Law
or to solicit additional proxies and votes in favor of adoption of this
Agreement if sufficient votes to constitute the Company Stockholder Approval
have not been obtained. The record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting
shall be determined by the Company with prior consultation with Parent.

(c) The Company Board shall, except in the case of a Change in Board
Recommendation made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, recommend
the adoption of this Agreement by the Company stockholders to the effect as
set forth in _Section 3.3_, and, subject to _Section 5.3_, shall use
reasonable best efforts to solicit the Company Stockholder Approval.
Notwithstanding any Change in Board Recommendation pursuant to _Section 5.3_,
unless this Agreement is otherwise terminated in accordance with its terms,
this Agreement shall be submitted to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders at
the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve
the Company of such obligation.

 

5.6 _Public Announcements_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, Parent and
Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other, shall not, and
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause their respective advisors and
controlled affiliates not to, issue any press release or make any public
statement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (a) as may be required by applicable
Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States securities
exchange or regulatory or governmental body to which the relevant party is
subject, in which case to the extent permitted by Law the party proposing to
issue such press release or make such public announcement shall use its
reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before
making any such public announcements or (b) with respect to any press release
or other public statement by the Company permitted by _Section 5.3_. The
press release announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall
be a joint release of, and shall not be issued prior to the approval of each
of, the Company and Parent.

5.7  _Employee Benefit Matters_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Company shall, and Parent shall
cause the Company to, honor all Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not prevent or otherwise limit Parent or the Surviving
Corporation from amending or terminating any Benefit Plan in accordance with
its terms as of the date hereof (or, in the case of any Benefit Plan permitted
to be amended under the terms of this Agreement, as of the Closing Date). For
a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide,
or shall cause to be provided, to each Person who is employed by the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time who
continues in the employ of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective affiliates on or after the Effective Time (" _Company Employees_ ")
(i) base salary or wage rate and cash bonus opportunities that, in each case,
are no less favorable than were provided to the Company Employee immediately
before the Effective Time and (ii) all other compensation and employee
benefits that are substantially equivalent in the aggregate to those provided
to the Company Employee immediately before the Effective 

 



49  Time (except that no payments or benefits under any defined benefit pension
plan or the Retention Program shall be taken into account for purposes of
determining whether the other compensation and employee benefits are
substantially equivalent).

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and for calculating
severance and vacation entitlements under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and the Parent Subsidiaries (each, a " _New Plan_ "), each Company Employee
shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective
Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Benefit Plan in
which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall
not apply (i) with respect to accruals under a defined benefit pension plan,
(ii) to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits, or (iii) with respect to any newly established New Plan for which
prior service is not taken into account for employees of Parent or any of its
affiliates. In addition and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(A) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent that coverage
under such New Plans is comparable to a Benefit Plan in which such Company
Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time (such plans,
collectively, the " _Old Plans_ ") and (B) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Company Employee, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause all eligibility waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee
and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been
waived under the comparable Old Plans, and Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee
and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the
Old Plans ending on the date such employeeÂ’s participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan.

 

(c) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Benefit Plans will occur at the Effective Time, as
applicable.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time (but not earlier than ten (10) Business Days
prior to the Effective Time), the Company shall (unless otherwise instructed
by the Parent prior to the taking of such actions) take all such actions as
are necessary, including the adoption of board of directors or compensation
committee resolutions or consents, to terminate the CompanyÂ’s 401(k) plan(s),
effective no later than the day immediately prior to the Effective Time, with
such termination subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that
such plan(s) have been terminated. The form and substance of such resolutions
shall be subject to the review and approval of Parent (which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Parent shall cause the
401(k) plans of Parent or its affiliates to accept as soon as reasonably
practicable rollover distributions from current and former employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to such individualsÂ’ account
balances (including loans), if elected by any such individuals.

 



50 (e) With respect to each Benefit Plan that is a seasonal bonus plan (each,
a " _Seasonal Plan_ "), immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company
may pay to each employee of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries actively
employed as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and then participating
in such Seasonal Plan, a bonus equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(i) the Company EmployeeÂ’s full-season bonus entitlement under such Seasonal
Plan, based on deemed performance at "target" (100%) levels, and (ii) a
fraction, the numerator of which equals the number of days that have elapsed
during the applicable season through the Closing Date and the denominator of
which equals the total number of days in the applicable season; _provided_
 that, if the Effective Time occurs on or after August 2, 2015, the Company
shall pay out in full or defer, as applicable, any bonus under the Season
Plans for the current season and any subsequent season that ends on or prior
to such Effective Time based on actual performance. The term "Seasonal Plan"
shall include both short term incentive compensation programs and long-term
restricted cash programs under the CompanyÂ’s Management Performance
Compensation Plan, as amended through March 7, 2012.

(f) No later than thirty (30) Business Days following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall pay out all earned and unpaid amounts under the
Long-Term Restricted Cash Program (" _LTRCP_ ") for fiscal years 2012, 2013,
2014 and, if the Effective Time occurs on or after August 2, 2015, 2015. 
_Section 5.7(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of LTRCP
participants and the earned and unpaid amounts payable to such participants in
respect of fiscal years 2012, 2013 and 2014. If the Effective Time occurs on
or after August 2, 2015, amounts in respect of the performance period ending
prior to such time shall be determined prior to the Effective Time in good
faith by the Company in accordance with the LTRCP.

 

(g) The Company may establish a cash-based retention program in the aggregate
amount of $7,500,000 to promote retention and to incentivize efforts to
consummate the Closing (the " _Retention Program_ ") with any such payments
from such Retention Program to be paid no earlier than the first to occur of
(i) the three (3)-month anniversary of the Effective Time, (ii) a Qualifying
Termination (as defined in the CompanyÂ’s Special Severance Plan in effect as
of the date hereof), (iii) a termination of employment due to disability or
(iv) a termination of employment due to death and, in the case of subclauses
(ii) and (iii), subject to the delivery by the participant of a non-mutual
release of claims in favor of the Company in a form no less favorable than the
release provided by the employee in the form of release attached to the
CompanyÂ’s Special Severance Plan. Amounts under the Retention Program shall be
allocated among the employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
identified, and in the amounts and on the terms determined, by the Chief
Executive Officer of the Company (or her designee(s)); _provided_ , _however_
, that the Company shall consult in good faith with Parent regarding the
allocation and timing of payment of amounts under the Retention Program. If a
retention award or portion thereof under the Retention Program is forfeited
by a participant, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (or her
designee(s)) may reallocate the retention award (or unpaid portion thereof) to
existing employees or new hires of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

 



51 (h) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee or
other Person any right to continue in the employ or service of the Company,
the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries or any of their
respective affiliates. Except as expressly set forth in this _Section 5.6_,
no provision of this Agreement: (i) shall limit the ability of the Company or
any of its affiliates (including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate in accordance
with its terms any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement,
contract, policy or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by any of them, (ii) shall be deemed or construed to amend,
establish, or modify any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement,
contract, policy or arrangement, or (iii) create any third party beneficiary
rights or obligations in any person (including any current or former service
provider or employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (or any
beneficiaries or dependents thereof)) or any right to employment or continued
employment or to a particular term or condition of employment with the Company
or any of its affiliates (including, following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries).

5.8 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless all past and present
directors and officers of the Company or each Company Subsidiary
(collectively, the " _Covered Persons_") to the same extent such Persons are
indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to
applicable Law, the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent organizational or governing documents,
of any Company Subsidiary and indemnification agreements, if any,
in existence on the date of this Agreement and set forth in _Section 3.13_
of the Company Disclosure Letter (collectively, the " _Existing
Indemnification Agreements_ ") arising out of acts or omissions in their
capacity as directors or officers of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with the
adoption and approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby). The Surviving Corporation and Parent shall
advance expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in
the defense of any Proceeding or investigation with respect to the matters
subject to indemnification pursuant to this  _Section 5.8_ in accordance
with the procedures (if any) set forth in the Company Charter, the Company
Bylaws, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent
organizational documents, of any Company Subsidiary, and any
Existing Indemnification Agreements; _provided_ , that the Person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Person is not entitled to indemnification
and complies with other applicable provisions imposed under applicable Law.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Proceeding (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against such persons
with respect to matters subject to indemnification hereunder on or prior to
the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this
_Section 5.8_ shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such
Proceeding or investigation. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
_Section 5.8_ or otherwise, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall have any obligation hereunder to any Covered Person if it is ultimately
decided in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction that such indemnification is prohibited by applicable Law, in
which case the Covered Person shall promptly refund to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation the amount of all such expenses theretofore advanced pursuant
hereto.

 



52 (b) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time,
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation,
indemnification of and advancement of expenses to Covered Persons for periods
at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company
Charter and the Company Bylaws. Following the Effective Time, the Existing
Indemnification Agreements shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation,
without any further action, and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms.

(c) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain for the benefit of the directors
and officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as of the date of
this Agreement and as of the Effective Time, an insurance and indemnification
policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time
(the " _D andO Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to and in
any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the existing policies of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (true and complete copies which have
been previously made available to Parent) or, if substantially equivalent
insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ ,
that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium
for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid prior
to the date of this Agreement, but in such case shall purchase as much
coverage as is available for such amount (the maximum amount of the aggregate
annual premium over such six (6) year term, the " _Maximum Premium_ "). In
lieu of the foregoing, at or prior to the Effective Time, the Company may
obtain, at its election, prepaid policies, which policies provide such
directors and officers with coverage for an aggregate period of at least six
(6) years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred
on or before the Effective Time, including in connection with the adoption and
approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , that the Company shall not spend in excess of
the Maximum Premium to obtain such prepaid policies. If such prepaid policies
have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue
to honor the obligations thereunder.

(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or
surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may
be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.8_.

 

(e) The obligations under this _Section 5.8_ shall not be terminated or
modified in any manner that is adverse to the Covered Persons (and their
respective successors and assigns), it being expressly agreed that the Covered
Persons (including successors and assigns) shall be Third Party beneficiaries
of this _Section 5.8_. In the event of any breach by the Surviving
Corporation or Parent of this _Section 5.8_, the Surviving Corporation shall
pay all

 



53  reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees, that may be
incurred by Covered Persons in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
provided in this _Section 5.8_ as such fees are incurred upon the written
request of such Covered Person.

5.9 _Takeover Statutes_. If any state takeover Law or state Law that purports
to limit or restrict business combinations or the ability to acquire or vote
Shares (including any "control share acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium,"
"business combination" or other similar takeover Law) becomes or is deemed to
be applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, this Agreement, the Merger
or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall cooperate and take all action reasonably available
to render such Law inapplicable to the foregoing. Neither Parent, Merger Sub
or the Company will take any action that would cause this Agreement, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject
to the requirements imposed by any such Laws.

5.10 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board,
or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the
disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a
"covered person" of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_") of Company
Shares, Company Options or Company Restricted Share Awards pursuant to
this Agreement and the Merger shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of
Section 16\.

5.11 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to obtain and to consummate the Financing on
the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter (including the
flex provisions related thereto), subject to any amendments or
modifications thereto permitted by _Section 5.11(c)_, including using
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter, (ii)
negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing
on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) contained in the
Commitment Letter, subject to any amendments or modifications thereto
permitted by _Section 5.11(c)_; (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Parent or Merger Sub contained in the Commitment
Letter and that are within ParentÂ’s or Merger SubÂ’s control, including the
payment of any commitment, engagement or placement or other fees required as a
condition to the Financing and due and payable by Parent or Merger Sub, (iv)
upon the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions and the conditions set
forth in _Article 6_ , consummate the Financing on or prior to the Closing
(with respect to amounts required to consummate the Merger), including by
drawing on any interim or bridge financing facilities contemplated thereby,
(v) obtain such third-party consents as may be reasonably required in
connection with the Financing, (vi) comply with its obligations under
the Commitment Letter and (vii) enforce its rights under the Commitment
Letter in the event of any failure to fund thereunder by the Lender. If Parent
or Merger Sub becomes aware of any event that makes procurement of any portion
of the Financing unlikely to occur in the manner or from the sources
contemplated in the Commitment Letter, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly
(and in any event within two (2) Business Days) notify the Company and shall
use reasonable best efforts to arrange as promptly as practicable any such
portion from alternative

 



54  sources on terms and conditions no less favorable, in the aggregate, to
Parent and Merger Sub and to the Company than the terms and conditions set
forth in the Commitment Letter and that would not have any of the effects
prohibited by _Section 5.11(c)_ (such financing, " _Alternative Financing_
"); _provided_ , that in the case of (A) the continuation of the asset-based
lending facilities of the Parent or the Company in lieu of the asset-based
lending facilities under the Commitment Letter, subject to no additional or
otherwise more onerous conditions than as set forth in the Commitment Letter
with respect to the asset-based lending facility contemplated thereby and/or
(B) the reduction of the term loan commitments under the Commitment Letter due
to the realization by Parent of the proceeds of a debt securities offering, no
such notice shall be required and such actions shall not constitute an

Company (but not the Company itself), subject to the occurrence of the

the contrary, (i) neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries

definitive agreement, incur any other liability or obligation in connection
with the Financing (or any Alternative Financing) or the continuation of the

any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party, (iii) no officer, director or

Company hereby consents to use of its and its SubsidiariesÂ’ logos in
connection with such financing; _provided_ , that such logos are used solely
in a manner that is not intended or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or their reputation, goodwill or marks

Merger Sub shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, (i)
permit any termination, amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letter or Fee Letter if such

committed amount of the Financing such that Parent would not have sufficient
funds (including cash, cash equivalents, available lines of credit or

56  immediately available funds) to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration
contemplated by this Agreement and to perform the other obligations of Parent
and Merger Sub contemplated by this Agreement, (B) (i) adds new conditions or
(ii) modifies any existing conditions to the consummation of all or any
portion of the Financing to the extent, in the case of clause (ii), that it
would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede or delay the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (it being understood that Parent may amend, restate, modify,
supplement or replace the Commitment Letter to add and appoint additional
arrangers, bookrunners, underwriters, agents, lenders and similar entities,
to provide for the assignment and reallocation of a portion of the financing
commitments contained therein and to grant customary approval rights to such
additional arrangers and other entities in connection with such
appointments), (C) adversely affects the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
enforce its rights against other parties to the Commitment Letter or the
definitive agreements in respect thereof or (D) could otherwise reasonably be
expected to prevent, impede or delay the consummation the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) undertake any merger,
acquisition, joint venture or debt or equity financing that could be expected
to prevent or materially impair or delay consummation of the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter or any Alternative Financing
contemplated by any new debt commitment letter; _provided_ that (i) the
continuation of the asset-based lending facilities of the Parent or the
Company in lieu of the asset-based lending facilities under the Commitment
Letter, subject to no additional or otherwise more onerous conditions than as
set forth in the Commitment Letter with respect to the asset-based lending
facility contemplated thereby and/or (ii) the reduction of the term loan
commitments under the Commitment Letter due to the realization by Parent of
the proceeds of a debt securities offering shall not constitute an amendment
or modification of the Commitment Letter, nor shall such actions be deemed to
contravene this _Section 5.11(c)_.

 

(d) In no event shall the receipt or availability of the Financing,
Alternative Financing or any other funds or financing by Parent or Merger Sub
or any of their respective affiliates be a condition to any of ParentÂ’s or
Merger SubÂ’s obligations hereunder.

 

5.12 _Stockholder Litigation_. The parties shall cooperate and consult with
one another in connection with any Proceeding by the CompanyÂ’s stockholders
against the Company or any of its directors, officers or affiliates with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall
give Parent notice of any such Proceeding as promptly as practicable. The
Company shall not compromise or settle any Proceeding commenced against it or
its directors, officers and/or affiliates relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) without ParentÂ’s prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

5.13 _NASDAQ Listing_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
party under applicable Laws and rules and policies of NASDAQ to cause the

either the Company or Parent as provided in  _Section 7.1_, written notice
thereof shall be given to the other party or parties, specifying the
provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is made and the basis
therefor described in reasonable detail, and this Agreement shall become void
and of no further force or effect without liability or obligation on the part
of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective Subsidiaries,
affiliates, officers or directors; _provided_ , that (i) no such
termination shall relieve the Company of its obligation to pay the
Termination Fee or Expense Reimbursement if, as and when required pursuant to

no such termination shall relieve any party for liability for such partyÂ’s

and the definitions of all defined terms appearing in such Sections shall
survive the termination of this Agreement. 

 



61 7.3 _Termination Fee_.

 

(a) The parties agree that if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 7.1(d)_, then the Company shall reimburse the Parent for its actual
and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in an amount not to exceed $5,000,000
(five million dollars) (the " _Expense Reimbursement_ ") within two (2)
Business Days of such termination. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) in no
event shall the Company be required to pay the Expense Reimbursement on more
than one (1) occasion and (ii) in no event shall the sum of the Expense
Reimbursement and Termination Fee payable by the Company exceed $48,270,000.

(b) The parties agree that if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant
to  _Section 7.1(e)_ or by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(f),_ then
the Company shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Parent prior to or concurrently
with such termination, in the case of a termination by the Company, or
within two (2) Business Days thereafter, in the case of a termination by
Parent, a termination fee equal to $48,270,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ").

 

(c) The parties agree that if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 7.1(b)_, _7.1(d)_ or  _7.1(g)_ and, in any such case, (1) after the
date hereof and prior to the date of termination of this Agreement, an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company is made to the Company or the
Company Board, is made public by the Company or any other Person, or
otherwise made generally known to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders, and is not
withdrawn and (2) within twelve (12) months after such termination, the
Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal is thereafter consummated (which need
not be the same Acquisition Proposal that was made, disclosed or communicated
prior to the termination hereof), then the Company shall pay (or cause to be
paid) the Termination Fee to Parent, prior to or concurrently with the
consummation of such transaction, _less_ the amount of any Expense
Reimbursement previously paid pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_. For purposes of
only subclause (2) of this _Section 7.3(c)_, the term " _Acquisition
Proposal_ " shall have the meaning assigned to such term in _Section 8.4_,
except that the references to "20%" shall be deemed to be references
to "50%".

(d) The Company acknowledges that the agreement contained in this _Section
7.3_ is an integral part of this Agreement and that, without this _Section
7.3_, Merger Sub and Parent would not have entered into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to
this _Section 7.3_, the Company shall pay to Merger Sub all reasonable fees,
costs and expenses of enforcement (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees as
well as reasonable expenses incurred in connection with any action initiated
by Parent and/or Merger Sub), together with interest on the amount of the
Termination Fee at the prime lending rate as published in _The Wall Street
Journal_ , in effect on the date such payment is made.

 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be required to
pay the Termination Fee on more than one (1) occasion.

(f) Subject to ParentÂ’s and Merger SubÂ’s rights set forth in _Section
8.14_, ParentÂ’s right to receive payment from the Company of the Termination
Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against
the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective former,
current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers,
members or affiliates (collectively, " _Company Related Parties_ ") under
circumstances requiring the payment thereof pursuant to this _Section 7.3_
for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, to be consummated or for
a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of
such amount, none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger (except that
the Company shall also be obligated with respect to  _Section 7.3(d)_ and
except that the applicable Company Related Parties shall remain obligated for,
and Parent and its affiliates may be entitled to remedies with respect to the
provisions and agreements surviving such termination pursuant to _Section
7.2_). For the avoidance of doubt, while Parent and Merger Sub may pursue both
a grant of specific performance in accordance with _Section 8.14_ and the
payment of the Termination Fee under _Section 7.3_, under no circumstances
shall Parent and Merger Sub be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant
of specific performance and the Termination Fee.

 



62 7.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by each of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub by action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards of
directors; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Company Stockholder
Approval has been obtained, there may not be, without further approval of the
stockholders of the Company, any amendment of this Agreement that changes the
amount or the form of the consideration to be delivered under this Agreement
to the holders of Company Shares, or which by applicable Law otherwise
requires the further approval of the stockholders of the Company. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the
parties hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
_Sections 8.10_, _8.12_ and _8.15_ , and this sentence (and any other
provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, supplement, waiver or
other modification of such provision would modify the substance of _Sections
8.10_ , _8.12_ or _8.15_ , or this sentence) may not be amended, supplemented
or otherwise modified in any manner that is adverse in any material respect to
any Lender Party without the prior written consent of the Lender.

 

7.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub,
on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other, (b)
waive any breach of the representations and warranties of the other contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance
by the other with any of the agreements or covenants contained herein. Any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby, but
such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

76 8.6 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement.

8.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

8.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits, Parent
Disclosure Letter and Company Disclosure Letter and the other documents
delivered pursuant hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement of the parties and supersede all prior agreements (except the
Confidentiality Agreement) and understandings, both written and oral, among
the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

8.9 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any party by
operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other
parties.

8.10 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other
than (a) any Persons entitled to indemnification or insurance benefits under
the provisions of _Section 5.7_ (Indemnification of Directors and Officers)
following the Effective Time, with respect to such provisions, (b) the
stockholders of the Company, after the Effective Time, as applicable, with
respect to the right of such stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration,
in the case of Company Shares converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in the Merger, and (c) if the Effective Time occurs, the right
of holders of the Company Equity Awards to receive payments contemplated
hereby in respect thereof after the Effective Time; _provided_ , that the
Lender Parties shall be third party beneficiaries and may enforce the
provisions set forth specifically for their benefit in _Sections 7.4_ , _8.10_
, _8.12_ and _8.15_. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are
the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole
benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto without notice or
liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the
knowledge of any of the parties hereto, and consequently, may not accurately
characterize actual facts or circumstances.

8.11  _Mutual Drafting; Interpretation_. Each party hereto has participated
in the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result
of extensive negotiations

 



77  between the parties. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the
parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision. For
purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the singular number
shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine gender shall include
the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender shall include the
masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall include masculine
and feminine genders. As used in this Agreement, the words "include"
and "including" and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of
limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement
to "Sections," "Exhibits" and "Annexes" are intended to refer to Sections of
this Agreement and Exhibits and Annexes to this Agreement. The Company
Disclosure Letter, Parent Disclosure Letter and exhibits attached to
this Agreement constitute a part of this Agreement and are incorporated
herein for all purposes. The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein,"
"hereunder" and words of similar import, when used in this Agreement, shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular section or
article in which such words appear. All references in this Agreement to "$"
are intended to refer to U.S. dollars. Unless otherwise specifically provided
for herein, the term "or" shall not be deemed to be exclusive. Disclosure of
any item on the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter by
reference to any particular Section or Subsection of this Agreement shall be
deemed to constitute disclosure with respect to any other Section or
Subsection of this Agreement if the relevance of such disclosure to such other
Section or Subsection is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure.

 

8.12 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury_.

 

(a) This Agreement and all claims and causes of action arising in connection
herewith shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of
the State of Delaware, without regard to Laws that may be applicable under
conflicts of laws principles (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of
any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any Proceeding
with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising in
connection herewith or any claim or cause of action arising in connection with
this Agreement or the negotiation hereof, and any Proceeding for recognition
and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights
and obligations arising hereunder brought by any other party hereto or its
successors or assigns, will be brought and determined exclusively in the
Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the
State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the
State of Delaware). Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits
with regard to any such Proceeding for itself and in respect of its property,
generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid
courts and agrees that it will not bring any action relating to or
arising from this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
the negotiation hereof in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Proceeding with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (i) any claim that it is
not personally

 



78  subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other
than the failure to serve in accordance with this _Section 8.12_, (ii) any
claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of
any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the
fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (A) the
Proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of
such Proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter
hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that a final judgment in any such Proceeding shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in
any other manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably
consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in _Section
8.3_ and agrees that service made in such manner shall have the same legal
force and effect as if served upon such party personally within the State of
Delaware. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this
Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 

(c) (i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees that
it will not bring any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-
party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Lender Party relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing
or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, County of New York, located in the Borough of Manhattan,
or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal
courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
(and, in each case, appellate courts thereof) and (ii) notwithstanding 
_Section 8.12(a)_, any such action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third-party claim shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in
accordance with, the laws of the state of New York, without giving effect to
any choice of law or conflicts of laws rules or provisions (whether of the
state of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the state of New York.

 

(d) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE FINANCING) IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE
FINANCING). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED
THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS

 



79  VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
8.12(d)_.

 

8.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts, including by facsimile or other electronic transmission each of
which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto
and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become
effective when the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
party hereto. Until and unless the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and
Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall have received a counterpart hereof signed
by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party
shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other
oral or written agreement or other communication). The exchange of a fully
executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic transmission
in .PDF format or by facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

8.14 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no
adequate remedy at Law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine, and accordingly, (a) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement
and to specific performance of the terms hereof, in each case in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court shall not have
jurisdiction, in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any
Delaware state court, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at Law or in equity, (b) the parties waive any requirement for
the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any
specific performance or injunctive relief and (c) the parties will waive, in
any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at
Law. Either partyÂ’s pursuit of specific performance at any time will not be
deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other
right or remedy to which such party may be entitled, including the right to
pursue remedies for liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by a party in
the case of a breach of this Agreement involving willful breach or fraud.

8.15 _No Recourse to Lender Parties_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement, the Company agrees on its behalf and on behalf of its stockholders
and affiliates that neither the Lender nor any of its respective former,
current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers,
members, agents, officers, directors, representatives and Affiliates or any of
their respective successors or assigns (collectively, together with the
Lender, the " _Lender Parties_ " and each, a " _Lender Party_ ") shall have
any liability or obligation to Company, its stockholders or its affiliates
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herein
(including the Financing), whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise. This _Section 8.15_ is intended to benefit and may be enforced by
the Lender and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Company
and its stockholders and affiliates.
