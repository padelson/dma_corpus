iv THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of December 16, 2011 by and among Vistaprint N.V., a company organized
under the laws of the Netherlands (" _Parent_ "), Vistaprint USA,
Incorporated, a Delaware corporation and a directly or indirectly wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Midco_ "), Woodbridge Acquisition Corporation,
a Delaware corporation and a directly or indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent and Midco (such entity, or any other directly or indirectly wholly
owned Parent and Midco subsidiary that Parent may elect to substitute
therefor, " _Sub_ "), Webs, Inc., a Delaware corporation (such corporation and
any predecessor entity thereto, the " _Company_ "), and
Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Colorado limited liability
company, solely in its capacity as Securityholder Representative (the "
_Securityholder Representative_ "). Certain capitalized terms used but not
otherwise defined herein are defined in _Article X_ of this Agreement.

_RECITALS_

 

A. Each of Parent, Midco, Sub and the Company believe it is in the best
interests of each such company and its respective stockholders that Parent
acquire the Company through the statutory merger of Sub with and into the
Company (the " _Merger_ ").

 

B. Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, (i) all of the issued and
outstanding Company Capital Stock, Vested Options and Company Warrants shall
be terminated and converted into the right to receive the consideration set
forth herein and (ii) all Unvested Options and any other rights to acquire
Company Capital Stock shall be automatically terminated for no consideration.

C. A portion of the consideration payable by Parent in connection with the
Merger shall be withheld and placed in escrow by Parent as security for the
indemnification obligations set forth in this Agreement.

D. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent, Midco and Sub, on the other
hand, desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and other
agreements in connection with the Merger.

E. As an inducement to the willingness of Parent, Midco and Sub to enter into
this Agreement (but not pursuant to any prior agreement with the Company, Sub
or Parent), (i) holders of at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding
shares of Company Capital Stock voting together as a single class and on an
as-converted basis, and (ii) holders of ninety-two percent (92%) of the
outstanding shares of Company Preferred Stock, voting together as a single
class and on an as-converted basis, have indicated that they expect to
deliver, following the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the board of
directors of the Company and within two (2) hours following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, (x) their irrevocable approval and adoption of
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
(y) specified undertakings, representations, warranties, releases and
waivers, pursuant to a written consent in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_ and a joinder, release and waiver in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit B_ , respectively, signed and dated as of the date of this Agreement,
pursuant to and in accordance with the applicable provisions of Delaware Law
and the Company Charter Documents (such consents of such Stockholders in the
form of _Exhibit A_ and _Exhibit B_ , collectively, the " _Stockholder
Consent_ "). 

F. Prior to the execution of this Agreement, each of the Founders shall have
executed an accredited investor questionnaire in a form acceptable to Parent
in which each Founder represents and warrants that such Founder is an
"accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule 501 of the Securities Act.

 



1 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements, covenants and other
promises set forth herein, the mutual benefits to be gained by the
performance thereof, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, the
parties hereby agree as follows:

 

 _ARTICLE I _

_THE MERGER_

1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time and subject to and upon the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, and applicable provisions of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (" _Delaware Law_ "), Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Sub
shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation and
as a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Midco and an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent. The surviving corporation after the Merger is sometimes
referred to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_." Parent shall have the
right to substitute, as "Sub" under this Agreement, any newly formed Delaware
corporation that is directly or indirectly a wholly owned Parent subsidiary,
in which case such substitute entity will sign a copy of the signature page
of this Agreement and be deemed a party hereto as the "Sub" without further
amendment or signature of any other party hereto.

 

1.2 _Effective Time_. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to
_Section 8.1_ of this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_
") will take place as promptly as practicable after the execution and delivery
of this Agreement by the parties hereto, but no later than five (5) Business
Days following satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article
VI_ of this Agreement (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions); _provided_   _however_ that in no event shall the Closing occur
prior to December 28, 2011. The date upon which the Closing actually occurs
shall be referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_ ". On the Closing Date,
the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a
Certificate of Merger, in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
C_ (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware, in accordance with the applicable provisions of Delaware Law
(the time of filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware (or such other time as agreed to in writing by Parent
and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger) shall be referred
to herein as the " _Effective Time_ ").

1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as otherwise agreed pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, all the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 5.20_, the certificate of incorporation of the Sub as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation at and as of the Effective Time,
until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in
such certificate of incorporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that at the
Effective Time, Article I of such certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as
follows: "The name of the corporation is Webs, Inc."

 



2 (b) Subject to _Section 5.20_, immediately following the Effective Time, the
board of directors of the Surviving Corporation shall adopt the bylaws of
Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, to be its bylaws
until amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the name of the Surviving Corporation shall
still be Webs, Inc.

1.5 _Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) _Directors_. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective
Time, the directors of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective
Time, each to hold the office of a director of the Surviving Corporation in
accordance with the provisions of Delaware Law, the Surviving CorporationÂ’s
Charter Documents until their successors are duly elected and qualified, or
until their earlier resignation or removal.

(b) _Officers_. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective
Time, the officers of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time,
each to hold office in accordance with the provisions of the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation.

1.6 _Effect of Merger on the Securities of the Company_.

(a) _Effect on Capital Stock of the Company_. At and as of the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Sub, the

(ii) _Conversion of Company Preferred Stock_. Each outstanding share of
Company Preferred Stock (other than any Dissenting Shares and those referred

(following the surrender of the certificate representing such share of Company
Preferred Stock in accordance with _Section 1.8_) an amount in cash (without
interest) equal to: (A) the Series A Preference Amount; _plus_ (B) the Per

three percent (63%) of the Per Share Purchase Price;  _minus_ (2) the cash

under the same conditions, as the amounts released from the Escrow Fund are
paid to holders of Company Preferred Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, if a
Company Preferred Warrant is exercised for its underlying shares of Series A

under the same conditions, as the amounts released from the Escrow Fund are
paid to holders of Company Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, if a
Company Common Warrant is exercised for its underlying shares of Company
Common Stock prior to the Effective Time, then the holder of such Company
Common Warrant shall receive, in respect of each such underlying share, the
amount which it is entitled pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)(iii)_ or _Section
1.6(a)(iv)_, as the case may be, as a holder of Company Common

order to effect the provisions of this _Section 1.6(b)(v)_, including,
without limitation, seeking all necessary approvals and providing any notice
required under the terms of the applicable stock option plans or agreements.

 

(c) _Certain Matters_. No share of Company Capital Stock (other than
Dissenting Shares), Company Options or Company Warrants shall be deemed to be
outstanding or to have any rights other than those set forth in _Section 1.6
_of this Agreement after the Effective Time. The amount of cash, if any, that
each Company Securityholder is entitled to receive at any particular time for
the securities held by such Company Securityholder shall be rounded to the
nearest cent (with $0.005 being rounded upward) and computed after aggregating
the cash amounts payable at such time for all securities held by such
Company Securityholder. No fractional shares of Parent Restricted Stock shall
be issued. In lieu of any fractional share to which a Company Securityholder
would otherwise be entitled, such number of shares shall be rounded to the

the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely on the Spreadsheet in making
distributions to Stockholders pursuant to  _Section 1.8(c)_.

withholding were made. The applicable information reporting and the timing and
amounts subject to income and employment tax withholdings with respect to
payments made to a holder of outstanding Vested Options, or in connection

and any other applicable numbers or amounts shall be adjusted to reflect
appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock

occurring or having a record date on or after the date of this Agreement and

thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are provided by Delaware
Law. Parent shall be entitled to retain any such consideration not paid on

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 1.7(a)_ of this Agreement, if
any holder of Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) such holderÂ’s appraisal rights under Delaware

event, such holderÂ’s shares shall automatically be converted into and
represent only the right to receive the consideration for Company Capital
Stock, as applicable, set forth in _Section 1.6(a)_ of this Agreement,
without interest thereon, and subject to the provisions of _Section 1.8_ and
_Article VII_, upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares.

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written notice of

each Stockholder may surrender the certificate(s) representing such
stockholderÂ’s shares of Company Capital Stock (the " _Company Stock
Certificates_ ") to the Paying Agent for cancellation, together with a duly

Certificate so surrendered, each outstanding Company Stock Certificate will be
deemed for all corporate purposes to evidence only the right to receive the
amount of consideration into which such shares of Company Capital Stock shall
be so exchanged. Upon the surrender of a Company Stock Certificate (or
compliance with _Section 1.10_ of this Agreement) for cancellation to the
Paying Agent, or such other agent or agents as may be appointed by

holder of a Company Warrant may surrender a duly completed and validly

consideration into which such Company Warrants shall be so exchanged. Upon the
delivery of a warrant termination agreement to the Paying Agent, or such other
agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such
Company Warrant shall be entitled to receive from the Paying Agent in exchange
therefor, the amount equal to the consideration to which such holder is then
entitled pursuant to  _Section 1.6(b)(ii)_ or _1.6(b)(iii)_ of this
Agreement, as applicable, and the Company Warrant shall be terminated.

official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. Any merger consideration or other amounts remaining unclaimed by Company
Securityholders three (3) years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity) shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any Liens.

 

(f) _Undistributed Payment Funds_. In addition, in the event that any portion
of the Payment Fund shall not have been distributed by the Paying Agent
within 180 days following the Effective Time, then the Paying Agent may, but
only upon ParentÂ’s written request, surrender such undistributed consideration

such Company Stock Certificates or Company Warrants and shall be obligated to
follow procedures equivalent to those set forth in _Section 1.8(c)_ of this
Agreement.

(g) _Payments to Others_. If payment of consideration in respect of shares of
Company Capital Stock or Company Warrants converted pursuant to _Section 1.6_
of this Agreement is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name a surrendered Company Stock Certificate or Company Warrant is
registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that the Company Stock
Certificate or Company Warrant so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required
by reason of such payment in a name other than that of the registered holder
of the Company Stock Certificate or Company Warrant surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent that such Tax
either has been paid or is not payable.

shares of Company Capital Stock and Company Warrants in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to be in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock and Company
Warrants. After the Effective Time, each Company Stock Certificate or Company
Warrant presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article I_. No interest shall
accrue or be paid on any consideration payable upon the surrender of a Company
Stock Certificate or Company Warrant which immediately before the Effective
Time represented outstanding (or immediately exercisable for) shares of
Company Capital Stock.

Certificates evidencing shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, Parent or the Paying Agent may, in its discretion and as
a condition precedent to the payment of any consideration with respect to the
shares of Company Capital Stock previously represented by such Company Stock
Certificates, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company
Stock Certificates to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond

name of and on behalf of the Company to execute and deliver any and all things
and to take such action as is necessary or desirable to vest or to perfect or
confirm title to such property or rights in the Surviving Corporation, and
otherwise to carry out the purposes and provisions of this Agreement.

_Section 2.13(e)(5)_ there are no pending disputes regarding the scope of any
Company Intellectual Property Agreements, performance under any Company
Intellectual Property Agreements, or with respect to payments made or
received under any Company Intellectual Property Agreements.

(f) The Company Intellectual Property is sufficient for the conduct of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as it is currently conducted and
as it is currently planned by the Company and its Subsidiaries to be
conducted. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company or its Subsidiaries
have the right to use all Company Intellectual Property (including Company
Source Code, software development tools, library functions, and compilers)
that the Company or its Subsidiaries (i) use to create, modify, compile,
market or support any Company Product, or (ii) use to provide any services
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(g) The Company and its Subsidiaries exclusively own all right, title and
interest in the Owned Company Intellectual Property and Company Source Code,
free and clear of all Liens (other than the licenses granted under the
Company Outbound Intellectual Property Agreements identified in _Section
2.13(e)(2)_ of the Schedule of Exceptions and licenses granted to end-user
customers in the ordinary course of business under the forms set forth in 
_Section 2.13(e)(3)_ of the Schedule of Exceptions). All Owned Company
Intellectual Property and Company Source Code was written and created solely
by either (i) employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries acting within
the scope of their employment and done so as work for hire, or (ii) by third
parties who have validly and irrevocably assigned all of their rights therein
to the Company, and no third-party owns or has any claim, right or interest
(whether or not currently exercisable) in or to any of the Owned Company
Intellectual Property or Company Source Code. No Company Personnel owns or has
any claim, right, interest or license (whether or not currently exercisable)
in or to any Company Intellectual Property or Company Source Code.

 



22 (h) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has taken all reasonable and
appropriate steps to protect and preserve the confidentiality of all
materials and information, including but not limited to Company Source Code
that the Company or its Subsidiaries holds, or purports to hold, as a Trade
Secret, and to the Knowledge of the Company, there have not occurred any
unauthorized uses, disclosures, misappropriations, or infringements of any
such Trade Secrets by any person. All use and disclosure by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries of Trade Secrets owned by another person have been
pursuant to the terms of a written agreement with such person or was otherwise
lawful. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries have
a valid and enforceable confidentiality and assignment agreement,
substantially in the CompanyÂ’s standard form previously made available to
Parent and identified in _Section 2.13(h)_ of the Schedule of Exceptions, in
place with each employee and contractor who has ever created Company
Intellectual Property. The Company and its Subsidiaries have enforced such
agreements and their rights in the Intellectual Property that they hold, or
purport to hold, as a Trade Secret.

(i) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of the Company
Products, or the operation of the CompanyÂ’s or its SubsidiariesÂ’ business has
infringed upon or misappropriated, or is infringing or misappropriating, in
any respect the Intellectual Property Rights of any other Person. To the
Knowledge of the Company, no Person or any of such PersonÂ’s products or
services or other operation of such PersonÂ’s business has infringed upon or
misappropriated any Owned Company Intellectual Property, and no Person or any
of such PersonÂ’s products or services or other operation of such PersonÂ’s
business is infringing upon or misappropriating any Owned
Company Intellectual Property. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is bound by any Contract to indemnify, defend, hold harmless or
reimburse any other Person with respect to, or has otherwise assumed or agreed
to discharge or otherwise take responsibility for, any existing or potential
claim of infringement, violation, or misappropriation of any Intellectual
Property Rights, except for the express infringement indemnities included in
the forms set forth on  _Section 2.13(e)(3)_ of the Schedule of Exceptions.

(j) There is no suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding made,
conducted or brought by a third-party that has been served with respect to,
filed, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to, and
the Company and its Subsidiaries have not been notified in writing of,
any alleged infringement or other violation or alleged misappropriation, by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any Company Product or other operation
of the CompanyÂ’s or its SubsidiariesÂ’ business of the Intellectual Property
Rights of any Person, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, is there any
basis for any of the foregoing. To the Knowledge of the Company, there is no
pending or threatened claim, action or proceeding challenging the scope,
validity or enforceability of, or contesting the CompanyÂ’s or any of its
SubsidiariesÂ’ rights with respect to, any of the Owned Company Intellectual
Property or Company Source Code. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written opinion of counsel regarding: (i) any
allegation of infringement, (ii) the application of any Patent to the Company
Products, or (iii) the operation of the CompanyÂ’s and its SubsidiariesÂ’
business with respect to the foregoing. The Company and its Subsidiaries are
not subject to any order of any Governmental Entity that restricts or impairs
the use, transfer or licensing of any Owned Company Intellectual Property or
Company Source Code. To the Knowledge of the Company, there is no basis for a
claim that any of the Company Owned Intellectual Property is invalid or
unenforceable as a result of patent or copyright misuse or on any other
grounds.

(k) None of the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Merger) will result in (i) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries granting,
assigning or transferring to any Person any rights or licenses to any Company
Intellectual Property or any Intellectual Property Rights therein, or the
release, disclosure 

 



23  or required delivery to any Person of any Company Intellectual Property,
(ii) any breach of, or the right of termination or cancellation under, any
Company Intellectual Property Agreement, (iii) the imposition of any Lien or
license on, or the loss of, any Owned Company Intellectual Property or Company
Source Code, or (iv) after the Merger, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries being
required, under the terms of any Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or is bound, to grant, assign or transfer to any
Person any rights or licenses to any Intellectual Property or Intellectual
Property Rights, to impose any restrictions not otherwise applicable to the
Company absent the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or to pay any
royalties or other amounts in excess of those that would have, in any event,
been payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries had the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement not occurred.

(l) _Section 2.13(l)_ of the Schedule of Exceptions contains a complete and
accurate list of all software that is distributed as "open source software" or
under a similar licensing or distribution model (including the GNU General
Public License) (" _Open Source Materials_ ") used by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in connection with their respective business or incorporated
in or used in connection with any Company Product or Company Source Code,
including a description of the manner in which such Open Source Materials are
used, including whether the Open Source Materials were modified and whether
such Open Source Materials were distributed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Except as expressly set forth in  _Section 2.13(l)_ of the
Schedule of Exceptions, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
(i) incorporated Open Source Materials into, or combined Open Source Materials
with, any Company Product or any Company Source Code, (ii) distributed Open
Source Materials in conjunction with any Company Product, or (iii) used,
incorporated or distributed Open Source Materials that require or could
require, or condition or could condition, the use or distribution of such
Open Source Materials on, the CompanyÂ’s or any SubsidiariesÂ’ granting to any
Person any right or immunity with respect to any Company Intellectual Property
(including any requirement or condition that other software
incorporated into, derived from, or distributed with such Open Source
Materials be (A) disclosed or distributed in source code form, (B) licensed
for the purpose of making derivative works, or (C) redistributable at no
charge). The Company and its Subsidiaries are in material compliance with all
license terms and conditions with respect to any Open Source Materials (i)
incorporated into or combined with any Company Product or Company Source Code,
or (ii) distributed or downloaded in conjunction with any Company Product or
Company Source Code. The Company has not used any Open Source Materials in
such a way as to require the licensing of any Company Intellectual Property
pursuant to the terms of an open source license. 

(m) None of the Company Source Code or Trade Secrets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries have been published or disclosed, except to the employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries or to other Persons with contractual
obligations to keep the Company Source Code or Trade Secrets (as applicable)
confidential. No condition has occurred or circumstance exists that would be
sufficient to entitle the beneficiary under any escrow arrangement under which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has deposited any Company Source Code
for any Company Product or Trade Secret to require release of such
Company Source Code. _Section 2.13(m)_ of the Schedule of Exceptions
identifies each Contract pursuant to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has deposited, or is or may be required to deposit, with an
escrow agent or any other Person, any Company Source Code. The consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) will not
constitute a condition sufficient to entitle the beneficiary under any escrow
arrangement under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has deposited
any Company Source Code for any Company Product or Trade Secret to require
release of such Company Source Code or Trade Secret.

(n) No funding, facilities, or personnel of any Governmental Entity or

established and maintained in accordance with its terms and in material
compliance with all applicable Laws. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries
and ERISA Affiliates has performed all material obligations required to be
performed by them under each Company Employee Plan. Each Company Employee
Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has timely
obtained a favorable determination letter from the IRS or is entitled to rely
on an opinion letter issued to the PlanÂ’s prototype sponsor, and nothing has
occurred since the date of that determination letter that could reasonably be
expected to cause any such Company Employee Plan to fail to qualify under
Section 401(a) of the Code. No "prohibited transaction," within the meaning
of Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA, and not
otherwise exempt under Section 408 of ERISA, has occurred with respect to any

prior to the Effective Time in accordance with its terms, without Liability to
Parent, the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate
(other than ordinary administration expenses). There are no audits, inquiries
or proceedings pending or to the Knowledge of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates, threatened by the IRS, United
States Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity with respect to
any Company Employee Plan. The Company and its Subsidiaries and ERISA
Affiliates are not subject to any penalty or Tax with respect to any Company
Employee Plan under Section 502(i) of ERISA or Sections 4975 through 4980 of
the Code, nor is any employee or former employee of the Company subject to
penalty under Section 409A of the Code. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries and ERISA Affiliates has timely made all contributions and other
payments required by and due under the terms of each Company Employee Plan.
Where applicable, each International Plan has been approved by the relevant
Governmental Entity so as to enable the Company and/or its Subsidiaries or
ERISA Affiliates to enjoy the most favorable taxation status possible, and the
Company is not aware of any basis on which such approval may cease to apply.

 

(d) _No Pension Plans or Welfare Plans_. The Company, its Subsidiaries and
ERISA Affiliates have not ever maintained, established, sponsored,
participated in, or contributed to, and do not otherwise have any Liability

of Section (3)(37) of ERISA, (iii) "multiple employer plans" for purposes of
ERISA, (iv) a "funded welfare plan" within the meaning of Section 419 of the
Code, or (v) an International Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan. No
Company Employee Plan provides health or disability benefits that are not
fully insured through an insurance contract other than the provision of
benefits under Section 125 of the Code. No International Plan has any
unfunded liabilities that, as of the Effective Time, will not be offset by
insurance or fully accrued.

(e) _No Post-Employment Obligations_. No Company Employee Plan provides, or
reflects or represents any Liability to provide, post-termination or retiree
life insurance, health or other retiree employee welfare benefits to any
Person for any reason, except as may be required by COBRA or other applicable
statute, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA
Affiliates has any current representation, promise or contract (whether in
oral or written form) with any Company Personnel

 



30  (either individually or to Company Personnel as a group) or any other Person
that such Company Personnel or other Person would be provided with post-
termination or retiree life insurance, health or other employee welfare
benefit, except to the extent required by statute other than the provision of
severance pay or benefits pursuant to Employee Agreements set forth on
_Section 2.24(e)_ of the Schedule of Exceptions.

Affiliates has, prior to the Effective Time, complied in all material
respects with the health care continuation requirements of COBRA, Family

reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty of such party

deliver to the Securityholder Representative a statement (the " _Parent
Statement_ "), certified as true and correct by a representative of Parent,

reasonable request and with reasonable advance notice, Parent will provide the
Securityholder Representative and its accountants reasonable access
(including electronic access, to the extent available) to the relevant
historical financial records of the Surviving Corporation and reasonable
access to the individuals responsible for preparing the Parent Statement
throughout the periods during which the Parent Statement is being evaluated
by the Securityholder Representative. If the Securityholder Representative
disagrees with the determination of the Parent Statement, the Securityholder
Representative shall notify Parent of such disagreement by 5:00 p.m. local
time at ParentÂ’s corporate headquarters on the thirtieth (30th) calendar day
following delivery of the Parent Statement, which written notice shall set
forth any such disagreement in reasonable detail (" _Disagreement Notice_ ").
If the Securityholder Representative fails to deliver a Disagreement Notice by
such time, the Securityholder Representative and the Company Securityholders
shall be deemed to have accepted the Parent Statement as delivered by Parent,
the Proposed Final WC Adjustment Amount shall become the Final WC Adjustment
Amount and the Proposed Final Cash Adjustment Amount shall become the Final
Cash Adjustment Amount. Matters included in the calculations in the Parent
Statement to which the Securityholder Representative does not object in the
Disagreement Notice shall be deemed accepted by the Securityholder
Representative and the Company Securityholders and shall not be subject to
further dispute or review by the Securityholder Representative or any Company
Securityholders;

 



46   _provided_ that the Proposed Final WC Adjustment Amount and the Proposed
Final Cash Adjustment Amount shall not be deemed accepted if a Disagreement
Notice is delivered with respect to such calculation. Parent and the
Securityholder Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any
such disagreement, and any resolution agreed to in writing by Parent and the
Securityholder Representative shall be final and binding upon Parent, the
Securityholder Representative and all the Company Securityholders. If the
Proposed Final WC Adjustment Amount has not previously become the Final WC
Adjustment Amount, and Parent and the Securityholder Representative agree in
writing to the calculation of the Working Capital Adjustment Amount, then
such agreed upon calculation shall become the Final WC Adjustment Amount. If
the Proposed Final Cash Adjustment Amount has not previously become the Final
Cash Adjustment Amount, and Parent and the Securityholder Representative
agree in writing to the calculation of the Cash Adjustment Amount, then such
agreed upon calculation shall become the Final Cash Adjustment Amount. The
date of any express or deemed acceptance of the Parent Statement (including
the Final WC Adjustment Amount and the Final Cash Adjustment Amount) or the
final resolution of all disputes in regard thereto pursuant to this _Section
5.16_ shall be the " _Determination Date_." 

(b) If Parent and the Securityholder Representative are unable to resolve any
disagreement as contemplated by this  _Section 5.16_ by 5:00 p.m. local time
at ParentÂ’s corporate headquarters on the thirtieth (30th) calendar day
following delivery by the Securityholder Representative of a Disagreement
Notice, Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall jointly select a
mutually acceptable third-party firm with expertise in accounting matters, the
retention of which will not give rise to present or potential future auditor
independence problems for Parent or any of its affiliates, as determined by
the reasonable discretion of Parent, to resolve such disagreement (the firm so
selected shall be referred to herein as the " _Accounting Arbitrator_ "). The
parties shall instruct the Accounting Arbitrator to consider only those items
and amounts set forth in the Parent Statement as to which the Securityholder
Representative has disagreed pursuant to a Disagreement Notice and Parent and
the Securityholder Representative have not resolved their disagreement, and
the resolution of such disagreement shall be (i) made in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied on a basis consistent with the CompanyÂ’s past practices
(to the extent that such past practices were in accordance with GAAP) and
(ii) with respect to any specific disagreement, no greater than the higher
amount calculated by Parent or the Securityholder Representative, as the case
may be, and no lower than the lower amount calculated by Parent or
the Securityholder Representative as the case may be. Parent and the
Securityholder Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Accounting Arbitrator to deliver to Parent and the Securityholder
Representative, as promptly as practicable, a written report setting forth
the resolution of any such disagreement determined in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, including a calculation of the Working Capital
Adjustment Amount as of the Closing Date and the Cash Adjustment Amount as of
the Closing Date. Such report shall be final and binding upon the parties and
the calculation of the Working Capital Adjustment Amount and the Cash
Adjustment Amount provided by the Accounting Arbitrator shall become
the Final WC Adjustment Amount and Final Cash Adjustment Amount,
respectively. The fees, expenses and costs of the Accounting Arbitrator shall
be borne by the party whose positions on the issues submitted to the
Accounting Arbitrator varies the greatest amount from the amounts as finally
determined by the Accounting Arbitrator, in the aggregate, hereunder with
respect to such issues. If it is determined that such fees, expenses and costs
are owned by the Company Securityholders, then such fees, expenses and costs
shall be deemed, for all purposes of this Agreement, to be additional Third-
Party Expenses incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(c) _Payment of Adjustment Amount_.

(i) If the Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment is less than the Working
Capital Escrow Portion of the Escrow Fund but greater than zero (0), then
Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall issue joint instructions to
the Escrow Agent to (A) transfer to Parent the amount of

 



47  the Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment and (B) transfer to the Paying
Agent from the Working Capital Escrow Portion of the Escrow Fund an amount in
cash equal to the difference between the Post-Closing Purchase Price
Adjustment and the Working Capital Escrow Portion of the Escrow Fund, and
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to distribute such cash to the Company
Securityholders based on their respective Pro Rata Share. 

(ii) If the Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment is greater than the Working
Capital Escrow Portion of the Escrow Fund (such amount, a " _Working Capital
Escrow Portion Shortfall_ "), then Parent and the Securityholder
Representative shall issue joint instructions to the Escrow Agent to (A)
transfer to Parent an amount in cash equal to the Working Capital Escrow
Portion of the Escrow Fund and (B) transfer to Parent an amount in cash equal
to the Working Capital Escrow Portion Shortfall.

(iii) If the Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment is equal to zero (0), then
Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall issue joint instructions to
the Escrow Agent to transfer to the Paying Agent the Working Capital Escrow
Portion of the Escrow Fund and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
distribute the Working Capital Escrow Portion of the Escrow Fund to the
Company Securityholders based on their respective Pro Rata Share. 

(iv) Any amounts payable under _Sections 5.16(c)(i)_ , _5.16(c)(ii)_ , or
_5.16(c)(iii)_ shall be paid no later than fifteen (15) Business Days after
the Determination Date.

(v) Amounts paid under this _Section 5.16(c)_ shall be treated as an
adjustment to the purchase price for Tax purposes.

5.17 _Resignation of Officers and Directors_. The Company shall cooperate
with Parent to effect the replacement of all the officers and directors of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries with directors and officers appointed by
Parent, to the extent possible under local laws, as of the Effective Time.

directors of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries effective as of the date
of their effective replacement by officers and directors appointed by
Parent.

be deemed to have resigned their employment from the Company and its
Subsidiaries effective upon the date upon which such Offer Letter was to be
accepted. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain from such Employees a severance agreement and release dated
the date of such employeeÂ’s termination of employment with the Company or such
Subsidiary in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent (which
shall include a general release of any claims in favor of Parent and related
persons and entities and shall include, without limitation, a release with
respect to any claim arising out of the termination of such EmployeeÂ’s
Unvested Options) (a " _Severance Agreement and Release_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not pay any severance
to any Employee who is terminated and does not sign a Severance Agreement and
Release (except as may otherwise be required by Law or by the express terms of
agreements identified in the Schedule of Exceptions as containing severance
arrangements).

Business Days after the date of this Agreement, the

to Parent, to all third parties who received confidential information relating
to the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with discussions about any
potential Acquisition Activity instructing such parties to: (a) promptly
return to the Company or destroy all copies of written confidential
information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries (including any
confidential information stored on a computer, word processor or similar
device) furnished to such third parties by or on behalf of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries in their possession or custody or in the possession
or custody of their respective representatives, officers, directors, and
employees; and (b) confirm in writing that all such confidential information
has been either returned or destroyed. Upon receipt of all such confirmations,
the Company shall provide notice to Parent that all such confirmations have

5.20 _D andO Tail Insurance; Indemnification_. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall purchase an extended reporting period endorsement under the

mutually acceptable to the Company and Parent, which shall provide such
directors and officers with coverage for six years following the Effective
Time of not less than the existing coverage under, and have other terms not
materially less favorable to, the insured persons than the directorsÂ’ and
officersÂ’ liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company.
For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall not amend, terminate or repeal any provision in the
Surviving CorporationÂ’s Charter Documents relating to the exculpation or
indemnification of former officers and directors of the Company (unless
required by applicable Law) in a manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were
officers or directors of the Company, unless such amendment, termination or
repeal is required by applicable Law after the Effective Time, it being the
intent of the parties hereto that the officers and directors of the Company
prior to the Closing shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation and
indemnification to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 5.20_ shall prevent the
Surviving Corporation from combining with any other entity (including Parent),
or the taking of any other action by Parent or the Surviving Corporation that
may result in the amendment, repeal or modification of the Surviving
CorporationÂ’s Charter Documents, or any provision thereof relating to the
exculpation or indemnification of former officers and directors, as long as
Parent provides, or causes the Surviving Corporation to provide, the officers
and directors of the Company prior to the Closing with rights that in the
reasonable good faith judgment of Parent are no less favorable than the rights
afforded, as of the Effective Time, to such individuals in the Surviving
CorporationÂ’s Charter Documents.

5.21 _Changes to Company Capital Structure_. The Company shall notify Parent
in writing promptly upon becoming aware of any changes arising after the date
of this Agreement in the holders of Company Capital Stock, the number and

(a) Parent shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to be
filed, on a timely basis, and on a basis reasonably consistent with past
practice, all Tax Returns with respect to the Company for taxable periods (or
portions thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date and required to be
filed thereafter (the " _Prior Period Returns_ "), provided that Parent shall
not be required to take a position on a Tax Return that is not permitted by
law or that would require a reserve to be recorded on a financial statement of
the Company. Parent shall provide a draft copy of such Prior Period
Returns to the Securityholder Representative for its review at least twenty
(20) Business Days prior to the due date

 



49  thereof. The Securityholder Representative shall provide its comments to
Parent at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the due date of such returns
and Parent shall make all changes to such Prior Period Returns reasonably
requested by the Securityholder Representative if such changes (i) are
reasonably consistent with past practice or (ii) do not adversely affect
Parent.

 

(b) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and all other
Taxes, fees and duties, if any, incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and all expenses associated therewith, will be
borne and paid 50% by Parent and 50% by the Company Securityholders. Parent
will prepare and file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable Law, the
other parties will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation.

 

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) in the case of any gross receipts,
income, sales, use, payroll, withholding, or similar Taxes that are payable
with respect to a period that includes but does not end on the Closing Date (a
" _Straddle Period_ "), the portion of such Taxes allocable to the period
ending on the Closing Date shall be determined on the basis of a deemed
closing at the end of the Closing Date of the books and records of the
Company; and (ii) in the case of any Taxes other than those described in
clause (i) that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of
such Taxes allocable to the period ending on the Closing Date shall be equal
to the product of (A) all such Taxes and (B) the percentage, expressed as a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of such
period ending on and including the Closing Date, and the denominator of which
is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period.

Limitations Representations shall survive until ninety (90) days after the

is properly asserted in writing pursuant to _Section 7.3_ prior to the
applicable expiration date (as provided in this _Section 7.1(a)_) of a
representation or warranty that is the basis for such claim, then such
representation or warranty shall survive beyond such expiration date until,
but only for the purpose of, the resolution of such claim. It is the express
intent of the parties that, if the applicable survival period for an item as
contemplated by this _Section 7.1(a) _is shorter than the statute of
limitations that would otherwise have been applicable to such item, then, by
contract, the applicable statute of limitations with respect to such item
shall be reduced to the shortened survival period contemplated hereby. The
parties further acknowledge that the time periods set forth in this _Section
7.1(a) _for the assertion of claims under this Agreement are the result of
armsÂ’-length negotiation among the parties and that they intend for the time
periods to be enforced as agreed by the parties.

(b) _By Parent and Sub_. The representations and warranties of Parent and Sub
contained in this Agreement, or in any certificate or other instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, shall terminate at the Closing.

anything to the contrary contained in _Section 7.1(a)_ of this Agreement,
the limitations set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_ of this Agreement shall not
apply in the event of any fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful
breach (whether on the part of any Company Securityholder against whom
liability is being asserted, on the part of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or on the part of any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section
7.1(b)_ of this Agreement, the limitations set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ of
this Agreement shall not apply in the event of any fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful breach (whether on the part of Parent or Sub, or
on the part of any Representative of Parent or Sub).

including the Surviving Corporation (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and
collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") for Losses incurred by
such Indemnified Parties, or any of them (including the Surviving
Corporation), as a result of:

(i) any breach of or inaccuracy in a representation or warranty of the
Company contained in this Agreement as of the date of this Agreement or as of

date, which representations and warranties shall be made only as of such
particular date), or in any certificate or other instruments delivered
pursuant to this Agreement;

 

(ii) any failure by the Company to perform or comply with any covenant
contained in this Agreement prior to the Effective Time;

set forth therein) or breach of or inaccuracy in any representation, warranty
or certification regarding the Spreadsheet contained in the certificate
delivered to Parent pursuant to this Agreement;

(iv) any Dissenting Share Payments;

 

(v) any Working Capital Escrow Portion Shortfall;

(vi) any amounts reasonably incurred by an Indemnified Party in the defense of
a Third-Party Claim that, if adversely determined, would give rise to a right
of recovery for Losses, regardless of the outcome of such Third Party Claim;
or

(vii) any Taxes (A) imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any
Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date
(determined in the manner set forth in _Section 5.22(c)_), except to the

and (B) together with applicable reasonable expenses, for which the Company

entitled to receive any indemnification for the matters described in clause
(A), clause (B) or clause (C) of this sentence, Parent or such other
Indemnified Party shall be required to first exhaust the Indemnity Escrow
Amount of the Escrow Fund as their sole source of recovery prior to pursuing
any other remedies or sources of recovery, to the extent available under
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing
herein shall limit the rights or remedies of Parent or any other Indemnified
Party against the Company or a Company Securityholder (A) with respect to
fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful breach by the Company or such
Company Securityholder, as applicable or (B) with respect to specific
performance, injunctive and other equitable relief.

Representation or the Intellectual Property Representations), until such time
as the total amount of all Losses incurred by the Indemnified Parties from
the matters described in _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ or Section 7.2(a)(vi) (other
than claims for indemnification arising from any breach of or inaccuracy in a
Special Representation or the Intellectual Property Representations) exceeds
$150,000 in the aggregate (the " _Threshold Amount_ "); _provided_ that at

connection with claims brought by a third party) (ii) any and all reasonable
fees and costs of enforcing an Indemnified PartyÂ’s rights under this

(but not for the purpose of determining whether or not a breach has occurred),
any representation or warranty given or made by the Company in this Agreement
that is qualified in scope as to materiality (including Company Material
Adverse Effect) shall be deemed to be made or given without such
qualification, and such qualification will not have any effect with respect
to the calculation of the amount of any Losses attributable to a breach of
such representation or warranty. There shall be no right of contribution from
the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries with respect to any Loss claimed by an Indemnified Party.

(e) _Knowledge of Indemnified Parties_. The Company and the Securityholder
Representative (on behalf of Company Securityholders) agree that the

by this Agreement; and such representations, warranties and covenants, and the
rights and remedies that may be exercised by the Indemnified Parties with
respect thereto, shall not be waived, limited, qualified, or otherwise
affected by or as a result of (and the Indemnified Parties shall be deemed to
have relied upon such representations, warranties or covenants
notwithstanding) any knowledge on the part of any of the Indemnified Parties
or any of their Representatives, regardless of whether obtained (or should
have been obtained) through any due diligence review, audit or other
investigation by any Indemnified Party or any Representative of
any Indemnified Party or through disclosure by the Company or any other
Person, and regardless of whether such knowledge was obtained before or after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, other than as disclosed in the
Schedule of Exceptions; _provided_ __, _however_ __, that regardless of any
disclosure made or information contained in the Schedule of Exceptions, each
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover for any Losses related to
_Sections 7.2(a)(iii)_ , _(vii)_ and _(viii)_ above.

(f) _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnification payments
under this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the purchase price
for all Tax purposes.

 



57 7.3 _Claims for Indemnification_.

 

(a) _Procedure for Claims_. An Indemnified Party wishing to assert a claim for
indemnification under this _Article VII_ shall deliver to the Securityholder
Representative a certificate (an " _Officer Â’s Certificate_") signed by any
officer of Parent (or another Indemnified Party) no later than fifteen (15)
days after the applicable survival date (if any): (i) stating that Parent (or
such other Indemnified Party) has paid, sustained, incurred or accrued Losses,
(ii) specifying in reasonable detail the facts pertinent to such claim(s) and
the nature of the basis for indemnification with respect thereto, and (iii)
if practicable, containing a non-binding, preliminary, good faith estimate of
the amount of Losses to which the Indemnified Party in good faith believes it
is entitled (the aggregate amount of such Losses, the " _Claimed Amount_ ").
Within thirty (30) days after delivery of such OfficerÂ’s Certificate, the
Securityholder Representative shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a written
response in which the Securityholder Representative shall: (A) agree that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Claimed Amount (in which
case the Securityholder Representative and the Indemnified Party shall deliver
to the Escrow Agent, within three (3) Business Days following delivery of the
response, a written notice executed by both such parties instructing the
Escrow Agent to distribute to the Indemnified Party, out of the Escrow Fund,
an amount equal to the Claimed Amount), (B) agree that the Indemnified Party
is entitled to receive part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount (the " _Agreed
Amount_ ") (in which case the Securityholder Representative and the
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, within three (3)
Business Days following delivery of the response, a written notice executed by
both such parties instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute to the
Indemnified Party, out of the Indemnity Escrow Amount of the Escrow Fund, an
amount equal to the Agreed Amount), or (C) contest that the Indemnified Party
is entitled to receive all or part of the Claimed Amount. If the
Securityholder Representative in such response contests the payment of all or
part of the Claimed Amount, then the Securityholder Representative and the
Indemnified Party shall use good faith efforts to resolve such dispute in
accordance with _Section 7.3(c)_ below. Failure of the Securityholder
Representative to respond in writing to an OfficerÂ’s Certificate within the
thirty (30) day period specified above shall be treated as agreement by the
Securityholder Representative that the Indemnified Party is entitled to the
Claimed Amount, which Indemnified Party may then recover unilaterally from
the Indemnity Escrow Amount of the Escrow Fund.

(b) _Defense of Third-Party Claims_. In the event an Indemnified Party
becomes aware of the commencement by a third-party of any action, suit or
proceeding which such Indemnified Party reasonably believes may result in a
Loss for which the Company Securityholders would become obligated to
indemnify such Indemnified Party (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified
Party shall promptly deliver written notice to the Securityholder
Representative of such Third-Party Claim. Any delay or failure in so notifying
the Securityholder Representative of such Third-Party Claim shall not limit
or relieve the Company Securityholders of their obligations under this
_Article VII_ (except to the extent, if at all, that the defense of such
Third-Party Claim is materially prejudiced by reason of such delay or
failure). Within thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Party delivers written
notice to the Securityholder Representative of such Third-Party Claim, the
Securityholder Representative may, upon written notice thereof to the
Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such action, suit or
proceeding if (1) the Securityholder Representative provides written notice to
such Indemnified Party that the Securityholder Representative intends to
undertake such defense and that the Company Securityholders will indemnify the
Indemnified Parties against all Losses resulting from or relating to such
Third-Party Claim; (2) the Securityholder Representative provides Parent
and such Indemnified Party with evidence reasonably acceptable to Parent and
such Indemnified Party that the Company Securityholders will have the
financial resources to defend against the third-party claimant and fulfill
their indemnification obligations hereunder; (3) the Third-Party Claim
involves only monetary damages that will be fully covered by the Indemnity
Escrow Amount of the Escrow Fund (taking into account all other pending claims
against the Indemnity Escrow Amount of the Escrow Fund) and does not seek an

 



58  injunction or other equitable relief; (4) settlement of or an adverse
judgment with respect to the action, suit or proceeding is not, in the good
faith judgment of Parent, likely to establish a precedent adverse to the
continuing business of Parent; (5) the Third-Party Claim does not involve any
Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Rights of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries; and (6) the defense of the action, suit or proceeding is
conducted actively and diligently by legal counsel reasonably acceptable to
Parent and such Indemnified Party. If the Securityholder Representative does
not assume control of such defense, the Indemnified Party may control such
defense. The party not controlling such defense may participate therein at its
own expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Securityholder
Representative assumes control of such defense and the Indemnified Party
reasonably concludes, based on advice of counsel, that the Securityholder
Representative and the Indemnified Party have an actual conflict of interest
with respect to such action, suit or proceeding, the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party solely in connection therewith
shall be considered "Losses" that may be recovered by the Indemnified Party
under this _Article VII_; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall the
Securityholder Representative or the Company Securityholders be responsible
for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel per jurisdiction for all
Indemnified Parties. The party controlling such defense shall keep the other
party reasonably advised of the status of such action, suit or proceeding and
the defense thereof and shall consider recommendations made by the other party
with respect thereto. The Securityholder Representative shall not agree to any
settlement of such action, suit or proceeding that does not include a
complete release of all potential Indemnified Parties from all Liability with
respect thereto or that imposes any Liability on any potential Indemnified
Party without the prior written consent of such Indemnified Party.
The Indemnified Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to any Third-Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Securityholder Representative, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(c) _Resolution of Conflicts_. In case the Securityholder Representative shall
object in writing to any claim or claims made in any OfficerÂ’s Certificate,
the Securityholder Representative and Indemnified Party shall attempt in good
faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each
of such claims within forty-five (45) days following the delivery by the
Securityholder Representative of its response to such OfficerÂ’s Certificate.
If the Securityholder Representative and Indemnified Party should so agree, a
memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both
parties and, in the case of a claim against the Indemnity Escrow Amount of the
Escrow Fund, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to rely on any such memorandum and make distributions from the
Indemnity Escrow Amount of the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms
thereof. If the Securityholder Representative and the Indemnified Party are
unable to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect
to such claims within forty-five (45) days, then such conflict or dispute
will be resolved in accordance with _Section 9.7_ of this Agreement.

7.4 _Escrow Fund_. Prior to the Closing, Parent, JP Morgan Chase Bank,
National Association (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), and the Securityholder
Representative shall execute and deliver the Escrow Agreement in
substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ (the " _Escrow
Agreement_ "), and, as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent or Sub shall deposit with the Escrow Agent, as a withholding from each
Company Securityholder immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Indemnity
Escrow Amount and the Working Capital Escrow Portion to be held as a trust
fund (the " _Escrow Fund_ "). The Indemnity Escrow Amount of the Escrow Fund
shall be held in escrow by the Escrow Agent for the purpose of securing the
indemnification obligations set forth in _Article VII_. The Working Capital
Escrow Portion of the Escrow Fund shall be held in escrow by the Escrow Agent
for the purpose of securing the working capital adjustments (including
adjustments based on a Cash Deficiency), if any, to the Adjusted Purchase
Price as set forth in _Section 5.16_. The Company has delivered a schedule
that sets forth the estimated Pro Rata Share of each Company Securityholder
(the " _Escrow Allocation Schedule_ "). The Company will amend the Escrow
Allocation Schedule as of the

 



59  Effective Time to reflect any actual adjustments to the Adjusted Purchase
Price as required by, and in accordance with, this Agreement, it being
understood that the maximum value of the shares of Parent Restricted Stock to
be withheld and contributed to the Escrow Fund shall be no greater than 18.5%
of the combined value of the cash and Parent Restricted Stock withheld and
contributed by the Major Common Holders to the Escrow Fund. The value of the
shares of Parent Restricted Stock to be contributed to the Escrow Fund shall
be determined as provided in _Section 1.6(a)(iv)._

The Escrow Fund shall be held by the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement
pursuant to the terms thereof. The Escrow Fund shall be held as a trust fund
and shall not be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any
other judicial process of any creditor of any party, and shall be held and
disbursed solely for the purposes and in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement. A portion of the Escrow Fund will be treated as
imputed interest as required under the Code.

7.5 _Securityholder Representative_.

 

(a) The Company Securityholders, by the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the execution of the Stockholder Consent and the letters of
transmittal, shall be deemed to have designated Shareholder Representative
Services LLC (together with its permitted successors) as his, her or its
representative and true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact for purposes
of (i) taking all action necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, or the defense and/or settlement of any claims for which
the Company Securityholders may be required to indemnify Parent or any other
Indemnified Party pursuant to _Article VII_ of this Agreement, (ii) giving
and receiving all notices required to be given under this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement, and (iii) taking any and all additional action as is
contemplated to be taken by or on behalf of the Company Securityholders by
the terms of this Agreement.

(b) All decisions and actions by the Securityholder Representative, including
any agreement between the Securityholder Representative and Parent relating to
the defense or settlement of any claims for which the Company Securityholders
may be required to indemnify Parent pursuant to  _Article VII_ of this
Agreement, shall be binding upon all of the Company Securityholders, and no
Company Securityholder shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or
otherwise contest the same.

 

(c) The Securityholder Representative shall not have any Liability to any of
the parties hereto or to the Company Securityholders for any act done or
omitted hereunder as Securityholder Representative while acting in good faith
and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted
pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good
faith. The Company Securityholders shall severally and not jointly (based on
each Company SecurityholderÂ’s Pro Rata Share) indemnify the Securityholder
Representative and hold it harmless against any loss, Liability or expense
incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the
Securityholder Representative and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of his duties hereunder, including any out-of-
pocket costs and expenses and legal fees and other legal costs incurred by
the Securityholder Representative. If not paid directly to the Securityholder
Representative by the Company Securityholders, such losses, liabilities or
expenses may be distributed to the Securityholder Representative, on behalf
of the Company Securityholders, from the cash deposited in the Indemnity
Escrow Amount of the Escrow Fund that is otherwise distributable to Company
Securityholders after the Survival Date (and not distributed or distributable
to Parent or subject to a pending indemnification claim of Parent) pursuant
to the terms hereof and of the Escrow Agreement, at the time of distribution;
_provided_ that while this section allows the Securityholder Representative to
be paid from the Indemnity Escrow Amount of the Escrow Fund, this does not
relieve the Company Securityholders from their obligation to indemnify the
Securityholder Representative and hold it harmless against any loss, Liability
or expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the
Securityholder Representative, nor does it prevent the Securityholder
Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise.

 



60 (d) The Securityholder Representative shall have full power and authority on
behalf of each Company Securityholder to take any and all actions on behalf
of, execute any and all instruments on behalf of, and execute or waive any and
all rights of, the Company Securityholders under this _Article VII_.

 

(e) By his, her or its approval of the Merger, this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, each Company Securityholder agrees, in addition to the foregoing,
that:

(i) Parent and any other Indemnified Party shall be entitled to rely
conclusively on the instructions and decisions of the Securityholder
Representative as to (i) the settlement of any claims for indemnification by
Parent or such Indemnified Party pursuant to _Article VII_ of this Agreement,
or (ii) any other actions required or permitted to be taken by the
Securityholder Representative hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement, and no
party hereunder shall have any cause of action against Parent or such
Indemnified Party for any action taken by Parent or such Indemnified Party in
reliance upon the instructions or decisions of the Securityholder
Representative;

(ii) all actions, decisions and instructions of the Securityholder
Representative shall be conclusive and binding upon all of the Company
Securityholders and no Company Securityholder shall have any cause of action
against the Securityholder Representative for any action taken, decision made
or instruction given by the Securityholder Representative under this Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement, except for gross negligence or bad faith by the
Securityholder Representative in connection with the matters described in
this _Section 7.5_;

(iii) the provisions of this _Section 7.5_ are independent and severable,
are irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall be enforceable
notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Company Securityholder may
have in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

 

(f) The individual serving as the Securityholder Representative may resign
(upon no less than thirty (30) days prior notice to Parent, the Escrow Agent
and each Company Securityholder that was outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than holders of Dissenting Shares)). In the event of the
death or permanent disability of the then-acting
Securityholder Representative, or if the then-acting Securityholder
Representative shall give notice of intent to resign, the holders of a
majority in interest of Company Securityholders (other than holders of
Dissenting Shares) outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(on an as-converted to Company Common Stock basis, assuming the exercise of
all Vested Options and Company Warrants) shall, by written notice to Parent
and the Escrow Agent, appoint a successor Securityholder Representative as
soon as practicable, and in no event later than thirty (30) days following
such death, permanent disability or notice of intent to resign. In addition,
the individual serving as the Securityholder Representative may be replaced
from time to time by the holders of a majority in interest of the Company
Securityholders (other than holders of Dissenting Shares) outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (on an as-converted to Company Common
Stock basis, assuming the exercise of all Vested Options and Company
Warrants) upon not less than ten (10) days prior written notice to Parent, the
Escrow Agent and each Company Securityholder (other than holders of Dissenting
Shares). Each successor Securityholder Representative shall have all of the
power, authority, rights and privileges conferred by this Agreement upon the
original Securityholder Representative, and the term "Securityholder
Representative" as used herein shall be deemed to include any such successor
Securityholder Representatives.

 



61 (g) In connection with any claim by an Indemnified Party for indemnification
under this  _Article VII,_ Parent shall, upon the reasonable request of the
Securityholder Representative, provide the Securityholder Representative with
reasonable access to information (including electronic access, to the extent
available and secure) about the Surviving Corporation and the reasonable
assistance of the officers and employees of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation for the purpose of performing its duties and exercising its rights
under this Agreement with respect to such claim; provided that the
Securityholder Representative will treat confidentially any nonpublic
information it receives from Parent regarding the Surviving Corporation
(except the Securityholder Representative (i) may disclose information to
its employees, advisors or consultants or the Company Securityholders in
connection with the performance by the Securityholder Representative of its
duties or the exercise of its rights under this Agreement, (ii) shall disclose
to such parties the confidentiality restrictions contained in this _Section
7.5(g)_ and (iii) be responsible for any disclosure by such parties that would
be in violation of the provisions of this _Section 7.5(g)_ as if such parties
were party to this Agreement).

(h) The provisions of this _Section 7.5_ shall be binding upon the executors,
heirs, legal representatives, personal representatives, successor trustees
and successors of each Company Securityholder, and any references in this
Agreement to a Company Securityholder or the Company Securityholders shall
mean and include the successors to the rights of the Company Securityholders
hereunder, whether pursuant to testamentary disposition, the Laws of descent
and distribution or otherwise.

63 8.3 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any
time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the party
against whom enforcement is sought. For purposes of this _Section 8.3_, any
amendment that purports to be enforceable against the Company Securityholders

waiver that is signed prior to the Effective Time that purports to be
enforceable against the Company Securityholders must be signed by the Company

65 9.2 _Interpretation_. The words "include," "includes" and "including" when
used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement. The term "willful breach" shall mean an
action or omission that constitutes a breach of a covenant and that was taken
or omitted to be taken for the purpose of breaching such covenant and was not
merely a volitional action or omission but does not require malicious or
tortious intent. The term "intentional misrepresentation" shall mean that an
action or omission that constitutes a breach of a representation or warranty
and that was taken or omitted to be taken for the purpose of misleading the
party to whom such representation or warranty was made and was not merely a
volitional action or omission but does not otherwise require malicious or
tortious intent.

9.3 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile or other
electronic transmission and in one or more counterparts, all of which shall
be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one
or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to
the other party, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same
counterpart.

9.4 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, the Schedule of
Exceptions, the Confidential Disclosure Agreement, and the documents and
instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto referenced herein:
(i) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement; (ii) except with respect to Indemnified
Parties under _Article VII_ of this Agreement and as provided in the final
sentence of this _Section 9.4_, are not intended to confer upon any other
Person any rights or remedies hereunder; and (iii) shall not be assigned by
operation of Law or otherwise, except that Parent may assign its rights and
delegate its obligations hereunder to its Affiliates or (after the Closing) to
any purchaser of the Surviving Corporation or of all or substantially all of
the assets or business of the Surviving Corporation provided further that in
the case of such assignment, Parent will remain liable for all of their
obligations hereunder and any failure of assignee or assignees to discharge
the same. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(but without limiting any of the rights of the Securityholder Representative
hereunder), if the Merger is consummated, (i) the Company Securityholders
shall be third party beneficiaries of the provisions set forth in Article I,
and (ii) the CompanyÂ’s former officers and directors shall be third party
beneficiaries of the provisions set forth in _Section 5.20_.

9.5 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with
a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

 

9.6 _Other Remedies_. Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a
party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 



66 9.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Venue_. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED HEREIN,
