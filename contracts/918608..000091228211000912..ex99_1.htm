time periods specified in such Laws imposed by such Governmental Entities.

management or other employees who have a significant role in the internal
control over financial reporting of European Goldfields.

summarize and report financial information; (y) since December 31, 2010, there
have been no changes in Eldorado's internal controls over financial reporting;

provided, however, that nothing contained in this Subsection 7.1(a) or any
other provision of this Agreement shall prevent European Goldfields from, and
European Goldfields shall be permitted to engage in discussions or
negotiations with, or respond to enquiries from any Person that has made a
bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that the European
Goldfields Board has determined constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
result in a Superior Proposal, or provide information and access to
properties, facilities, books or records of European Goldfields pursuant to
Subsection 7.1(d) to any Person where the requirements of that Section are
met.

  

  

    

  |  

(b)

  |  

European Goldfields shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Eldorado)
with respect to any potential Acquisition Proposal and, in connection
therewith, European Goldfields will discontinue access to any of its
confidential information (and not establish or allow access to any of its
confidential information, or any data room, virtual or otherwise) and shall as
soon as possible request the return or destruction of all confidential
information provided in

\- 82 -

connection therewith to the extent such information has not already been
returned or destroyed. European Goldfields agrees not to release any third
party from any confidentiality, non-solicitation or standstill agreement to
which such third party is a party, or terminate, modify, amend or waive the
terms thereof and European Goldfields undertakes to enforce, or cause its
Subsidiaries to enforce, all standstill, non-disclosure, non-disturbance, non-
solicitation and similar covenants that it or any of its Subsidiaries have
entered into prior to the date hereof or entered into after the date hereof.

(c)

  |  

From and after the date of this Agreement, European Goldfields shall
immediately provide notice to Eldorado of any unsolicited Acquisition Proposal
or any proposal, inquiry or offer that could lead to an Acquisition Proposal
or any amendments to the foregoing or any request for non-public information
relating to European Goldfields or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
such an Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties, books or records
of European Goldfields or any Subsidiary by any Person that informs European
Goldfields, any member of the European Goldfields Board or such Subsidiary
that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such
notice to Eldorado shall be made, from time to time, first immediately orally
and then promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) in writing and shall
indicate the identity of the Person making such proposal, inquiry or contact,
all material terms thereof and such other details of the proposal, inquiry or
contact known to European Goldfields, and shall include copies of any such
proposal, inquiry, offer or request or any amendment to any of the foregoing.
European Goldfields shall keep Eldorado promptly and fully informed of the
status, including any change to the material terms, of any such Acquisition
Proposal, offer, inquiry or request and will respond promptly to all inquiries
by Eldorado with respect thereto.

   
---|---|---

(d)

  |  

If European Goldfields receives a request for material non-public information
from a Person who proposes to European Goldfields an unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal and: (x) the European Goldfields Board determines that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
result in a Superior Proposal; and (y) in the opinion of the European
Goldfields Board, acting in good faith and on advice from its outside legal
advisors, the failure to provide such party with access to information
regarding European Goldfields and its Subsidiaries would be inconsistent with
the fiduciary duties of the European Goldfields Board, then, and only in such
case, European Goldfields may provide such Person with access to information
regarding European Goldfields and its Subsidiaries, subject to the execution
of a confidentiality and standstill agreement which is customary in such
situations and which, in any event and taken as a whole, is no less favourable
to European Goldfields than the Confidentiality Agreement, then provided that
European Goldfields sends a copy of any such confidentiality and standstill
agreement to Eldorado promptly upon its execution and Eldorado is provided
with a list of, and, at the request of Eldorado,

copies of, the information provided to such Person and immediately provided
with access to similar information to which such Person was provided.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(e)

  |  

European Goldfields agrees that it will not accept, approve or enter into any
agreement (a "Proposed Agreement"), other than a confidentiality agreement as
contemplated by Subsection 7.1(d), with any Person providing for or to
facilitate any Acquisition Proposal unless:

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(i)

  |  

the European Goldfields Board determines that the Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(ii)

  |  

the European Goldfields Meeting has not occurred;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(iii)

  |  

European Goldfields has complied with Subsections 7.1(a) through 7.1(d)
inclusive;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(iv)

  |  

European Goldfields has provided Eldorado with a notice in writing that there
is a Superior Proposal together with all documentation related to and
detailing the Superior Proposal, including a copy of any Proposed Agreement
relating to such Superior Proposal, and a written notice from the European
Goldfields Board regarding the value in financial terms that the European
Goldfields Board has in consultation with its financial advisors determined
should be ascribed to any non-cash consideration offered under the Superior
Proposal, such documents to be so provided to Eldorado not less than five
business days prior to the proposed acceptance, approval, recommendation or
execution of the Proposed Agreement by European Goldfields;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(v)

  |  

Five business days shall have elapsed from the date Eldorado received the
notice and documentation referred to in Subsection 7.1(e)(iv) from European
Goldfields and, if Eldorado has proposed to amend the terms of the Arrangement
in accordance with Subsection 7.1(f), the European Goldfields Board shall have
determined, in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that the Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal
compared to the proposed amendment to the terms of the Arrangement by
Eldorado;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(vi)

  |  

European Goldfields concurrently terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Subsection 8.2(a)(iv)(C); and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(vii)

  |  

European Goldfields has previously, or concurrently will have, paid to
Eldorado the European Goldfields Termination Fee;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

and European Goldfields further agrees that it will not withdraw, modify or
qualify (or propose to withdraw, modify or qualify) in any manner adverse to
Eldorado the approval or recommendation of the

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 84 -  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Arrangement, nor accept, approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal unless
the requirements of this Subsection 7.1(e)(i) through Subsection 7.1(e)(v)
have been satisfied or pursuant to Subsection 7.1(h).

  

  

    

  |  

(f)

  |  

European Goldfields acknowledges and agrees that, during the five business day
period referred to in Subsections 7.1(e)(iv) and 7.1(e)(v) or such longer
period as European Goldfields may approve for such purpose, Eldorado shall
have the opportunity, but not the obligation, to propose to amend the terms of
this Agreement and the Arrangement and European Goldfields shall co-operate
with Eldorado with respect thereto, including negotiating in good faith with
Eldorado to enable Eldorado to make such adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Arrangement as Eldorado deems appropriate
and as would enable Eldorado to proceed with the Arrangement and any related
transactions on such adjusted terms. The European Goldfields Board will review
any proposal by Eldorado to amend the terms of the Arrangement in order to
determine, in good faith in the exercise of its fiduciary duties and
consistent with Subsection 7.1(a), whether Eldorado's proposal to amend the
Arrangement would result in the Acquisition Proposal not being a Superior
Proposal compared to the proposed amendment to the terms of the Arrangement.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(g)

  |  

The European Goldfields Board shall promptly reaffirm its recommendation of
the Arrangement by press release after: (x) any Acquisition Proposal which the
European Goldfields Board determines not to be a Superior Proposal is publicly
announced or made; or (y) the European Goldfields Board determines that a
proposed amendment to the terms of the Arrangement would result in the
Acquisition Proposal which has been publicly announced or made not being a
Superior Proposal, and Eldorado has so amended the terms of the Arrangement.
Eldorado and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the form and content of any such press release, recognizing that
whether or not such comments are appropriate will be determined by European
Goldfields, acting reasonably.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(h)

  |  

Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the European Goldfields Board from
responding through a directors' circular or otherwise as required by
applicable Securities Laws to an Acquisition Proposal that it determines is
not a Superior Proposal, or from withdrawing, modifying or changing its
recommendation as a result of an Eldorado Material Adverse Effect. Further,
nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the European Goldfields Board from
making any disclosure to the securityholders of European Goldfields if the
European Goldfields Board, acting in good faith and upon the advice of its
legal advisors, shall have first determined that the failure to make such
disclosure would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the European
Goldfields Board or such disclosure is otherwise required under applicable
Law, provided, however, that, notwithstanding the

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 85 -  

  

 

 

 

   
 

    

  |  

European Goldfields Board shall be permitted to make such disclosure, the
European Goldfields Board shall not be permitted to make a European Goldfields
Change in Recommendation, other than as permitted by Subsection 7.1(e) or the
first sentence of this paragraph. Eldorado and its counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the form and content of any
such disclosure, recognizing that whether or not such comments are appropriate
will be determined by European Goldfields, acting reasonably.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(i)

  |  

European Goldfields acknowledges and agrees that each successive modification
of any Acquisition Proposal shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for
the purposes of this Section 7.1.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(j)

  |  

European Goldfields shall ensure that the officers, directors and employees of
European Goldfields and its Subsidiaries and any investment bankers or other
advisors or representatives retained by European Goldfields and/or its
Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are aware of the provisions of this Section, and European Goldfields
shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 7.1 by such officers,
directors, employees, investment bankers, advisors or representatives.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(k)

  |  

If European Goldfields provides Eldorado with the notice of an Acquisition
Proposal contemplated in this Section 7.1 on a date that is less than seven
calendar days prior to the European Goldfields Meeting, if requested by
Eldorado, European Goldfields shall adjourn the European Goldfields Meeting to
a date that is not less than seven calendar days and not more than 10 calendar
days after the date of such notice, provided, however, that the European
Goldfields Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed to a date later than
the seventh (7) business day prior to the Outside Date.

and European Goldfields shall, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to afford to the other Party and to Representatives of the
other Party such access as the other Party may reasonably require at all
reasonable times, including for the purpose of facilitating integration
business planning, to their officers, employees, agents, properties, books,
records and contracts, and shall furnish the other Party with all data and
information as the other Party may reasonably request. Eldorado and European
Goldfields acknowledge and agree that information furnished pursuant to this
Section 7.2 shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

would, or would be likely to:

  |  

(i)

  |  

cause any of the representations or warranties of such Party contained herein
to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect on the date hereof or at
the Effective Time (provided, however, that this clause (i) shall not apply in
the case of any event or state of facts resulting from the actions or

  |  

No Party may elect not to complete the transactions contemplated hereby
pursuant to the conditions set forth herein or any termination right arising
therefrom under Subsection 8.2(a)(iii)(B) or Subsection 8.2(a)(iv)(B) and no

delivered a written notice to the other Party specifying in reasonable detail
all breaches of covenants, representations and warranties or other matters
which the Party delivering such notice is asserting as the basis for the non-
fulfilment or the applicable condition or termination right, as the case may
be. If any such notice is delivered, provided, however, that a Party is
proceeding diligently to cure such matter and such matter is capable of being
cured, no Party may terminate this Agreement until the expiration of a period
of ten business days from such notice.

European Goldfields' Greek projects), in either case that may occur or that
may be produced by or provided to European Goldfields after the date of this
Agreement.

Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement
and that, without those agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Each Party acknowledges that all of the payment amounts set out in
this Section 8.3 are payments of liquidated damages which are a genuine pre-
estimate of the damages, which the Party entitled to such damages will suffer
or incur as a result of the event giving rise to such payment and the
resultant termination of this Agreement and are not penalties. Each of
European Goldfields and Eldorado irrevocably waives any right it may have to
raise as a defence that any such liquidated damages are excessive or punitive.

Agreement under circumstances where European Goldfields or Eldorado is
entitled to a Fee and such Fee is paid in full, European Goldfields or
Eldorado, as the case may be, shall be precluded from any other remedy against
the other Party at Law or in equity or otherwise (including, without
limitation, an order for specific performance), and shall not seek to obtain
any recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including consequential,
indirect, or punitive damages, against the other Party or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
partners, managers, members, shareholders or affiliates or their respective
Representatives in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, provided, however, that payment by a Party of a Fee shall
not be in lieu of any damages or any other payment or remedy available
(including, without limitation, an order for specific performance) in the
event of any wilful or intentional breach by such Party of any of its
obligations under this Agreement.

  |  

(c)

An Eligible Holder whose European Goldfields Shares are exchanged for the
Consideration pursuant to the Arrangement shall be entitled to make an income
tax election, pursuant to section 85 of the Tax Act (and any analogous
provision of provincial income tax law) (a "Section 85 Election") with respect
to the exchange by providing the necessary information in accordance with the
procedures set out in the tax instruction letter on or before 90 days after
the Effective Date. Neither European Goldfields, Eldorado nor any successor
corporation shall be responsible for the proper completion of any election
form nor, except for the obligation to sign and return duly completed election
forms which are received within 90 days of the Effective Date, for any taxes,
interest or penalties resulting from the failure of an Eligible Holder to
properly complete or file such election forms in the form and manner and
within the time prescribed by the Tax Act (or any applicable provincial
legislation). In its sole discretion, Eldorado or any successor corporation
may choose to sign and return an election form received by it more than 90

In no event shall any holder of European Goldfields Shares be entitled to a
fractional Eldorado Share. Where the aggregate number of Eldorado Shares to be
issued to a European Goldfields Shareholder as consideration under this
Arrangement would result in a fraction of a Eldorado Share being issuable, the
number of Eldorado Shares to be received by such European Goldfields
Shareholder shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Eldorado Share and in
lieu of a fractional Eldorado Share, the European Goldfields Shareholder will
receive a cash payment in Canadian dollars (rounded down

  

   
 

 

 

 


 

  

A-11

 

  

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

   
 

to the nearest cent) determined on the basis of an amount equal to (i) the
volume weighted average trading price on the TSX of the Eldorado Shares over
the five business days ending one business day before the Effective Date,
multiplied by the (ii) fractional share amount. Any such cash payable in lieu
of fractional Eldorado Shares will be denominated in Canadian dollars.

Goldfields not later than 5:00 p.m. on the Business Day that is two (2)

(i)

  |  

are ultimately entitled to be paid fair value for their European Goldfields
Shares, which fair value, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in the YBCA, shall be determined as of the close of business on the day before
the Effective Date, shall be deemed to have transferred their European
Goldfields Shares to Eldorado in exchange for the right to be paid fair value
for such European Goldfields Shares, and Eldorado shall thereupon be obligated
to pay the amount therefore determined to be the fair value of such European
Goldfields Shares; and

(ii)

are ultimately not entitled, for any reason, to be paid fair value for their
European Goldfields Shares shall be deemed to have participated in the
Arrangement, as of the Effective Time, on the same basis as a non-dissenting
holder of European Goldfields Shares and shall be entitled to receive only the
Consideration contemplated in Subsection 3.1(d) hereof that such holder would
have received pursuant to the Arrangement if such holder had not exercised
Dissent Rights;

   
---|---|---

the following shall be entitled to exercise Dissent Rights: (i) holders of

Goldfields Shareholders who vote, or who have instructed a proxyholder to
vote, in favour of the Arrangement Resolution.

---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(a)

  |  

Upon surrender to the Depository for cancellation of a certificate that
immediately before the Effective Time represented one or more outstanding
European Goldfields Shares that were exchanged for Eldorado Shares in
accordance with Subsection 3.1(c) or (d) hereof (other than a European
Goldfields Share that was issued on the exercise of a European Goldfields RSU
in accordance with Subsection 3.1(a) hereof and exchanged for Eldorado Shares
in accordance with Subsection 3.1(d) hereof) together with such other
documents and instruments as would have been required to effect the transfer
of the European Goldfields Shares formerly represented by such certificate
under the YBCA and the articles of European Goldfields and such additional
documents and instruments as the Depository may reasonably require, the holder
of such surrendered certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, and the Depository shall deliver to such holder following the
Effective Time, a certificate representing the Eldorado Shares and a cheque
representing the cash that such holder is entitled to receive in accordance
with Subsection 3.1(d) hereof.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(b)

  |

issued upon exercise of a European Goldfields RSU in accordance with
Subsection 3.1(a) and exchanged for Eldorado Shares in accordance with
Subsection 3.1(c) or (d) hereof, together with such additional documents and
instruments as the Depository may reasonably require, the former holder of

  |  

certificate representing the Eldorado Shares and a cheque representing the
cash that such holder is entitled to receive in accordance with Subsection
3.1(c) or (d) hereof, except that the Depository shall withhold and not
deliver to a particular holder share certificates representing such number of
Eldorado Shares as it reasonably believes are necessary to be retained and
sold by the Depository on behalf of European Goldfields in order to satisfy
any withholding tax obligation arising in respect of the issuance of European
Goldfields Shares to the holders under the European Goldfields RSU Plan in
accordance with Subsection 3.1(a).

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(c)

  |  

The Depository shall, forthwith and acting reasonably, sell the Eldorado
Shares retained in accordance with Section 5.1(b) and remit the appropriate
amount in respect of each holder to the appropriate taxing authority, and to
the extent the sale proceeds of the Eldorado Shares so retained in respect of
a particular holder (less all reasonable selling expenses) exceeds the actual
withholding obligation arising in respect of that holder, the excess shall
forthwith be paid to the holder in cash. All amounts so remitted to the
appropriate taxing authority in respect of a particular holder shall be
treated for all purposes hereof as having been paid to that particular holder.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(d)

  |  

After the Effective Time and until surrendered for cancellation as
contemplated by Subsection 5.1(a) hereof, each certificate that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented one or more European Goldfields Shares
shall be deemed at all times to represent only the right to receive in
exchange therefor the Consideration that the holder of such certificate is
entitled to receive in accordance with Section 3.1 hereof.

Lost Certificates

If any certificate, that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
one or more outstanding European Goldfields Shares that were exchanged for the
Consideration in accordance with Section 3.1 hereof, shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Depositary shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, the Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive in
accordance with Section 3.1 hereof. When authorizing such delivery of
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the holder to whom such Consideration
is to be delivered shall, as a condition precedent to the delivery of such
Consideration, give a bond satisfactory to Eldorado and the Depositary in such
amount as Eldorado and the Depositary may direct, or otherwise indemnify
Eldorado and the Depositary in a manner satisfactory to Eldorado and the
Depositary, against any claim that may be made against Eldorado or the
Depositary with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen
or destroyed and shall otherwise take such actions as may be required by the
articles and by-laws of European Goldfields.

---|--- 
 

  

 

  

No dividend or other distribution declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to Eldorado Shares with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding European
Goldfields Shares unless and until the holder of such certificate shall have
complied with the provisions of Section 5.1 or Section 5.2 hereof. Subject to
applicable Law and to Section 5.4 hereof, at the time of such compliance,
there shall, in addition to the delivery of Consideration to which such holder
is thereby entitled, be delivered to such holder, without interest, the amount
of the dividend or other distribution with a record date after the Effective
Time theretofore paid with respect to such Eldorado Shares.

  

  

    

5.4

Withholding Rights

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

Eldorado, European Goldfields and the Depository shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from all dividends or other distributions or payments otherwise
payable to any Former European Goldfields Shareholder, Former European
Goldfields RSU Holder, Former European Goldfields DPU Holder or other person
(an "Affected Person") such amounts as Eldorado, European Goldfields or the
Depository is required or permitted to deduct and withhold with respect to
such payment under the Tax Act or any provision of any applicable federal,
provincial, state, local or foreign tax law or treaty, in each case, as
amended (a "Withholding Obligations"). To the extent that amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof as
having been paid to the Affected Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts are actually
remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. Eldorado, European Goldfields
and the Depository shall also have the right to withhold and sell, on their
own account or through a broker (the "Broker"), and on behalf of any Affected
Person, such number of Eldorado Shares issued or issuable to such Affected
Person pursuant to the Arrangement Agreement as is necessary to produce sale
proceeds (after deducting commissions payable to the broker and other costs
and expenses) sufficient to fund any Withholding Obligations. Any such sale of
Eldorado Shares shall be affected on a public market and as soon as
practicable following the Effective Date. None of Eldorado, European
Goldfields, the Depository or the Broker will be liable for any loss arising
out of any sale of such Eldorado Shares, including any loss relating to the
manner or timing of such sales, the prices at which the Eldorado Shares are
sold or otherwise.

To the extent that a Former European Goldfields Shareholder shall not have
complied with the provisions of Section 5.1 or Section 5.2 hereof on or before
the date that is six (6) years after the Effective Date (the "final
proscription date"), then the Consideration that such Former European
Goldfields Shareholder was entitled to receive shall be automatically
cancelled without any repayment of capital in respect thereof and the
Consideration to which such Former European Goldfields Shareholder was
entitled, shall be delivered to Eldorado by the Depositary and certificates
representing Eldorado Shares forming the Consideration shall be cancelled by
Eldorado, and the interest of the

Former European Goldfields Shareholder in such Eldorado Shares and cash to

issued prior to the Effective Time; (ii) the rights and obligations of the
registered holders of European Goldfields Shares, European Goldfields Options,
European Goldfields RSUs and European Goldfields DPUs, and European

of Arrangement; and (iii) all actions, causes of action, claims or proceedings
(actual or contingent and whether or not previously asserted) based on or in
any way relating to any European Goldfields Shares or European Goldfields
Options, European Goldfields RSUs or European Goldfields DPUs shall be deemed
to have been settled, compromised, released and determined without liability
except as set forth herein.
