determining the Purchase Price.

(c) For twenty (20) days (or such longer period as the parties hereto may

hand, and the Purchaser Parties, on the other hand, shall attempt to resolve

reports of such unresolved item or items and deliver such reports to the

reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accountant to, acting as an
arbitrator, as soon as practicable and in any event within thirty (30) days

or items shall be treated in the Closing Net Worth Statement; provided,
however, that the dollar amount of each item in dispute shall be determined

Independent Accountant containing customary terms and conditions for this type
of engagement. The parties hereto shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with and provide information and documentation, including
work papers, to assist the Independent Accountant. Any such information or
documentation provided by any party hereto to the Independent Accountant shall
be concurrently delivered to the other parties hereto, subject, in the case of
independent accountant work papers, to such other parties hereto entering into
a customary release agreement with respect thereto. None of the parties hereto
shall disclose to the Independent

* * *





Accountant, and the Independent Accountant shall not consider for any
purposes, any settlement discussions or settlement offers made by any of the
parties hereto with respect to any objection under this Section 2.3. The
determinations by the Independent Accountant as to the item or items in
dispute shall be in writing and shall be an arbitral award that is final,
binding and conclusive for all purposes of determining the Purchase Price, and
such award may be entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.
The fees, costs and expenses of retaining the Independent Accountant shall be
borne by the Purchaser Parties, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other
hand, in proportion to those matters submitted to the Independent Accountant
that are resolved against the Purchaser Parties, on the one hand, and Seller,
on the other hand, and the allocation of such fees, costs and expenses shall
be so determined by the Independent Accountant. No later than the fifth
Business Day immediately following the resolution of all disputed items (or,
if there is no dispute, promptly after the parties hereto reach agreement on
the Closing Net Worth Statement), the Purchaser Parties shall revise the
Closing Net Worth Statement to reflect the resolution of any disputed items
(as so revised, the "Final Closing Net Worth Statement") and shall deliver a
copy thereof to Seller. Seller shall have five (5) Business Days from the date
on which the Closing Net Worth Statement is delivered to it to review the
Final Closing Net Worth Statement solely for purposes of confirming that it
accurately reflects the prior resolution of all matters set forth in the
Dispute Notice either by mutual agreement of the parties hereto or by the
Independent Accountant, as applicable. The Adjusted Statutory Net Worth of the
Company reflected in such Final Closing Net Worth Statement, once accepted by
Seller in the manner provided by the preceding sentence, shall be referred to
as the "Final Closing Adjusted Statutory Net Worth".

(d) Effective upon the end of the Review Period (if a timely Dispute Notice is
not delivered), or upon the resolution of all matters set forth in the Dispute
Notice either by mutual agreement of the parties hereto or by the Independent
Accountant, the Closing Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment as
follows: (i) if the Final Closing Adjusted Statutory Net Worth is less than
the Estimated Closing Adjusted Statutory Net Worth, the Closing Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the amount equal to the amount by which the Final Closing
Adjusted Statutory Net Worth is less than the Estimated Closing Adjusted
Statutory Net Worth, which amount shall be paid by Seller to the Purchaser
Parties in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.3(d); and (ii) if
the Final Closing Adjusted Statutory Net Worth is greater than the Estimated
Closing Adjusted Statutory Net Worth, the Closing Purchase Price shall be
increased by the amount equal to the amount by which the Final Closing
Adjusted Statutory Net Worth is greater than the Estimated Closing Adjusted
Statutory Net Worth, which amount shall be paid by the Purchaser Parties to
Seller in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.3(d). Any
adjustment to the Closing Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 2.3(d) shall
be paid by the applicable party hereto by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, to an account or accounts designated by the other party
hereto in writing on the fifth Business Day following the delivery of the
Final Closing Net Worth Statement, once accepted by Seller in the manner
provided by the penultimate sentence of Section 2.3(c).

Parties would reasonably be expected to have any liability, (ii) accelerate
the time of payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding (through a
grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the
amount payable or result in any other material obligation pursuant to, any of
the Benefit Plans for which any Acquired Company or any of the Purchaser
Parties would reasonably be expected to have any liability or (iii) result in

that Seller seek such consent, approval or waiver); provided, however, each
party hereto shall bear its own legal and other advisory fees related to the
matters set forth in the foregoing clauses (A), (B) and (C). None of the

is aware or reasonably should be aware would have the effect of delaying,
impairing or impeding in any material respect the receipt of any consent,
authorization, order or approval of, any exemption by, or any waiver from, any
Governmental Authority, including any Required Approvals.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) the Purchaser

contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. The parties hereto
agree that they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of
all applications, filings, registrations, notifications, permits, consents,

necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement and each party hereto will keep the
others apprised of the status of such matters. The party hereto responsible
for any such action shall promptly deliver to the other parties hereto
evidence of the filing or making of all applications, filings, registrations,
notifications, permits, consents, approvals, waivers and authorizations
relating thereto, and any supplement, amendment or item of additional
information in connection therewith.

receiving any communication from any Governmental Authority whose consent or
approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, including promptly furnishing each

communication causes such party hereto to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any Required Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt
of any such approval will be materially delayed or conditioned.

hand, or Seller or either Acquired Company, on the other hand, shall
participate or permit any of their officers or any other representatives or
agents to participate in any live or telephonic meeting with any Governmental

inquiry (other than (i) for routine or ministerial matters or (ii)
communications by the Purchaser Parties or any of their

* * *





respective Affiliates with applicable Governmental Authorities in its
jurisdiction of domicile (other than the Department); provided that the
Purchaser Parties notify Seller promptly of any such meeting and of the
material matters discussed thereat) relating to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements unless it consults with the
other parties hereto in advance and, to the extent permitted by Law or by such
Governmental Authority, gives the other parties hereto the opportunity to
attend and participate thereat.

(h) Nothing contained in this Section 5.3 shall require a party hereto to
disclose to the other parties hereto (i) confidential personal or financial
information of any of its directors, officers, partners or Affiliates or (ii)

interfere in any material respect with the operations of Seller and its
Subsidiaries. Seller shall, and shall cause the Company to, promptly provide
to the Purchaser Parties copies of any responses to such filings and
reasonable cooperation and assistance to the Purchaser Parties regarding any
information or document requests or follow-up inquiries from the Department in
regards to such filings. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 5.3(i), the effectiveness of all filings contemplated by this Section
5.3(i) shall be conditioned on the consummation of the Closing; provided,
however, that the effectiveness of all such filings shall not be a condition
to the Closing. The Purchaser Parties shall promptly reimburse Seller and its
Subsidiaries for all of their out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably
incurred in connection with the provisions of this Section 5.3(i) (other than
costs of outside counsel). Unless requested by the Department, the Purchaser
Parties shall not request that the Company file any "Form D" filing with the

parties, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(i) Upon the written request of the Purchaser Parties setting forth in detail
the computation of the amount owed, Seller shall pay to the Purchaser Parties,
no later than three (3) days prior to the due date for the applicable Tax

the close of the Closing Date and the period deemed to begin at the beginning
of the day following the Closing Date on the basis of an interim closing of
the books, except that Taxes (such as real or personal property Taxes) imposed
on a periodic basis shall be allocated on a daily basis.

event, or surrender any right to claim a Tax refund, offset or other reduction

Purchaser Parties, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or

other Person to take, any action that could directly (i) increase Seller\'s or
any of its Affiliates\' liability for Taxes or (ii) result in, or change the
character of, any income or gain that must be reported on any Tax Return filed
or to be filed by Seller or any of its Affiliates (including any Tax Return
filed or required to be filed by either Acquired Company for a taxable year or
period beginning on or before the Closing Date); provided that the Purchaser
Parties shall not be prohibited from making or changing any Tax election,
changing any method of Tax accounting, or changing any Tax position of an
Acquired Company for any period beginning after the Closing Date; and provided
further that the Purchaser Parties shall obtain the prior written consent of
Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) with respect
to any action described in the foregoing proviso that reasonably could be
expected to affect the Taxes of Seller or any of its Affiliates.



(h) Tax Refunds. Upon receipt, the Purchaser Parties shall promptly forward to
Seller any refund, rebate, abatement, reduction or other recovery (whether
direct or indirect through a right of set-off or credit) of Taxes of either
Acquired Company, and any interest received thereon, with respect to any
taxable year or period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing
Date, except to the extent that such amounts relate to any refund, rebate,
abatement, reduction or other recovery of Taxes that are included in the Tax
assets taken into account in the preparation of the Closing Net Worth
Statement or the adjustment to the Closing Purchase Price, if any, pursuant to
Section 2.3 (and in the event that such excepted amounts are received by
Seller, Seller shall promptly forward such amounts to the Purchaser Parties).

(i) Section 338(h)(10) Election.

(i) Seller shall join with Acorn Holdco, and Acorn Holdco shall join with
Seller, in timely making an election, and in taking any and all other actions
necessary to effect and preserve such election, under Section 338(h)(10) of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and any
corresponding elections under applicable foreign, state or local income Tax
law (each a "Section 338(h)(10) Election") with respect to the purchase and
sale of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement. Seller and the Purchaser
Parties shall mutually prepare all documents and forms as are required by
applicable Tax law for effective Section 338(h)(10) Elections with respect to
such sale of the Shares, which sale shall be treated as occurring on the
Closing Date. None of Seller or any Purchaser Party shall take, or cause or

* * *





permit any other Person to take, any action that causes any such Section
338(h)(10) Election to not be available to Seller or any Purchaser Party, or
that causes any Section 338(h)(10) Election (or the effects thereof) to be
revoked or otherwise no longer effective.

(ii) Seller and the Purchaser Parties shall cooperate and jointly agree, on or
prior to the date that is one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the last date
for filing the earliest Section 338(h)(10) Election pursuant to Section
5.4(i)(i), on the general methodology to be used to determine the "Aggregate
Deemed Sale Price" ("ADSP") as defined in Treasury Regulation §1.338-4, the
"Adjusted Grossed-Up Basis" ("AGUB") as defined in Treasury Regulation
§1.338-5, and how such ADSP and AGUB is to be allocated among the assets of
the Acquired Companies pursuant to Treasury Regulation §§1.338-6, 1.338-7, and
1.338-11. Such cooperation shall include making available to each other such
Tax data and other information as may be reasonably requested by the other
party. The Purchaser Parties shall, within thirty (30) days after such
agreement, prepare a written notice (the "Allocation Notice") in accordance
with that agreement and deliver a draft of the IRS Forms 8023 and 8883, and
all other required forms, to Seller (together with schedules thereto and
supporting documentation). In the event that Seller and the Purchaser Parties
are unable to resolve any disagreements regarding the ADSP, the AGUB, the
Allocation Notice or other aspects of the draft IRS Forms 8023 and 8883 or
other required forms as of the date that is sixty (60) days prior to the last
date for filing the earliest Section 338(h)(10) Election pursuant to Section
5.4(i)(i), the matters in dispute shall be resolved as soon as practicable
(but in no event later than the date that is twenty (20) days prior to the
last date for filing the earliest Section 338(h)(10) Election pursuant to
Section 5.4(i)(i)) pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.3(c) (insofar as
such Section relates to determinations by the Independent Accountant), which
resolution shall be final, binding and conclusive upon Seller and the
Purchaser Parties without further appeal therefrom. The parties hereto or
their respective Affiliates shall timely execute the final IRS Forms 8023 and
8883 (and comparable forms required by applicable state, local or foreign
income Tax law) and timely file the forms, and any required supplements
thereto, in the manner prescribed by applicable Treasury Regulations or the
corresponding provisions of applicable foreign, state or local income Tax law.
Seller and the Purchaser Parties shall file all Tax Returns and report Taxes
in a manner consistent with such final IRS Forms 8023 and 8883 (and comparable
forms filed under applicable state, local or foreign income Tax law).

(iii) Seller and the Purchaser Parties agree to allocate to the "Separate
Account Assets" (as defined in the Variable Universal Life Business
Coinsurance and Modified Coinsurance Agreement and the Variable Annuity
Business Coinsurance and Modified Coinsurance Agreement) the amount of ADSP
and AGUB equal to the amount of liabilities reported for U.S. federal income
Tax purposes with respect to the "Separate Accounts" (as defined in the
Variable Universal Life Business Coinsurance and Modified Coinsurance
Agreement and the Variable Annuity Business Coinsurance and Modified
Coinsurance Agreement), and Seller and the Purchaser Parties shall prepare and
file all IRS Forms 8023 and 8883 consistently with such allocation, unless
prohibited by applicable Law.

(a) The Purchaser Parties shall cause an Affiliate of the Purchaser Parties to

provided to Seller by Purchaser as of the date hereof (the "Offered
Employees"), which offers shall provide for base wages or salaries equal to
the respective base wages or salaries specified for each such employee as in
effect immediately prior to the Closing Date (and as previously provided in
the employee information described in Section 3.22(a) and made available to
the Purchaser Parties as of the date hereof, as the same may be modified prior
to the Closing Date consistent with the limitations of Section 5.2(y)(l)) and
benefits that are consistent with, and no less favorable than, those benefits
provided to similarly situated employees of Guggenheim Partners and its
Subsidiaries generally from time to time. Such offers shall be made to the
Offered Employees as soon as practicable following the date hereof, shall be
conditioned

upon the Closing, and shall be for employment commencing at 11:59 p.m, Des
Moines, Iowa time, on the Closing Date (such time, the "Offer Effective
Time"); provided that, in the case of an employee (i) who is on short term
disability leave, workers\' compensation leave, or other authorized leave of
absence as of the Closing Date, the offer of employment shall be for
employment effective immediately after the date that such employee is first
able to return to active employment or (ii) who continues employment with
Seller following the Offer Effective Time as mutually agreed between Seller
and the Purchaser Parties, the offer of employment shall be effective as of
such employee\'s last day of work with Seller as mutually agreed between
Seller and the Purchaser Parties (such date, in each case, the "Delayed
Transfer Date")). The offer to each Offered Employee shall be conditioned upon
such Offered Employee (A) passing a background check in accordance with the
standard employment practices of the Purchaser Parties and their respective
Affiliates as described to Seller prior to the date hereof and (B) remaining
employed by Seller or its Affiliates through the Offer Effective Time or (with
respect to affected employees) as of the Delayed Transfer Date, as the case
may be. Subject to the foregoing, those Offered Employees who accept an offer
of employment as described above and become so employed as of the Offer
Effective Time or (with respect to affected employees) as of the Delayed
Transfer Date, as the case may be, shall be referred to herein as "Transferred
Employees". To the extent that an Offered Employee has accepted an offer of
employment effective as of the Delayed Transfer Date, the Purchaser Parties
shall promptly upon written request after the applicable Delayed Transfer Date
reimburse Seller on an after-Tax basis for the expense of employment
continuation from the Offer Effective Time through the applicable Delayed
Transfer Date in accordance with the base wages or salaries specified for such
Offered Employee in the employee information described in Section 3.22(a) and
made available to the Purchaser Parties as of the date hereof, as the same may
be modified prior to the Closing Date consistent with the limitations of
Section 5.2(y)(l).

(b) The Purchaser Parties and their respective Affiliates shall not
communicate with any employee of Seller or its Affiliates without the prior
written consent of Seller. The parties hereto shall mutually cooperate, and
shall inform each other of the status and progress of, the process of
coordinating and making the offers of employment to the Offered Employees.
Without limiting the foregoing, the employment of Transferred Employees with
Seller shall cease immediately prior to the Offer Effective Time or (with
respect to affected employees) as of the Delayed Transfer Date, as the case
may be, and Seller shall have the sole obligation to compensate the
Transferred Employees for any vacation that has accrued but remains unused at
the time of termination of employment with Seller and for which the
Transferred Employees have a right to payment. Each party hereto shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, comply with applicable Laws in all material
respects in connection with this Section 5.5.

(c) Neither the Purchaser Parties nor any of their respective Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies after the Closing) shall have any obligation
for any payments or benefits under any Benefit Plan.

(d) For a period of at least twelve (12) months following the Offer Effective
Time, the Purchaser Parties shall, or cause any of their respective Affiliates
to, provide each Transferred Employee base wages or salaries equal to the
respective base wages or salaries specified for each such employee as of the
Closing Date as specified in the employee information described in Section
3.22(a) and made available to the Purchaser Parties as of the date hereof (as
the same may be modified after the date hereof and prior to the Closing
consistent with the limitations of Section 5.2(y)(l)).

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, nothing herein shall prevent
the Purchaser Parties or any of their respective Affiliates from terminating
any Transferred Employee following the Offer Effective Time or (with respect
to affected employees) as of the Delayed Transfer Date, as the case may be, or
amending or terminating any employee benefit plan in accordance with its
terms.

(f) The Purchaser Parties agree that for a period of not less than eighteen
(18) months following the Offer Effective Time, they shall cause the
Transferred Employees to be provided with severance benefits that are no less
favorable than those set forth on Section 5.5(f) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule (and determined based on the employee information described in
Section 3.22

prior to the Offer Effective Time or (with respect to affected employees) as
of the Delayed Transfer Date, as the case may be, under the analogous welfare
benefit plans of the Purchaser Parties or any of their respective Affiliates
in which they are eligible to participate after the Offer Effective Time or

Employee who has received an eligible rollover distribution (as defined in

such eligible rollover distribution, including any associated loans, as part
of any lump sum distribution into an account under a 401(k) savings plan
maintained by the Purchaser Parties or any of their respective Affiliates in
accordance with the terms of such plan.

hire or hiring of the Current Employees, or the Purchaser Parties\' or any of
their respective Affiliates\' failure to make an offer of employment as
contemplated by this Section 5.5; provided that with respect to the foregoing
sentence, the Purchaser Parties shall not be liable for any Losses resulting
from the actions or omissions of Seller or any of its Affiliates except to the
extent taken as directed by the Purchaser Parties or any of their respective
Affiliates, expressly recognizing that the selection of Offered Employees from
among the Current Employees was made solely by the Purchaser Parties. With
respect to any Current Employee who does not become a Transferred Employee (A)
because such employee is not an Offered Employee, (B) because such employee is
an Offered Employee to whom the Purchaser Parties failed to extend an offer of
employment consistent with the provisions of this Section 5.5 or (C) for any
other reason in the Purchaser Parties\' discretion, if Seller and its
Subsidiaries pay severance to (x) in the case of any such Current Employee who

Services Agreement of the services under the Transition Services Agreement

Section 3.22(a) and made available to the Purchaser Parties as of the date
hereof, as the same may be modified prior to the Closing Date consistent with

all severance and other employment termination obligations for Transferred
Employees that arise in connection with the employment of Transferred
Employees by the Purchaser Parties and their respective Affiliates on or after
the Offer Effective Time or (with respect to affected employees) as of the
Delayed Transfer Date, as the case may be.

(k) Seller shall indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties from any Losses
incurred by or asserted against any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties by
any employee or former employee of Seller, to the extent resulting from the
actions or omissions of Seller or any of its Affiliates in the identification
of the Current Employees.

Subject to the Purchaser Parties\' satisfaction of its obligations in the

each such AAR Report is delivered to Seller to review such AAR Report (it
being agreed that if the Purchaser Parties fail to comply with such
obligations, such fifteen (15)-day period shall be tolled for the number of
days that the Purchaser Parties withhold access to Seller) (the "AAR Review
Period"). The Purchaser Parties shall cause the Acquired Companies to, upon
request, provide Seller with reasonable assistance in reviewing each AAR
Report, including by providing Seller and Seller\'s representatives with
access to such information (including the Books and Records) and personnel and
representatives of the Acquired Companies as Seller may reasonably request in

calendar quarter. The aggregate amount of interest actually paid by Seller
under this Section 5.18(b) in respect of all calendar quarters for which an
AAR Dispute Notice was delivered is referred to as the "Paid Interest Amount".

(c) In the event that, as of the date that is the earlier of (i) the
termination of the obligations of the parties hereto under Section 5.18(f) and
(ii) the sixth Quarterly Interest Payment Date following the Closing Date,
Seller has delivered to the Purchaser Parties one or more AAR Dispute Notices,
Seller, on the one hand, and the Purchaser Parties, on the other hand, shall
prepare separate written reports related to such AAR Dispute Notice(s) and
deliver such reports to the Independent Accountant within thirty (30) days of
such date. The parties hereto shall use their respective

* * *





commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accountant to, acting
as an arbitrator, as soon as practicable and in any event within thirty (30)
days after receiving such written reports, determine (A) the amount of the
Asset Adequacy Reserve for each calendar quarter for which an AAR Dispute
Notice was delivered and (B) the aggregate amount of interest payable in
respect of such calendar quarter(s) in accordance with Section 5.18(b) (the
"Owed Interest Amount"); provided, however, that the dollar amount of the
Asset Adequacy Reserve for each calendar quarter for which an AAR Dispute
Notice was delivered shall be determined within the range of dollar amounts
proposed by Seller in the AAR Dispute Notice for such calendar quarter, on the
one hand, and the Purchaser Parties in the AAR Report for such calendar
quarter, on the other hand. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (x)
the review by and determinations of the Independent Accountant shall be
limited to, and only to, the matters set forth in clauses (A) and (B) above
contained in the reports prepared and submitted to the Independent Accountant
by Seller and the Purchaser Parties, and (y) the determinations by the
Independent Accountant shall be based solely on (a) such reports submitted by
Seller and the Purchaser Parties and the basis for Seller\'s and the Purchaser
Parties\' respective positions and (b) the Net Worth Statement Methodologies
and this Section 5.18. Seller and the Purchaser Parties agree to enter into an
engagement letter with the Independent Accountant containing customary terms
and conditions for this type of engagement. The parties hereto shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with and provide information and
documentation, including work papers, to assist the Independent Accountant.
Any such information or documentation provided by any party hereto to the
Independent Accountant shall be concurrently delivered to the other parties
hereto, subject, in the case of independent accountant work papers, to such
other parties hereto entering into a customary release agreement with respect
thereto. None of the parties hereto shall disclose to the Independent
Accountant, and the Independent Accountant shall not consider for any
purposes, any settlement discussions or settlement offers made by any of the
parties hereto with respect to any objection under this Section 5.18. The
determination by the Independent Accountant under this Section 5.18(c) shall
be in writing and shall be an arbitral award that is final, binding and
conclusive for all purposes, and such award may be entered and enforced in any
court of competent jurisdiction. The fees, costs and expenses of retaining the
Independent Accountant shall be borne by the Purchaser Parties, on the one
hand, and Seller, on the other hand, in proportion to those matters submitted
to the Independent Accountant that are resolved against the Purchaser Parties,
on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, and the allocation of such
fees, costs and expenses shall be so determined by the Independent Accountant.

(d) If the Owed Interest Amount exceeds the Paid Interest Amount, no later
than the fifth Business Day immediately following the written determination by
the Independent Accountant under Section 5.18(c), Seller shall pay to the
Purchaser Parties an amount equal to the difference between the Owed Interest
Amount and the Paid Interest Amount.

(e) Any payment by Seller to the Purchaser Parties under this Section 5.18
shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to an account
or accounts designated by the Purchaser Parties in writing no later than the
fifth Business Day prior to the date of payment.

(f) In no event shall the amount of any Asset Adequacy Reserve set forth in
any AAR Report with respect to any particular calendar quarter be greater than
the amount of the Asset Adequacy Reserve set forth in an AAR Report delivered
by the Purchaser Parties with respect to a prior calendar quarter. In the
event that an AAR Report delivered by the Purchaser Parties with respect to a
calendar quarter sets forth that the amount of Asset Adequacy Reserve as of
the last day of such calendar quarter is equal to zero, Seller shall have no
obligation to pay interest in respect of such calendar quarter, and the
obligations of the Purchaser Parties to deliver subsequent AAR Reports and of
Seller to pay interest in respect of subsequent calendar quarters under this
Section 5.18 shall terminate and be of no further force or effect. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that neither the inclusion of this Section 5.18
herein nor the provisions of this Section 5.18 shall be taken into account in
determining the existence or the amount, if any, of an Asset Adequacy Reserve
in accordance with the Net Worth Statement Methodologies.

(Taxes) shall not survive the Closing and (c) Sections 3.10(a), (d), (e), (f),

contained in this Agreement which, by their terms, are to be performed or
complied with in their entirety at or prior to the Closing, and all claims and
causes of action with respect thereto, shall terminate fifteen (15) months
from the Closing Date; provided that the covenants and agreements contained in
Section 5.4 shall survive until the Tax Indemnity Expiration Date. All of the
covenants and agreements of Seller and the Purchaser Parties contained in this
Agreement which, by their terms, are to be performed or complied with in whole
or in part following the Closing, and all claims and causes of action with
respect thereto, shall survive for the period provided in such covenants and
agreements, if any, or until performed in accordance with their terms. If a

pursuant to Section 9.1 within the applicable survival period, the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements that are the subject of
such indemnification claim shall survive with respect to such Claim Notice
solely for purposes of its resolution in accordance with the terms hereof. 

Section 7.2 Indemnification by the Purchaser Parties.

(a) Subject to Sections 7.2(b) and 7.6, the Purchaser Parties shall and shall
cause the Acquired Companies to indemnify Seller and its Affiliates (the
"Seller Indemnified Parties") from any damages, claims, losses, Liabilities,
judgments, settlements and reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys\' fees) (collectively, "Losses") incurred by or asserted against any
of the Seller Indemnified Parties, to the extent resulting from (i) any breach
of any representation or warranty made by the Purchaser Parties contained in
Article IV or the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 6.3(a)
(disregarding for this purpose all references to "material," "materiality" or
"Purchaser Material Adverse Effect"), (ii) any breach of any covenant or
agreement of the Purchaser Parties contained in this Agreement (other than
Section 5.4), (iii) any liability for Taxes of either Acquired Company for any
taxable year or period (or portion thereof) that begins after the Closing
Date, (iv) any liability for which the Purchaser Parties are liable pursuant
to Section 5.4(a) for Transfer Taxes arising out of or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, (v)
any liability for Taxes reflected or taken into account in the preparation of
the Closing Net Worth Statement or the adjustment to the Closing Purchase
Price, if any, pursuant to Section 2.3, (vi) any breach of any covenant or
agreement of any Purchaser Party contained in Section 5.4, and (vii) all other
Liabilities of whatever kind or nature, direct or indirect, absolute,
contingent, known or unknown, whether or not accrued or arising before, on or
after the Closing Date relating to, or arising out of, the Acquired Companies
or the operation of their business (except, in the case of this subclause
(vii)), for such matters for which Seller is obligated to indemnify the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 7.3 or any Ancillary
Agreement).

(b) No Claim Notice may be submitted by any Seller Indemnified Party with
respect to any Loss, nor shall the Purchaser Parties be required to indemnify
any Seller Indemnified Party against any Loss in respect of such Claim Notice,
unless the aggregate amount to be paid out in respect of such Claim Notice
exceeds $100,000 (the "Initial Threshold"); provided, however, that any series
of Losses relating to the same facts and circumstances will be aggregated for
purposes of determining whether such Losses exceed the Initial Threshold. The
Purchaser Parties shall and shall cause the Acquired Companies to be liable to
the Seller Indemnified Parties for any Losses solely to the extent the
aggregate amount of such Losses exceeds one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the
Closing Purchase Price (the "Deductible"), up to an aggregate maximum amount
equal to twenty percent (20%) of the Closing Purchase Price (the "Indemnity
Cap"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Losses resulting from Sections 7.2(a)(i)
(solely with respect to Fundamental Representations made by the Purchaser
Parties), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) shall not be subject to or
taken into account in determining the Initial Threshold or the Deductible or
be subject to the Indemnity Cap; provided, however, that the Purchaser Parties
shall be liable to the Seller Indemnified Parties for Losses resulting from
Section 7.2(a)(i) (solely with respect to Fundamental Representations made by
the Purchaser Parties) up to an aggregate maximum amount equal to the Closing
Purchase Price.



Section 7.3 Indemnification by Seller.

(a) Subject to Sections 7.3(b) and 7.6, Seller shall indemnify the Purchaser
Parties, the Acquired Companies and their respective Affiliates (the
"Purchaser Indemnified Parties" and, collectively with the Seller Indemnified
Parties, the "Indemnified Parties") from any Losses incurred by or asserted
against any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, to the extent resulting from
(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller contained in
Article III or the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 6.2(a)
(disregarding for this purpose all references to "material," "materiality" or
"Company Material Adverse Effect," other than any such references in (x)
clauses (B) and (C) of Sections 3.7(a) and (b), (y) Sections 3.7(d), 3.7(e),
3.8, 3.10(e), 3.12(d) and 3.20(c)(iii), and (z) any representation or warranty
made by Seller contained in Article III to the effect that it contains a list
of specified items or that a corresponding section of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a list of specified items), (ii) any breach of any
covenant or agreement of Seller contained in this Agreement (other than
Section 5.4), (iii) any liability for Taxes of either Acquired Company for any
taxable year or period

* * *





(or portion thereof) that ends on or before the Closing Date (other than
Transfer Taxes, if any, arising out of or in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements), (iv) any
liability for Taxes, for any taxable year that begins on or before the Closing
Date, of any consolidated, affiliated, combined, unitary, or similar group for
Tax purposes of which either Acquired Company was a member on or prior to the
Closing Date pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any
comparable provision of state, local, or foreign income Tax law, (v) any
liability for which Seller is liable pursuant to Section 5.4(a) for Transfer
Taxes arising out of or in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, (vi) any breach of any covenant or
agreement of Seller contained in Section 5.4, and (vii) any liability for
Taxes with respect to the "Separate Account Assets" (as defined in the
Variable Universal Life Business Coinsurance and Modified Coinsurance
Agreement and the Variable Annuity Business Coinsurance and Modified
Coinsurance Agreement) in connection with any position taken pursuant to
Section 5.4(i)(iii), net of (A) any Tax benefit realized that would not have
otherwise been realized or (B) any reduction in liability for Taxes that would
not have otherwise been realized.

(b) No Claim Notice may be submitted by any Purchaser Indemnified Party with
respect to any Loss, nor shall Seller be required to indemnify any Purchaser
Indemnified Party against any Loss in respect of such Claim Notice, unless the
aggregate amount to be paid out in respect of such Claim Notice exceeds the
Initial Threshold; provided, however, that any series of Losses relating to
the same facts and circumstances will be aggregated for purposes of
determining whether such Losses exceed the Initial Threshold. Seller shall be
liable to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any Losses solely to the
extent such Losses exceed the Deductible, up to an aggregate maximum amount
equal to the Indemnity Cap. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Losses resulting
from Sections 7.3(a)(i) (solely with respect to Fundamental Representations
made by Seller or representations and warranties made by Seller contained in
Sections 3.10 and 3.12(d)), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) shall not
be subject to or taken into account in determining the Initial Threshold or
the Deductible or be subject to the Indemnity Cap; provided, however, that
Seller shall be liable to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for Losses
resulting from Section 7.3(a)(i) (solely with respect to Fundamental
Representations made by Seller) up to an aggregate maximum amount equal to the
Closing Purchase Price.



Section 7.4 Claims.

(a) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification against any
Losses unless it has given to the party from whom indemnification is sought
(the "Indemnifying Party") a written claim notice relating to such Losses (a
"Claim Notice"). The Claim Notice shall be given promptly (and in any event
within fifteen (15) days) after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of the
facts indicating that a claim for indemnification may be warranted and shall
state in reasonable detail, to the extent reasonably available at such time,
the nature of the claim, identify the sections of this Agreement which form
the basis for such claim, attach copies of all material written evidence
thereof received from a third party to the date of such notice and set forth
the estimated amount of the Losses that have been or may be sustained by an
Indemnified Party relating to such claim to the extent reasonably estimable.
The failure of any Indemnified Party to give a Claim Notice shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Article VII, except to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by the failure
to give such Claim Notice.

(b) If a Claim Notice relates to a claim, action, suit, proceeding or demand
asserted by a Person who is not a party hereto or its Affiliate (or a
successor thereof) (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnifying Party may,
through counsel of its own choosing, assume the defense and investigation of
such Third Party Claim; provided that any Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to participate in any such defense with counsel of its own choice at its own
expense. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense and
investigation of such Third Party Claim, it shall, no later than thirty (30)
days following its receipt of the Claim Notice notify the Indemnified Party in
writing of its assumption of the defense and investigation of such Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnifying Party fails to take reasonable steps necessary to
defend diligently the action or proceeding after notifying the

* * *





Indemnified Party of its assumption of the defense and investigation of such
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may assume such defense, and the
reasonable fees of its attorneys and other advisors will be covered by the
indemnity provided for in this Article VII upon determination of the
Indemnifying Party\'s indemnity obligations. The Indemnifying Party shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, settle or
compromise any pending or threatened Third Party Claim in respect of which
indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not the Indemnified Party
is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) or consent to the
entry of any judgment (A) which does not, to the extent that an Indemnified
Party may have any liability with respect to such action or claim for which it
is entitled to indemnification hereunder, include as an unconditional term
thereof the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of
a written release from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim or
(B) which involves any injunctive relief against the Indemnified Party with
respect to such action or claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the
Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days following its receipt of the Claim
Notice that it desires to assume the defense and investigation of such Third
Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate
in any such defense at its sole cost and expense. The Indemnified Party may
not compromise or settle any Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party unless the sole relief granted is equitable
relief for which the Indemnifying Party would have no liability or to which
the Indemnifying Party would not be subject. The Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall make reasonably available to each other and their
respective agents and representatives all relevant business records and other
documents available to them that are necessary or appropriate for the defense
of any Third Party Claim, subject to any bona fide claims of attorney-client
privilege, and each of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
use its reasonable efforts to assist, and to cause the employees of such party
to assist, in the defense of such Third Party Claim.



Section 7.5 Characterization of Indemnification Payments. Unless otherwise
required by applicable Law, all indemnification payments made by Seller or the
Purchaser Parties under this Article VII shall be treated for all Tax purposes
as adjustments to the Purchase Price.



Section 7.6 Certain Indemnification Matters.

(a) The Purchaser Parties and Seller agree that Losses hereunder shall be
limited to actual monetary damages only and shall not include punitive,
incidental, consequential, special, indirect or treble damages or damages
based on loss of future revenue, profits or income, loss of business
reputation or opportunity, diminution of value or on any type of multiple
(other than any damages actually paid to a claimant in respect of a Third
Party Claim).

(b) Any liability for indemnification under this Agreement shall be determined
without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to
such liability constituting a breach of more than one representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement.

(c) The amount of any Losses sustained by an Indemnified Party shall be
reduced (i) by any amount received by such Indemnified Party or its Affiliates
with respect thereto under any insurance coverage relating thereto (other than
insurance coverage provided by an Affiliate of such Indemnified Party), (ii)
by any amount received by such Indemnified Party or its Affiliates with
respect thereto from any non-Affiliated Person alleged to be responsible for
any Losses or (iii) by the amount of any Tax benefit realized by such
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates with respect to such Loss. The Indemnified
Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect any amounts
recoverable from non-Affiliated Persons (other than under third party
insurance policies) relating to Losses sustained by such Indemnified Party;
provided that any failure of such Indemnified Parties to use such commercially
reasonable efforts shall not relieve any Indemnifying Party from any
obligation under this Article VII, including any obligation to make any
payment to an Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates
receive any amounts under applicable third party insurance policies, or from
any non-Affiliated Person alleged to be responsible for any Losses, or realize
any Tax benefit, in each case in

* * *





connection with a matter giving rise to an indemnification payment, but
subsequent to such indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then
such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any
indemnification payment made by such Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified
Party with respect to the applicable Loss up to the amount actually received
or realized (net of deductibles, co-payments or other costs actually and
reasonably incurred by the Indemnified Party (including increased premiums on
such third party insurance policies to the extent attributable to the payment
of such claims)) by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates under such third
party insurance policies, from such non-Affiliated Person or in respect of
such Tax benefit.

(d) No Losses may be claimed hereunder by an Indemnified Party to the extent
that such Losses have been reflected or taken into account in the preparation
of the Closing Net Worth Statement or the adjustment to the Closing Purchase
Price, if any, pursuant to Section 2.3.

(e) Except with respect to Taxes, in the event of payment by or on behalf of
any Indemnifying Party to any Indemnified Party pursuant to a claim or demand
in a Claim Notice, such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to and shall
stand in the place of such Indemnified Party as to any events or circumstances
in respect of which such Indemnified Party may have any right, defense or
claim relating to such claim or demand against any claimant or plaintiff
asserting such claim or demand. Such Indemnified Party shall cooperate with
such Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and at the cost of such
Indemnifying Party, in presenting any subrogated right, defense or claim.

(f) In the event any Action for indemnification under this Article VII has
been finally determined, the amount of such final determination shall be paid
if the Indemnified Party is a (i) Seller Indemnified Party, by the Purchaser
Parties and the Acquired Companies to the Seller Indemnified Party, and (ii)
Purchaser Indemnified Party, by Seller to the Purchaser Indemnified Party, in
each case upon demand by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to an
account or accounts designated by the Indemnified Party in writing. An Action,
and the liability for and amount of damages therefor, shall be deemed to be
"finally determined" for purposes of this Article VII when the parties hereto
have so determined by mutual agreement or, if disputed, when a final and non-
appealable Governmental Order has been entered with respect to such Action.



Section 7.7 Exclusive Remedy. Subject to the next sentence and except for
claims for specific performance under Section 9.15, the indemnification
provisions in this Article VII shall be, in the absence of fraud, the sole and
exclusive remedy for any breach of any representation or warranty or any
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement. The provisions of this
Article VII shall not be applicable to Section 2.3 or 5.18 of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no breach of any
representation or warranty or any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement shall give rise to any right on the part of either party hereto to
rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. This
Article VII shall become effective immediately following the Closing.



ARTICLE VIII



Termination



Section 8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated, and the
transactions contemplated hereby abandoned, at any time prior to the Closing:

(a) by written agreement of the Purchaser Parties and Seller;

(b) by the Purchaser Parties, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand,
by giving written notice of such termination to the other, if the Closing
shall not have occurred on or prior to June 30, 2012, unless the failure of
the Closing to occur results from the failure of the party or parties hereto
seeking to terminate this Agreement to materially perform any of its or their
obligations under this Agreement required to be performed at or prior to the
Closing; provided that in the event that the parties hereto mutually determine
that the Acquisition will not be eligible for exemption from premerger
notification reporting requirements under the HSR Act pursuant to Section
7A(c)(1) of the

* * *





Clayton Act as contemplated by Section 5.14 and all other conditions to
Closing set forth in Article VI shall have otherwise been satisfied (other
than conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing), such
date shall automatically be extended to September 30, 2012;

(c) by the Purchaser Parties, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand,
by giving written notice of such termination to the other, if a Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted, enforced or entered
any Law or a final and non-appealable Governmental Order shall be in effect
that prohibits the consummation of the Closing; provided, however, that the
party or parties hereto seeking to terminate this Agreement shall have used
reasonable best efforts to have any such Law declared invalid or inapplicable
or Governmental Order vacated; or

(d) by the Purchaser Parties, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand,
by giving written notice of such termination to the other, if there shall have
been a breach by the other party or parties hereto of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach, either individually or in the aggregate, would result
in, if occurring or continuing as of the Closing, the failure of a condition
set forth in Section 6.2(a) or (b) (if the Purchaser Parties are seeking to
terminate) or Section 6.3(a) or (b) (if Seller is seeking to terminate), as
the case may be, and which breach has not been cured within thirty-five (35)
days following written notice thereof to the other party or parties hereto or,
by its nature, cannot be cured within such time period.



Section 8.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Section 8.1, this Agreement shall thereafter become void and
have no effect, and no party hereto shall have any liability to the other
parties hereto or such other parties\' Affiliates, directors, officers,
shareholders, partners, agents or employees in connection with this Agreement,
except that (a) the obligations contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and
in this Section 8.2 and in Article IX shall survive and (b) termination will
not relieve the Purchaser Parties or any of their respective Affiliates from
liability for any breach of Section 4.8, 5.16 or 5.17 or relieve any party
hereto from liability for any willful and material breach of this Agreement or
fraud prior to such termination.

by the parties hereto, or in the case of a waiver, by the party hereto against
whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any party hereto in

privilege.



Section 9.3 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under it may be directly or indirectly assigned,
delegated, sublicensed or transferred by any of the parties hereto, in whole

operation of law or otherwise, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, without
the prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempted or purported
assignment in violation of this Section 9.3 will be null and void. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.



Section 9.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto and thereto with

From and after the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect except to the extent otherwise provided in Section 5.1(b).



Section 9.5 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing expressed or implied in this
Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or
liabilities upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.



Section 9.6 Public Disclosure. The parties hereto shall agree on the form and
content of any initial press release and, except with the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), shall not issue any other press release or
other public statement or communication with respect to this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby;
provided that the parties hereto may, without the prior written consent of the
other party hereto, issue such communication or make such public statement (a)
as may be required by applicable Law, stock exchange rules or Governmental
Authority and, if practicable under the circumstances, after reasonable prior
consultation with the other parties hereto, or (b) to enforce its rights under
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.



Section 9.7 No Other Representations and Warranties; Reserves.

(a) Except for the representations and warranties contained in Article III,
none of Seller or its Affiliates, nor any of their respective directors,

Acquired Companies, including as to the accuracy or completeness of any of
information (including any projections, estimates or other forward-looking
information) provided (including set forth in the Electronic Data Room, or
provided in any management presentations, information memoranda,

* * *





supplemental information or other materials) or otherwise made available by or
on behalf of Seller or as to the probable success or profitability of the
Acquired Companies. Seller expressly disclaims any and all other
representations and warranties, whether express or implied.

(b) Except for the representations and warranties contained in Article IV,
none of the Purchaser Parties nor any of their respective Affiliates, nor any
of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives,
makes or has made any other representation or warranty on behalf of the
Purchaser Parties. The Purchaser Parties expressly disclaim any and all other
representations and warranties, whether express or implied.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements, the Purchaser Parties acknowledge and agree that neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates makes any representation or warranty (express
or implied), and nothing contained in this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement
or any other agreement, document or instrument to be delivered in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby is intended or shall be
construed to be a representation or warranty (express or implied) of Seller or
any of its Affiliates: (i) with respect to the adequacy or sufficiency of the
reserves of the Company; (ii) with respect to the effect of the adequacy or
sufficiency of the reserves of the Company on any "line item" or asset,
liability or equity amount; or (iii) that the reserves of the Company have
been or will be adequate or sufficient for the purposes for which they were
established.



Section 9.8 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement
or in any Ancillary Agreement, whether or not the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are consummated, all direct and indirect costs and expenses
(including any legal and other advisory fees) incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby shall be borne by the party hereto incurring such expenses;
provided, however, except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, Seller
shall bear all out-of-pocket expenses of the Acquired Companies in connection
with the negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements (and, in the case of this Agreement, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby to be completed prior to the Closing) that
are not accrued as a liability on the Estimated Closing Net Worth Statement.



Section 9.9 Disclosure Schedules. Disclosures on the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule or the Seller Disclosure Schedule (each, a "Disclosure Schedule")
shall be arranged in sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered
sections of this Agreement, and any disclosure set forth on any section of a
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed by the party hereto
delivering such Disclosure Schedule only for the section of this Agreement
corresponding to the section of the Disclosure Schedule and all other sections
of this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that such
disclosure is applicable to such other sections of this Agreement. The
headings contained in a Disclosure Schedule are for convenience of reference
only and shall not be deemed to modify or influence the interpretation of the
information contained in such Disclosure Schedule or this Agreement. The
inclusion of any information in any section of a Disclosure Schedule shall not
be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment by the party hereto delivering
such Disclosure Schedule or otherwise imply that such information is required
to be listed in any section of such Disclosure Schedule or that any such
matter rises to a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect or Company Material
Adverse Effect, as applicable, or is material to or outside the Ordinary
Course of Business. Matters reflected in a Disclosure Schedule are not
necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in
such Disclosure Schedule. Such additional matters are set forth for
informational purposes and do not necessarily include other matters of a
similar nature. All references in a Disclosure Schedule to the enforceability
of agreements with third parties, the existence or non-existence of third-
party rights, the absence of breaches or defaults by third parties, or similar
matters or statements, are intended only to allocate rights and risks between
the Purchaser Parties, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, and
were not intended to be admissions against interests, give rise to any
inference or proof of accuracy, be admissible against any party to this

* * *





Agreement by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement, or give rise to
any claim or benefit to any Person who is not a party to this Agreement. The
disclosure in a Disclosure Schedule of any allegation, threat, notice or other
communication shall not be deemed to include disclosure of the truth of the
matter communicated. In addition, the disclosure of any matter in a Disclosure
Schedule is not to be deemed an admission that such matter actually
constitutes noncompliance with, or a violation of applicable Law, any
Governmental Order or Governmental Authorization or Contract or other topic to
which such disclosure is applicable. In no event shall the disclosure of
matters disclosed in a Disclosure Schedule be deemed or interpreted to
constitute or broaden a representation, warranty, obligation, covenant,
condition or agreement of the party hereto delivering such Disclosure Schedule
except to the extent provided in this Agreement. No reference in a Disclosure
Schedule shall by itself be construed as an admission or indication that a
Contract or other document is enforceable or in effect as of the date hereof
except to the extent provided in this Agreement. Where a Contract or other
document is referenced, summarized or described in a Disclosure Schedule, such
reference, summary or description does not purport to be a complete statement
of the terms or conditions of such Contract or other document and such
reference, summary or description is qualified in its entirety by the specific
terms and conditions of such Contract or other document.



Section 9.10 Governing Law. This Agreement and its enforcement will be
governed by, and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within
such state without regard to the conflicts of law provisions thereof.



Section 9.11 Submission to Jurisdiction. Subject to Sections 2.3 and 5.18,
each party to this Agreement hereby submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction
of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any appellate courts therefrom
(the "Delaware Courts"), for any dispute arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the breach, termination or validity thereof, including in the
case of disputes subject to Section 2.3 or 5.18, for an action to compel
arbitration before the Independent Accountant as contemplated by Section 2.3
or 5.18, for provisional relief to prevent irreparable harm prior to the
appointment of the Independent Accountant as contemplated by Section 2.3 or to
enforce an arbitral award rendered thereunder. Each party to this Agreement
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the
venue of any such proceedings brought in such court. Each of the parties
hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim
in any such court (a) that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of
the Delaware Courts for any reason other than the failure to serve process in
accordance with applicable Law, (b) that it or its property is exempt or
immune from jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts or from any legal process
commenced in the Delaware Courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in the Delaware
Courts is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit,
action or proceeding is improper and (iii) this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by the Delaware Courts.



Section 9.12 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY FOR ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE BREACH, TERMINATION OR VALIDITY THEREOF OR ANY TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NONE
OF THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO NOR ITS REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS OR ATTORNEYS HAVE
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN

* * *





THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY
HERETO UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C)
EACH PARTY HERETO MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) EACH PARTY HERETO HAS
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS OF THIS SECTION 9.12. ANY PARTY HERETO MAY FILE AN
ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN
EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY.



Section 9.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed to constitute an original, but all
of which shall constitute one and the same agreement, and may be delivered by
facsimile or other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic
or pictorial appearance of a document.



Section 9.14 Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is found by a court or other Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement
and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall
not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such
invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such
provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction. If any
provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision
shall be interpreted to be only so broad as would be enforceable.



Section 9.15 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
harm would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms on a timely basis or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that, without posting bond or other
undertaking, the parties hereto shall be entitled to injunctive or other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of
competent jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity. In the event that any such action is
brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no party hereto
will allege, and each party hereto hereby waives the defense or counterclaim,
that there is an adequate remedy at law. The parties hereto further agree that
(a) by seeking any remedy provided for in this Section 9.15, a party hereto
shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that
may be available to such party hereto under this Agreement and (b) nothing
contained in this Section 9.15 shall require any party hereto to institute any
action for (or limit such party\'s right to institute any action for) specific
performance under this Section 9.15 before exercising any other right under
this Agreement.



Section 9.16 Authority of GPFT Holdco. Any notice or other communication to
Seller under or in respect of this Agreement on behalf of one or more of the
Purchaser Parties shall be delivered solely by GPFT Holdco, and Seller shall
be entitled to rely on the authority of GPFT Holdco in delivering such notice
or making such communication to act on behalf of and bind the Purchaser
Parties.
