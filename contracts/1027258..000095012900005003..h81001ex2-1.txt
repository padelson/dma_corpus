                                       AND

         This Agreement and Plan of Merger ("Agreement") is entered into as of
October 16, 2000 between Southwest Bancorporation of Texas, Inc., a Texas

("Citizens").

                                    RECITALS

         A. The parties hereto desire to effect a business combination pursuant
to which (i) Citizens will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company
being the surviving corporation (the "Merger"), and (ii) the shareholders of
record, as of the date of the Merger, of the common stock, $100 par value, of

Stock are hereinafter referred to as the "Shareholders") will receive shares of
Common Stock, $1.00 par value, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, all for the purpose
of effecting a tax-free reorganization pursuant to Section 368(a)(1) of the

shares of Company Common Stock and the assumption by the Company of
substantially all of the liabilities and obligations of the Partnership, to be
followed by the liquidation of the Partnership, the distribution of the Company
Common Stock to the general partner and limited partners of the Partnership in
accordance with their respective interests, and the dissolution of the
Partnership, all upon the terms and subject to the conditions therein set forth.

         E. The transactions contemplated hereby require certain shareholder and
regulatory approvals as described herein and shall be effected only after the
necessary approvals have been obtained. Certain capitalized terms not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in Section 8.15 hereof.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

         SECTION 1.1  THE MERGER.

         (a) Procedure for Merger. The Merger shall take place upon the terms
and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Texas Business Corporation Act (the "TBCA"),
pursuant to which, at the Effective Time:

                  (i) Citizens shall be merged with and into the Company by a
         statutory merger; the separate corporate existence of Citizens shall
         thereupon cease; and the Company shall continue as the surviving
         corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation");

                  (ii) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
         immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger
         and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, continue to
         be outstanding as one share of Company Common Stock;

                  (iii) each share of Citizens Common Stock issued and
         outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of
         the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
         cancelled and converted into the right to receive, upon surrender of
         the certificate representing such share, the number of shares of
         Company Common Stock equal to the Adjusted Company Shares divided by
         15,610.165. The "Adjusted Company Shares" shall be a number equal to
         (A) $126,550,000 divided by (B) the Company Measurement Price. The
         "Company Measurement Price" is defined as the average of the closing
         prices of a share of Company Common Stock as reported by Nasdaq during
         the period of 15 trading days ending on the day that is five business
         days preceding the Closing Date (the "Determination Period"), provided,
         however, that (i) if the Company Measurement Price is equal to or
         greater than $32.50, it shall be deemed to be equal to $32.50 (the
         "Maximum Company Measurement Price"), and (ii) if the Company
         Measurement Price is equal to or less than $30.2326, it shall be deemed
         to be equal to $30.2326 (the "Minimum Company Measurement Price").

<PAGE>   8

                  (iv) the Articles of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the
         Company shall be unchanged and shall be the Articles of Incorporation
         and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation;

                  (v) the authorized capital stock of the Surviving Corporation
         shall be unchanged, consisting of 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock,
         $.01 par value, and 75,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, $1.00
         par value;

                  (vi) the directors of the Company at the Effective Time shall
         be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and the officers of the
         Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
         Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are duly
         elected and qualified;

                  (vii) the corporate existence of each of Citizens and the
         Company shall be merged into and continued in the Surviving
         Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall be deemed to be the
         same corporation as Citizens and the Company; all rights, title and
         interests to all real estate and other property owned by Citizens and
         the Company shall be vested in the Surviving Corporation without
         reversion or impairment, without further act or deed, and without any
         transfer or assignment having occurred, but subject to any existing
         liens and other encumbrances thereon; and

                  (viii) the Merger shall have the other effects set forth in
         Article 5.06 of the TBCA, including, without limitation, that the
         Surviving Corporation shall be liable for all liabilities of Citizens
         and the Company.

         SECTION 1.2  CONVERSION OF CITIZENS COMMON STOCK.

         (a) Outstanding Citizens Common Stock. At the Effective Time, each
share of Citizens Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares, as defined in Section 8.15) shall,
by virtue of this Agreement and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted into and exchangeable for the number of shares of Company
Common Stock equal to the Adjusted Company Shares divided by 15,610.165 (the
"Exchange Ratio"). All of the shares of Citizens Common Stock converted into
Company Common Stock pursuant to this Section 1.2(a) shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each certificate (each a "Certificate") previously representing any such shares
of Citizens Common Stock shall thereafter represent the right to receive (i) the
number of whole shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) cash in lieu of
fractional shares into which the shares of Citizens Common Stock represented by
such Certificate have been converted pursuant to this Section 1.2(a) and Section
1.3(e) hereof. Certificates previously representing shares of Citizens Common
Stock shall be exchanged for certificates representing whole shares of Company
Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration
therefor upon the surrender of such Certificates in accordance with Section 1.3
hereof, without any interest thereon. If, between the date hereof and the
Effective Time of the Merger, shares of Company Common Stock shall be changed
into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of
any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of
shares or readjustment, or if a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a
record date within such period

                                      -3-
<PAGE>   9

(a "Common Stock Adjustment"), then (i) the Minimum Company Measurement Price,
the Maximum Company Measurement Price and the Exchange Ratio will be
appropriately and proportionately adjusted so that the number of such shares of
Company Common Stock into which a share of Citizens Common Stock shall be
converted will equal the number of shares of Company Common Stock which holders
of shares of Citizens Common Stock would have received pursuant to such Common
Stock Adjustment had the record date therefor been immediately following the
Effective Time of the Merger, and (ii) the Termination Price will likewise be
appropriately and proportionately adjusted.

         (b) Treasury Stock. At the Effective Time, all shares of Citizens
Common Stock that are held in Citizens' treasury or otherwise owned by Citizens
as treasury stock shall be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no stock of
the Company or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

         (c) Dissenters. Each Shareholder who is entitled to dissenters' rights
pursuant to the TBCA on the date of the Shareholders Meeting, and who continues
to be so entitled as of the Effective Time is referred to herein as a
"Dissenter." Each Dissenting Share shall be converted into the rights provided
by the TBCA.

         SECTION 1.3  SURRENDER OF CITIZENS STOCK CERTIFICATES.

         (a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Computershare
Investor Services, as Exchange Agent (the "Exchange Agent"), shall mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates a form letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the shares of Company
Common Stock and the cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares of
Citizens Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have
been converted pursuant to this Agreement. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor (x) a certificate representing that number of whole
shares of Company Common Stock to which such holder of Citizens Common Stock
shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.2 hereof and
(y) a check representing the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares, if
any, which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate
surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Section 1.3, and the Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on the cash in lieu of fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions,
if any, payable to holders of Certificates.

         (b) No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective
Time with respect to Company Common Stock and payable to the holders of record
thereof shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the
holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Section
1.3. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Section 1.3,
the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or
other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become
payable with respect to shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate.

                                      -4-
<PAGE>   10

         (c) If any certificate representing shares of Company Common Stock is
to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof
that the Certificate so surrendered shall be appropriately endorsed (or
accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper
form (reasonably satisfactory to the Company) for transfer, and that the person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer
or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate representing
shares of Company Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason, or
shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been
paid or is not payable.

         (d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Citizens shall
be closed, and no transfer of the shares of Citizens Common Stock shall
thereafter be recognized. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they
shall be canceled and exchanged for the certificates representing shares of
Company Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in
Section 1.2 hereof.

         (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Company Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or
distribution with respect to Company Common Stock shall be payable on or with
respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of the
Company. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, the Company shall
pay to each former holder of Citizens Common Stock who otherwise would be
entitled to receive a fractional share of Company Common Stock an amount in cash

receive pursuant to Section 1.2 hereof. The term "Average Closing Price" means
the average closing sales price per share of Company Common Stock on The Nasdaq

reported thereby, another authoritive source selected by the Company), for the
five consecutive Nasdaq trading days immediately prior to the date of the
Shareholders' Meeting.

         (f) None of the Company, Citizens, the Exchange Agent or any other
person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Citizens Common Stock
for any Company Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) or cash properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

         (g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Company, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as the Company may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Company Common Stock and cash in
lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.

covenants or encroaches on any property owned by others, nor does any building
or structure of third parties encroach upon any Citizens Real Property, except
for those violations and encroachments which in the aggregate could not

manner in which it is currently being used.

encumbrances, except (i) statutory liens for amounts not yet delinquent or which
are being contested in good faith through proper proceedings and (ii) those
liens related to real property taxes, local improvement district assessments,
easements, covenants, restrictions and other matters of record which do not
individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect the use and
enjoyment of the relevant real property.

         (e) All buildings and other facilities used in the business of Citizens
and its Subsidiaries are adequately maintained and are free from defects which
could materially interfere with the current or future use of such facilities.

         SECTION 3.11 PERSONAL PROPERTY. Citizens and its Subsidiaries have good
title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all personal property, whether
tangible or intangible, used in the conduct of their business (the "Citizens
Personalty"), free and clear of all liens, charges or other encumbrances, except
(a) statutory liens for amounts not yet delinquent or which are being contested
in good faith through proper proceedings and (b) such other liens, charges,
encumbrances and imperfections of title as do not individually or in the
aggregate materially adversely affect the use and enjoyment of the relevant
Citizens Personalty. Subject to ordinary wear and tear, the Citizens Personalty
is in good operating condition and repair and is adequate for the uses to which
it is being put.

         SECTION 4.12 ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES. To the Company's knowledge, SW
Bank's allowance for possible credit losses is adequate in relation to the
outstanding loans, leases and other extensions of credit of SW Bank and is in

practices and procedures of, the OCC, as such standards, practices and
procedures may be amended from time to time.

         SECTION 4.13 DISCLOSURE. Without limiting any of the representations
and warranties contained herein, no representation or warranty by the Company in

writing and no other information furnished or to be furnished by the Company to
Citizens or any of its representatives pursuant to the provisions hereof or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, contains or will contain
any untrue statement of material fact or omits or will omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements herein or therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

         SECTION 4.14 INSURANCE. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is
presently insured or self-insured, and during each of the past five calendar
years (or during such lesser period of time as the Company has owned its
Subsidiaries) has been insured or self-insured, for reasonable amounts with
financially sound and reputable insurance companies against such risks as
companies engaged in a similar business would, in accordance with good business
practice, customarily be insured and has maintained all insurance required by
applicable law and regulation.

         SECTION 4.15  COMPANY BENEFIT PLANS.

                  (i) For purposes of this Section 4.15, the term "Company Plan"
         means all employee benefit plans as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA,
         to which the Company contributes, sponsors, or otherwise has any
         obligations.

                  (ii) No Company Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the
         meaning of Section 3(37) or ERISA.

                                      -33-
<PAGE>   39

                  (iii) Each Company Plan is and has been in all material
         respects operated and administered in accordance with its provisions
         and applicable law, including, if applicable, ERISA and the Code.

                  (iv) Each Company Plan intended to be qualified under Section
         401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from
         the Internal Revenue Service stating that the Company Plan (including
         all amendments) is tax qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and
         the Company knows of no reason that any such Company Plan is not
         qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code and knows of
         no reason that each related Company Plan trust is not exempt from
         taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code.

                  (v) All contributions, premium payments and other payments
         required to be made in connection with the Company Plans as of the date
         of this Agreement have been made.

                  (vi) The Company has no Plan that is subject to Title IV of
         ERISA, Section 301 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.

         SECTION 4.16 NO DEFAULTS. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in default, nor has any event occurred which, with the passage
of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute a default under any
material agreement, indenture, loan agreement or other instrument to which it is
a party or by which it or any of its assets is bound or to which any of its
assets is subject, the result of which has had or could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect upon the Company. To the Company's knowledge,
all parties with whom the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has material
leases, agreements or contracts or who owe to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries material obligations other than with respect to those arising in
the ordinary course of the banking business of the Company's Subsidiaries are in
compliance therewith in all material respects.

         SECTION 4.17 COMMITMENTS AND CONTRACTS. Except for those contracts
which have been filed with the SEC and those listed in Schedule 4.17, as of
September 30, 2000 neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
subject to any of the following (whether written or oral, express or implied):

                  (i) any labor contract or agreement with any labor union;

                  (ii) any contract not made in the ordinary course of business
         containing covenants which materially limit the ability of the Company
         or any of its Subsidiaries to compete in any line of business or with
         any person or which involve any material restriction of the
         geographical area in which, or method by which, the Company or any of
         its Subsidiaries may carry on its business (other than as may be
         required by law or applicable regulatory authorities); or

                  (iii) any other contract or agreement which is a "material
         contract" within the meaning of Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K.

         SECTION 4.18 REGULATORY APPROVALS. The Company knows of no reason why
it would not be able to obtain the Regulatory Approvals in a timely manner.

                                      -34-
<PAGE>   40

         SECTION 4.19 LOANS. Except as disclosed on Schedule 4.19 and except for
those matters which, in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to cause
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, (i) each outstanding loan, lease or
other extension of credit or commitment to extend credit of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is a legal, valid and binding obligation, is in full force
and effect and is enforceable in accordance with its terms except as may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws
affecting the rights of creditors generally or equitable principles limiting the
right to obtain specific performance or other similar relief; (ii) the Company
and its Subsidiaries have duly performed all of their respective obligations
thereunder to the extent that such obligations to perform have accrued; (iii)
all documents and agreements necessary for the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enforce such loan, lease or other extension of credit are in
existence and in their possession; (iv) no claims, counterclaims, set-off rights
or other rights exist, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, do the grounds for
any such claim, counterclaim, set-off rights or other rights exist, with respect
to any such loans, leases or other extensions of credit which could impair the
collectability thereof; and (v) each such loan, lease and extension of credit
has been originated and served in accordance with the lender's then applicable
underwriting guidelines, the terms of the relevant credit documents and
agreements and Applicable Law; provided, however, that no representation or
warranty is made as to the sufficiency of the collateral securing or the
collectability of such loans.

         SECTION 4.20 INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS. All interest
rate swaps, caps, floors and option agreements and other interest rate risk
management arrangements to which the Company or one of its Subsidiaries is a
party or by which any of their properties or assets may be bound were entered
into in the ordinary course of business and, to the Company's knowledge, in
accordance with prudent banking practice and all applicable rules, regulations
and policies of applicable Governmental Authorities with counterparties believed
to be financially responsible at the time and are legal, valid and binding
obligations enforceable in accordance with their terms (except as may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting
the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies),
and are in full force and effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries have duly
performed in all material respects all of their obligations thereunder to the
extent that such obligations to perform have accrued; and to the Company's
knowledge, there are no breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or
assertions of such by any party thereunder.

contemplated by this Agreement, which meeting shall be held not earlier than 20
nor later than 30 days following the date upon which the notice of the
Shareholders' meeting is mailed to the Shareholders. In connection with the
Shareholders' Meeting, the Board of Directors of Citizens shall recommend
approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, indicate the
determination by the Board of Directors that the Merger is in the best interests
of Citizens' shareholders and use its best efforts (including, without
limitation, soliciting proxies for such approvals) to obtain such shareholder
approval, subject to its fiduciary duties. Notice of the Shareholders' Meeting
shall be accompanied by the Offering Memorandum/Proxy Statement.

         (b) In obtaining the approval of shareholders referred to in this
Section 5.8, Citizens will comply, and will use its best efforts to cause its
officers, directors and 5% shareholders to comply, with applicable provisions of
and the rules and regulations under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and any

addresses of any other person (within the meaning of such Rule) which the
Company identifies (by written notice to Citizens within three business days
after receipt of such list) as possibly being a person who may be deemed to be
an "Affiliate" of Citizens within the meaning of Rule 144. Citizens shall use
its best efforts to deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Company, not later

         SECTION 5.11  PLAN AMENDMENTS AND PARTICIPATION IN COMPANY PLANS.

         Citizens shall execute and deliver such instruments and take such other
actions as the Company may reasonably require in order to cause the amendment or
termination of any Plan on terms satisfactory to the Company and in accordance
with Applicable Law and effective as of the Effective Time. The Company agrees
that the employees of Citizens and its Subsidiaries who continue their
employment after the Effective Time (the "Citizens Employees") will be entitled
to participate as newly hired employees in the employee benefit plans and
programs (including any severance plan) maintained for employees of the Company
and SW Bank, in accordance with the respective terms of such plans and programs,
and the Company shall take all actions necessary or appropriate to facilitate
coverage of the Citizens Employees in such plans and programs from and after the
Effective Time, subject to the following:

                  (i) Each Citizens Employee will be entitled to credit for
         prior service with Citizens and its Subsidiaries for all purposes under
         the employee welfare benefit plans and other employee benefit plans and
         programs (other than stock option plans), sponsored by the Company and
         SW Bank to the extent Citizens and its Subsidiaries sponsored a similar
         type of plan in which the Citizens Employees participated immediately
         prior to the Effective Time. Any pre-existing condition exclusion
         applicable to such plans and programs shall be waived with respect to
         each Citizens Employee. For purposes of determining Citizens Employee's
         benefit for the calendar year in which the Merger occurs under the
         Company's vacation program, any vacation taken by the Citizens Employee
         immediately preceding the Effective Time for the calendar year in which
         the Merger occurs will be deducted from the total Company vacation
         benefit available to such Citizens Employee for such calendar year. The
         Company further agrees to credit each Citizens Employee for the year
         during which coverage under the Company's group health plan begins,
         with any deductibles already incurred during such year, under Citizens'
         group health plan.

                  (ii) Each Citizens Employee shall be entitled to credit for
         past service with Citizens and its Subsidiaries for the purpose of
         satisfying any eligibility or vesting periods applicable to the Company
         employee benefit plans which are subject to Sections 401(a) and 501(a)
         of the Code (including, without limitation, the Company's 401(k)
         Savings Plan).

                  (iii) Employees of Citizens and its Subsidiaries who are
         terminated as of or within six months after the Effective Time because
         their jobs are eliminated due to merger related consolidations will be
         entitled to treatment under the Severance Benefits Summary attached
         hereto as Schedule 5.11 and will be entitled to credit for prior
         service with Citizens and its Subsidiaries as described therein.

         SECTION 5.12 TERMINATION OF SEVERANCE AND CONSULTING ARRANGEMENTS. On
or prior to the Closing Date, subject to Applicable Law, Citizens shall use its
best efforts to terminate those arrangements other than the Employee Agreements
(pursuant to reasonable severance arrangements and subject to any vested rights)
as the Company shall notify Citizens in writing pursuant to which Citizens or
any of its Subsidiaries is or may be obligated to make payments after the
Closing Date to any Person pursuant to any employment, consulting, severance,
employment termination or other

                                      -42-
<PAGE>   48

similar agreement with any current or former officer, director, employee or
agent of Citizens or any of its Subsidiaries.

         SECTION 5.13  CERTAIN NOTIFICATIONS.

         (a) Each party to this Agreement shall notify the other party promptly
both orally and in writing (i) after becoming aware of any misrepresentation or
breach of warranty on its part under this Agreement, (ii) after becoming aware
of the occurrence of, or the impending or threatened occurrence of, any event
that would constitute a breach on its part of any obligation under this
Agreement or the occurrence of any event that would cause any representation or
warranty made by it herein to be false or misleading in any material respect if
such representation and warranty were restated at such time, or (ii) upon the
occurrence of, or the discovery of, any event that could reasonably be expected
to cause it to be unable to satisfy a condition to any other party's obligation
to proceed with the Merger.

         (b) Each party to this Agreement shall notify the other party promptly
both orally and in writing if it becomes aware that there exists a basis for any
material suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding of any nature to be
brought against or by or on behalf of the notifying party, or any of its
properties.

         SECTION 5.14  NO SHOPPING.

         (a) Citizens shall not, directly or indirectly, through any officer,
director, employee or agent or otherwise, solicit, initiate or encourage any
Acquisition Proposal, or, except as otherwise required in the opinion of
Bracewell & Patterson, L.L.P. or such other nationally recognized, independent
counsel in order for its Board of Directors to fulfill its fiduciary duties,
participate in any negotiation in respect of or cooperate with (including,
without limitation, by way of furnishing any nonpublic information concerning
the business, properties or assets of Citizens or its Subsidiaries or any access
to such properties or assets) any Acquisition Proposal. Citizens shall notify
the Company promptly by telephone, and thereafter promptly confirm such
notification in writing, if any such information is requested from, or any
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry with respect to any Acquisition Proposal is
received by, Citizens and shall provide the Company with a reasonably detailed
description of the contents thereof, including without limitation, the identity
of the other persons or entities involved.

         (b) Unless and until Citizens shall have exercised its right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(e) hereof (or shall exercise
such right simultaneously with any of the following), no Acquisition Proposal
shall be accepted, approved, adopted or recommended by the Board of Directors of
Citizens, or presented by Citizens, or by its Board of Directors or management,
to the shareholders of Citizens for vote or approval by written consent, the
Board of Directors of Citizens shall not rescind the approval of this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and no such meeting of
shareholders shall be called by Citizens or noticed for purposes of taking
shareholder action with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

                                      -43-
<PAGE>   49

         (c) Unless and until Citizens shall have exercised its right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(e) hereof, or except as
otherwise required by any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction with
respect to a party, Citizens shall not prepare or assist in the preparation of
or file or assist in the filing of any notice or application to any Governmental
Authority pertaining to or seeking approval of any change in control incident to
or which would result from any Acquisition Proposal.

         SECTION 5.15 NO INCONSISTENT ACTIONS; POOLING; TAX TREATMENT. None of
the parties hereto will voluntarily take or omit to take any action, the effect
of the taking or omission of which would reasonably be expected to cause any of
its representations and warranties herein to be inaccurate in any material
respect at the Closing or at any time prior to the Closing as if such
representation and warranty were restated at such time. Each party hereto shall
use its best efforts to cause the Merger to be treated for financial accounting
purposes as a "pooling of interests," and shall not take, and shall use its best
efforts to prevent any Affiliate of such party from taking, any actions which
could prevent the Merger from being treated as such for financial accounting
purposes. Each party hereto shall use its best efforts to cause the Merger and
the Bank Merger to qualify, and shall not take, and shall use its best efforts
to prevent any Affiliate of such party from taking, any actions which could
prevent the Merger or the Bank Merger from qualifying, as a reorganization under
the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code.

         SECTION 5.16 TAXES; CONSENT. Citizens shall prepare and timely file all
Returns and amendments thereto required to be filed by Citizens and its
Subsidiaries on or before the Closing Date. The Company shall have a reasonable
opportunity to review all Returns and amendments thereto prior to filing.
Citizens shall pay and discharge all Taxes, assessments and governmental charges
upon or against it or any of its properties or assets, and all liabilities at
any time existing, before the same shall become delinquent and before penalties
accrue thereon, except to the extent and as long as: (a) the same are being
contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings pursued diligently and in
such a manner as not to cause any Material Adverse Effect on Citizens; and (b)
Citizens shall have set aside on its books reserves (segregated to the extent
required by sound accounting practice) in the amount of the demanded principal
imposition (together with interest and penalties relating thereto, if any).

         SECTION 5.17 TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES AND INSIDERS. From the date
hereof until the Effective Time, Citizens shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Company, make, or allow any of its Subsidiaries (other than Bay
City) to make, any loan (other than renewals, extensions and consolidations of
loans) or establish any relationship, of the type or engage or propose to engage
in any transaction of the type that would be required to be disclosed on
Schedule 3.19 had such loan been made, relationship been established or
transaction been entered into or proposed as of the date hereof. To the extent
Citizens can prevent Bay City from taking any of the foregoing actions through
its current oversight authority over Bay City, Citizens will not allow Bay City
to take any such actions prior to the Effective Time.

         SECTION 5.18 CLASSIFICATION OF LOANS. During the period from the
execution of this Agreement until the Effective Time, Citizens and the Company
(i) to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, shall each promptly inform the
other of the amounts and categories of any of its loans, leases or other
extensions of credit that are classified by any Governmental Authority or by

                                      -44-
<PAGE>   50

any of its Subsidiaries as "Other Assets Especially Mentioned," "Substandard,"
"Doubtful," "Loss" or any comparable classification; (ii) shall classify all
assets in accordance with Regulatory Standards and its own current internal
classification system; and (iii) shall apply the standards regarding accrual of
interest set forth in the then most recent Call Report Instructions of the
Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council.

         SECTION 5.19 COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW. During the period from the
date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, Citizens shall take any and all
actions reasonably requested by the Company in order to conform the conduct of
the business of Citizens and its Subsidiaries, including, without limitation,
the business of originating, acquiring, holding or disposing of assets and
liabilities, with the requirements of any Applicable Law.

         SECTION 5.20 CERTAIN ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS. After the approval of the
Shareholders and all of the Regulatory Approvals have been obtained, Citizens
shall, if requested by the Company, make such accounting entries prior to the
Effective Time as the Company may reasonably request in order to conform the
accounting records of Citizens to the accounting policies and practices of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, subject to compliance with generally accepted
accounting principles and all appropriate regulatory requirements, such
adjustments to be effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. No such
adjustment shall of itself constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation or
failure to satisfy any representation, warranty, covenant, condition or other
provision or constitute grounds for termination of this Agreement or be an
acknowledgment by Citizens (i) of any adverse circumstances for purposes of
determining whether the conditions to the Company's obligations under this
Agreement have been satisfied, or (ii) that such adjustment is required for
purposes of determining satisfaction of the condition to the Company's
obligations under this Agreement set forth in Section 6.2(a) hereof or (iii)
that such adjustment has any bearing on the number of shares of Company Common
Stock issuable hereunder. No adjustment shall (i) require any prior filing with
any governmental agency or regulatory authority or (ii) violate any law, rule or
regulation applicable to Citizens.

         SECTION 5.21  ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTIGATION; RIGHT TO TERMINATE
                       AGREEMENT.

         (a) The Company and its designated consultants, agents and
representatives shall have the right to the same extent that Citizens has such
right, but not the obligation or responsibility, at the Company's expense, to
inspect any Citizens Real Property or Real Estate Owned, including, without
limitation, conducting asbestos surveys and sampling, environmental assessments
and investigation, and other environmental surveys and analyses including soil
and ground sampling ("Environmental Inspections") at any time on or prior to
November 15, 2000. The Company shall notify Citizens prior to any physical
inspections of any such properties, and Citizens may place reasonable
restrictions on the time of such inspections. (If, as a result of any such
Environmental Inspection, further investigation ("secondary investigation")
including, without limitation, test borings, soil, water and other sampling is
deemed desirable by the Company, the Company shall (i) notify Citizens of any
property for which it intends to conduct such a secondary investigation and the
reasons for such secondary investigation, and (ii) commence such secondary
investigation, on or prior to December 15, 2000. All secondary investigations
must be approved in advance by Citizens. The Company shall give reasonable
notice to Citizens of such secondary investigations, and Citizens may place
reasonable time and place restrictions on such secondary investigations.

                                      -45-
<PAGE>   51

         (b) Citizens agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company for any
claims for damage to property, or injury or death to persons, made as a result
of any Environmental Inspection or secondary investigation conducted by the
Company or its agents, which damage or injury is attributable solely to the
negligent actions or negligent omissions of Citizens or its agents. The Company
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Citizens for any claims for damage to
property, or injury or death to persons, attributable solely to the negligent
actions or omissions of the Company or its agents in performing any
Environmental Inspection or secondary investigation. In addition, the Company
shall, after any physical testing, restore such tested property to its original
condition at the Company's sole cost and expense. The Company shall not have any
liability or responsibility of any nature whatsoever for the results,
conclusions or other findings related to any Environmental Inspection, secondary
investigation or other environmental survey. If this Agreement is terminated,
then except as otherwise required by law, reports to any governmental authority
of the results of any Environmental Inspection, secondary investigation or other
environmental survey shall be made by Citizens and not by the Company. The
Company shall make no such report prior to the Closing unless required to do so
by law, and in such case will give Citizens reasonable notice of the Company's
intentions.

         (c) The Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement if (i)
Citizens has refused to allow the Company to conduct an Environmental Inspection
or secondary investigation in a manner that the Company reasonably considers
necessary; or (ii) the Environmental Inspection, secondary investigation or
other environmental survey identifies any past or present events, conditions or
circumstances (including but not limited to the presence of any
asbestos-containing material or underground storage tank) that would require
remedial or cleanup action at the expense of Citizens or any of its Subsidiaries
in an aggregate estimated cost which is in excess of $500,000 on an after-tax
basis. On or prior to December 30, 2000, the Company shall advise Citizens in
writing if the Company intends to terminate this Agreement because the Company
disapproves of the results of the Environmental Inspection, secondary
investigation or other environmental survey. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
the Company elects to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (ii) of the
first sentence of this Section 5.21(c), Citizens may elect, within three
business days of its receipt of such notice of termination, to reduce the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock to be received by the shareholders of
Citizens pursuant to the Merger by the quotient of the excess of the Company's
estimated remedial or clean up cost over $500,000 on an after-tax basis divided
by the Company Measurement Price, and proceed with the Merger (without obtaining
any additional approval from the shareholders of Citizens if they have already
approved the Merger). In such event, the Company and Citizens shall execute an
amendment to this Agreement to reflect the appropriate reduction in the Exchange
Ratio.

         (d) Citizens agrees to make available to the Company and its
consultants, agents and representatives all documents and other material
relating to environmental conditions of any Citizens Real Property and Real
Estate Owned including, without limitation, the results of other environmental
inspections and survey. Citizens also agrees that all engineers and consultants
who prepared or furnished such reports may discuss such reports and information
with the Company and shall be entitled to certify the same in favor of the
Company and its consultants, agents and representatives and make all other data
available to the Company and its consultants, agents and representatives.

         SECTION 5.22 INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS; INSURANCE. (a)
The indemnification provisions contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the Company, the Articles of Association and Bylaws of SW Bank and the
Articles of Association and Bylaws of Bay City shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years after the Effective Time in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at
any time prior to the Effective Time were directors or officers of Citizens or
any of its Subsidiaries in respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), unless such modification is required by
Applicable Law.

         (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Company shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the present and former directors, officers, employees
and agents of Citizens and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Indemnified
Parties") against all losses, expenses, claims, damages, liabilities or amounts
(including all amounts paid in settlement with the approval of the Company,
which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld) in connection with, any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (a "Claim"), based in whole or
in part on the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or
agent of Citizens or any of its Subsidiaries and arising out of actions or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including, without
limitation, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), in each case to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable law and whether or not asserted
before the Effective Time.

         (c) Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any Claim is brought
against any Indemnified Party (whether arising before or after the Effective
Time) after the Effective Time (i) the Indemnified Parties may retain Citizens'
regularly engaged independent legal counsel, or other independent legal counsel
satisfactory to them provided that such other counsel shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company, (ii) the Company shall pay all reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements
therefor are received and (iii) the Company will use its best efforts to assist
in the vigorous defense of any such matter, provided that the Company shall not
be liable for any settlement of any Claim effected without its written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any Indemnified Party wishing
to claim indemnification under this Section 5.22, upon learning of any such
Claim, shall notify the Company (although the failure so to notify the Company
shall not relieve the Company from any liability which the Company may have
under this Section 5.22 except to the extent such failure prejudices the Company
or SW Bank), and shall deliver to the Surviving Corporation an undertaking to
repay all expenses paid by the Company if such indemnification is not permitted
under Applicable Law. The Indemnified Parties as a group may retain one law firm
to represent them with respect to each such matter unless there is, under
applicable standards of professional conduct (as determined by counsel to the
Indemnified Parties), a conflict on any significant issue between the positions
of any two or more Indemnified Parties, in which event, such additional counsel
as may be required may be retained by the Indemnified Parties.

                                      -47-
<PAGE>   53

         (d) For a period of four years and six months after the Effective Time,
the Company shall cause to be maintained in effect a "tail" directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy with terms and conditions substantially
similar to Citizens' current insurance policy, but only covering claims arising
from facts or events which occurred before the Effective Time (including the
transactions which are the subject of this Agreement).

         (e) The provisions of this Section 5.22 shall survive the Effective
Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the
Indemnified Parties, their heirs and personal representatives and shall be
binding on the Company and the Surviving Corporation and their representative
successors and assigns.

         (f) If the Company or any of its successors or assigns (A) shall
consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger; or (B) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any individual, corporation, or other entity, then and in each such
case the Company shall make proper provision so that the successors and assigns
of the Company shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.22.

         SECTION 5.23 ACCESS TO INFORMATION OF THE COMPANY.

         (a) During the period from the date hereof until the Effective Time,
(i) the Company shall provide the information and access described in paragraphs
(b) and (c) below during normal business hours, upon reasonable written or oral
notice and in such manner as will not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of
the Company's or SW Bank's business and (ii) subject to compliance with Section
5.7, two representatives of Citizens shall be entitled to attend all meetings of
the Board of Directors of the Company and the Board of Directors of SW Bank
(except for those parts of such meetings where matters related to this Agreement
are discussed and where litigation regarding the Company is being discussed and
counsel for the Company has advised the Company that the presence of Citizens'
representatives may jeopardize the attorney-client privilege).

         (b) To the extent permitted by law and consistent with Section 5.23(a),
the Company shall authorize and permit Citizens and its representatives,
accountants and counsel to have full and complete access to all of the
properties, books, records, branch operating reports, branch audit reports,
customer accounts and records, any reports of Governmental Authorities and
responses thereto, operating instructions and procedures (and all correspondence
with Governmental Authorities), tax returns, tax settlement letters, financial
statements and other financial information (including the work papers of
PricewaterhouseCoopers used to audit the Company's balance sheets as of December
31, 1999 and 1998 and its statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity
and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997), contracts
and documents of the Company and SW Bank and all other information with respect
to the business affairs, financial condition, assets and Liabilities of the
Company and SW Bank as Citizens may from time to time reasonably request, to
make copies of such books, records and other documents and to discuss the
business affairs, condition (financial and otherwise), assets and Liabilities of
the Company and SW Bank with such third persons, including, without limitation,
the directors, officers, employees, agents, accountants (including
PricewaterhouseCoopers) and attorneys of the Company and SW Bank, as Citizens
considers reasonably necessary or appropriate for the purposes of familiarizing

                                      -48-
<PAGE>   54

itself with the business and operations of the Company and SW Bank, determining
any breach of the representations, warranties and covenants of the Company and
SW Bank set forth herein, obtaining any necessary orders, consents or approvals
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by Governmental Authorities
and conducting further evaluations of the assets and Liabilities of the Company
and SW Bank.

         (c) For purposes of Citizens' investigation pursuant to this Section
5.23, the Company shall use its best efforts to cause any service bureau,
accountant, third party servicer or other third party under contract to it to
furnish to Citizens and its authorized representatives, at Citizens' cost, full
access to such party's premises and all of its books, records and properties,
including, without limitation, all loan, investment, regulatory, financial,
accounting, tax and property records and files relating to the operations of the
Company and SW Bank including, without limitation, all files, computer records
and customer information, relating to assets serviced by third parties. The
Company shall use its best efforts to cause any service bureau, accountant,
third party servicer or other third party to provide adequate space and
facilities and the cooperation of its personnel at Citizens' cost, including,
without limitation, copying facilities, to the end that such examination shall
be completed expeditiously, completely and accurately. Without limiting any of
the foregoing, Citizens and its authorized representatives shall be specifically
entitled to conduct at Citizens' own expense (and the Company and SW Bank shall
use their best efforts to enable them to conduct) such tests of accounts
receivable and other matters as they deem appropriate. Any examination or
investigation made by Citizens or other Persons as contemplated by this Section
shall not affect any of the representations and warranties hereunder.

         SECTION 5.24 EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS. The Company shall use its best
efforts to enter into Employment Agreements with John H. Echols, Andrew C.
Echols, Hugh A. Echols, Conrad W. Magouirk, Sam T. Schultz, E. Reginald Brewer,
Michael Wilson and Mark Himsel substantially in the forms set forth in Exhibit D
hereto effective as of the Effective Time.

         SECTION 5.25 FURTHER ASSURANCES. Each party hereto shall execute and
deliver such instruments and take such other actions as the other party may
reasonably require in order to carry out the intent of this Agreement.

         SECTION 5.26 PREPARATION OF SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT. As soon as
practicable following the Closing Date (but no later than ten days following the
later of the Closing Date or the date on which the Company has received all
requisite information from substantially all of the Shareholders), the Company
will prepare and file with the SEC, at its expense (including, without
limitation, all NASD registration and filing fees, fees and expenses of
compliance with securities or blue sky laws, listing fees, printing expenses,
messenger and delivery expenses, all fees and disbursements of counsel,
independent certified public accountants, consultants, advisors and experts for
the Company, and all other expenses of the type ordinarily incurred to register
securities, but not including any underwriting discounts or commissions, or
expenses of Shareholders or underwriters), a continuous or "shelf" registration
statement on Form S-3 (the "Registration Statement") pursuant to Rule 415 under
the Securities Act for registration of the resale by the Shareholders of the
shares of Company Common Stock to be issued in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby. The parties hereby agree (i) to cooperate with each other
in preparing and filing such Registration Statement, and (ii) to use its best
efforts to cause such Registration Statement to be declared effective

                                      -49-
<PAGE>   55

by the SEC by the date on which the Company first publishes an earnings report
that reflects at least 30 days of combined operations of the Company and
Citizens (the "Expiration Date"), such earnings report being referred to herein
as the "Combined Report." The Company agrees to maintain the effectiveness of
the Registration Statement for a period of two years following the Closing Date.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, nothing shall be contained in
the Registration Statement or with respect to any party unless approved by such
party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Company shall
furnish without charge to each Shareholder such number of copies of the
prospectus (including each preliminary prospectus) included in the Registration
Statement, and such other documents as the Shareholder may reasonable request in
order to facilitate the disposition of shares of Company Common Stock by each
Shareholder, including, without limitation, all documents incorporated by
reference in the Registration Statement. The Company shall also promptly notify
each Shareholder, after becoming aware thereof, of the issuance by the SEC of
any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the
happening of any event which makes the Registration Statement or any
post-effective amendment thereto, related prospectus or any amendment or
supplement thereto, or any document incorporated therein by reference, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading. The
Company shall use its best efforts to register or qualify such shares under the
securities or blue sky laws of such states and the District of Columbia as the
Shareholders may reasonably request to enable them to dispose in such states and
the District of Columbia of the shares owned by them; and otherwise use its best
efforts to comply with all Applicable Laws to enable the Shareholders to
consummate the disposition of the shares owned by them.

         The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC all such amendments and
supplements to the Registration Statement and each prospectus used in connection
therewith as may be necessary to keep the Registration Statement effective for
the two-year period specified above in this Section 5.26 and as may be necessary
to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the
disposition of all shares of Company Common Stock covered by the Registration
Statement in accordance with the intended method of disposition (which shall
include underwritten offerings) set forth in the Registration Statement.

         SECTION 5.27 SHAREHOLDERS' AGREEMENTS AS TO REGISTRATION STATEMENT.
Citizens understands that each Shareholder must furnish the Company with such
information regarding the Shareholder and pertinent to the disclosure
requirements relating to the registration and distribution of his shares of
Company Common Stock as the Company may from time to time reasonably request in
writing and hereby agrees to assist the Company in that regard. Citizens
understands and agrees that in order to sell any shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Registration Statement, the selling Shareholder or the broker
effectuating any such sale must deliver a copy of the current prospectus
included in the Registration Statement to the purchaser of such shares prior to
or simultaneously with the delivery of the confirmation for such sale to such
purchaser. Citizens understands that any sale which fails to comply with the
requirements of the preceding sentence will not be in compliance with the
Securities Act and must be rescinded. Citizens understands that, upon receipt of
any notice from the Company of the happening of any event described in the sixth
sentence of Section 5.26 hereof, each Shareholder must immediately discontinue
disposition of his shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Registration
Statement until the lifting of such

                                      -50-
<PAGE>   56

stop order or the Shareholder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or
amended prospectus, as applicable.

         SECTION 5.28 INDEMNIFICATION BY THE COMPANY. The Company shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Shareholder and each underwriter, if
any, and each Affiliate of each Shareholder or any such underwriter
(collectively, the "Shareholder Indemnified Parties") against any and all
losses, claims, damages or liabilities, and expenses to which any such
Shareholder Indemnified Party may become subject under the Securities Act,
common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(or actions or proceedings in respect thereof, whether commenced or threatened)
arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement of any material fact
contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary, final or summary
prospectus contained therein (except where errors or omissions in such
preliminary prospectus are corrected in the final prospectus and the Shareholder
fails to timely deliver such final prospectus) or in any amendment or supplement
thereto or any document incorporated by reference therein or (ii) any omission
to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading, and the Company will reimburse the
Shareholder Indemnified Party for any legal or any other expenses reasonably
incurred by him in connection with investigating or defending any such loss,
claim, liability, action or proceeding; provided, that the Company shall not be
liable to the Shareholder Indemnified Party in any such case to the extent that
any such loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect
thereof) or expense arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or
omission made in the Registration Statement or amendment or supplement thereto
or in any such preliminary, final or summary prospectus in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information with respect to the Shareholder or the
Shareholder's underwriter furnished to the Company by the Shareholder or the
Shareholder's underwriter specifically for use in the preparation thereof. The
indemnity agreements contained in this Section 5.28 shall not apply to amounts
paid in settlement of claims if such settlement is effectuated without the
consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). Such
indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation
made by or on behalf of the Shareholder or any Shareholder Indemnified Party.

         (b) Indemnification by the Shareholder. Each Shareholder shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, the Company and each Affiliate of the
Company and their respective directors and officers (and the directors,
officers, affiliates and controlling persons thereof, as defined in Section 15
of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act")), (collectively, the "Company Indemnified
Parties"), against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, and
expenses to which any such Company Indemnified Party may become subject under
the Securities Act, common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities,(or actions or proceedings in respect thereof, whether
commenced or threatened) arise out of or are based upon any statement in or
omission from the Registration Statement, any preliminary, final or summary
prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement, if such statement
or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
with respect to the Shareholder furnished to the Company by the Shareholder
specifically for use in the preparation of the Registration Statement,
preliminary, final or summary prospectus or amendment or supplement, or a
document incorporated by reference into any of the foregoing; provided, however,
that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 5.28 shall not apply to
amounts paid in settlement of any loss, claim, damage, liability or action
arising if such

                                      -51-
<PAGE>   57

settlement is effected without the consent of the Shareholder (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld). Such indemnity shall remain in full force
and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company
or any other Company Indemnified Party.

         (c) Notices of Claims, Etc. Promptly after receipt by a Shareholder or
a Company Indemnified Party (collectively, an "Indemnified Party") hereunder or
written notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding with respect to
which a claim for indemnification may be made pursuant to this Section 5.28,
such Indemnified Party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against
an indemnifying party, give written notice to the latter of the commencement of
such action; provided, that the failure of such Indemnified Party to give notice
as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations
under the preceding sections of this Section 5.28, except to the extent that the
indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice, and in
no event shall such omission relieve the indemnifying party from any other
liability it may have to such Indemnified Party. In case any such action is
brought against any Indemnified Party, unless in such Indemnified Party's
reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and
indemnifying parties may exist in respect of such claim, the indemnifying party
will be entitled to participate in and to assume the defense thereof, jointly
with any other indemnifying party similarly notified to the extent that it may
wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, and after
notice from the indemnifying party to such Indemnified Party of its election so
to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such
Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the
latter in connection with the defense thereof. No indemnifying party will
consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not
include as an unconditional term thereof, the giving by the claimant or
plaintiff to such Indemnified Party or a release from all liability in respect
to such claim or litigation.

         (d) Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in this Section
5.28 from the indemnifying party is unavailable to an Indemnified Party
hereunder in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses
referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such
Indemnified Party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
Indemnified Party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of
the indemnifying party and such Indemnified Party in connection with the actions
that resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well
as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such
indemnifying party and an Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by such indemnifying party or by such Indemnified Party.
The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contributions pursuant to this Section 5.28(d) were determined: (i) by pro rata
allocation or (ii) by any other method of allocation that does not take account
of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 5.28(d). The amount
paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of the losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred
to above shall be deemed to include (subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 5.28(c) hereof) any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred
by such Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such
action, proceeding or claim. No party guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation

                                      -52-
<PAGE>   58

(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any party who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

         (e) Non-Exclusivity. The obligations of the parties under this Section
5.28 shall be in addition to any liability which any party may otherwise have to
any other party.

         SECTION 5.29 COMBINED REPORT. The Company agrees to publish the
Combined Report without undue delay, but in no event later than 30 days after
the last day of the first full month of combined operations of the Company and
Citizens, and thereupon to notify the Shareholders of the occurrence of the
Expiration Date.

         SECTION 5.30 LEGENDS ON CERTIFICATES. In order to comply with the
requirements of the Securities Act and the Texas Business Corporation Act,
Southwest may give stop transfer instructions to its transfer agent with respect
to the shares of Company Common Stock issuable hereunder and shall place on each
certificate representing any such shares (and any substitution therefor) a
legend stating in substance:

                  "The securities represented by this certificate were issued
         without registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") or
         any applicable state securities laws and may be sold, transferred or
         otherwise disposed of only upon receipt by the Company of an opinion of
         counsel acceptable to it that an exemption from registration under the
         Act and any such state securities laws is available, or pursuant to a
         registration statement under the Act."

The legend set forth above shall be removed by delivery of substitute
certificates without such legend, and any related stop transfer instructions
shall be lifted forthwith, provided that the Shares have been sold under the
Registration Statement and the prospectus delivery requirements set forth in
Section 5.27 have been satisfied. In addition, such legend shall be so removed,
and any related stop transfer instructions shall be lifted forthwith, upon the
Company's receipt of a request therefor from any Shareholder at least two years
following the Effective Time, unless the Company deems the Shareholder at the
time to be an affiliate of the Company or to have been such an affiliate within
the preceding three months.

         SECTION 5.31 BEST EFFORTS FOR DECEMBER CLOSING. The Company and
Citizens shall use their best efforts to cause the Effective Time to occur on or
prior to December 31, 2000.

         SECTION 5.32 SPLIT-DOLLAR LIFE INSURANCE. Following the Effective Time,
John C. Echols shall have the option of purchasing from SW Bank (as the
successor to CB&T) the split-dollar life insurance policy maintained by CB&T,
then in effect covering his life, and Douglas W. Stewart shall have the option
of purchasing from SW Bank the two second-to-die split-dollar life insurance
policies maintained by CB&T then in effect covering his life and the life of his
spouse. In each case, the purchase price of such policy shall be paid in cash
and shall be equal to CB&T's investment in the policy as defined in the Split
Dollar Agreement relating to such policy and as reflected as an asset on CB&T's
balance sheet (the "CB&T Investment"). If either such option is not exercised
within 10 days following the Effective Time, SW Bank may terminate such policy
and retain the

                                      -53-
<PAGE>   59

CB&T Investment from the cash surrender value thereof. In no event shall the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries make any further payments on either such
policy following the Effective Time.

                                   ARTICLE VI

Patterson, L.L.P., an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to Citizens to

the Company and Citizens will each be a party to that reorganization; (iii) no
gain or loss will be recognized to the former Shareholders of Citizens who
receive Company Common Stock in exchange for their Citizens Common Stock, except

exchange); and (v)

Shareholder will include the holding period of the shares of Citizens Common
Stock surrendered therefor, provided that such Citizens Common Stock was held as

Agreement are subject to the satisfaction or waiver on or before the Closing
Date (or as otherwise provided below) of all of the following conditions:

         (a)  Representations and Warranties; Covenants.

                  (i) Except for such breaches of the representations and
         warranties contained in Article III hereof as have not had, and cannot
         reasonably be expected to have, in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
         Effect on Citizens, all representations and warranties of Citizens
         contained in Article III of this Agreement shall be true and correct on
         and as of the Closing Date, with the same force and effect as though
         such representations and warranties were being made on and as of the

         speak as of a specific date, in which case they shall be deemed to have

         compliance with the condition set forth herein, any representation and
         warranty made by Citizens in this Agreement shall be read and
         interpreted as if the qualification stated therein with respect to
         materiality or Material Adverse Effect were not contained therein;

                  (ii) Citizens shall have performed and satisfied in all

                  (iii) There shall not have been instituted or threatened any
         suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding of any nature by any
         Person that would have been required to be listed on Schedule 3.14(a)
         hereto had such suit, claim, action or proceeding been instituted or
         threatened as of the date of this Agreement, and that, individually or
         in the aggregate, or when aggregated with the breaches, if any, of
         representations and warranties contained in Article III hereof, has
         had, or can reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect
         on Citizens; and

         (b) Regulatory Approvals. All the Regulatory Approvals for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have been obtained without the
imposition of any non-standard conditions that are or would become applicable to
the Company, the Surviving Corporation, SW Bank or any other Subsidiary of the
Company after the Effective Time that the Company in good faith determines would
be unduly burdensome (in the context of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) upon the conduct of the business of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, or SW Bank, as such businesses have been conducted prior to the
Effective Time or as such businesses are anticipated to be conducted after the
Effective Time, other than activity restrictions resulting from the activities

bank or a bank holding company. All such Regulatory Approvals shall be in effect
and no proceedings shall have been instituted or threatened with respect
thereto; all applicable waiting periods with respect to such Regulatory
Approvals shall have expired; and all conditions and requirements prescribed by
Applicable Law or by such Regulatory Approvals shall have been satisfied. All
other consents, approvals, waivers and other actions required from any other
Person pursuant to the Scheduled Contracts in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall have been obtained in form satisfactory to
the Company, except where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals and
waivers, and to take such other action, will not result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

         (c) Board and Shareholder Approval.

                  (i) The holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares

                  and Pasadena, approving the Bank Merger.

         (d) No Violations of Law; No Litigation. The transactions contemplated

pending or threatened suits, claims, actions, investigations, or proceedings by

                                   TERMINATION

         SECTION 7.1 TERMINATION. This Agreement and the obligations of the
parties hereunder will terminate automatically upon any termination of the
Purchase Agreement pursuant to Article VII thereof. In addition, this Agreement
and the obligations of the parties hereunder may be terminated:

         (a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Citizens at any time
whether or not theretofore approved by Citizens' shareholders;

         (b) by the Company or Citizens upon the expiration of 15 days after any
Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over any of the transactions set
forth herein indicates that it intends to deny or to refuse to grant any
Regulatory Approval; provided, however, that in the case of a denial or refusal
to grant approval by any Governmental Authority other than the OCC or the
Federal Reserve Board, the parties shall use their best efforts during such 15
day period to obtain the withdrawal of such denial or refusal;

         (c) by the Company immediately upon the expiration of 30 days from the
date that the Company has given notice to Citizens of Citizens' material failure
to satisfy any covenant or agreement herein, or of Citizens' breach of any
warranties or representations contained herein that in the aggregate represent a
change in Citizens from that represented to the Company that is equivalent to a
Material Adverse Effect on Citizens; provided, however, that no termination
under this Section 7.1(c) shall take effect if Citizens shall have fully and
completely corrected the grounds for termination as specified in the
aforementioned notice within the earlier to occur of (i) 30 days after the date
of receipt of such notice and (ii) the date specified in paragraph (i) below,
and provided further, however, that solely for purposes of this Section 7.1(c),
any representation and warranty made by Citizens in this Agreement shall be read
and interpreted as if the qualification stated therein with respect to
materiality or Material Adverse Effect were not contained therein;

         (d) by Citizens immediately upon the expiration of 30 days from the
date that Citizens has given written notice to the Company of the Company's
material failure to satisfy any covenant or agreement contained herein, or of
the Company's breach of any warranties or representations contained herein that
in the aggregate represent a change in the Company from that represented to
Citizens that is equivalent to a Material Adverse Effect on the Company;
provided, however, that no termination under this Section 7.1(d) shall take
effect if the Company shall have fully and completely corrected the grounds for
termination as specified in the aforementioned notice within the earlier to
occur of (i) 30 days after the date of receipt of such notice and (ii) the date
specified in paragraph (i) below, and provided further, however, that solely for
purposes of this Section 7.1(d), any representation and warranty made by the
Company in this Agreement shall be read and interpreted as if the qualification
stated therein with respect to materiality or Material Adverse Effect were not
contained therein;

         (e) by either the Company or Citizens (provided that if the terminating
party is Citizens, Citizens shall not be in material breach of any of its
obligations under this Agreement) if any approval of the Shareholders required
for the consummation of the Merger shall not have been

                                      -60-
<PAGE>   66

obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at the
Shareholders' Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof or the Board of
Directors of Citizens has determined not to recommend approval of the Merger to
the Shareholders or has determined to withdraw such recommendation of approval
pursuant to the exercise of its fiduciary duties;

         (f) by the Company, if there shall have occurred since September 30,
2000, any change in or effect on the business of Citizens or its Subsidiaries or
any occurrence, development or event of any nature that has had or may
reasonably be expected to have, together with all such other changes and
effects, a Material Adverse Effect on Citizens;

         (g) by Citizens, if there shall have occurred since June 30, 2000, any
change in or effect on the business of the Company or any occurrence,
development or event of any nature that has had or may reasonably be expected to
have, together with all such other changes and effects, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company;

         (h) by Citizens, within three business days after the end of the
Company Measurement Period, if the Company Measurement Price is less than $25.00
(the "Termination Price") without regard for the Minimum Company Measurement
Price (the "Arithmetic Company Measurement Price");

         (i) immediately by either party hereto that is not in default
hereunder, if the Closing has not occurred on or before March 31, 2001.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Citizens elects to terminate the
Agreement pursuant to clause (h) above, the Company shall have the right, but
not the obligation, to nullify such termination by increasing the number of
Adjusted Company Shares to be issued in connection with the Merger by
multiplying the number of Adjusted Company Shares determined pursuant to Section
1.5(a) by the quotient of the Termination Price divided by the Arithmetic
Company Measurement Price (which increase would result in a corresponding
increase in the Exchange Ratio). If the Company exercises the right described in
the preceding sentence, it must notify Citizens of such exercise within two
business days following its receipt of Citizens' election to terminate the
Agreement pursuant to clause (h) above, whereupon no such termination shall have
occurred and this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms
(except that the Adjusted Company Shares and the Exchange Ratio shall have been
so modified), and any references in this Agreement to "Adjusted Company Shares"
and "Exchange Ratio" shall thereafter be deemed to refer to such terms as
adjusted pursuant to this paragraph.

         SECTION 7.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of a termination under
Section 7.1, this Agreement shall become void, and there shall be no liability
on the part of any party or any of such party's directors, officers, employees,
agents or shareholders to the other party or such other party's directors,
officers, employees, agents or shareholders; provided, however, that the
obligations of any party under Sections 5.7, 8.9, 8.10 and 8.11 shall survive
the termination of this Agreement; and provided further that a termination under
Section 7.1(c) or (d) shall not relieve any party of any liability for breach of
this Agreement or for any misrepresentation hereunder as of the date of this
Agreement or be deemed to constitute a waiver of any remedy available for such
breach or misrepresentation. Liability, if any, for an inadvertent or
non-intentional breach or misrepresentation

                                      -61-
<PAGE>   67

under the foregoing provisions shall be limited to the recovery of out-of-pocket
costs and expenses and shall not include punitive, special or consequential
damages. The parties acknowledge and agree that breaches of representations and
warranties that in the aggregate do not give rise to a right of termination
hereunder shall not give any right to any party as to offset or any other remedy
or right hereunder.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

the Closing, except for those covenants and agreements that are contemplated by
their terms to be performed after the Closing. No party, including any of its
directors, officers, employees, agents and shareholders, shall be under any
liability whatsoever with respect to such representations, warranties,
conditions and covenants following the Closing, except that the Company shall be
responsible for all of its covenants and agreements that are contemplated by
their terms to be performed after the Closing.

         SECTION 8.3 GOVERNING LAW. Except as otherwise provided in any exhibit
hereto, this Agreement and the legal relations between the parties shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of
Texas without taking into account provisions regarding choice of law.

         SECTION 8.4 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. All exhibits and schedules (including,
without limitation, the Disclosure Schedule) referred to in this Agreement are
integral parts hereof, and this Agreement, together with such exhibits and
schedules (including, without limitation, the Disclosure Schedule), constitutes
the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the matters herein
and therein and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the
parties with respect thereto.

         SECTION 8.5 AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. This Agreement may not be amended
except upon a written consent authorized and approved by the board of directors
of each party hereto. By an instrument in writing, the Company may waive
compliance by Citizens and Citizens may waive compliance by the Company with any
term or provision of this Agreement that such other party was or is obligated to
comply with or perform; provided, however, that such waiver shall not operate as
a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any other or subsequent failure. No
failure to exercise and no delay in exercising any right, remedy or power
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy or power provided
herein or by law or in equity. The waiver by any party of the time for
performance of any act or condition hereunder does not constitute a waiver of
the act or condition itself. Unless required by Applicable Law, no such

                                      -63-
<PAGE>   69

waiver, amendment or modification effected after approval of this Agreement by
the shareholders of Citizens shall require any further shareholder approval.

         SECTION 8.6 SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof to any Person, place or circumstance, shall be held by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unenforceable or void, the
remainder of this Agreement and such provisions as applied to other Persons,
places and circumstances shall remain in full force and effect only if, after
excluding the portion deemed to be unenforceable, the remaining terms shall
provide for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in
substantially the same manner as originally set forth at the later of the date
this Agreement was executed or last amended.

         SECTION 8.7 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, each of which shall constitute one and the same instrument.

         SECTION 8.8 INTERPRETATION OF AGREEMENT. The article, section and other
headings used in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
constitute a part hereof or affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. References herein to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or other similar words shall include, without limitation, the Merger, the
Delaware Merger, the Bank Merger and all of the other transactions contemplated
hereunder.

         SECTION 8.9  EXPENSES.

         (a) Subject to paragraphs (b) through (d) below and except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, the Delaware Merger and the
Bank Merger and all other terms and conditions of this Agreement, and the
transactions contemplated hereby, will be paid by the party incurring such costs
and expenses.

         (b) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1
hereof, all out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the parties relating to the
printing, filing, shipping and distribution of the Offering Memorandum/Proxy
Statement shall be borne equally by the Company, on the one hand, and Citizens,
on the other hand.

         (c) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
7.1(e) hereof and the Board of Directors of Citizens has either failed to
recommend, or has recommended against, approval of the Merger because of the
receipt by Citizens of an Acquisition Proposal, the parties agree that Citizens
shall pay to the Company, concurrently with such termination, a termination fee
of $5,000,000. The Company hereby agrees that its sole remedy in such case shall
be such termination fee.

         Citizens acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
8.9(c) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement,
and that without these agreements, the Company would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if Citizens fails to promptly pay such termination fee
when due, Citizens shall in addition thereto pay to the Company all costs and
expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred in collecting
such termination fee, together with interest thereon (or any unpaid portion
thereof) from the date such payment was

                                      -64-
<PAGE>   70

required to be made to the date such payment is received by the Company at the
prime rate of SW Bank as in effect from time to time during such period.

         (d) Except as provided in paragraph (c) above, the rights and remedies
provided in this Section 8.9 are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights and
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

         SECTION 8.10 ATTORNEYS' FEES. In addition to the rights granted
pursuant to Section 8.9, if any legal action is brought for the enforcement of
this Agreement or because of an alleged dispute, breach or default in connection
with this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover
reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs incurred in such action or
proceeding, in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled.

         SECTION 8.11 PUBLICITY. The parties hereto will consult with each other
with regard to the terms and substance of any and all press releases,
announcements or other public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby. The parties agree further that neither of them will release
any such press release, announcement or other public statement without the prior
approval of the other party, unless such release is required by law and the
parties cannot reach agreement upon a mutually acceptable form of release, in
which event the party releasing the information, announcement or public
statement shall not be deemed to be in breach of this Agreement. The parties
agree further that such approval will not be unreasonably withheld, and they
pledge to make a good faith effort to reach agreement expeditiously on the terms
of any such press release, announcement or other public statement.

         SECTION 8.12 BINDING EFFECT. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns.

         SECTION 8.13 THIRD PARTIES. Except as otherwise provided herein, each
party intends that this Agreement shall not benefit or create any right or cause
of action or remedy of any nature whatsoever in any Person other than the
parties to this Agreement, including, without limitation, conferring upon any
Person the right to remain an employee of Citizens, the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries, or restraining Citizens, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries from changing the terms and conditions of employment of any Person
or terminating such Person's employment, following the Effective Time.

                          [Form of Affiliates' Letter]



Southwest Bancorporation of Texas, Inc.
4400 Post Oak Parkway
Houston, Texas 77027

Gentlemen:

         I have been advised that as of the date hereof I am an "affiliate" of
Citizens Bankers, Inc., a Texas corporation ("Citizens"), as that term is
defined in Rule 144 ("Rule 144") of the Rules and Regulations (the "Rules and
Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under
the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act"). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement
and Plan of Merger dated October __, 2000 (the "Agreement"), between Southwest
Bancorporation of Texas, Inc., a Texas corporation (the "Company"), and
Citizens, providing for the merger of Citizens with and into the Company (the
"Merger"), as a result of which I will receive shares of Company Common Stock
(the "Company Shares") in exchange for the shares of Citizens Common Stock owned
by me at the Effective Time of the Merger as defined in the Agreement.

         I represent and warrant that:

         A. I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of the
Company Shares in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.

         B. I have been advised that the issuance of the Company Shares to me
pursuant to the Merger has not been registered by the Company under the Act but
that the Company has agreed to file a "shelf" registration statement on Form S-3
(the "Registration Statement") after the Effective Time of the Merger that would
register the resale of my Company Shares. I hereby agree to furnish the Company
with such information regarding myself and pertinent to the disclosure
requirements relating to the registration and distribution of my Company Shares
as the Company may reasonably request in writing. I hereby acknowledge and agree
that in order to sell any of my Company Shares pursuant to the Registration
Statement, I or the broker effectuating any such sale must deliver a copy of the
current prospectus included in the Registration Statement to the purchaser of
such shares prior to or simultaneously with the delivery of the confirmation for
such sale to such purchaser. I further understand that any sale which fails to
comply with the requirement of the preceding sentence will not be in compliance
with the Act and must be rescinded. I also hereby agree that, upon my receipt of
any notice from the Company of the issuance by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement or the happening of any event which makes the
Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto, related
prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any document incorporated
therein by reference, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made
not misleading, I will immediately discontinue

                                      C-1
<PAGE>   86

disposition of my Company Shares pursuant to the Registration Statement until
the lifting of such stop order or my receipt of the copies of the supplemented
or amended prospectus, as applicable.

         C. I have been informed by the Company that I may not transfer, or in
any way reduce my risk with respect to, the Company Shares between the period
starting thirty (30) days prior to the Effective Time and ending at such time as
the Company shall have publicly released its first earnings report after the
Effective Time which includes the results of the combined operations of the
Company and Citizens for a period of at least thirty (30) days subsequent to the
Effective Time.

         D. [The following sentence to be included only if the affiliate is a
record or beneficial owner of 5% or more of the outstanding Citizens Common
Stock.] I have no present plan or intention to sell, exchange, transfer,
distribute (including, without limitation, a distribution by a partnership to
its partners or by a corporation to its stockholders), pledge or otherwise
dispose of, reduce the risk of loss by short sale or otherwise, enter into any
contract or arrangement with respect thereto, or consent to the sale, exchange,
transfer, distribution or other disposition of any interest in (i) shares of
Citizens Common Stock in a transaction the consideration for which is to be
provided by Citizens, the Company, or any party related to Citizens or the
Company or (ii) shares of Company Common Stock to be received in the Merger in a
transaction the consideration for which is to be provided by the Company or any
party related to the Company.

         E. I have carefully read this letter and the Agreement and have
discussed their requirements and other applicable limitations upon my sale,
transfer or other disposition of the Company Shares, to the extent I felt
necessary, with my counsel or counsel for Citizens.

         F. I understand that the Company is under no obligation to register the
sale, transfer or other disposition of the Company Shares by me or on my behalf,
or to take any other action necessary in order to make compliance with an
exemption from registration available, other than as set forth in the Agreement.

         G. I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to
the Company's transfer agent with respect to the Company Shares and that there
will be placed on the certificates for the Company Shares, or any substitutions
therefor, a legend stating in substance:

                   "The shares represented by this certificate have not been
         registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") or any
         applicable state securities laws and may be sold, transferred or
         otherwise disposed of only upon receipt by the Company of an opinion of
         counsel acceptable to it that an exemption from registration under the
         Act and any such state securities laws is available, or pursuant to a
         registration statement under the Act."

         It is understood and agreed that the legend set forth in paragraph G
above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such
legend (i) if the Company Shares have been sold under the Registration Statement
and the prospectus delivery requirements set forth in paragraph B above have
been satisfied, or (ii) upon the Company's receipt of a request by the
undersigned for such removal at least two years following the Effective Time of
the Merger, provided that the

                                      C-2
<PAGE>   87

undersigned has not been an "affiliate" of the Company (as defined in Rule 144)
within the three-month period preceding the date of such request.

                                               Very truly yours,



                                               ---------------------------------

Information of Company and its affiliates that has been and will in the future
be disclosed or entrusted to Executive, the business good will of Company and
its affiliates that has been and will in the future be developed in Executive,
or the business opportunities that have been and will in the future be disclosed
or entrusted to Executive by Company and its affiliates; and as an additional
incentive for Company to enter into this Agreement, Company and Executive agree
to the non-competition obligations hereunder. Executive shall not, directly or
indirectly for Executive or for others, in any geographic area or market where
Company or any of its affiliates are conducting any business as of the date of
the termination of the employment relationship or have during the previous
twelve months conducted such business:

                  (i) engage in any business competitive with the business
         conducted by Company in any county in which the Company maintains an
         office;

                  (ii) render advice or services to, or otherwise assist, any
         other person, association, or entity who is engaged, directly or
         indirectly, in any business competitive with the business conducted by
         Company with respect to such competitive business; or

                  (iii) induce any employee of Company or any of its affiliates
         to terminate his or her employment with Company or such affiliates, or
         hire or assist in the hiring of any such employee by any person,
         association, or entity not affiliated with Company.

These non-competition obligations shall apply during the period that Executive
is receiving benefits pursuant to Article 3 hereunder and shall extend one year
after termination of the employment relationship if such termination is by
Company pursuant to Section 2.2(iii) or (iv) or by Executive pursuant to Section
2.3(ii).

         5.2 ENFORCEMENT AND REMEDIES. Executive understands that the
restrictions set forth in paragraph 5.1 may limit Executive's ability to engage
in certain businesses anywhere in the world during the period provided for
above, but acknowledges that Executive will receive sufficiently high
remuneration and other benefits under this Agreement to justify such
restriction. Executive acknowledges that money damages would not be sufficient
remedy for any breach of this Article by Executive, and Company shall be
entitled to enforce the provisions of this Article by terminating any

                                      D-6
<PAGE>   94

payments then owing to Executive under this Agreement and/or to specific
performance and injunctive relief as remedies for such breach or any threatened
breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed the exclusive remedies for a breach of
this Article, but shall be in addition to all remedies available at law or in
equity to Company, including without limitation, the recovery of damages from
Executive and Executive's agents involved in such breach and remedies available
to Company pursuant to other agreements with Executive.

         5.3 REFORMATION. It is expressly understood and agreed that Company and
Executive consider the restrictions contained in this Article to be reasonable
and necessary to protect the proprietary information of Company. Nevertheless,
if any of the aforesaid restrictions are found by a court having jurisdiction to
be unreasonable, or overly broad as to geographic area or time, or otherwise
unenforceable, the parties intend for the restrictions therein set forth to be
modified by such court so as to be reasonable and enforceable and, as so
modified by the court, to be fully enforced.

                                    ARTICLE 6

                          STATEMENTS CONCERNING COMPANY

         6.1 IN GENERAL. Executive shall refrain, both during the employment
relationship and after the employment relationship terminates, from publishing
any oral or written statements about Company, any of its affiliates, or any of
such entities' officers, employees, agents or representatives that are
slanderous, libelous, or defamatory; or that disclose private or CONFIDENTIAL
information about Company, any of its affiliates, or any of such entities'
business affairs, officers, employees, agents, or representatives; or that
constitute an intrusion into the seclusion or private lives of Company, any of
its affiliates, or any of such entities' officers, employees, agents, or
representatives; or that give rise to unreasonable publicity about the private
lives of Company, any of its affiliates, or any of such entities' officers,
employees, agents, or representatives; or that place Company, any of its
affiliates, or any of such entities' officers, employees, agents, or
representatives in a false light before the public; or that constitute a
misappropriation of the name or likeness of Company, any of its affiliates, or
any of such entities' officers, employees, agents, or representatives. A
violation or threatened violation of this prohibition may be enjoined by the
courts. The rights afforded Company and its affiliates under this provision are
in addition to any and all rights and remedies otherwise afforded by law.

                                    ARTICLE 7

                      EFFECT OF TERMINATION ON COMPENSATION

         7.1 BY EXPIRATION. If Executive's employment hereunder shall terminate
upon expiration of the term provided in paragraph 2.1 hereof, then all
compensation and all benefits to Executive hereunder shall terminate
contemporaneously with termination of his employment (except to the extent
benefits continue pursuant to the specific terms of any plan or program).

         7.2 BY COMPANY. If Executive's employment hereunder shall be terminated
by Company prior to expiration of the term provided in paragraph 2.1, then, upon
such termination,

                                      D-7
<PAGE>   95

regardless of the reason therefor, all compensation and benefits to Executive
hereunder shall terminate contemporaneously with the termination of such
employment (except to the extent benefits continue pursuant to the specific
terms of any plan or program); provided, however, that if such termination shall
be for any reason other than those encompassed by paragraphs 2.2(i), (ii),
(iii), or (iv), then Company shall (i) pay Executive the Termination Payments
and (ii) provide Executive with Continuation Benefits. For purposes of this
Agreement, (A) the term "Termination Payments" shall mean continuation of
Executive's annual base salary as provided in paragraph 3.1 and continuation of
Executive's bonuses as provided in paragraph 3.2 at the average percentage of
annual base salary paid to Executive within the two-year period preceding his
termination of employment with Company, as if he had remained employed by
Company through the third anniversary of the Effective Date and (B) the term
"Continuation Benefits" shall mean continued coverage under Company's medical
and dental plans and life insurance for Executive and his dependents (including
his spouse) who were covered under such plans and insurance on the day prior to
Executive's termination of employment with Company as if he had remained
employed by Company through the third anniversary date of the Effective Date
(provided, however, that (1) such coverage shall terminate if and to the extent
Executive becomes eligible to receive medical, dental and life insurance
coverage from a subsequent employer (and any such eligibility shall be promptly
reported to Company by Executive), (2) if Executive (and/or his spouse) would
have been entitled to retiree medical, dental, and/or life insurance coverage
under Company's plans had he voluntarily retired on the date of such
termination, then such coverages shall be continued as provided under such
plans, and (3) in the event that continued participation in any such Company
plan is for whatever reason impermissible, Company shall arrange upon comparable
terms benefits substantially equivalent to those that may not be so provided
under the plan maintained by Company). Notwithstanding the preceding provisions
of this paragraph 7.2, as a condition to the receipt of any Termination Payments
and/or Continuation Benefits pursuant to this paragraph 7.2, Executive must
first execute a release and agreement which shall release Company, its
affiliates and their officers, directors, employees and agents from any and all
claims and from any and all causes of action of any kind or character, including
but not limited to all claims or causes of action arising out of Executive's
employment with Company and the termination of such employment.

         7.3 BY EXECUTIVE. If Executive's employment hereunder shall be
terminated by Executive prior to expiration of the term provided in paragraph
2.1, then, upon such termination, regardless of the reason therefor, all
compensation and benefits to Executive hereunder shall terminate
contemporaneously with the termination of such employment (except to the extent
benefits continue pursuant to the specific terms of any plan or program);
provided, however, that if such termination shall be pursuant to paragraph
2.3(i), (iii), (iv) or (v), then Company shall (i) pay Executive the Termination
Payments and (ii) provide Executive with Continuation Benefits, subject to
Executive's execution of a release and agreement as described in the last
sentence of Section 7.2.

         7.4 LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. In light of the difficulties in estimating the
damages for an early termination of this Agreement, Company and Executive hereby
agree that the payments, if any, to be received by Executive pursuant to this
Article 7 shall be received by Executive as liquidated damages.

         7.5 INCENTIVE AND DEFERRED COMPENSATION. This Agreement governs the
rights and obligations of Executive and Company with respect to Executive's base
salary, bonus, life insurance

                                      D-8
<PAGE>   96

and certain perquisites of employment. Executive's rights and obligations both
during the term of his employment and thereafter with respect to stock options,
restricted stock, and incentive and deferred compensation shall be governed by
the separate agreements, plans and other documents and instruments governing
such matters.

transfer, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written
consent of the other party.

         8.12 TERM. This Agreement has a term co-extensive with the term of
employment provided in paragraph 2.1. Termination shall not affect any right or
obligation of any party which is accrued or vested prior to such termination.
