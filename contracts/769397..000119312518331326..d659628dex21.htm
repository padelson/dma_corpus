such Parent Indemnitee may deliver a claim notice signed by an authorized representative of Parent (a &#147;<U>Claim Notice</U>&#148;) to the Securityholders&#146; Agent. Each Claim Notice shall: (i)&nbsp;contain a brief description specifying in

description of the facts and circumstances supporting the Securityholders&#146; Agent&#146;s claim that only a portion or no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Parent Indemnitee, as the case may be. Any part of the Claimed Amount that is not
agreed to be owed to the Parent Indemnitee pursuant to the Response Notice (or the entire Claimed Amount, if the Securityholders&#146; Agent asserts in the Response Notice that no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Parent Indemnitee) is

the Securityholders&#146; Agent any ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The Securityholders&#146; Agent will not be liable for any loss of principal of the Expense Fund other than as a result of its
