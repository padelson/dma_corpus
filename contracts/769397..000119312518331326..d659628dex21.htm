unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to
any vesting (including acceleration of vesting) that is contingent upon the
completion of the Merger, including, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect
to any Company Option that is not a Substitute Option and would otherwise be
an Unvested Option but for any acceleration of vesting pursuant to Section
11(b) of the Company Stock Plan or pursuant to the stock option agreement
governing the applicable Company Option) (each, a " _Vested Option_ ") shall
be cancelled and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 1.6(a)_, for such holders Company Common Stock subject
to such Vested Options, an amount in cash equal to: (i) (A) the Per Share
Amount _multiplied by_ the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Vested Option held by such holder; _minus_ (B) the aggregate
purchase price for the exercise of the Vested Option with respect to all
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested Option; _minus_ (ii) the
Per Share Escrow Amount _multiplied by_ the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Vested Option held by such holder; _minus_ (iii)
the Per Share Expense Fund Amount _multiplied by_ the total number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested Option held by such holder;
_plus_ (iv) any disbursements of cash required to be made from the Escrow Fund
or Expense Fund with respect to such Vested Option in accordance with
_Sections 10.5(g)_ , _10.5(h)_ ,  _10.5(i)_ and _11.1_ and the terms of the
Escrow Agreement (in each case, as applicable), as and when such disbursements
are required to be made (it being understood that: (A) if the exercise price
payable in respect of a share of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested
Option equals or exceeds the Per Share Amount (an " _Underwater Vested Option_
"), then the amount payable hereunder with respect to such Vested Option shall
be zero; and (B) once deposited in an account designated by the
Securityholders Agent, Parent shall have no Liability to any Person in
respect of the Expense Fund and each holder of a Vested Option shall look
solely to the Securityholders Agent with respect to any payments in respect
thereof). Each Vested Option, other than any Underwater Vested Option, is
referred to in this Agreement as an " _Outstanding  In-the-Money Vested
Option_". Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action that
may be necessary (under the Company Stock Plan or otherwise) to effectuate
the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 1.6(a)_ and to ensure that, from and
after the Effective Time, each holder of a Vested Option cancelled as provided
in this _Section_ __ _ 1.6(a)_ shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the consideration specified in this
_Section_ __ _ 1.6(a)_, if any, without interest.

by a Key Employee or Continuing Service Provider: (x) that is unvested,

price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option that is
less than the Per Share Amount (an " _Outstanding In-the-Money Unvested
Option_") shall be converted into and become an option to purchase Parent
Common Stock, and Parent shall either assume such Company Option or replace
such Company Option by causing Parent to issue a reasonably equivalent
replacement stock option to purchase Parent Common Stock in substitution
therefor, subject to the remainder of this _Section_ __ _ 1.6(b)_
(all Outstanding In-the-Money Unvested Options that are assumed or replaced
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.6(b)_ are hereafter referred to as "
_Substitute Options_ "). All rights to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
under Substitute Options shall thereupon be converted into rights to purchase
Parent Common Stock. Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time: (A) each
Substitute Option may be exercised solely for shares of Parent Common Stock;
(B) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Substitute
Option shall be determined by multiplying __ the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that were subject to such Substitute Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting number
down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; (C) the
per share exercise price for a share of Parent Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of each Substitute Option shall be determined by dividing the per
share exercise price of a share of Company Common Stock subject to such
Substitute Option, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, by
the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the
nearest whole cent; and (D) any restriction on the exercise of any Substitute
Option shall continue in full force and effect and the term, incentive stock
option status, exercisability and vesting schedule (including vesting
acceleration) of such Substitute Option shall otherwise remain unchanged as a
result of the assumption or replacement of such Substitute Option. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions that may be
necessary (under the Company Stock Plan and otherwise) to: (A) effectuate the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 1.6(b)_; and (B) to ensure that, from
and after the Effective Time, holders of Unvested Options have no rights with
respect thereto other than those specifically provided in this _Section_ __ _
1.6(b)_ _,_ if any.

 

(c) _V_ _ested RSUs_. Subject to _Sections_ ___1.5(d)_ and _1.8(h)_ , at
the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is vested, outstanding and
unsettled immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to any
vesting (including acceleration of vesting) that is contingent upon the
completion of the Merger, including, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect
to any Company RSU that is not a Substitute RSU and would otherwise be an
Outstanding Unvested RSU but for any acceleration of vesting pursuant to
Section 11(b) of the Company Stock Plan or pursuant to the restricted stock
unit agreement governing the applicable Company RSU) (each, a " _Vested RSU_
") shall be cancelled and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 1.6(c)_, for such holders Company Common
Stock subject to such Vested RSUs, an amount in cash equal to: (i) the Per
Share Amount _multiplied by_ the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Vested RSU held by such holder; _minus_ (ii) the Per
Share Escrow Amount _multiplied by_ the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Vested RSU held by such holder; _minus_ (iii)
the Per Share Expense Fund Amount _multiplied by_ the total number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested RSU held by such holder; _plus_

_10.5(g)_ , _10.5(h)_ , _10.5(i)_ and _11.1_ and the terms of the Escrow
Agreement (in each case, as applicable), as and when such disbursements are
required to be made (it being understood once deposited in an account
designated by the Securityholders Agent, Parent shall have no Liability to
any Person in respect of the Expense Fund and each holder of a Vested RSU
shall look solely to the Securityholders Agent with respect to any payments
in respect thereof). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
action that may be necessary (under the Company Stock Plan or otherwise) to
effectuate the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 1.6(c)_ and to ensure
that, from and after the Effective Time, each holder of a Vested RSU cancelled
as provided in this _Section_ __ _ 1.6(c)_ shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration specified
in this _Section_ __ _ 1.6(c)_, if any, without interest.

 



13

    

(d) _U_ _nvested RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each Company RSU held by a
Key Employee or Continuing Service Provider that is unvested, outstanding and
unsettled immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to any
vesting that is contingent upon the completion of the Merger) (each, an "
_Outstanding Unvested RSU_ ") shall be converted into and become an RSU to
acquire Parent Common Stock, and Parent shall either assume such Company RSU
or replace such Company RSU by causing Parent to issue a reasonably
equivalent replacement RSU to acquire Parent Common Stock in substitution
therefor, subject to the remainder of this _Section_ __ _ 1.6(d)_ (all
Outstanding Unvested RSUs that are assumed or replaced pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 1.6(d)_ are hereafter referred to as " _Substitute RSUs_ ").
All rights to acquire shares of Company Common Stock under Substitute RSUs
shall thereupon be converted into rights to acquire Parent Common Stock.
Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time: (A) each Substitute RSU may be
settled solely for shares of Parent Common Stock; (B) the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to each Substitute RSU shall be determined
by multiplying __ the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were
subject to such Substitute RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock; and (C) any restriction on the
settlement of any Substitute RSU shall continue in full force and effect and
the term and vesting schedule (including vesting acceleration) of such
Substitute RSU shall otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the assumption
or replacement of such Substitute RSU. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all actions that may be necessary (under the Company Stock
Plan and otherwise) to: (A) effectuate the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
1.6(d)_; and (B) to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, holders of
Outstanding Unvested RSUs have no rights with respect thereto other than those
specifically provided in this  _Section_ __ _ 1.6(d)_ _,_ if any.

(e) _Payment_. Promptly (but in any event within 30 days) following the
Effective Time, Parent: (i) shall cause to be paid through the payroll
services of the Company or Parent to each holder of an Outstanding In-the-
Money Vested Option and/or Vested RSU (other than Outstanding In-the-Money
Vested Options and Vested RSUs with respect to which the Company has no Tax
withholding obligations (" _Non-Employee __Awards_ ")), the consideration
specified in this  _Section_ __ _ 1.6_, without interest, _less_ applicable
withholding Taxes and subject to _Section_ __ _ 1.5(c)_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall use reasonable
efforts to cause the payment contemplated by this clause "(i)" to occur prior
to December 31, 2018 if (and only if): (A) the Closing occurs on or before
December 27, 2018; (B) at least five Business Days prior to the Closing (or,
solely in the case of early termination of the waiting period under the HSR
Act, if later, on the Closing Conditions Satisfaction Date), the Company
provides evidence to Parent, reasonably satisfactory to Parent, that all
calculations have been made and all actions have been taken such that the
only action required to be completed after the Closing in order to effectuate
the timing contemplated by this proviso is that the Company needs to transfer
funds to the Companys payroll provider and direct the Companys payroll
provider to transfer the funds to the Persons entitled thereto, including
written (including email) confirmation from the Companys payroll provider
that they can process and make such transfers prior to December 31, 2018; and
(C) promptly (but in any event within three Business Days) following the date
of this Agreement, the Company provides Parent and Parents Representatives
with reasonable access during normal business hours to the books and records
of the Acquired Entities (and to the Companys payroll provider, to the extent
within the Companys control) as reasonably requested by Parent in connection
with the calculations and payments contemplated by this _Section_ __ _
1.6(e)_ (the foregoing clauses "(A)" through "(C)" together, the " _Payroll
Conditions_ "); and (ii) shall cause to be paid by the Payment Agent (as
defined in _Section_ __ _ 1.8(a)_) to each holder of a Non-Employee Award
the consideration specified in this _Section_ __ _ 1.6_, without interest and
subject to  _Section_ __ _ 1.5(c)_.

 



14

    

(f) _Discretionary Assumption of Company Stock Plan_. At the Effective
Time, Parent may (but shall not be obligated to) assume the Company Stock Plan
or merge the Company Stock Plan into any equity compensation plan of Parent.
If Parent elects to so assume or merge the Company Stock Plan, then, under
the Company Stock Plan, Parent shall be entitled to grant stock awards, to
the extent permissible under applicable Legal Requirements, using the share
reserves of the Company Stock Plan as of the Effective Time (including any
shares subsequently returned to such share reserves as a result of the
termination of Substitute Options or Substitute RSUs), except that: (i) shares
covered by such awards shall be shares of Parent Common Stock; (ii) all
references in the Company Stock Plan to a number of shares of Company Common
Stock shall be deemed amended to refer instead to a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of referenced shares of
Company Common Stock by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting number
down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; (iii) the
compensation committee of Parents board of directors shall succeed to the
authority and responsibility of the Companys board of directors or any
committee thereof with respect to the administration of the Company Stock
Plan; and (iv) the Company Stock Plan shall be subject to administrative
procedures consistent with those in effect under Parents equity compensation
plan.

(g) _Form S-8_. Parent shall file with the SEC, no later than 30 days
after the date on which the Merger becomes effective, a registration statement
on Form S-8, if available for use by Parent, relating to the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable with respect to the Substitute Options and the
Substitute RSUs. Parent will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such
assumed Substitute Options and Substitute RSUs remain outstanding and will
reserve a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for issuance upon
exercise thereof.

 

1.7 Dissenting Shares.

 

(a) _Effect_ _on_ _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provisions of
this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Capital Stock held by a
holder who has demanded and perfected a demand for appraisal of such holders
shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
and/or, if applicable by virtue of Section 2115 of the CGCL, Chapter 13 of
the CGCL, and as of the Closing has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost
such holders right to such appraisal (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not
be converted into the applicable Merger Consideration, but shall be entitled
to only such rights as are granted by the DGCL or the CGCL. Parent shall be
entitled to retain any Merger Consideration not paid on account of such
Dissenting Shares pending resolution of the claims of such holders, and no
other Person shall be entitled to any portion of such retained Merger
Consideration.

 

(b) _Loss of Dissenting Share Status_. Notwithstanding the provisions of 
_Section_ __ _ 1.7(a)_, if any holder of shares of Company Capital Stock who
demands appraisal of such holders shares under the DGCL or the CGCL, as
applicable, shall effectively withdraw or lose (through the failure
to perfect or otherwise) such holders right to appraisal under the DGCL or
the CGCL, as applicable, then as of the Closing or the occurrence of such
event, whichever occurs later, such holders shares of Company Capital Stock
shall automatically be converted into the right to receive the applicable
Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, promptly following the
surrender of the certificate or certificates representing such shares of
Company Capital Stock.

 



15

    

(c) _Notice of Dissenting Shares_. The Company shall give Parent: (i)
prompt notice of any demands for appraisal of shares of Company Capital Stock
received by the Company, withdrawals of any demands, and any other instruments
or notices served or otherwise delivered pursuant to the DGCL or the CGCL, as
applicable, and received by the Company; and (ii) the opportunity to direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands for
appraisal or other instruments or notices. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal of shares of Company Capital Stock or offer to settle
any such demands.

 

1.8 Exchange of Certificates and Payment.

 

(a) _Payment Agent_. U.S. Bank National Association, or another nationally
recognized bank or trust company selected by Parent, shall act as payment
agent in the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ "). At or promptly after the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Payment Agent cash sufficient to
pay the cash consideration payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.5(a)(ii)_
(excluding the portion thereof attributable to the Escrow Amount and Expense
Fund, which shall be deposited with the Escrow Agent and Securityholders
Agent, respectively, and any consideration to be retained by Parent pursuant
to the Holdback Agreements). The cash amount so deposited with the Payment
Agent is referred to as the " _Payment Fund_." The Payment Agent will be
instructed to invest the funds included in the Payment Fund in the manner
directed by Parent. Any interest or other income resulting from the investment
of such funds shall be the property of, and will be paid to, Parent. The
Company shall deliver Form W-9s (or other applicable form) for all holders of
Non-Employee Awards to the Payment Agent.

 

(b) _Letter of Transmittal_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent
shall instruct the Payment Agent to mail to each Person who is a record
holder of Outstanding Capital Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time:
(i) a letter of transmittal substantially in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit G_ (which, as evidenced in  _Exhibit G_ , contain provisions
confirming that delivery of Company Capital Stock or transfer of Company Book
Entry Shares shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company Capital
Stock shall pass, only upon delivery of applicable Company Stock
Certificates, if any, or transfer of Company Book Entry Shares to the Payment
Agent, a general release and a provision whereby such holder agrees to be
bound by the provisions of _Sections 1.5,_ _1.8,_ _10_ , _11.1_  and the
other applicable provisions of this Agreement) (a " _Letter of Transmittal_
"); and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the delivery of Company Stock
Certificates, if any, or transfer of Company Book Entry Shares in exchange
for the Merger Consideration payable with respect to such shares of Company
Capital Stock. Upon the surrender to the Payment Agent of a Company Stock
Certificate, if any (or an affidavit of lost stock certificate as described
in  _Section_ __ _ 1.8(e)_) or confirmation of electronic transfer of
Company Book Entry Shares by the Payment Agent, together with a duly executed
Letter of Transmittal and such other documents as Parent or the Payment Agent
may reasonably request, the holder of such Company Capital Stock shall,
subject to _Section_ __ _ 1.8(h)_, if applicable, be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration, if any,
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.5_ at
the time of such surrender, and the Company Stock Certificate, if any, so
surrendered or Company Book Entry Shares so transferred shall forthwith be
cancelled. From and after the Effective Time, each Company Stock Certificate
or Company Book Entry Share which prior to the Effective Time represented
shares of Company Capital Stock shall be deemed to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, payable with respect to such shares, and
the holder of each such Company Stock Certificate or Company Book Entry Share
shall cease to have any rights with respect to the shares of Company Capital
Stock formerly represented thereby. 

 



16

    

(c) _Payments to Others_. If payment of Merger Consideration in respect
of shares of Company Capital Stock converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.5_
is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name such shares of
Company Capital Stock are registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that any Company Stock Certificate surrendered in respect thereof shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other than that of the
registered holder thereof or shall have established to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not payable.

 

(d) _Stock Transfer Books_. As of the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and there shall not be any further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Capital Stock thereafter on the
records of the Company. If, after the Effective Time, certificates for shares
of Outstanding Capital Stock (" _Company Stock Certificates_ ") are presented
to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration, if any, payable with respect to such shares as provided
for in _Section 1.5._ No interest shall accrue or be paid on any Merger
Consideration payable upon the surrender of a Company Stock Certificate or the
transfer of a Company Book Entry Share.

 

(e) _Lost Certificates_. In the event any Company Stock Certificate
representing shares of Outstanding Capital Stock shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the payment of any Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company
Capital Stock previously represented by such Company Stock Certificate,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate
to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such amount, in
such form and with such surety as Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against the Payment Agent, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any affiliated party with respect to such Company
Stock Certificate.

 

(f) _Undistributed_ _Payment Funds_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed as of the date that is 180 days after the date of this
Agreement shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and the Effective Time
Holders who have not provided a Letter of Transmittal in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 1.8_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of
their claims for the Merger Consideration payable with respect to the shares
of Company Capital Stock without any interest thereon.

 

(g) _Escheat_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither Parent nor any other Person shall be liable to any Effective Time
Holder or to any other Person for any amount paid to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar
applicable Legal Requirement. Any Merger Consideration or other amounts
remaining unclaimed three years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Body) shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of Parent free and
clear of any Encumbrance.

 

(h) _Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Company, Merger
Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement (including all
amounts to be contributed to the Escrow Fund and Expense Fund in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 1.5(c)_) such amounts as are required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom or in connection therewith under the Code or any provision
of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted
or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing authority, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 



17

    

1.9 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
or Parent with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and
property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of
Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

19

    

(b) _Stock Options and RSUs_.

 

(i) The Company has reserved 14,362,461 shares of Company Common Stock for

each Company Option that is outstanding as of the date of this Agreement: (A)
the name of the holder of such Company Option; (B) the total number of shares
of Company Common Stock that are or were subject to such Company Option; (C)
the date on which such Company Option was granted and the term of such Company
Option; (D) the vesting schedule and the vesting commencement date of such
Company Option (including the number of shares of Company Common Stock

action, including, as applicable, approval by the board of directors of the
Company (or a duly constituted and authorized committee thereof) and any
required stockholder approval, in each case, by the necessary number of votes
or written consents, and the award agreement governing such grant (if any)
was duly executed and delivered by each party thereto and is in full force and
effect, each such grant was made in all material respects in accordance with
(1) the terms of the Company Stock Plan and (2) all other applicable Legal
Requirements. All options with respect to shares of Company Common Stock that

thereof ceased to be an employee, consultant or director of an Acquired
Entity. The exercise of the Company Options and the payment of cash in respect
thereof complied and will comply with the terms of the Company Stock Plan, all
Contracts applicable to such Company Options and all Legal Requirements.

(ii) The Company has reserved 14,362,461 shares of Company Common Stock
for issuance under the Company Stock Plan of which restricted stock units
with respect to no shares of Company Common Stock are outstanding as of the

Company RSU is subject to any acceleration in connection with the Merger, any
termination of employment or separation from service, or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each grant of a Company RSU was
duly authorized no later than the date on which the grant of such Company RSU
was by its terms to be effective by all necessary corporate action,
including, as applicable, approval by the board of directors of the Company
(or a duly constituted and authorized committee thereof) and any required
stockholder approval, in each case, by the necessary number of votes or
written consents, and the award agreement governing such grant (if any) was
duly executed and delivered by each party thereto and is in full force and
effect, each such grant was made in all material respects in accordance with
the terms of the Company Stock Plan and in accordance with all other
applicable Legal Requirements. All Company RSUs with respect to shares of
Company Common Stock that were ever issued by the Company ceased to vest on
the date on which the holder thereof ceased to be an employee, consultant or
director of an Acquired Entity. The settlement of the Company RSUs and the
payment of cash in respect thereof complied and will comply with the terms of
the Company Stock Plan, all Contracts applicable to such Company RSUs and
all Legal Requirements.

 



20

    

(iii) As of the Effective Time, no former holder of a Company Option or
Company RSU will have any rights with respect to any Company Option or Company
RSU other than the rights contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 1.6_. The Company
has delivered to Parent an accurate and complete copy of the Company Stock
Plan, each form of agreement used thereunder and each Contract pursuant to
which any Company Option and Company RSU is outstanding. The terms of the
Company Stock Plan or the Contracts evidencing the Company Options and
Company RSUs authorize the treatment of the Company Options or Company RSUs
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 1.6_ without any required consent or approval
of the holders of such Company Options or Company RSUs, as applicable. There
are no options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock or restricted stock
units settleable for shares of Company Common Stock that were not granted
under the Company Stock Plan.

 

(c) _No Other Securities_. Except for the conversion privileges of the
Company Preferred Stock and except as set forth in _Parts_ __ _ 2.3(a)_ and
_2.3(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, there is no: (i) outstanding
subscription, option, call, convertible note, warrant or right (whether or not
currently exercisable) to acquire any shares of or interest in Company
Capital Stock or other securities of the Company or any derivative of any of
the foregoing; (ii) outstanding security, note, instrument or obligation

2.10(o)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, no Source Code for any Acquired Entity
Owned Software has been delivered, licensed or made available to any escrow
agent or other Person who is not an Acquired Entity Service Provider. Except
as described on _Part_ __ _ 2.10(o)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, none of the

Software or any Acquired Entity Product is derived; (B) the name, version or
versions of, and a link to the applicable license terms for, each such item of

any Acquired Entity grant a license under its Patent rights or that any
Acquired Entity Product or part thereof: (1) be disclosed or distributed in
Source Code form; (2) be licensed for the purpose of making modifications
or derivative works; or (3) be redistributable at no charge; or (B) other

data protection or data security with respect to User Data or Personal Data.
None of the Acquired Entities has pending, current, or prior letters,
complaints, subpoenas, court orders, consent decrees,
citations, administrative actions, notifications or other claims from a
state, federal, national or multi-national governmental entity, or another

any of the Acquired Entity Databases or Acquired Entity Data in
the possession of, or on behalf of, an Acquired Entity. All known material
vulnerabilities of each Acquired Entity identified through internal audits,

authorization the Acquired Entity IT Systems, Acquired Entity Databases or
Acquired Entity Data, or (B) otherwise materially adversely affect the
functionality of the Acquired Entity IT Systems. None of the

disruption to, or material interruption in, the conduct of business
attributable to a defect, bug, breakdown or other failure or deficiency of the

remedied in the ordinary course of business. Each Acquired Entity has taken
commercially reasonable measures to provide for the back-up and recovery of
the Acquired Entity Data in the possession of, or on behalf of, an Acquired

material interruption in, the conduct of the business of such Acquired
Entity. None of the Acquired Entities is in breach of any Contract related to

program, Contract or arrangement that is subject to Section 412 of the Code,
Section 302 of ERISA or Title IV of ERISA; (iv) any multiple employer welfare
arrangement as defined under Section 3(40)(A) of ERISA; (v) any self-
insured plan (including any such plan pursuant to which a stop loss policy or
Contract applies); or (vi) any plan maintained or sponsored by a professional
employer organization. No Acquired Entity Employee Plan provides, or is
obligated to provide, welfare benefits to any person who is not a current or
former employee of an Acquired Entity (or dependent thereof). No Acquired
Entity has terminated an employee benefit plan for which any Acquired Entity
would reasonably be expected to have any existing or continuing liability or
obligation (contingent or otherwise) relating thereto.

(i) _No Defaults_. Each Acquired Entity has performed in all material
respects all obligations required to be performed by it under each Acquired
Entity Employee Plan and is not in default or violation of, and none of the
Acquired Entities has Knowledge of any default or violation by any other
party to, the terms of any Acquired Entity Employee Plan. Each of the Acquired
Entity Employee Plans (and each related trust, insurance contract or fund) has
been operated and administered in accordance with its terms and all
applicable Legal Requirements, including the applicable requirements under the
Code, ERISA, and the ACA, in each case in all material respects. All required
contributions to, and payments from or in connection with, any
Acquired Entity Employee Plan have been timely made in accordance with the
terms of such Acquired Entity Employee Plan, applicable Contracts and
applicable Legal Requirements, in each case in all material respects, and all
contributions for any period ending on or before the Closing Date which are
not yet due are reflected as an accrued Liability on the Unaudited Interim
Balance Sheet. No "prohibited transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975
of the Code or Section 406 and 407 of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt under
Section 408 of ERISA, has occurred in connection with which any Acquired
Entity would reasonably be expected to have any material liability (including
on account of an indemnification obligation). No Acquired Entity has any
material liability (including material liability on account of an
indemnification obligation or an ERISA Affiliate) with respect to or under
Section 502(i) of ERISA or Chapter 43 of the Code or on account of a
violation of Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, and to the Knowledge
of the Company, nothing has occurred that would reasonably be expected to
subject any Acquired Entity to such liability. Each Acquired Entity Employee
Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the date of
this Agreement, without Liability to any Acquired Entity or Parent (other than
ordinary and reasonable administrative expenses typically incurred in a
termination event).

 

(j) _No Conflict_. Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement, nor the consummation of the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will or may (either alone or upon
the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events): (i) constitute an
event under any Acquired Entity Employee Plan, trust or loan that will or may
result (either alone or in connection with any other circumstance or event) in
any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness
of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to
fund benefits (through a grantor trust or otherwise) with respect to any
Acquired Entity Service Provider; or (ii) create or otherwise result in any
Liability with respect to any Acquired Entity Employee Plan (except to conform
any such Acquired Entity Employee Plan to the requirements of any applicable
Legal Requirements or as required by this Agreement).

 



47

    

(k) _Compliance_. Each Acquired Entity: (i) is, and at all times has
been, in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements, Contracts and
Orders respecting employment, hiring practices, employment practices, terms
and conditions of employment, wages, hours or other labor-related
matters, including Legal Requirements and Orders relating to discrimination,
wages and hours, overtime, reimbursements, labor relations, leaves of absence
including sick leave laws, work breaks, classification of employees (including
exempt and independent contractor status), occupational health and safety,
privacy, harassment, discrimination, retaliation, disability rights and
benefits, reasonable accommodation, equal employment, fair employment
practices, immigration, wrongful discharge or violation of the personal
rights of Acquired Entity Service Providers (or prospective employees or other
service providers), including, but not limited to, the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act (and any similar foreign, provincial, state
or local statute or regulation) (collectively " _WARN Act_ "), in each case
in all material respects; (ii) has not effectuated a "plant closing,"
"termination," "relocation," or "mass layoff" as those terms are used in the
WARN Act and similar laws nor has or will, prior to the Effective Time, any
Acquired Entity become subject to any obligation under applicable Legal
Requirements or otherwise to notify or consult with any Acquired
Entity Service Provider, Governmental Body or other Person with respect to
the impact of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the
employment of any of the Acquired Entity Service Provider or the compensation
or benefits provided to any of the Acquired Entity Service Providers; (iii)
has properly accrued in the ordinary course of business and is not delinquent
in payments to any of its current or former Acquired Entity Service Provider
for any wages, overtime, salaries, commissions, bonuses, fees or other
compensation for any services performed, directly or indirectly, for any
Acquired Entity as of the date of this Agreement or amounts required to be
reimbursed to such current or former Acquired Entity Service Provider and
has no Liability for any arrears of wages, salaries, overtime pay, premium
pay, commissions, bonuses, benefits, severance pay or other amounts due to any
Acquired Entity Service Provider, including pursuant to any Contract, policy,
practice or applicable Legal Requirement, or any Taxes or any penalty for
failure to comply with any of the foregoing, in each case in all material
respects; (iv) has no material Liability for any payment to any trust or other
fund governed by or maintained by or on behalf of any Governmental Body with
respect to unemployment compensation benefits, workers compensation, social
security or other benefits or obligations for any Acquired Entity Service
Provider (other than routine payments to be made in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice); and (v) to the Knowledge of the
Company, none of the Acquired Entitys policies or practices with respect to
Acquired Entity Service Providers is currently being audited or investigated
by any Governmental Body. Each Acquired Entity Employee Plan intended to be
"qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified
and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no circumstances exist: (A) which would
reasonably be expected to result in loss of such qualification under Section
401(a) of the Code; or; or (B) which would reasonably be expected to result in
a penalty under the Internal Revenue Service Closing Agreement Program if
discovered during an Internal Revenue Service audit or investigation. Each
such Acquired Entity Employee Plan has received a favorable determination,
opinion or advisory letter from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to
such qualification and the Tax-exempt status of its related trust, and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, no circumstances exist which would reasonably be
expected to result in Liability to any Acquired Entity in respect of such
qualified status. No Acquired Entity Employee Plan is intended to meet the
requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. No fiduciary (within the
meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) of any Acquired Entity Employee Plan
subject to Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA has committed a breach of
fiduciary duty with respect to that Acquired Entity Employee Plan that would
reasonably be expected to subject any Acquired Entity or an Acquired
Entity Service Provider to any material Liability (including material
Liability on account of an indemnification obligation). None of the Acquired
Entities has incurred any excise Taxes under Chapter 43 of the Code with
respect to any Acquired Entity Employee Plan and nothing has occurred with
respect to any Acquired Entity Employee Plan that would reasonably be expected
to subject any Acquired Entity to any such Taxes. None of the Acquired
Entities, nor any ERISA Affiliate of any Acquired Entity, has any material
liability of any kind whatsoever, whether known or unknown, direct, indirect,
contingent or otherwise: (x) on account of any violation of the health care
requirements of Part 6 or 7 of Title I of ERISA or Section 4980B or 4980D of
the Code; or (y) under Section 502(i) or 502(l) of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code.

 



48

    

(l) _Labor Relations and Claims_. Each Acquired Entity has good labor
relations, and the Company has no Knowledge of any facts indicating that the
consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will have a material adverse effect on the labor relations of
any Acquired Entity. Since January 1, 2016, there has been no Legal
Proceeding, claim, investigation, labor dispute or grievance pending or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened or reasonably anticipated relating to
any employee, employment Contract, or any other employment or labor matter
including but not limited to those related to compensation, wages and hours,
misclassification, leave of absence, office or plant closing notification,
employment statute or regulation (including human rights and pay equity),
records and files, privacy right, labor dispute, workers compensation policy
or long term disability policy or similar policy subject to foreign Legal
Requirements, occupational health and safety, retaliation, immigration,
harassment, or discrimination matter involving any Acquired Entity Service
Provider, including charges of unfair labor practices, retaliation, or
harassment complaints. Each Acquired Entity is not and, since January 1, 2016,
has not been, subject to any Order or private settlement contract in respect
of any labor or employment matters. Each Acquired Entity is, and at all times
has been, in compliance with the requirements of the Immigration Reform
Control Act of 1986. Every employee who requires permission and/or
authorization to work in the jurisdiction in which they carry out their
employment had at the time of hire current and appropriate permission and/or
authorization to work in that jurisdiction. Except as set forth in _Part_ __
_ 2.15(l)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, there are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened or reasonably anticipated claims,
investigations or Legal Proceedings against the Acquired Entities under any
workers compensation policy or long-term disability policy.

(m) _Claims Against Plans_. There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened or reasonably anticipated claims, investigations or
Legal Proceedings against any of the Acquired Entity Employee Plans, the
assets of any of the Acquired Entity Employee Plans, or the Acquired Entity
Employee Plan administrator or any fiduciary of the Acquired Entity Employee
Plans with respect to the operation of such Acquired Entity Employee Plans
(other than routine, uncontested benefit claims) or asserting any rights or
claims to benefits under such Acquired Entity Employee Plan.

(n) _No Misclassification_. Every Acquired Entity Service Provider,
whether an exempt or non-exempt employee or non-employee contractor, is
properly characterized for all purposes including but not limited to Taxes
and Tax reporting, the Fair Labor Standards Act, applicable Legal Requirements
governing the payment of wages (including overtime), unemployment insurance
and workers compensation obligations, and for purposes of all Acquired
Entitys plans and perquisites. No Acquired Entity has any Liability for any
misclassification of an Acquired Entity Service Provider, including of any
employee as an independent contractor, any independent contractor as an
employee or any non-exempt employee as an exempt employee. No independent
contractor is eligible to participate in any Acquired Entity Employee Plan.

 

2.16 Environmental Matters. Each of the Acquired Entities has at all times
been and is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
Environmental Laws, which compliance includes the possession by each
respective Acquired Entity of all Environmental Licenses and other
Governmental Authorizations required under applicable Environmental Laws, and
compliance with the terms and conditions thereof. Since January 1, 2016, none
of the Acquired Entities has received any written (or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, other) notice from any Person that alleges that any Acquired Entity
is not in compliance with any Environmental Law. None of the Acquired
Entities has caused or contributed to any Environmental Release. No
Contaminants are stored or contained on or under any of the Properties whether
in storage tanks, landfills, pits, ponds, lagoons or otherwise. All
Environmental Licenses and other Governmental Authorizations currently held by
any Acquired Entity pursuant to Environmental Laws are identified in _Part_ __
_ 2.16_ of the Disclosure Schedule. The Company has made available to Parent
accurate and complete copies of all internal and external environmental audits
and studies in its possession or control, if any, relating to each Acquired
Entity or its operations and all correspondence on substantial environmental
matters relating to any Acquired Entity or its operations.

applicable, provided that such terminations may be made contingent upon the
Closing. In the event that the distributions of assets from the trust of a

liquidation charges, surrender charges, or other fees to be imposed upon the
account of any participant or beneficiary of such terminated plan or upon any
Company or plan sponsor, then the Company shall take such actions as are

director or manager to be replaced, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent (it being understood that such resignations shall not
constitute a termination of employment by such officer, director or manager).

Charter Documents and pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the
applicable Acquired Entity and such DandO Indemnified Parties, in each case, in

could be deemed to constitute "parachute payments" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder ("
_Section_ __ _ 280G_")) a waiver of such individuals rights to retain or
receive some or all of such payments and/or benefits (such waived payments
and/or benefits, the " _Waived _ _Section_ __ _ 280G_ _Payments_ ")

payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code); and (ii) at

benefits will not be limited by the application of Section 280G and the excise
tax under Section 4999 of the Code will not apply to such payments and/or
benefits (such request for stockholder approval, the " _280G Vote_ "). Prior
to the Closing, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Parent that either: (x) the requisite Company stockholder
approval was obtained with respect to the Waived Section 280G Payments; or (y)
the Company stockholder approval of the Waived Section 280G Payments was not
obtained and that, as a consequence, such Waived Section 280G Payments shall
not be made or provided. The Company shall provide to Parent for its review
and approval, at least three days prior to securing the waivers required by
clause "(i)" hereof, copies of all documents prepared by the Company in
connection with this _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_, including the form of waiver

enforce and shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives not
to) terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision in any agreement between
or among the Company, on the one hand, and any of the holders of Company
Capital Stock, on the other hand, that requires such holders to cooperate with
the Company in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including by requiring such holders to execute
a Letter of Transmittal. In furtherance and not limitation of the foregoing,
the Company will enforce any Acquired Entity Contract prohibiting or
restricting a holder of Company Capital Stock from raising any objection to
the Merger or exercising any dissenters rights, appraisal rights or similar
rights in connection with the Merger.

(7) cause the management of the Company, in each case, with appropriate
seniority and expertise, to participate, upon reasonable advance notice, in a

Agreement to the contrary: (i) neither the Company nor any of its personnel
or advisors shall be required to take any action pursuant to _Section_ __ _
5.5(a)_ which would unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the
Company; and (ii) the Company shall not be required by _Section_ __ _
5.5(a)_ to provide any financial or other information that is not readily
available to the Company and shall not be required to provide or prepare
projections or other forward-looking information (it being understood and
agreed that the Company shall provide any historical information that is
readily available to the Company and reasonably requested by Parent that is
necessary for Parent to prepare any projections or similar forward-looking
information). This _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ shall not require the Company or any
of its Affiliates to agree to any contractual obligation relating to the
Financing (other than in respect of any authorization letters) that is not
expressly conditioned upon the consummation of the Closing and that does not
terminate without liability to the Company upon the termination of this
Agreement.

 



65

    

(d) _Indemnity_. Parent shall: (i) indemnify the Acquired Entities and
their respective Representatives from and against any loss, damages, claim,
liability, obligation or reasonable cost or expense suffered or incurred in

(without requirement to segregate funds therefor) a plan for a retention pool
consisting of an amount, as set forth in Section 5.6 of _Schedule A,_ in cash,
or new restricted stock unit awards in Parent (priced at time of grant), or a
combination thereof (the " _Retention Pool_ "). The Retention Pool will be
allocated to certain Continuing Service Providers as determined by Parent
following consultation with the Companys Chief Executive Officer. Parent
acknowledges and agrees that such allocations with respect to Key Employees
have been determined prior to the date hereof and are set forth on _Schedule_
___5.6_ hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall bear the cost of the
Retention Pool and the Retention Pool shall not be deemed a part of or
otherwise reduce the Merger Consideration.

5.7 Compensation and Benefits.

 

(a) For a period of 12 months following the Effective Time, Parent will

who continues to be employed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation with: (i)
a base salary or wage, and target cash bonus and/or commission opportunity, as
applicable, that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the combined
base salary or wage, and target cash bonus and/or commission opportunity
provided to such Continuing Service Provider as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time; and (ii) severance entitlement that is no less favorable in
the aggregate than that provided to such Continuing Service Provider pursuant
to a written Acquired Entity Employee Plan in effect as of the date of this
Agreement as disclosed in _Part 2.15(e)_ of the Disclosure Schedule or
the Severance Payments under the Employee Retention Agreements to be entered
into between the date of this Agreement and the Closing as disclosed in _Part
4.2(5)_ of the Disclosure Schedule (it being understood that any such
Continuing Service Provider who is entitled to severance under any such
Acquired Entity Employee Plan shall not also be entitled to severance under
any other applicable policy or plan of Parent or any of its Affiliates). 

 



66

    

(b) From and after the Effective Time, and to the extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements, Parent shall, or shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Surviving Corporation to, recognize the prior
service with the Acquired Entity of each Continuing Service Provider in
connection with all employee benefit plans, programs or policies (including
severance, to the extent such Continuing Service Provider is not already
entitled to severance pursuant to clause "(ii)" of _Section_ __ _ 5.7(a)_) of
Parent or its Affiliates in which Continuing Service Providers are eligible
to participate following the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility and
vesting and determination of level of benefits, to the same extent as such
service was taken into account under corresponding plans of the Acquired
Entity for such purposes (except that such prior service credit shall not be
provided: (i) with respect to accrued benefits under any defined benefit
pension plan, sabbatical program or anniversary award program; (ii) to the
extent that it results in a duplication of benefits; or (iii) with respect to
the vesting of awards under Parents or its applicable Subsidiaries equity or
other incentive compensation plans, if any). From and after the Effective
Time, Parent shall, or shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Surviving Corporation to: (A) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations
and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of Parent or its
affiliates to be waived with respect to Continuing Service Providers and their
eligible dependents; and (B) to the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements and the insured benefits carrier, provide each Continuing
Service Provider with credit for any eligible expenses incurred that were
credited to deductible and maximum out-of-pocket co-insurance requirements
under any Acquired Entity Employee Plan that provides medical, dental or
vision benefits in the plan year in effect as of the Closing Date in
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any
corresponding medical, dental or vision plans of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation. __

 

(c) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ are not intended to confer
upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, including any right to continued employment or any right under any
Acquired Entity Employee Plan and the parties hereby expressly disclaim the
creation or establishment of any third party beneficiary rights (whether
express or implied) under or by right of the terms of this _Section_ __ _
5.7_. Nothing herein shall be deemed to amend any plan or arrangement to
reflect the terms of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.7_, nor shall it be deemed to
prohibit the amendment or termination of any plan or arrangement.

TAX MATTERS 

---|---|--- 
 

6.1 Liability for Taxes

 

(a) _Indemnification_. From and after the Effective Time, each Effective
Time Holder shall, severally and not jointly, hold harmless and indemnify
each of the Parent Indemnitees from and against, and shall compensate and
reimburse each of the Parent Indemnitees for, such Effective Time Holders
Applicable Pro Rata Share of any Damages that are suffered or incurred at any
time by any of the Parent Indemnitees or to which any of the Parent
Indemnitees may otherwise become subject at any time (regardless of whether or
not such Damages relate to any third-party claim) and that arise from or as a
result of: (i) any Taxes imposed on any Acquired Entity, or for which any
Acquired Entity may otherwise be liable, as a result of having been a member
of an Affiliated Group or by reason of any Tax allocation, Tax indemnity or
Tax sharing agreement (other than an agreement that is included in a Contract
entered into in the ordinary course of business that is not primarily related
to Taxes) entered into, at any time prior to the Closing Date (including Taxes
for which any Acquired Entity may be liable pursuant to United States
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or similar provisions of state, local or
foreign law as a result of having been a member of an Affiliated Group and
any Taxes resulting from any Acquired Entity ceasing to be a member of any
Affiliated Group); (ii) any Transfer Taxes described in _Section 6.1(b);_ and
(iii) any Taxes imposed on any Acquired Entity, or for which any Acquired
Entity may otherwise be liable, for any taxable year or period that ends on
or before the Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the
portion of such Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date
(including any liability for any "net tax liability" (as described in Section
965(h)(6) of the Code)). For purposes of this _Section 6.1(a),_ whenever it
is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of any Acquired Entity for a
Straddle Period, the determination of the Taxes of such Acquired Entity for
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date
shall be determined by assuming: (i) in the case of Taxes that are either
based upon or related to income or receipts or imposed in connection with any
sale of property, that the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable years or
periods, one which ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other which
began at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date, and items of
income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of such Acquired Entity for the
Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two taxable years or periods
on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of such Acquired
Entity were closed at the close of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that exemptions, allowances, deductions or Taxes that are calculated on an
annual basis, such as property Taxes and depreciation deductions, shall
be apportioned between such two taxable years or periods on a daily basis;
and _provided further_ , that any deductions attributable to the payment of
any Company Option or Company RSU made after the Closing Date shall be
allocated to the period after the Closing Date unless Parent determines
otherwise; and (ii) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis
with respect to the assets or capital of any of any Acquired Entity, deemed to
be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion
of the period ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of calendar days in the entire period. Whenever it is
necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of an Acquired Entity that is a
"United States shareholder" (within the meaning of Section 951(b) of the Code)
of a "controlled foreign corporation" (within the meaning of Section 957 of
the Code), amounts, if any, included in the income of such Acquired Entity
under Section 951 of the Code with respect to any Straddle Period of such
controlled foreign corporation shall be allocated between such two taxable
years or periods of such Acquired Entity by assuming that, for purposes of
Section 951 of the Code, the Straddle Period of the controlled foreign
corporation consisted of two taxable years or periods, one of which ended at
the close of the Closing Date and the other of which began at the beginning of
the day following the Closing Date and taking into account any net operating
losses or similar Tax Attributes of the Acquired Entities that would have been
available to offset the inclusion under Section 951 of the Code had such
amount been included in gross income by the Acquired Entity that is the United
States shareholder during the portion of the Straddle Period ending prior to
the Closing Date;  _provided_ , _however_ , that "subpart F income" (within
the meaning of Section 952 of the Code) of the controlled foreign corporation
shall be determined without regard to Section 952(c) of the Code. Parent shall
be entitled to any refund of, or credit with respect to, Taxes (including any
interest related thereto) that results from the carryback of losses, credits
or similar items from a taxable year or period that begins after the Closing
Date and is attributable to any Acquired Entity. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall be required to first seek
recovery from the Escrow Fund for any amounts indemnified under this _Section_
__ _ 6.1(a)_ before seeking recourse from the Effective Time Holders
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.3(d)_.

 

(b) _Transfer Taxes_. Each Effective Time Holder shall, severally and not
jointly, hold harmless and indemnify each of the Parent Indemnitees from and
against, and shall compensate and reimburse each of the Parent Indemnitees
for, such Effective Time Holders Excess Pro Rata Share of any Damages that
are suffered or incurred at any time by any of the Parent Indemnitees or to
which any of the Parent Indemnitees may otherwise become subject to at any
time (regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to any third-party
claim) and that arise from, or as a result of, or are connected with any real
property transfer or gains, transfer, documentary, sales, use, excise, stock
transfer, value-added, stamp, recording, registration and other similar Taxes,
and any conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges
(including any penalties and interest) (such amounts, the " _Transfer Taxes_
") imposed on the exchange of Company Capital Stock in the Merger.

 



68

    

6.2 Tax Returns.

 

(a) With respect to Tax Returns required to be filed by, on behalf of, or
with respect to, an Acquired Entity, the Company shall timely file or cause
to be timely filed when due (taking into account all extensions properly
obtained) all such Tax Returns that are required to be filed on, or prior to,
the Closing Date, and the Company shall remit or cause to be remitted any
Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns; _provided_ , _however_ , the Company
shall not elect, and shall not permit any Person to elect, pursuant to Section
965(h) of the Code, to pay any "net tax liability" (as described in Section
965(h)(6) of the Code) of any Acquired Entity, if any, in installments. Parent
shall file, or cause to be filed, when due (taking into account all extensions
properly obtained) all other Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or
with respect to an Acquired Entity; _provided_ , that to the extent such Tax
Returns relate to a tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the
Closing Date and would result in a liability of the Effective Time
Holders pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.1_, Parent shall provide such Tax
Returns to the Securityholders Agent for review no less than 30 days prior to
the due date (including extensions) for timely filing of such Tax Returns, or
if the due date is within 30 days of the Closing Date, as promptly as
practical after the Closing Date, and shall consider in good faith the
Securityholders Agents comments.

 

Except as otherwise required by applicable Tax law, all Tax Returns that an
Acquired Entity is required to file or cause to be filed in accordance with
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_ (whether before or after the Closing Date)
shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with the past practice of
such Acquired Entity and, on such Tax Returns, no position shall be taken,
election made or method adopted that is inconsistent with positions taken,
elections made or methods used in preparing and filing similar Tax Returns in
prior periods (including positions, elections or methods that would have the
effect of deferring gain or income to periods ending after the Closing Date
or accelerating credits or deductions to periods ending on or before the
Closing Date).

 

6.3 Assistance and Cooperation. After the Closing Date, each of
Securityholders Agent and Parent shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to):

(a) timely sign and deliver such certificates or forms as may be necessary
or appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce), or file
Tax Returns or other reports with respect to, Taxes described in _Section_ __
_ 6.1(b)_ (relating to Transfer Taxes);

 

(b) reasonably assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which
such other party is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_ and in connection therewith, and provide the other party
with any necessary powers of attorney;

 

(c) cooperate fully in preparing for and defending any audits of, or
disputes with taxing authorities regarding, any Tax of any Acquired Entity;

(d) make available to the other party and to any taxing authority as
reasonably requested all information, records and documents relating to Taxes
of any Acquired Entity, _provided, however_ , that nothing in this Agreement
shall require Parent to share any information related to its consolidated
Tax Returns; and

(e) furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence received from
any taxing authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request
_provided_ , that Parent shall only be obliged to furnish copies of such
correspondence to Securityholders Agent to the extent such audit or
information request relates to Taxes for which the Effective Time Holders may
be liable under the terms of this Agreement.

 

6.4 Termination of Tax Allocation Arrangements. Any Tax allocation, Tax
indemnity or Tax sharing agreement between an Acquired Entity (other than an
agreement that is included in a Contract entered into in the ordinary course
of business that is not primarily related to Taxes), on the one hand, and any
Person (other than another Acquired Entity), on the other hand, shall be
terminated as to the applicable Acquired Entity on or prior to the Closing,
and after the Closing no Acquired Entity shall have any liability thereunder.

 



69

    

6.5 Survival, Etc. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement (including _Section_ __ _ 10_), the obligations of the parties set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6_ shall survive the Effective Time until the
date that is 60 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (including any extensions thereof); _provided, however_ , that if,
at any time on or prior to the expiration date referred to in this sentence,
any Parent Indemnitee delivers to the Securityholders Agent a valid written
notice delivered in accordance with the terms set forth in _Section_ __ _ 10_
alleging the existence of a breach of any obligation set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 6_ and asserting a claim for recovery under this _Section_ __
_ 6_ based on such alleged breach, then the claim asserted in such notice
shall survive until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. No
claim made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6_ shall be subject to the
limitations in _Section 10.3,_ except that the final sentence of _Section_ __
_ 10.3(d)_ shall apply. Subject to the immediately preceding sentence,
any claim for indemnification under this _Section_ __ _ 6_ shall be subject
to the other provisions of _Section_ __ _ 10_ (including the claim procedures
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 10.5_ and  _Section_ __ _ 10.6_) in the same
manner as a claim for indemnification arising under _Section_ __ _
10.2(a)(iv)_, and any audit or other dispute with a Taxing authority regarding
any Tax of an Acquired Entity for which Parent could be entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement, shall be treated as a third party claim
subject to the provisions of _Section 10.6._ To the extent of any conflict
between this _Section_ __ _ 6_ and  _Section_ __ _ 10_ (as it relates to
Taxes), this _Section_ __ _ 6_ shall control.

until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including any
extensions thereof (as such statute of limitations pertains to the subject
matter of such representations or warranties)); _provided_ , _however_ , that
if, at any time on or prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations referred to in this sentence, any Parent Indemnitee delivers to
the Securityholders Agent a valid written notice, delivered in accordance
with the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 10_ alleging the existence of an
inaccuracy in or a breach of any such Fundamental Representation and asserting
a claim for recovery under _Section_ __ _ 10.2_ based on such alleged
inaccuracy or breach, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive
the applicable expiration date until such time as such claim is fully and

Parent and Merger Sub shall terminate and expire as of the Effective Time,

the bargain contemplated by this Agreement; and such representations,
warranties, covenants and obligations, and the rights and remedies that may be
exercised by the Parent Indemnitees with respect thereto, shall not be
waived, limited or otherwise affected by or as a result of (and the Parent
Indemnitees shall be deemed to have relied upon such representations,
warranties, covenants or obligations notwithstanding) any knowledge on the
part of any of the Parent Indemnitees (regardless of whether obtained through
any investigation by any Parent Indemnitee or through disclosure by the
Company or any other Person, and regardless of whether such knowledge was
obtained before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement) or by
reason of the fact that a Parent Indemnitee knew or should have known that any
representation or warranty is or might be inaccurate or untrue.

 

10.2 Indemnification.

 

(a) _Indemnification_. From and after the Effective Time (but subject to 
_Section_ __ _ 10.1_), each Effective Time Holder shall, severally (in
accordance with their respective Applicable Pro Rata Share) and not jointly,
hold harmless and indemnify each of the Parent Indemnitees from and against,
and shall compensate and reimburse each of the Parent Indemnitees for, such
Effective Time Holders Applicable Pro Rata Share, as applicable, of any
Damages that are suffered or incurred at any time by any of the Parent
Indemnitees or to which any of the Parent Indemnitees may otherwise become
subject at any time (regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to any
third party claim) and that arise from or as a result of:

 

(i) regardless of any update of or modification to the Disclosure Schedule
made or purported to have been made on or after the date of this Agreement,
any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Company in this Agreement as of the date of this Agreement (without giving
effect to any materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifications limiting
the scope of such representation or warranty (other than, for purposes of
determining whether an inaccuracy or breach exists, in the case of any lists
required by the Material Listing Representations);

 



75

    

(ii) regardless of any update of or modification to the Disclosure
Schedule made or purported to have been made on or after the date of this
Agreement, any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made
by the Company: (A) in this Agreement as if such representation or warranty
was made on and as of the Closing; or (B) in the Company Closing Certificate
(in each case of clauses "(A)" and "(B)", without giving effect to any
materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifications limiting the scope of
such representation or warranty (other than, for purposes of determining
whether an inaccuracy or breach exists, in the case of any lists required by
the Material Listing Representations);

 

(iii) regardless of the disclosure of any matter set forth in the
Disclosure Schedule, any inaccuracy in any information, or breach of any
representation or warranty, set forth in the Merger Consideration Certificate,
including any failure to properly calculate the Company Transaction Expenses,
the Purchase Price, the Aggregate Exercise Price, and the Per Share Amount;

(iv) any breach of any covenant or obligation of the Company in this
Agreement required to be performed prior to the Effective Time (including any
such covenant described in _Section_ __ _ 6_), or any breach of any covenant
or obligation of any Effective Time Holder or the Securityholders Agent in
this Agreement required to be performed at or after the Effective Time
(including any covenant described in _Section_ __ _ 6_);

 

(v) any matter referred to in _Part_ _10.2_ of the Disclosure Schedule;

 

(vi) the exercise by any stockholder of the Company of such stockholders
appraisal rights under the DGCL or the CGCL, including all costs and expenses
incurred by the Company or Parent in connection with any Legal Proceeding or
settlement in connection therewith (it being understood that if a final
determination of the fair value of any Dissenting Shares is made by a court
of competent jurisdiction in connection with any such exercise of appraisal
rights, then the only portion of such fair value to be included in calculation
of the Damages incurred as a result of such exercise is the amount, if any,
by which such fair value exceeds what otherwise would have been payable by
Parent with respect to such Dissenting Shares in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 1.5_ hereof had they not been Dissenting Shares);

 

(vii) any Fraud on the part of the Company or any Representative acting on
behalf of the Company, in each case in connection with this Agreement or the
Merger; and

(viii) any claim or Legal Proceeding by a third party to the extent that,
assuming the facts underlying such claim or Legal Proceeding were true, such
facts would constitute a breach of a representation or warranty in this
Agreement or give rise to indemnification under any of clauses "(i)" through
"(vii)" above, inclusive; _provided_ that any Damages under this clause
"(viii)" shall only constitute Damages indemnifiable hereunder to the extent
that they consist of: (A) reasonable, out of pocket fees, costs and expenses
of defending any such claim or Legal Proceeding; or (B) settlements,
adjustments or compromises of any such claim or Legal Proceeding that are
effected with the consent of the Securityholders Agent, or as to which the

76

    

(b) _Damage_ _to_ _Parent_. The parties acknowledge and agree that, if
the Surviving Corporation or any of the Acquired Entities suffers, incurs or
otherwise becomes subject to any Damages as a result of or in connection with
any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation, then (without limiting any of the rights of the Surviving
Corporation or any of the Acquired Entities as a Parent Indemnitee) Parent
shall also be deemed, by virtue of its ownership of the stock of the Surviving
Corporation or any Acquired Entity, to have incurred Damages as a result of
and in connection with such inaccuracy or breach.

 

10.3 Limitations.

 

(a) _Basket_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 10.3(b)_, the Effective Time
Holders shall not be required to make any indemnification payment pursuant to
(x) _ Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)(ii)_ for any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty in this Agreement;
or (y) _Section 10.2(a)(viii)_ (to the extent related to _Section_ __ _
10.2(a)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)(ii)_) until such time as: (i) the
amount of Damages that have been suffered or incurred by any one or more of
the Parent Indemnitees, or to which any one or more of the Parent Indemnitees
has or have otherwise become subject, with respect to an individual claim
exceeds the amount set forth in Section 10.3(a)(i) of _Schedule A_ (it being
agreed and understood that all Damages, whether in a single claim or in a
group of related claims, relating to a particular fact, event, circumstance or
occurrence (or a series of related facts, events, circumstances or
occurrences, or facts, events, circumstances or occurrences having the same
underlying, non-generic factual or legal basis) shall be aggregated for this
purpose); and (ii) the total amount of all Damages (including the
Damages arising from such inaccuracy or breach and all other Damages arising
from any other inaccuracies or breaches of any representations or warranties)
that have been suffered or incurred by any one or more of the Parent
Indemnitees, or to which any one or more of the Parent Indemnitees has or
have otherwise become subject, exceeds the amount set forth in Section
10.3(a)(ii) of _Schedule A_ in the aggregate (the " _Basket Amount_ "). If the
total amount of such Damages exceeds the Basket Amount, then the Parent
Indemnitees shall be entitled to be indemnified against and compensated and
reimbursed for the entire amount of such Damages, subject to clause "(i)" of
the preceding sentence, and not merely the portion of such Damages exceeding
the Basket Amount.

(b) _Applicability of Basket_. The limitations set forth in _Section_ __
_ 10.3(a)_ shall not apply (and shall not limit the indemnification or other
obligations of any Effective Time Holder): (i) in the event of Fraud (whether
on the part of any Effective Time Holder, on the part of the Company or any
Representative acting on behalf of the Company); (ii) to inaccuracies in or
breaches of any of the Fundamental Representations; (iii) to any of the
matters referred to in _Sections_ _10.2(a)(iii)_  through _Section_ __ _
10.2(a)(vii)_, inclusive; or (iv) to the matters referred to in _Section_ __ _
10.2(a)(viii)_ (to the extent related to any of the matters referred to in
clauses "(i)" through "(iii)" of this sentence).

(c) _Recourse to_ _Escrow Fund_. Subject to _Section 10.3(d),_ recourse
by the Parent Indemnitees to the Escrow Fund shall be the Parent Indemnitees
sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement for monetary Damages resulting
from the matters referred to in _Sections 10.2(a)(i),_   _10.2(a)(ii)_ ,
_10.2(a)(v)_ and _10.2(a)(viii)_.

 



77

    

(d) _Applicability of_ _Escrow Amount_ _Cap_. The limitation set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 10.3(c)_ shall not apply to any Effective Time Holder (and
shall not limit the indemnification or other obligations of such Effective
Time Holder): (i) in the event of Damages resulting from Fraud (whether on
the part of any Effective Time Holder, on the part of any Acquired Entity or
any Representative acting on behalf of any Acquired Entity); (ii) to
inaccuracies in or breaches of any of the Fundamental Representations; or
(iii) to any of the matters referred to in _Section 10.2(a)(iii),_ _Section
10.2(a)(iv),_ _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)(vi)_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)(vii)_;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that any amounts recovered by the Parent
Indemnitees from the Escrow Fund pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)(i)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)(ii)_ with respect to breaches of the
Fundamental Representations, or pursuant to any of the matters referred to in
_Section 10.2(a)(iii)_ , _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)(iv)_, _Section_ __ _
10.2(a)(vi)_ or _Section 10.2(a)(vii),_ shall not count towards or reduce
the amount that the Parent Indemnitees may recover with respect to claims for
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement pursuant to _Section
10.2(a)(i),_ _Section 10.2(a)(ii),_ _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)(v)_ or  _Section_
__ _ 10.2(a)(viii)_ (it being understood that, in the case of such recovery
from the Escrow Fund, the Parent Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover
directly against the Effective Time Holders up to the amount of such recovery
from the Escrow Fund). To the extent that the Parent Indemnitees are entitled
to recovery under _Section_ __ _ 6_ or this _Section_ __ _ 10_ in excess of
the Escrow Fund, the Parent Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover
amounts directly from the Effective Time Holders under this _Section_ __ _
10_ in respect of the indemnification obligations of the Effective Time
Holders until such time as the Escrow Fund has been fully exhausted or the
amounts contained therein are otherwise allocated to cover existing,
unresolved indemnification, compensation or reimbursement claims that have
been set forth in Claim Notices delivered pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 10.5_.
Subject to _Section 11.3,_ the total amount of indemnification payments that
each Effective Time Holder (other than with respect to any Fraud on the part
of such Effective Time Holder) can be required to make to the Parent
Indemnitees pursuant to _Sections 6_ and _10.2_ (in excess of the amount, if
any, that was withheld from such Effective Time Holder as a contribution to
the Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms of  _Section_ __ _ 1.5(c)_, and paid
to Parent or any other Parent Indemnitee out of the Escrow Fund) shall be
limited to the portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration paid (other than
with respect to any amounts subject to a Holdback Agreement, which shall only
be taken into consideration to the extent actually paid) or payable to such
Effective Time Holder pursuant to _Sections_ __ _ 1.5_ and _1.6_ (without
regard to any Taxes deducted or to be deducted).

(e) _Insurance and Third-Party Payments_. For purposes of computing the
amount of any Damages payable to the Parent Indemnitees under _Section_ __ _
6_ or this _Section 10,_ such Damages shall be reduced by an amount equal to
the amount of any insurance proceeds received by Parent or any of its
Affiliates and any indemnification payments or reimbursements received by the
Parent Indemnities from third parties (net of actual out-of-pocket costs of
recovery and/or enforcement, deductibles and retro-premium adjustments) in
connection with such Damages or any of the circumstances giving rise thereto
(it being understood that Parent and any of its Affiliates shall have no
obligation to obtain or seek coverage or recovery from insurance carriers or
such third parties in respect of any such Damages). If Parent or any of its
Affiliates or receives any such insurance or third-party proceeds after an
indemnification payment has been made to it, Parent or its Affiliates, as the
case may be, shall promptly pay or cause to be paid (up to the aggregate
amount of indemnification payments previously made to Parent or its Affiliates
hereunder) to the Effective Time Holders the amount of such insurance
or third-party proceeds promptly after such time or times as and to the
extent that such insurance or third-party proceeds are received by Parent or
its Affiliates, to the extent not previously offset against Damages paid by
the Effective Time Holders. 

10.4 No Contribution. Except with respect to any such rights as a director
or officer of the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.10_ or under the DandO
Tail Policy, each Effective Time Holder waives, and acknowledges and agrees
that such Effective Time Holder (and the Securityholders Agent on behalf of
such Effective Time Holder) shall not have and shall not exercise or assert
(or attempt to exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right of
indemnity, right of subrogation or advancement of expenses or other right or
remedy against the Surviving Corporation or any Acquired Entity in connection
with any indemnification obligation or any other liability to which such
Effective Time Holder may become subject under or in connection with this
Agreement or any other agreement, document or instrument delivered to Parent
in connection with this Agreement.

 



78

    

10.5 Claim Procedures. Any claim for indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6_ or this _Section_ __ _ 10_ (and,
at the option of any Parent Indemnitee, any claim based upon Fraud) shall be
brought and resolved exclusively as follows:

(a) _Claim Notice_. If any Parent Indemnitee has or claims in good faith
to have incurred or suffered, or believes in good faith that it may incur or
suffer, Damages for which it is or may be entitled to indemnification,
compensation or reimbursement under _Section_ __ _ 6_ or this _Section_ __ _
10_, such Parent Indemnitee may deliver a claim notice signed by an
authorized representative of Parent (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the
Securityholders Agent. Each Claim Notice shall: (i) contain a brief
description specifying in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances
supporting the Parent Indemnitees claim; and (ii) if practicable, contain a
non-binding, preliminary, good faith estimate of the amount to which
the Parent Indemnitee reasonably anticipates it will be entitled hereunder
(the aggregate amount of such estimate, as it shall be modified by the Parent
Indemnitee in good faith from time to time, being referred to as the "
_Claimed Amount_ "). Following the delivery of a Claim Notice, Parent shall
provide reasonable access to the Securityholders Agent and its
Representatives to the books and records of the Surviving Corporation and
reasonable access during normal business hours to such personnel or other
representatives of the Surviving Corporation and Parent, in each case as may
reasonably be required by the Securityholders Agent and its Representatives,
for the purposes of investigating or resolving any disputes relating to or
raised by the Claim Notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (A) the parties
will cooperate with the intention that any such access as contemplated in this
_Section_ __ _ 10.5(a)_ shall occur in such a manner to protect the
confidentiality of the matters at issue (including through an agreement by the
Securityholders Agent to reasonable restrictions on disclosure and use); (B)
all requests for such access shall be directed to an employee of Parent at or
above the level of Vice President, or an employee in Parents legal
department; and (C) nothing herein shall require Parent to provide access to,
or to disclose any information to, the Securityholders Agent or any of its
Representatives if such access or disclosure: (y) would waive any legal
privilege; or (z) would be in violation of any applicable Contracts,
applicable Legal Requirements or regulations of any Governmental Body;
_provided, however_ , that Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to provide such information to the Securityholders Agent in a manner that
would not adversely affect the applicable privilege or violate such applicable
Contract, Legal Requirement or regulation.

(b) _Response Notice_. During the 30-day period commencing upon receipt
by the Securityholders Agent of a Claim Notice from a Parent Indemnitee (the
" _Dispute Period_ "), the Securityholders Agent may deliver to the Parent
Indemnitee a written response (the " _Response Notice_ ") in which the
Securityholders Agent: (i) agrees that the full Claimed Amount is owed to the
Parent Indemnitee; (ii) agrees that part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount
is owed to the Parent Indemnitee; or (iii) indicates that no part of the
Claimed Amount is owed to the Parent Indemnitee. If the Response Notice is
delivered in accordance with clause "(ii)" or clause "(iii)" of the preceding
sentence, the Response Notice shall also contain a brief description of the
facts and circumstances supporting the Securityholders Agents claim that
only a portion or no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Parent
Indemnitee, as the case may be. Any part of the Claimed Amount that is
not agreed to be owed to the Parent Indemnitee pursuant to the Response
Notice (or the entire Claimed Amount, if the Securityholders Agent asserts in
the Response Notice that no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Parent
Indemnitee) is referred to herein as the " _Contested Amount_ " (it being
understood that the Contested Amount shall be modified from time to time to
reflect any good faith modifications by the Parent Indemnitee to the Claimed
Amount). If a Response Notice is not received by the Parent Indemnitee from
the Securityholders Agent prior to the expiration of the Dispute Period, then
the Securityholders Agent shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed that an
amount equal to the full Claimed Amount is owed to the Parent Indemnitee.

(c) _Full Claimed Amount_. If the Securityholders Agent in its Response
Notice agrees that the full Claimed Amount is owed to the Parent Indemnitee,
or if no Response Notice is received by the Parent Indemnitee from the
Securityholders Agent prior to the expiration of the Dispute Period, then:
(i) Parent and Securityholders Agent shall, within seven Business Days
following the earlier of the delivery of such Response Notice and the
expiration of the Dispute Period, jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow
Agent a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to pay the Claimed Amount
to the Parent Indemnitee from the Escrow Fund; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if the Securityholders Agent fails to execute and deliver such written notice
within such seven Business Day period, Parents unilateral execution and
delivery of such written notice shall constitute binding instructions to the
Escrow Agent by Parent and the Securityholders Agent to release the Claimed
Amount to the Parent Indemnitee from the Escrow Fund (to the extent of the
Escrow Fund); and (ii) if the amount held in the Escrow Fund is insufficient
to cover the full Claimed Amount, then, subject to the limitations contained
in  _Section_ __ _ 10.3_, Parent may, following the earlier of the delivery
of such Response Notice and the expiration of the Dispute Period, pursue
recovery directly against each Effective Time Holder for an amount equal to
such Effective Time Holders Applicable Pro Rata Share of the amount of such
deficiency to the Parent Indemnitee.

 

(d) _Agreed Amount_. If the Securityholders Agent delivers a Response
Notice to the Parent Indemnitee during the Dispute Period agreeing that part,
but not all, of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Parent Indemnitee (the "
_Agreed Amount_ "), then: (i) Parent and Securityholders Agent shall, within
three Business Days following the delivery of such Response Notice, jointly
execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice instructing the
Escrow Agent to pay the Agreed Amount to such Parent Indemnitee from the
Escrow Fund; and (ii) if the amount held in the Escrow Fund is insufficient
to cover the full Agreed Amount, then, subject to the limitations contained in
_Section_ __ _ 10.3_, Parent may, following the delivery of such Response
Notice, pursue recovery directly against each Effective Time Holder for an
amount equal to such Effective Time Holders Applicable Pro Rata Share of the
amount of such deficiency to the Parent Indemnitee.

 

(e) _Stipulated Amount_. If the Securityholders Agent delivers a Response
Notice to the Parent Indemnitee during the Dispute Period expressly stating
that there is a Contested Amount, the Securityholders Agent and the Parent
Indemnitee shall attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute related to the
Contested Amount. If the Securityholders Agent and the Parent Indemnitee
resolve such dispute, such resolution shall be binding on the Securityholders
Agent, the Effective Time Holders and such Parent Indemnitee, and a settlement
agreement stipulating the amount owed to such Parent Indemnitee (the "
_Stipulated Amount_ ") shall be signed by such Parent Indemnitee and the
Securityholders Agent. Within three Business Days following the execution of
such settlement agreement, or such shorter period of time as may be set forth
in the settlement agreement, Parent and the Securityholders Agent shall
execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing
the Escrow Agent to release the Stipulated Amount to the Parent Indemnitee
from the Escrow Fund (to the extent of the Escrow Fund). If the amount held in
the Escrow Fund is insufficient to cover the full Stipulated Amount, then,
subject to the limitations contained in  _Section_ __ _ 10.3_, Parent may,
following the execution of such settlement agreement, pursue recovery directly
against each Effective Time Holder for an amount equal to such Effective Time
Holders Applicable Pro Rata Share of the amount of such deficiency to the
Parent Indemnitee.

(f) _Dispute_. In the event that there is a dispute relating to any Claim
Notice or Contested Amount (whether it is a matter between the Parent
Indemnitee, on the one hand, and the Securityholders Agent, on the other
hand, or it is a matter that is subject to a claim or Legal Proceeding
asserted or commenced by a third party brought against the Parent Indemnitee
or an Acquired Entity), such dispute (an " _Arbitrable_ _Dispute_ ") shall be
settled by binding arbitration. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
nothing in this _Sec_ _tion_ __ _ 10.5(f)_ shall prevent the Parent
Indemnitee from seeking preliminary injunctive relief from a court of
competent jurisdiction pending settlement of any Arbitrable Dispute.

 



80

    

(i) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any Arbitrable Dispute
shall be resolved by arbitration in San Francisco County, California, in
accordance with JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the "
_JAMS Rules_ ") then in effect. However, in all events, the provisions
contained in this Agreement shall govern over any conflicting rules which may
now or hereafter be contained in the JAMS Rules. A judgment upon the award
rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
over the subject matter thereof. The arbitrator shall have the authority to
grant any equitable and legal remedies that would be available if any judicial
proceeding were instituted to resolve an Arbitrable Dispute. The existence
of such arbitration and the terms of the Arbitrable Dispute shall be kept
confidential by the Securityholders Agent and the Effective Time Holders;
_provided_ , _however_ , that: (A) such parties may discuss the arbitration
with those of their respective advisors, attorneys, directors, officers,
members, Affiliates and other representatives who agree to keep the existence
of such arbitration and the terms of such Arbitrable Dispute confidential; and
(B) the Securityholders Agent may disclose such information on a need-to-
know basis to the Effective Time Holders, provided that such Effective Time
Holders agree to keep such information confidential.

(ii) Any such arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator who
will be compensated for his or her services at a rate to be determined by the
Parent Indemnitee and the Securityholders Agent or by JAMS, but based upon
reasonable hourly or daily consulting rates for the arbitrator in the
event the parties are not able to agree upon his or her rate of compensation.

(iii) The arbitrator shall be mutually agreed upon by the Parent
Indemnitee and the Securityholders Agent. In the event the Parent Indemnitee
and the Securityholders Agent are unable to agree on the selection of an
arbitrator within 20 days following submission of the dispute to JAMS by one
of the parties, JAMS will have the authority to select an arbitrator from a
list of arbitrators who satisfy the criteria set forth in clause "(iv)" below.

 

(iv) The arbitrator shall not have any past or current family, business or
other relationship with the Parent Indemnitee, any Acquired Entity, the
Securityholders Agent, any of the Effective Time Holders or any Affiliate,
director or officer thereof, unless, following full disclosure of all such
relationships, the Parent Indemnitee and the Securityholders Agent agree in
writing to waive such requirement with respect to the arbitrator in connection
with such dispute. In addition, unless otherwise agreed to between the Parent
Indemnitee and the Securityholders Agent in writing, the arbitrator shall
have at least 15 years experience in the negotiation of definitive merger and
acquisition agreements involving privately held entities; _provided_ ,
_however_ , __ that if JAMS is not able to provide an arbitrator for such
arbitration with the requisite experience set forth in this clause "(iv),"
such arbitrator shall be a retired Article III Federal District Court judge.

 

(v) The arbitrator shall be instructed to hold up to three days of eight-
hour hearings regarding the disputed matter within 60 days of his or her
designation and to render an award no later than 30 days after the conclusion
of such hearings, in each case unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by
the Parent Indemnitee and the Securityholders Agent. The final decision of
the arbitrator: (A) shall include the amount of the award to the Parent
Indemnitee (the " _Award Amount_ "), if any; (B) shall be furnished to the
Securityholders Agent and the Parent Indemnitee in writing; and (C) shall
constitute a final, non-appealable and conclusive determination of the
issue(s) in question, shall be binding upon the Securityholders Agent,
the Effective Time Holders and the Parent Indemnitee and shall not be
contested by any of them.

 

(vi) The Parent Indemnitee and the Securityholders Agent agree to act in
good faith to promptly exchange relevant non-privileged documents upon
request from the other party.

 



81

    

(vii) The Parent Indemnitee and the Securityholders Agent (on behalf of
the Effective Time Holders) will each pay 50% of the initial compensation to
be paid to the arbitrator in any such arbitration and 50% of the costs of
transcripts and other normal and regular expenses of the arbitration
proceedings; _provided_ , _however_ , that: (A) the prevailing party in any
arbitration will be entitled to reimbursement of such amounts and an award of
reasonable attorneys fees and costs; and (B) all costs of arbitration will
be paid by the losing party, and the arbitrator will be authorized to
determine the identity of the prevailing party and the losing party. If the
Parent Indemnitee is found to be the prevailing party in any arbitration, the
amount of the fees and expenses of the Parent Indemnitee payable by the
Effective Time Holders pursuant to this clause "(vii)" shall be added to the
Award Amount.

 

(viii) The arbitrator chosen in accordance with these provisions will not
have the power to alter, amend or otherwise affect the terms of these
arbitration provisions or any other provisions contained in this _Section_ __
_ 10.5_ or elsewhere in this Agreement.

 

(ix) Upon resolution of the Arbitrable Dispute in accordance with this 
_Section_ __ _ 10.5_: (A) Parent and the Securityholders Agent shall
instruct the Escrow Agent to pay the Parent Indemnitee the Award Amount from
the Escrow Fund in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 10.5_ and the Escrow
Agreement; and (B) if the Award Amount relates to Fraud or any other matter
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)_ for which recovery from the Escrow Fund
is not the sole and exclusive remedy, and the amount remaining in the Escrow
Fund is insufficient to cover the full Award Amount, then, subject to any
applicable limitations provided for in _Section_ __ _ 10.3_, Parent may,
following the delivery of the final decision of the arbitrator, pursue
recovery directly against each Effective Time Holder for an amount equal to
such Effective Time Holders Applicable Pro Rata Share of the amount of such
deficiency to the Parent Indemnitee. Any ruling or decision of the arbitrator
may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.

(g) _First Anniversary Release_. Promptly after the first anniversary of
the Closing Date (the " _First Anniversary_ "), Parent will notify the
Securityholders Agent in writing of the amount that Parent determines in good
faith to be necessary to satisfy all then-pending and unresolved claims for
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement made pursuant to _Section_ __ _
6_ or this _Section_ __ _ 10_, on or prior to 11:59 p.m. (Pacific time) on
the First Anniversary (such amount, the " _Initial_ _Retained Escrow Amount_
"). Subject to _Section_ __ _ 10.5(j)_, within 10 Business Days following the
First Anniversary, Parent and the Securityholders Agent shall execute and
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow
Agent to release from the Escrow Fund to: (x) Parent, for further distribution
via payroll to the holders of Outstanding-In-the-Money Vested Options and/or
Vested RSUs who are Continuing Service Providers; or (y) the Payment Agent,
for distribution to the other Effective Time Holders, as applicable, an
amount in the aggregate equal to 50% of: (i) the amount held in the Escrow
Fund as of the First Anniversary (as reduced from time to time pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement); _minus_ (ii) the Initial Retained Escrow Amount,
with each Effective Time Holder to receive a portion thereof equal to the
product obtained by multiplying: (A) the amount to be so released; by (B) such
Effective Time Holders Pro Rata Share.

 

(h) _Subsequent Releases_. Promptly after the Expiration Date, Parent will
notify the Securityholders Agent in writing of the amount that Parent
determines in good faith to be necessary to satisfy all then-pending and
unresolved claims for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement made
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 6_ or this _Section_ __ _ 10_, on or prior to
11:59 p.m. (Pacific time) on the Expiration Date (each such claim a "
_Continuing Claim_ " and such amount, the " _Subsequent Retained Escrow
Amount_ "). Subject to _Section_ __ _ 10.5(j)_, within 10 Business Days
following the Expiration Date, Parent and the Securityholders Agent shall
execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow Fund to: (x) Parent,
for further distribution via payroll to the holders of Outstanding-In-the-
Money Vested Options and/or Vested RSUs who are Continuing Service Providers;
or (y) the Payment Agent, for distribution to the other Effective Time
Holders, as applicable, an amount in the aggregate equal to: (i) the amount
held in the Escrow Fund as of the Expiration Date (as reduced from time to
time pursuant to the terms of this Agreement);  _minus_ (ii) the Subsequent
Retained Escrow Amount, with each Effective Time Holder to receive a portion
thereof equal to the product obtained by multiplying: (A) the amount to be so
released; _by_ (B) such Effective Time Holders Pro Rata Share.

 



82

    

(i) _Remaining Amounts_. Following the Expiration Date, after resolution
and payment of a Continuing Claim, Parent and the Securityholders Agent shall
execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing
the Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow Fund to: (x) Parent, for further
distribution via payroll to the holders of Outstanding-In-the-Money Vested
Options and/or Vested RSUs who are Continuing Service Providers; or (y) the
Payment Agent, for distribution to the other Effective Time Holders, as
applicable, an amount in the aggregate equal to the amount remaining in the
Escrow Fund with respect to such Continuing Claim (if any) as of the date of
such resolution and payment, with each Effective Time Holder to receive a
portion thereof equal to the product obtained by multiplying: (i) the amount
to be so released; _by_ (ii) such Effective Time Holders Pro Rata Share.

(j) _Payment Conditions_. With respect to any amount to be released from
the Escrow Fund to the Effective Time Holders pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
10.5_ or the Escrow Agreement:

 

(i) if any former holder of Outstanding Capital Stock has not executed and
delivered a properly completed Letter of Transmittal and surrendered such
Effective Time Holders Company Stock Certificate (or transferred such
Effective Time Holders Company Book Entry Shares) in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 1.8(b)_ (collectively, the " _Payment Conditions_ ") prior to
the delivery to the Escrow Agent of the applicable joint written instructions,
then any amount that would otherwise be released to such Effective Time Holder
shall be held by the Payment Agent, without interest, until such holder
satisfies all of such Effective Time Holders applicable Payment Conditions;

 

(ii) for purposes of _Sections_ __ _ 1.5(a)(ii)_ only, amounts to be
released from the Escrow Fund to be distributed to each Effective Time Holder
shall be deemed to be the product of: (A) the aggregate amount to be released
from the Escrow Fund to the Effective Time Holders; _multiplied by_ (B) __
each Effective Time Holders Pro Rata Share (it being understood that the
amounts referred to in this clause "(ii)" have been taken into account in
determining each Effective Time Holders Pro Rata Share and that no Effective
Time Holder shall receive more than such Effective Time Holders Pro Rata
Share of any amount released from the Escrow Fund);

 

(iii) each distribution to be made from the Escrow Fund to a particular
Effective Time Holder shall be effected in accordance with the payment
delivery instructions set forth in such Effective Time Holders Letter of
Transmittal, with respect to amounts to be distributed in respect of such
Effective Time Holders Outstanding Capital Stock; and

(iv) all written instructions to be delivered to the Escrow Agent
with respect to any distribution from the Escrow Fund shall be consistent
with this _Section 10.5(j)._

 

10.6 Defense of Third Party Claims. In the event of the assertion or
commencement by any Person of any claim or Legal Proceeding (whether against
the Surviving Corporation, any Acquired Entity, Parent or any other Person)
with respect to which any Effective Time Holder may become obligated to hold
harmless, indemnify, compensate or reimburse any Parent Indemnitee pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 10_, Parent shall have the right, at its election, to
proceed with the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding on its own with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Securityholders Agent. If Parent so
proceeds with the defense of any such claim or Legal Proceeding:

(a) upon Parents written request, each Effective Time Holder shall make
available to Parent any documents and materials in such Effective Time
Holders possession or control that may reasonably be necessary to the defense
of such claim or Legal Proceeding;

 



83

    

(b) Parent shall: (i) keep the Securityholders Agent reasonably informed
of the status of such claim or Legal Proceeding and the defense thereof and
shall consider reasonable recommendations made in good faith by the
Securityholders Agent with respect to the defense of such claim or
Legal Proceeding; and (ii) upon reasonable written request by the
Securityholders Agent for specified pleadings, notices or material written
communications, deliver to the Securityholders Agent, within five Business
Days after the Parent Indemnitees receipt thereof, copies of all such
materials reasonably requested, _provided_ that Parent may limit such
disclosure in order to preserve the attorney client privilege, work product
doctrine or any other similar privilege, in each case as and to the extent
applicable to such materials; _provided, further_ , that Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide such information to
Securityholders Agent in a manner that would not adversely affect
any applicable privileges; and

(c) Parent shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such claim
or Legal Proceeding without the consent of the Securityholders Agent;
_provided, however,_ that if Parent settles, adjusts or compromises any such
claim or Legal Proceeding without the consent of the Securityholders Agent,
then such settlement, adjustment or compromise shall not be conclusive
evidence of the amount of, or the Effective Time Holders liability for,
Damages incurred by the Parent Indemnitee in connection with such claim or
Legal Proceeding. If Parent does not elect to proceed with the defense of any
such claim or Legal Proceeding, the Securityholders Agent may proceed with
the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to Parent; _provided, however,_  that the Securityholders Agent
may not settle, adjust or compromise any such claim or Legal Proceeding
without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). Parent shall give the Securityholders
Agent prompt notice of the commencement of any such claim or Legal Proceeding
against Parent, Merger Sub or the Company; _provided, however_ , that any
failure on the part of Parent to so notify the Securityholders Agent shall
not limit any of the obligations of the Effective Time Holders under this
_Section_ __ _ 10_ (except to the extent such failure materially prejudices
the defense of such Legal Proceeding).

 

10.7 Exclusive Remedy. Except for equitable remedies, from and after the
Effective Time, the rights to indemnification, compensation and reimbursement
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6_ and this _Section_ __ _ 10_ shall be the sole
and exclusive monetary remedy of the Parent Indemnitees against the Effective
Time Holders with respect to any Damages arising under or pursuant to this
Agreement; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 10.7_ shall limit the rights of the Indemnitees against any
Effective Time Holder in the event of Fraud on the part of such Effective
Time Holder.

10.8 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. The parties agree to report each
indemnification payment made in respect of any Damages as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for federal income Tax purposes unless the indemnified party
determines in good faith that such reporting position is incorrect.

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 

---|---|--- 
 

11.1 Securityholders Agent.

 

(a) _Appointment_. By virtue of the adoption and approval of this
Agreement and/or the Joinder and Support Agreements, and by the consummation
of the Merger or participating in the Merger and receiving the benefits
thereof, including the right to receive the consideration payable in
connection with the Merger, the Effective Time Holders irrevocably nominate,
constitute and appoint Shareholder Representative Services LLC as the
representative agent and true and lawful attorney-in-fact of the Effective
Time Holders, with full power of substitution, for all purposes in connection
with this Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto (the "
_Securityholders_ __ _Agent_ "), including to act in the name, place and
stead of such Persons for purposes of executing any documents and taking any
actions that the Securityholders Agent may, in the Securityholders Agents
sole discretion, determine to be necessary, desirable or appropriate in
connection with this Agreement and any other agreement, document or
instrument referred to in or contemplated by this Agreement and any
transaction contemplated under this Agreement or any such other agreement,
document or instrument, including with respect to, any claim
for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under _Section_ __ _ 10_,
the Escrow Agreement. Securityholders Agent hereby accepts its appointment as
Securityholders Agent.

 

(b) _Authority_. The Effective Time Holders grant to the Securityholders
Agent full authority to execute, deliver, acknowledge, certify and file on
behalf of such Persons (in the name of any or all of such Persons or
otherwise) any and all documents that the Securityholders Agent may, in its
sole discretion, determine to be necessary, desirable or appropriate, in such
forms and containing such provisions as the Securityholders Agent may, in its
sole discretion, determine to be appropriate, in performing its duties as
contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 11.1(a)_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement or in any other agreement executed in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, after the Closing: (i)
each Parent Indemnitee shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the
Securityholders Agent on all matters relating to any claim for
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under _Section_ __ _ 10_ and
under the Escrow Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, except with respect
to payment of any amounts owed directly by the Effective Time Holders to a
Parent Indemnitee); and (ii) each Parent Indemnitee shall be entitled to rely
conclusively (without further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any
document executed or purported to be executed on behalf of any Effective Time
Holder by the Securityholders Agent, and on any other action taken or
purported to be taken on behalf of any such Person by the Securityholders
Agent, as fully binding upon such Person.

(c) _Power of Attorney_. The Effective Time Holders recognize and intend
that the power of attorney granted in _Section_ __ _ 11.1(a)_: (i) is coupled
with an interest and is irrevocable; (ii) may be delegated by the
Securityholders Agent; and (iii) shall survive the death, incapacity,
dissolution, liquidation or winding up of each of the Effective Time Holders.

 

(d) _Replacement_. If the Securityholders Agent shall die, resign, become
disabled or otherwise be unable to fulfill its responsibilities hereunder,
the Effective Time Holders shall (by consent of those Persons who contributed
at least 50% of the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Fund), within 10 days after
such death, disability or inability, appoint a successor to the
Securityholders Agent (who shall be an Effective Time Holder and shall be
reasonably satisfactory to Parent) and immediately thereafter notify Parent of
the identity of such successor. Any such successor shall succeed the
Securityholders Agent as Securityholders Agent hereunder. If for any reason
there is no Securityholders Agent at any time, all references herein to the
Securityholders Agent shall be deemed to refer to the Effective Time
Holders.

 



85

    

(e) _Liability of Securityholders  Agent_. The Securityholders Agent
will incur no liability of any kind with respect to any action or omission by
the Securityholders Agent in connection with its services provided pursuant
to this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, except in the event of
liability directly resulting from the Securityholders Agents gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Securityholders Agent shall not be
liable for any action or omission pursuant to the advice of counsel.
The Effective Time Holders shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Securityholders Agent from and against any and all losses, liabilities,
damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and
expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their
staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment)
(collectively, " _Agent Losses_ ") arising out of or in connection with the
Securityholders Agents execution and performance of this Agreement and any
agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such Agent Loss is suffered or
incurred; _provided_ that in the event that any such Agent Loss is finally
adjudicated to have been directly caused by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Securityholders Agent, the Securityholders Agent will
reimburse the Effective Time Holders the amount of such indemnified Agent Loss
to the extent attributable to such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If
not paid directly to the Securityholders Agent by the Effective Time Holders,
any such Agent Losses may be recovered by the Securityholders Agent from: (i)
the funds in the Expense Fund; and (ii) the amounts in the Escrow Fund at
such time as remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable to the
Effective Time Holders; _provided_ that while this section allows the
Securityholders Agent to be paid from the aforementioned sources of funds,
this does not relieve the Effective Time Holders from their obligation to
promptly pay such Agent Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it
prevent the Securityholders Agent from seeking any remedies available to it
at law or otherwise. In no event will the Securityholders Agent be required
to advance its own funds on behalf of the Effective Time Holders or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions
or limitations on the liability or indemnification obligations of the
Effective Time Holders set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended
to be applicable to the indemnities provided to the Securityholders Agent
under this  _Section_ __ _ 11.1(e)_. The foregoing indemnities will survive
the Closing, the resignation or removal of the Securityholders Agent or the
termination of this Agreement.

 

(f) _Expense Fund_. The Expense Fund will be used for the purposes of
paying directly, or reimbursing the Securityholders Agent for, any third
party expenses pursuant to this Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto.
The Effective Time Holders will not receive any interest or earnings on the
Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign to the Securityholders
Agent any ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any such
interest or earnings. The Securityholders Agent will not be liable for any
loss of principal of the Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Securityholders Agent will hold these
funds separate from its corporate funds, will not use these funds for its
operating expenses or any other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily
make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. As
soon as practicable following the completion of the Securityholders Agents
responsibilities, the Securityholders Agent will deliver any remaining
balance of the Expense Fund to the Payment Agent for further distribution to
the Effective Time Holders. For tax purposes, the Expense Fund will be treated
as having been received and voluntarily set aside by the Effective Time
Holders at the time of Closing.

 

11.2 Further Assurances. Each party hereto shall execute and cause to be
delivered to each other party hereto such instruments and other documents,
and shall take such other actions, as such other party may reasonably request
(prior to, at or after the Closing) for the purpose of carrying out or
evidencing any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

11.3 No Waiver Relating to Claims for Fraud. The liability of any Person
under  _Section_ __ _ 10_ will be in addition to, and not exclusive of, any
other liability that such Person may have at law or in equity based on such
Persons Fraudulent acts or omissions. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, none of the provisions set forth in
this Agreement, including the provisions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 10_,
shall be deemed a waiver by any party to this Agreement of any right or remedy
which such party may have at law or in equity based on any other Persons own
Fraudulent acts or omissions, nor will any such provisions limit, or be deemed
to limit: (a) the amounts of recovery sought or awarded in any claim for Fraud
against such other Person; (b) the time period during which a claim for Fraud
may be brought against such other Person; or (c) the recourse which any such
party may seek against such other Person with respect to a claim for Fraud, in
each case based on such Persons own Fraudulent acts or omissions.

 



86

    

11.4 Fees and Expenses. Subject to  _Sections_ __ _ 1.5_ and _10_ and the
Escrow Agreement, each party to this Agreement shall bear and pay all fees,
costs and expenses that have been incurred or that are incurred in the future
by such party in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including all fees, costs and expenses incurred by such party in
connection with or by virtue of: (a) the negotiation, preparation and review
of this Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedule) and all agreements,
certificates, opinions and other instruments and documents delivered or to be
delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
(b) the preparation and submission of any filing or notice required to be
made or given in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the obtaining of any Consent required to be obtained in
connection with any of such transactions; and (c) the consummation of the
Merger.  

11.5 Attorneys Fees. If any action, suit or other Legal Proceeding
relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of any provision of this
Agreement is brought against any party hereto, the prevailing party shall be
entitled to recover reasonable attorneys fees, costs and disbursements (in
addition to any other relief to which the prevailing party may be entitled).

11.6 Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to
be delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall
be deemed properly delivered, given and received: (a) if delivered by hand,
when delivered; (b) if sent on a Business Day by facsimile
transmission before 11:59 p.m. (recipients time) on the day sent by
facsimile and receipt is confirmed, when transmitted; (c) if sent by facsimile

before 11:59 p.m. (recipients time) on the day sent by email and receipt is
confirmed, when transmitted; (e) if sent by email on a day other than a
Business Day and receipt is confirmed, or if sent by email after 11:59 p.m.
(recipients time) on the day sent by email and receipt is confirmed, on the
Business Day following the date on which receipt is confirmed; (f) if sent by
registered, certified or first class mail, the third Business Day after being
sent; and (g) if sent by overnight delivery via a national courier service,
one Business Day after being sent, in each case to the address or facsimile
telephone number or email address, as applicable, set forth beneath the name
of such party below (or to such other address, facsimile telephone number or
email address, as applicable, as such party shall have specified in a written
notice given to the other parties hereto); _provided, however,_ in the case of
each of the foregoing clauses "(b)", "(c)", "(d)" and "(e)", any notice or
other required or permitted communication provided via facsimile or email
transmission shall be deemed properly delivered, given and received as of the
date set forth in such clause only if such notice or other communication is

exclusively in any federal or state court located in the County of San
Francisco, State of California. Each party to this Agreement: (i) expressly
and irrevocably consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of and

commenced in any federal or state court located in the County of San
Francisco, State of California, any claim that such party is not subject

limiting any portion of _Section_ __ _ 11.9(b)_: (i) at the option of any

this Agreement), the investigation provided for herein and the preparation of
this Agreement and other related documents shall be deemed "Confidential
Information" under the Confidentiality and Nondisclosure Agreement, dated as

Agreement_ ") and subject to the terms thereof;  _provided, however,_ that:
(a) prior to the Effective Time, Parent or any of its Affiliates may disclose
any confidential information related to any Acquired Entity or its assets or
business to the Financing Sources and the Financing Source Related Parties
(in each case, without any obligation on the part of the Financing Sources or
the Financing Source Related Parties to comply with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement) so long as the Financing Sources are subject
to confidentiality undertakings that are at least as restrictive as those
applicable to Parent with respect to the Company (except that such
confidentiality agreement need not contain any explicit or implicit standstill
provision); and (b) after the Effective Time, Parent and the Company may use
or disclose any confidential information related to any Acquired Entity or its
assets or business.

 

11.18 No Public Announcement. Prior to the Effective Time, none of Parent,

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as and to the extent: (a)
that any party shall be so obligated by Legal Requirements or the laws of any
stock exchange upon which the securities of such Person are listed, in which
case such party shall first advise each other party thereof and the parties
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause a mutually agreeable
release or announcement to be issued; or (b) consistent with prior press
releases or public statements mutually agreed to and made by Parent or the
Company; _provided, however_ , that the foregoing shall not preclude
communications or disclosures necessary to implement the provisions of this
Agreement or enforce such partys rights hereunder. Following the Effective
Time, neither the Securityholders Agent nor any of its Affiliates shall make
any press release or other public announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except as and to the extent: (i) that such
party shall be so obligated by law, in which case such party shall advise
Parent thereof and the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause a mutually agreeable release or announcement to be issued; or (ii)
consistent with prior press releases or public statements mutually agreed to
and made by Parent or the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, following the Closing, the Securityholders
Agent shall be permitted to: (A) after the public announcement of the Merger,
publicly announce that it has been engaged to serve as the Securityholders
Agent in connection herewith as long as such announcement does not disclose
any of the other terms hereof or the terms of any agreement ancillary hereto;
and (B) disclose information as required by applicable Legal Requirements or
to employees, advisors, agents or consultants of the Securityholders Agent
and to the Effective Time Holders, in each case who have a need to know such
information, provided that such Persons are subject to reasonable restrictions
on disclosure and use with respect thereto.

 

11.19 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other agreements referred to
herein set forth the entire understanding of the parties hereto relating to
the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings among or between any of the parties relating to the subject
matter hereof and thereof. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that,
effective as of the Effective Time, the Confidentiality Agreement is hereby
terminated and shall be null and void and of no force or effect. Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledge that the Company has not made, and Parent and Merger
Sub are not relying on, any representations or warranties as to the accuracy
or completeness of any information regarding the Acquired Entities or their
respective businesses or assets, express or implied, except as set forth in
_Section 2_ or pursuant to certificates delivered hereto. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing contained in
this Agreement shall limit the rights of the Parent Indemnitees against any
Person in the case of Fraud by such Person (whether within or outside the
subject matter of the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement).

11.20 Disclosure Schedule. The Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in
separate parts corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and
subsections contained in this Agreement, and the information disclosed in any
numbered or lettered part shall be deemed to relate to and to qualify only
the particular representation or warranty of the Company set forth in the
corresponding numbered or lettered section or subsection of this Agreement,
except to the extent that: (a) such information is explicitly cross-referenced
in another part of the Disclosure Schedule; or (b) it is readily apparent on
the face of the disclosure (without reference to any document referred to
therein) that such information qualifies another representation and warranty
of the Company in this Agreement.

masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine

limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation"; and (ii) the use of the word "or" shall not be exclusive.

Agreement to "Sections," "Parts," "Schedules" and "Exhibits" are intended to

consents to and covenants not to assert any objection based on conflict of
interest or otherwise, to any representation of the Companys

or (ii) any advice given to the Indemnitors (including the Securityholders
Agent) and their respective Affiliates by Fenwick prior to the Closing and
with respect to the negotiation, execution, and delivery of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then: (A) neither Parent nor
any of its Affiliates shall use any such communication or advice described in
clause "(i)" or "(ii)" of this sentence against the Indemnitors (including the
Securityholders Agent) or their respective Affiliates in connection with any
dispute between the Indemnitors (including the Securityholders Agent) and
their respective Affiliates, on one hand, and one or more of Parent, its
Affiliates and/or the Surviving Corporation, on the other hand, with respect
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
and (B) the Indemnitors (including the Securityholders Agent) may use any
