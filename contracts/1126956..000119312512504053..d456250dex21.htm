an agreement to assign or assume any Material Contract, material Permit or,
in each case, any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or

transfer or assignment to Buyer by Seller or any of its Affiliates of any
property or property rights or any Material Contract or material Permit that
requires the Consent of any third party shall be made subject to such Consent
being obtained. If such Consent is not obtained, or if an attempted
assignment thereof would be ineffective or would affect the rights of Seller
or its Affiliate thereunder such that Buyer would not in fact receive all such
rights, Seller will continue to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
relevant Consent until such Consent is obtained or such Material Contract or
material Permit expires or is terminated, and will either (at Buyers request)
(i) cooperate with Buyer in any arrangement that does not constitute a breach
of such Material Contract or material Permit, including an operating or other
services agreement if reasonably required by Buyer, reasonably designed to

Permit or rights including enforcement for the benefit of Buyer of any and all
rights of Seller or its Affiliates against a third party or Governmental Body
thereto arising out of the breach or cancellation by such third party or
Governmental Body or otherwise or (ii) subject to the following, assign such
Material Contract or material Permit to Buyer.

(b) To the extent that Buyer elects clause (i) of paragraph (a), above, and
does receive all of the benefits of any such Contract or rights pursuant to
the preceding sentence, Buyer shall accept, and shall indemnify Seller from
and against, the burdens (including the

 



17  out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller in performing such
arrangement) and perform the obligations under such Contract as subcontractor
of Seller to the extent of the benefit received, and to the extent such
burdens and obligations would have constituted an Assumed Liability if such
Contract had been transferred to Buyer at the Closing. Seller shall and shall
cause its Affiliates to exercise or exploit their respective rights and
options under all such Contracts referred to in this Section 2.4 only as
reasonably directed by Buyer. Furthermore, if the other party(ies) to such a
Contract subsequently Consent to the assignment of such Contract to Buyer,
Buyer shall thereupon agree to assume and perform all liabilities and the
obligations arising thereunder after the date of such Consent, at which time
such Contract shall be deemed an Asset, without the payment of further
consideration, and the obligations so assumed thereunder shall be deemed
Assumed Liabilities.

(c) To the extent Buyer elects clause (ii) of paragraph (a), above, Buyer
shall indemnify Seller from and against any liability associated with such
assignment.

(a) Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller within forty-five (45) days
following the Closing Date a statement (the "Closing Statement"), which will
utilize the same accounting methods, policies, practices, procedures and
adjustments as were used in the preparation of the Base Statement, and which
shall set forth in reasonable detail the Net Assets of the Business as of the
close of business on the date immediately prior to the Closing Date (the
"True-Up Amount").

(b) Following its receipt from Buyer of the Closing Statement, Seller shall
have thirty (30) days to review the Closing Statement and the True-Up Amount
and to inform Buyer in writing of any disagreement (the "Objection") that it
may have with the Closing Statement or the True-Up Amount, which objection
shall specify in reasonable detail Sellers disagreement with the Closing
Statement or the True-Up Amount. Buyer agrees, at no cost to Seller, to give
Seller and its authorized Representatives reasonable access to such
employees, officers and other facilities and such books and records of Buyer
and its Affiliates as are

 



18  reasonably necessary to allow Seller and its authorized Representatives to
review the Closing Statement and the True-Up Amount. If Buyer does not receive
the Objection within such thirty (30) day period, the True-Up Amount and the
other amounts set forth on the Closing Statement delivered pursuant to Section
3.2(a) shall be deemed to have been accepted by Seller and shall become
binding upon Seller. If Seller does timely deliver an Objection to Buyer,
Buyer shall then have fifteen (15) days from the date of receipt of such
Objection (the "Review Period") to review and respond to the Objection. Seller
and Buyer shall attempt in good faith to resolve any disagreements with
respect to the Closing Statement or the True-Up Amount. If they are unable to
resolve all of their disagreements with respect to the Closing Statement or
the True-Up Amount within twenty (20) days following the expiration of
Buyers Review Period, they may refer, at the option of either Buyer or
Seller, their differences to an internationally recognized firm of independent
public accountants selected jointly by Buyer and Seller, which accountants
shall determine, only with respect to the disagreements so submitted, whether
and to what extent, if any, the amounts set forth on the Closing Statement or
the True-Up Amount require adjustment. If Buyer and Seller are unable to so
select the independent public accountants within twenty (20) days, either
Buyer or Seller may thereafter request that the American Arbitration
Association make such selection (as applicable, the firm selected by Buyer and
Seller or the firm selected by the American Arbitration Association is herein
referred to as the "CPA Firm"). Buyer and Seller shall direct the CPA Firm to
use its reasonable best efforts to render its determination within thirty (30)
days after the issue is first submitted to the CPA Firm. The CPA Firms
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Buyer and Seller. The fees
and disbursements of the CPA Firm shall be borne by Buyer and Seller in
inverse proportion as they may prevail on matters resolved by the CPA Firm,
which proportionate allocations shall also be determined by the CPA Firm at
the time the determination of the CPA Firm is rendered on the Closing
Statement or the True-Up Amount. Buyer and Seller shall make readily available
to the CPA Firm all relevant books and records relating to the Closing
Statement and all other items reasonably requested by the CPA Firm. The
Closing Statement and True-Up Amount as agreed to by Buyer and Seller or as
determined by the CPA Firm shall be referred to as the "Final Closing
Statement."

(c) In the event of a positive difference between the True-Up Amount on the
Final Closing Statement and the Net Assets as set forth on the Base Statement,
Buyer shall pay to Seller in cash the amount of such difference, plus the
Settlement Interest thereon. In the event of a negative difference between the
True-Up Amount on the Final Closing Statement and the Net Assets as set forth
on the Base Statement, Seller shall pay to Buyer in cash the amount of such
difference, plus the Settlement Interest thereon. All amounts payable under
this Section 3.2(c) shall be paid within five (5) Business Days of the
determination of the Final Closing Statement by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to a bank account designated in writing by the recipient not
less than one (1) Business Day before such payment.

reasonably believes that the conditions to the Financing contemplated in the

and the Related Documents to which Seller is a party. Seller is duly qualified
to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the
laws of the State of Missouri and each other state in which conduct of the
Business, or the ownership or operation of any Assets, by Seller makes such

not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.2 Authority Relative to this Agreement and Binding Effect. The
execution, delivery and performance by Seller of this Agreement and the
Related Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate
action. Except as set forth in _Schedule 5.2_ , neither the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Related Documents
by Seller, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, will (a) result in any conflict with or breach or violation of or
default under the Organizational Documents of Seller, (b) result in a
violation or breach of any term or provision of or a loss of any right or
benefit under, constitute a default or accelerate the performance required
under, result in the termination of or a right of termination, cancellation or
amendment, or result in the creation of any Encumbrance upon any of the

30, 2012 (the "Balance Sheet") and the unaudited statement of profit of the
Business for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012 (collectively,

foreign Tax Returns required to be filed by Seller with respect to the Assets
or requests for extensions to file such Tax Returns have been timely filed,
and Seller has timely paid and discharged or made adequate provision for all

associated therewith, have been or will be entered into and operated in

Section 5.12 Employee Benefit Matters.

 

(a) _Schedule 5.12(a)_ contains a true and complete list of each material
deferred compensation and each incentive or equity compensation plan,
program, agreement or arrangement; each severance or termination pay, medical,
surgical, hospitalization, life insurance and other welfare plan, fund or
program (within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA); each profit-sharing,
stock bonus or other pension plan, fund or program (within the meaning of
Section 3(2) of ERISA); and each other material employee benefit plan, fund,
program, agreement or arrangement, in each case, that is
sponsored, maintained or contributed to or required to be contributed to by
Seller or by any trade or business, whether or not incorporated, that together
with Seller would be deemed a single employer within the meaning of Section
4001(b) of ERISA (an "ERISA Affiliate"), in each case for the benefit of any
Employee or Former Employee (the "Employee Plans"). Sellers Pension Plans and
Sellers 401(k) Plan are the only Employee Plans that are intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the IRC. Other than Employees and Former
Employees of the Business (and their applicable beneficiaries), no individuals
participate in or are otherwise entitled to receive benefits from Sellers
Pension Plans. Each Employee Plan that is subject to Section 302 or Title IV
of ERISA or Sections 412 and 430 of the IRC is hereinafter referred to as a
"Title IV Plan." Other than as specifically set forth in the Employee
Agreement, Buyer shall have no liability with respect to any Employee Plan of
Seller or any of its Affiliates.

(b) With respect to each Employee Plan, Seller has heretofore delivered to
Buyer true and complete copies of the Employee Plan and any amendments thereto
(or if the Employee Plan is not a written Employee Plan, a description
thereof), any related trust or other funding vehicle documents, the most
recent actuarial valuation reports, annual reports, Forms 5500 and asset
statements, in each case, as applicable, any summary plan descriptions
required under ERISA or the IRC and the most recent determination letter
received from the IRS with respect to each Employee Plan intended to qualify
under Section 401 of the IRC.

(c) As of the date hereof, no liability under Section 302 or Title IV of
ERISA has been incurred by Seller or any ERISA Affiliate with respect to
Sellers Pension Plans that has not been satisfied in full, other than
liability for premiums due the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC")
(which premiums have been paid when due). Except as set forth on _Schedule
5.12(c)_ , since May 1, 2010 to the date of this Agreement, there has been no
"reportable 

 



26  event" (as such term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) in connection with
any of Sellers Pension Plans other than reportable events for which notice is
waived under applicable regulations.

(d) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.12(d)_ , all contributions, premiums or
payments required to be made by Seller or any of its ERISA Affiliates with
respect to any Employee Plan prior to the Closing Date have been timely made
prior to the Closing Date or, if not yet due, have been reflected in the
Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP, and will be reflected in the
Carve-Out Financials in accordance with GAAP when delivered.

(e) No Title IV Plan that is maintained or contributed to by Seller or its
ERISA Affiliates and for which Buyer could, directly or indirectly, reasonably
be expected to have liability, is or has been a multiemployer plan, as defined
in Section 3(37) of ERISA, nor is any Title IV Plan a plan described in
Section 4063(a) of ERISA. Neither Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate has made or
suffered a complete withdrawal or a partial withdrawal, as determined under
Sections 4203 and 4205 of ERISA (or any liability resulting therefrom has
been satisfied in full). With respect to each Title IV Plan, as of the date of
this Agreement, there has been no material change in the financial condition
of any such Title IV Plan since the last day of its most recently completed
fiscal year. 

(f) None of Seller, any Employee Plan, any trust created thereunder, or any
trustee or administrator thereof has engaged in a transaction in connection
with which Seller or any Employee Plan could be subject to either a material
penalty assessed pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a material tax
imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976 of the IRC. 

(g) Each Employee Plan has been operated and administered (including with
respect to required contributions thereunder) in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and applicable law, including but not limited to
ERISA and the IRC.

(h) Each Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
IRC is so qualified and has received a favorable determination or opinion
letter as to its qualification. To the Knowledge of Seller, nothing has
occurred since the date of determination of such qualification and exemption
that would reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the qualified
or exempt status of such Employee Plan or trust. Each Employee Plan intended
to satisfy the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the IRC has satisfied
such requirements in all material respects.

(i) Except as disclosed in  _Schedule 5.12(i)(A)_ , no Employee Plan provides
medical, surgical, hospitalization, death or similar benefits coverage
(whether or not insured) for Employees or Former Employees for periods
extending beyond their retirement or other termination of service, other than
(A) coverage mandated by Section 4980B of the IRC, Section 601 et seq of
ERISA, or comparable provisions of state law, (B) death benefits under any
pension plan, or (C) benefits the full cost of which is borne by the Employee
or Former Employee (or in either case, his beneficiary).

 



27 (j) No amounts payable under the Employee Plans will fail to be deductible for
federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G of the IRC as a result
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(k) Except as disclosed in _Schedule 5.12(k)_ , the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in
combination with another event, (i) entitle any Employee or Former Employee to
severance pay or any other payment, or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due an Employee or Former
Employee.

(l) Except as would not result in material cost or liability to Buyer or its
Affiliates, there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, Threatened
or anticipated claims, liens, lawsuits or complaints by or on behalf of any
Employee Plan, by any Employee, Former Employee or beneficiary thereof covered
under any such Employee Plan, or otherwise involving any such Employee Plan
(other than routine claims for benefits).

(m) Except as disclosed in _Schedule 5.12(m)_ , (i) Seller has no plan,
contract or commitment, whether legally binding or not, to create any
additional employee benefit or compensation plans, policies or arrangements
or, except as may be required by applicable law, to modify any Employee Plan,
and (ii) each Employee Plan that provides medical, surgical, hospitalization,
death or similar benefits coverage (whether or not insured) for Employees or
Former Employees for periods extending beyond their retirement or other
termination of service may be amended, modified or terminated at any time
without incurring liability thereunder, other than medical or welfare claims
incurred prior to such amendment or termination.

 

(n) The only representations and warranties given in respect of employee
benefit matters are those contained in this Section 5.12, the Employee
Agreement and, to the extent related to the funding (or underfunding) of any
Employee Plan, Section 5.5, and none of the other representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute, directly
or indirectly, a representation or warranty in respect of employee benefit
matters.

Section 5.13 Employee and Labor Matters.

(a) _Schedule 5.13(a)_ lists all collective bargaining agreements, works
council agreements, labor union contracts, trade union agreements, and other
agreements (each a "Collective Bargaining Agreement") with any union, works

reasonably likely to cause, any representation or warranty of the notifying
party to be inaccurate or that is reasonably likely to result in the non-
fulfillment of any of the conditions to the consummation of the transactions
hereunder. Except as expressly provided in Section 6.1(b), neither such notice
nor the receiving partys resulting knowledge of the matters disclosed therein

transactions under this Agreement

(d) _Confidentiality_. From and after the Closing Date, Seller shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates and their respective Representatives to, keep
confidential and not disclose any information relating to the Business

Representatives at the time of the Closing or subsequently obtained by Seller,
any Affiliate of Seller or any such Representative from Buyer pursuant
to this Agreement or any Related Document) ("Restricted Information"), and
shall not directly or indirectly use such Restricted Information for any
purpose, except as and to the extent permitted by the terms of this Agreement
or any Related Document. The obligation to keep such Restricted Information
confidential shall continue indefinitely from the Closing Date and shall not
apply to any information which (i) is in the public domain, (ii) is published
or otherwise becomes part of the public domain through no fault of Seller,
any of its Affiliates or any of their Representatives or (iii) becomes
available to Seller, any of its Affiliates or any of their Representatives on
a non-confidential basis from a source that did not acquire such information
(directly or indirectly) from Seller or Buyer on a confidential basis.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller may make disclosures required by law;
_provided_ , that Seller, to the extent practicable, shall provide Buyer with
prompt notice thereof so that Buyer may seek a protective order or other
appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section
6.1(d). In the event that such protective order or other remedy is
not obtained or Buyer waives compliance with the provisions of this Section
6.1(d), Seller shall, or shall cause the Person required to disclose such
Restricted Information to, furnish only that portion of the information that
such Person is advised by an opinion of Sellers counsel is legally required,

efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment is accorded
the Restricted Information so furnished.

 



36 (e) _Non-Solicitation of Employees_. Except as otherwise set forth in Section
2.3 of the Employee Agreement, for a period of two (2) years after the
Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, without
the prior written approval of Buyer, directly or indirectly, solicit,
encourage, entice or induce any Transferred Employee or any other employee of
Buyer or its Affiliates to terminate his or her employment with Buyer or any
of its Affiliates; _provided, however_ , that such prohibition shall not apply
to any person who responds to a general solicitation.

(f) _Assets Owned by Affiliates_. Prior to or at the Closing, Seller shall
cause each of its Affiliates that holds any interest in any of the Assets as

Affiliates created thereby shall be deemed an Excluded Liability).

Section 6.2 Covenants of Buyer. Buyer agrees to observe and perform the
following covenants and agreements:

(a) _Access to Information_. After Closing, Buyer will, and will cause its
Representatives to, at no cost to Buyer or its Representatives, afford to
Seller, including its Representatives, on reasonable notice and at reasonable
times, reasonable access to all books, records, files and documents related to
the Business in order to permit Seller to prepare and file its Tax Returns
and to prepare for and participate in any investigation with respect thereto,
to prepare for and participate in any other investigation and defend any
Proceedings relating to or involving Seller or the Business for which Seller
may be responsible, to discharge its obligations under this Agreement and the
other Related Documents to which it is a party and for other reasonable
purposes and will afford Seller reasonable assistance in connection therewith.
Buyer will cause such records to be maintained for not less than seven (7)
years from the Closing Date and will not dispose of such records without first
offering in writing to deliver them to Seller; _provided, however,_ that in
the event that Buyer transfers all or a portion of the Business to any third
party during such period, Buyer may transfer to such third party all or a
portion of the books, records, files and documents related thereof, _provided_
such third party transferee expressly assumes in writing the obligations of
Buyer under this Section 6.2(a). In addition, on and after the Closing Date,
at Sellers request, Buyer shall make available to Seller and its Affiliates
and Representatives, on reasonable notice and at reasonable times, those
employees of Buyer reasonably requested by Seller in connection with any
Proceeding, including to provide testimony, to be deposed, to act as witnesses
and to assist counsel; _provided, however,_ that (i) such access to such
employees shall not unreasonably interfere with the normal conduct of the
operations of Buyer and (ii) Seller shall reimburse Buyer for the out-of-
pocket costs reasonably incurred by Buyer in making such employees available
to Seller. Without limiting the application of Section 6.1(d), all documents
or information furnished by Buyer or obtained by Seller or its Representatives

Section 6.2(b), commercially reasonable efforts shall include: (i) Buyers
assumption of the Contracts on the terms set forth in this Agreement; and (ii)
an obligation on the part of Buyer to provide a guaranty, letter of credit,

(90) days after the Closing Date but effective as of the Closing Date, an
equivalent surety instrument (upon substantially the same terms as such surety

shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates for any
and all Losses (in each case without deduction or set off) incurred on
account of Sellers guarantees, letters of credit, bonds and other surety
instruments on or after the Closing Date insofar as such Losses relate to any
failure of Buyer to perform or discharge any Assumed Liability on or after the
Closing.

reasonable best efforts to take promptly any steps necessary to obtain

Effect.

39  in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and will
permit the other party to review any communication given by it to, and consult
with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, any such
Governmental Body or, in connection with any Proceeding by a private party,
with such other Person, and to the extent permitted by such Governmental Body
or other Person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and to
participate in such meetings and conferences. Buyer shall use its reasonable
best efforts to (i) take promptly any and all steps necessary to resolve the
issues raised by the MPSC, its Staff or parties to the proceedings before the
MPSC in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(ii) obtain approval from the MPSC as promptly as practicable in order to
allow the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement no
later than the End Date, including committing to and effecting, by
stipulation, settlement or otherwise, conditions on Buyer or the Assets
imposed by the MPSC, including the conditions approved by the MPSC in the Non-
Unanimous Stipulation and Agreement in Case No. GM-2011-0412; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer shall not be required or obligated (and shall not be
obligated to cause any of its subsidiaries) to take any action if such action
would have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 6.4 Seller Marks. No later than one hundred eighty (180) days after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall cease using any names, marks, trade names,
trademarks and corporate symbols and logos incorporating "Southern Union",
"Southern," "SU" and "SUG" (collectively and together with all other names,
marks, trade names, trademarks and corporate symbols and logos owned by
Seller or any of its Affiliates, other than those included in the Assets, the
"Seller Marks") and shall remove from the Assets any and all Seller Marks.
Thereafter, except as required by Legal Requirement or with the prior written
consent of Seller, Buyer shall not use any Seller Mark or any name or term
confusingly similar to any Seller Mark in connection with the sale of any
products or services, in the corporate or doing business name of any of its
Affiliates or otherwise in the conduct of its or any of its Affiliates
businesses or operations. In the event that Buyer breaches this Section 6.4,
Seller shall be entitled to specific performance of this Section 6.4 and to
injunctive relief against further violations, as well as any other remedies at
law or in equity available to Seller.

Section 6.5 Acknowledgment by Buyer. In order to induce Seller to enter into
and perform this Agreement and the Related Documents, Buyer acknowledges and
agrees with Seller as follows: 

THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RELATED
DOCUMENTS CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF
SELLER TO BUYER IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND
THEREBY, AND THERE ARE NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS,
UNDERSTANDINGS OR AGREEMENTS, ORAL OR WRITTEN, IN RELATION THERETO BETWEEN
THE PARTIES OTHER THAN THOSE INCORPORATED HEREIN AND THEREIN. EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
RELATED DOCUMENTS, BUYER

 



40  DISCLAIMS RELIANCE ON ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, BY OR ON BEHALF OF SELLER OR ITS AFFILIATES OR REPRESENTATIVES.
WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 5.14, THERE ARE NO REPRESENTATIONS
OR WARRANTIES OF SELLER WITH RESPECT COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND
ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITS OR THE PRESENCE OR RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS MATERIAL IN
THE FIXTURES, SOILS, GROUNDWATER, SURFACE WATER OR AIR ON, UNDER OR ABOUT OR
EMANATING FROM ANY OF THE PROPERTIES OR ASSETS OF SELLER.

Section 6.6 Continuing Services. Within fifteen (15) days after the execution
date of this Agreement, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a list of its proposed
Representatives to a joint continuing services team, which shall include
individuals with expertise from various functional specialties associated or
involved in providing billing, payroll and other support services provided to
the Business by any automated or manual process using facilities or employees
that are not included among the Assets or Transferred Employees. Seller will
add its Representatives to such team within fifteen (15) days after receipt of
Buyers list. Such team will be responsible for preparing as soon as
reasonably practicable after the execution date of this Agreement, and timely
implementing, a continuing services plan that will identify and describe
substantially all of the various continuing services activities that
the parties will cause to occur before and after the Closing and any other
transfer of control matters that any party reasonably believes should be
addressed in such continuing services plan, substantially in the form attached
hereto as  _Exhibit 6.6_ (the "Continuing Services Agreement"). Buyer and
Seller shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause their
Representatives on such continuing services team to cooperate in good faith
and take all reasonable steps necessary to develop a mutually acceptable
continuing services plan. The specific continuing services activities will be
mutually agreed upon and more fully set forth in a definitive Continuing
Services Agreement to be executed and delivered by Buyer and Seller at the
Closing.

Section 6.7 Risk of Loss. The risk of any loss, damage,
impairment, confiscation or condemnation of any of the Assets from any cause
whatsoever shall be borne by Seller at all times prior to the Closing, and by
Buyer at all times thereafter (subject to the representations and warranties
of Seller set forth in this Agreement and the Related Documents and Buyers
rights to indemnification pursuant to Section 12.1). If any such loss, damage,
impairment, confiscation or condemnation occurs prior to Closing, Seller shall
apply the proceeds of any insurance policy, judgment or award with respect
thereto to repair, replace or restore the Assets as soon as reasonably
practicable (whether before or after Closing) to their prior condition;
_provided_ , _however_ , anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, Seller shall not be obligated to expend sums in excess of the
proceeds of any insurance policy (together with the amount of any deductible
or self-insured retention), judgment or award with respect to any loss,
damage, impairment, confiscation or condemnation of any of the Assets in order
to repair, replace or restore such Assets to their prior condition. In the
event ("Casualty Event") of any 

 



41  damage or destruction to the Assets which would result in the
nonsatisfaction of a condition precedent to Buyers obligation to consummate
this Agreement, Buyer at its option, may proceed to close this Agreement on
the Closing Date, in which event Seller shall pay or assign to Buyer (together
with the amount of any deductible or self-insured retention) the proceeds from
any insurance policies covering Assets subject to the Casualty Event to the
extent such proceeds are received by or payable to Seller and have not been
used in or committed to the restoration or replacement of Assets subject to
the Casualty Event as of the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt,
the determination of whether there has been any damage or destruction to the
Assets which would result in the nonsatisfaction of a condition precedent to
Buyers obligation to consummate this Agreement shall only take into account
those repairs, replacements and restorations that have actually taken place.

Section 6.8 Outstanding Payments and Bank Accounts. 

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, (i) to the
extent elected by Buyer prior to the Closing, all of the bank accounts and
lock boxes of Seller used in or in connection with the Business shall be
considered "Assets" for purposes of this Agreement and shall be transferred to
Buyer at the Closing, (ii) any checks that are in the possession of Seller at
the Closing that relate to accounts receivable (or any other asset) included
in the Assets shall be transferred to Buyer at the Closing and (iii) any
checks that are in the possession of Seller at the Closing that relate to
accounts receivable (or any other asset) not included in the Assets shall be
retained by Seller.

(b) From and after the Closing, (i) if Seller or any of its Affiliates
receives or collects any funds relating to any accounts receivable (or any
other asset) included in the Assets, Seller or its Affiliates shall remit any
such amounts to Buyer as promptly as practicable but no later than ten (10)
days after Seller or any of its Affiliates receives such sum, and (ii) Seller
and its Affiliates shall promptly forward all mail, remittances, receipts or
other mailings received by any of them relating to the Business to Buyer.

Section 6.9 Financing.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Financing Letter, after giving effect to the market flex
terms in the Fee Letter, and shall not permit any amendment or modification to
be made to (other than to amend the Financing Letter to add lenders,
lead arrangers, book runners, syndication agents or similar entities who had
not executed the Financing Letter as of the date of this Agreement), or any
waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Financing Letter or the Fee
Letter, if such amendment, modification or waiver (i) reduces the aggregate
amount of the Financing or (ii) imposes new or additional conditions or other
terms or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the
receipt of the Financing or other terms in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to (x) delay or prevent the Closing (y) make the timely funding of
the Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing
less likely to occur or (z) adversely impact the ability of Buyer to enforce
its rights against the other parties to the Financing Letter or the definitive

 



42  agreements with respect thereto; _provided_ that Buyer shall have the right
to substitute other financing for all or any portion of the Financing from the
same and/or alternative financing sources; _provided_ , _further_ , that such
substitution shall only be permitted if (i) the terms thereof would not be
reasonably expected to delay or prevent the Closing or make the timely funding
of the Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing
less likely to occur and (ii) the conditions to the Financing set forth in the
Financing Letter would not be expanded or modified in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing, _provided_ , _still
further_ , that any such substitute financing shall not obligate any of Seller
or its Affiliates as a surety, guarantor or indemnitor or to extend credit to
any Person. Any reference in this Agreement to (A) "Financing," shall include
the financing contemplated by the Financing Letter as amended or modified in
compliance with this Section 6.9(a) and (B) "Financing Letter," and "Fee
Letter" shall include such documents as amended or modified in compliance
with this Section 6.9(a).

(b) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts (i) to maintain in effect the
Financing Letter in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions
thereof, (ii) to negotiate and enter into all definitive agreements with
respect to the Financing on the terms and conditions contained in the
Financing Letter, including the market flex provisions in the Fee Letter, and
(iii) to satisfy all conditions to such definitive agreements and consummate
the Financing at or prior to the Closing. Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably
apprised of the status of the Financing and developments with respect thereto
(including giving Seller prompt notice of any material change with respect to
such Financing) and shall provide to Seller copies of all material
definitive documents related to the Financing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Buyer agrees to notify Seller promptly, and in
any event within two (2) Business Days, if at any time (x) the Financing
Letter shall expire or be terminated for any reason, (y) any of the other
parties to the Financing Letter notify Buyer that such party no longer intends
to provide financing on the terms set forth therein or (z) to Buyers
knowledge (without a requirement of due inquiry), any of the other parties to
the Financing Letter is or is alleged to be in breach or default thereunder.

(c) To the extent necessary to complete the transactions contemplated hereby,
Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the parties providing
Financing to fund on the Closing Date the Financing required to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and the other transactions contemplated by
the Financing Letter, including by taking enforcement action, if all
conditions in the Financing Letter and all conditions to Closing contained in
this Agreement are satisfied or waived, or upon funding will be satisfied.

(d) If the Financing Letter shall be terminated or modified in a manner
materially adverse to Buyer, if the Financing Letter shall be materially
breached or repudiated by the other parties to the Financing Letter, or if any
portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Financing Letter (other than as a result of obtaining
substitute debt financing in accordance with Section 6.9(a)) (such event, an
"Original Financing Failure"), Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange promptly to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on
terms and conditions not less favorable to Buyer than those contained in the
Financing Letter and the Fee Letter and in an amount at least

 



43  equal to the Financing or such unavailable portion thereof, as the case may
be (the "Alternate Financing"), and to obtain a new financing commitment
letter with respect to such Alternate Financing (the "New Financing Letter"),
which shall replace the existing Financing Letter, _provided_ that any such
Alternate Financing shall not obligate any of Seller or its Affiliates as a
surety, guarantor or indemnitor or to extend credit to any Person (the terms
described in this proviso "Prohibited Alternate Terms"). Buyer shall not
execute a New Financing Letter or consummate any Alternate Financing, without
the written consent of Seller, if (i) the terms of the New Financing Letter
or Alternate Financing are, in the aggregate, less favorable to the Seller
than the Financing Letter or the Financing (without giving effect to the
Original Financing Failure), (ii) the terms thereof would be reasonably
expected to delay or prevent the Closing or make the timely funding of the
Alternate Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
Alternate Financing less likely to occur, as compared to the Financing Letter
and the Financing (without giving effect to the Original Financing Failure) or
(iii) the conditions to the Alternate Financing set forth in the New Financing
Letter would be expanded or modified in a manner that would reasonably
be expected to delay or prevent the Closing, as compared to the Financing
Letter and the Financing (without giving effect to the Original Financing
Failure). Buyer shall promptly provide a true, correct and complete copy of
such New Financing Letter to Seller. In the event any New Financing Letter is
obtained, (i) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing" shall mean
the financing contemplated by the Financing Letter as modified pursuant to
clause (ii) below, (ii) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing
Letter" shall be deemed to include the Financing Letter that is not superseded
by a New Financing Letter at the time in question and the New Financing Letter
to the extent then in effect and (iii) any reference in this Agreement to
"Fee Letter" shall be deemed to include any fee or other letter relating to
the Financing Letter that are not superseded by a New Financing Letter at the
time in question and the New Financing Letter to the extent then in effect.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
with the consent of Seller, Buyer shall be entitled to pursue substitute
financing, the terms of which may differ from the terms set forth in the
Financing Letter and such substitute financing may not constitute Alternate
Financing. No actions taken by Buyer, its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives in connection therewith shall in and of itself constitute a
breach of the obligations of Buyer under this Agreement.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in paragraphs (a)-(e)
of this Section 6.9, Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that receipt of the
Financing or Alternate Financing does not constitute a condition to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.10 Financing Cooperation.

(a) For purposes of this Section 6.10, the term "Financing" shall include
any Permanent Financing (as defined in the Financing Letter), whether for
debt, equity or otherwise. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause each of its Affiliates and Representatives
to, use reasonable best efforts to provide to Buyer such cooperation
reasonably requested by Buyer and reasonably required in connection with the
Financing or the Alternate Financing, including (to the extent reasonably
requested and reasonably required):

 

(i) participating in a customary and reasonable number of meetings,
presentations, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions, road shows and
sessions with rating agencies;

 



44 (ii) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating

flows for the Business for the three (3) years ended December 31, 2012 and
(z) within forty-five (45) days of the end of the relevant fiscal quarter,
unaudited interim financial statements for each fiscal quarter ending after
January 1, 2013 (collectively, the "Carve-Out Financials");

(iv) in addition to the information required pursuant to clause (iii), above,
as promptly as reasonably practical, furnishing Buyer and the other parties to
the Financing Letter with financial and other information regarding the
Business and the Assets as may be reasonably requested by Buyer (including

including unaudited interim financial statements, financial data, projections,
audit reports and other information of the type required by Regulation S-X and
Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933 for a registered public
offering, and of type and form customarily included in private placements
under Rule 144A, to consummate the offering(s) of debt or equity securities
contemplated by the Financing, or as otherwise reasonably required in
connection with the Financing, or as otherwise necessary in order to assist in
receiving customary "comfort" (including "negative assurance" comfort) from
independent accountants in connection with the offering(s) of debt or equity
securities contemplated by the Financing (all such information in clause (iii)
and this clause (iv), including the Carve-Out Financials, the "Required
Information");

 

(v) providing information relating to the Business that is reasonably
available to it to assist in the preparation of any credit agreements,

the Financing contemplated by the Financing as may be reasonably requested by
Buyer;

 



45 (vi) furnishing Buyer and their Financing sources as promptly as

the Financing Letter and monthly financial statements for the Business (to the

(vii) assisting Buyer to obtain waivers, consents, estoppels and approvals
from other parties to Contracts, material Leases and Easements, and

(viii) cooperating with Buyer in its efforts to obtain accountants comfort
Letter, consents, legal opinions, surveys, appraisals, engineering reports,
environmental and other inspections, title insurance and other documentation
and items relating to the Financing, as reasonably requested by Buyer;

_provided_ that (A) nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the
extent it would require Seller or any of its Affiliates to waive or amend any
terms of this Agreement, incur any Liabilities, pay any fees, reimburse any
expenses, in each case, with respect to the Financing, prior to the Closing
for which it has not received prior reimbursement by or on behalf of Buyer,
or would cause Seller or any of its Affiliates to breach this Agreement or
become unable to satisfy a condition to the Closing, (B) nothing herein shall
require such cooperation from Seller or its Affiliates to the extent it would
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of Seller or its Affiliates
and (C) there shall be no action, Liability or obligation of Seller or its
Affiliates under any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or
instrument relating to the Financing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Section 6.10, neither Seller nor its Affiliates shall be in breach of
the covenant set forth in this Section 6.10 if it has acted in good faith to
comply with the cooperation and assistance set forth herein.

(b) Buyer shall indemnify the Seller Indemnitees from, against and in respect
of any Losses imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered by, or asserted
against, any of them, directly or indirectly relating to, arising out of or
resulting from the arrangement of the Financing, any other financing and/or
the provision of information utilized in connection therewith to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirement.

(c) Seller will use its reasonable best efforts to update Required Information
provided to Buyer pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) of Section 6.10(a) as may
be necessary such that the Required Information does not contain any untrue
statement of material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.

TERMINATION

Section 9.1 Termination Rights. This Agreement may be terminated in its

(a) By the mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer;

there shall be in effect a Final Order prohibiting, enjoining or restricting
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

(c) By either party in writing if there shall have been a material breach of
any of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement and the

relevant date (not just the date hereof and the Closing Date)) on the part of
the other party, which breach is not cured within thirty (30) days following
receipt by the breaching party of written notice of such breach from the
terminating party, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to
the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither party shall have the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(c) unless the breach
of a representation or warranty, together with all other such breaches, would
entitle the party receiving such representation not to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under Section 7.2(a) (in the case
of a breach of a representation or warranty by Seller) or Section 7.1(a) (in
the case of a breach of a representation or warranty by Buyer) and _provided,

representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein;

 



50 (d) By either party in writing if there shall have been a material breach of
any of the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or in the
Related Documents on the part of the other party, which breach shall not have
been cured within thirty (30) days following receipt by the breaching party of
written notice of such breach from the terminating party, or which breach, by
its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Closing ( _provided_ that the
terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein or in the Related
Documents);

(e) By either party in writing if the Closing has not occurred by the date
that is ten (10) months after the date of this Agreement (the "End Date");
_provided, however,_ that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 9.1(e) will not be available to any party that is in material breach
of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein
or in the Related Documents; and _provided further_ that in the event Sellers
conditions precedent to Closing set forth in Section 7.1(d) or 7.1(e) or
Buyers conditions precedent to Closing set forth in Sections 7.2(d) or
7.2(e) have not been satisfied prior to the End Date but are reasonably
capable of being satisfied thereafter, then either party may, following
written notice to the other, extend the End Date in thirty (30) day
increments (up to an aggregate of one hundred twenty (120) days); or

(f) By Seller, if at Closing Buyer fails to make the payments required to be
made by Buyer at Closing.

Section 9.2 Limitation on Right to Terminate; Effect of Termination.

(a) A party shall not be allowed to exercise any right of
termination pursuant to Section 9.1 if the event giving rise to the
termination right shall be due to the willful failure of such party seeking to
terminate this Agreement to perform or observe in any material respect any of
the covenants or agreements hereunder to be performed or observed by such
party.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated as permitted under Section 9.1 and except
as provided in this Section 9.2(b), such termination shall be without
liability of or to any party to this Agreement, or any shareholder or
Representative of such party; _provided, however,_ that if such termination
shall result from the willful failure of any party to fulfill a condition to
the performance of any other party or to perform a covenant of this Agreement
or from a material and willful breach by any party to this Agreement (it being
understood that the failure to cure a breach shall not, by itself, be a
willful breach of this Agreement), then such party shall (subject to the last
sentence of this Section 9.2(b)) be fully liable for any and all damages
sustained or incurred by the other party;  _provided, however_ , if (i) all
of Buyers and Sellers conditions precedent to Closing have been satisfied
(except with respect to the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 4.4), (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to Section
9.1(d) due to a breach of Buyers covenants in Section 6.9 or Section 6.10 of
this Agreement, or Section 9.1(e) or Section 9.1(f) of this Agreement and
(iii) Buyer is in violation of

 



51  its representation in Section 4.4 as measured on such date, then Buyer shall
pay to Seller an amount (the "Buyer Termination Fee") equal to $73,125,000.00,
by wire transfer of same day federal funds to the account specified by
Seller, within two (2) business days after any such termination.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Buyer
Termination Fee is required to be paid as a result of a termination of this
Agreement, Sellers right to receive the Buyer Termination Fee pursuant to
this Section 9.2(b) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of Seller and its Affiliates, as
applicable, against Buyer, The Laclede Group, Inc., and their respective
Affiliates, and upon payment of the Buyer Termination Fee in accordance with
this Section 9.2(b), none of Buyer, The Laclede Group, Inc. and any of
their respective stockholders, directors, officers, agents or other
representatives, shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. If prior to Closing either party to this Agreement resorts to
legal proceedings to enforce this Agreement, the prevailing party in such
proceedings shall be entitled to recover all costs incurred by such party
including reasonable attorneys fees, in addition to any other relief to
which such party may be entitled; _provided, however,_ and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 9.2(b), in no event shall either
party be entitled to receive any punitive, exemplary, special,
remote, speculative, indirect or consequential damages (including any damages
on account of lost profits or opportunities) in connection with any
termination of this Agreement.

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

 

Section 10.1 Employee Agreement. The parties have addressed the transfer of
employees and employee benefit matters in a separate agreement, entitled
Employee Agreement, executed and delivered as of even date herewith, the terms
and provisions of which agreement are incorporated into this Agreement as if
fully set forth herein and a copy of which is attached hereto as  _Exhibit
10.1_ (the "Employee Agreement").

ARTICLE XI

 

TAX MATTERS

Section 11.1 Purchase Price Allocation. Within one hundred eighty (180) days
after the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall use their good faith efforts to
agree upon the allocation (the "Allocation") of the Purchase Price (plus
Assumed Liabilities, to the extent properly taken into account under the IRC),
as adjusted pursuant to Section 3.2, among the Assets for U.S. federal (and
applicable state and local) income Tax purposes in accordance with Section
1060 of the IRC and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. If Buyer and Seller
are unable to resolve any dispute regarding the Allocation within such one
hundred eighty (180) day period, such dispute shall be resolved promptly by
the CPA Firm, the costs of which shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller.
If the Purchase Price is adjusted pursuant to this Agreement, the Allocation
shall be adjusted as mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller. Buyer and Seller
covenant and agree that (a) Buyer and Seller shall file all Tax Returns
(including, but not limited to, IRS Form 8594) consistent with the Allocation,
and (b) neither Buyer nor Seller will take any Tax position before
any Governmental Body or in any Proceeding with respect to Tax that is in any
way inconsistent

 



52  with such Allocation; _provided, however,_ that nothing contained herein
shall prevent Buyer or Seller from settling any proposed Tax deficiency or
adjustment by any Governmental Body based upon or arising out of the
Allocation, and neither Buyer nor Seller shall be required to litigate before
any court any proposed Tax deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Body
challenging such Allocation. Each of Buyer and Seller agrees to provide the
other promptly with any other information reasonably required to complete Form
8594 and Form 8883 (and any similar forms required for state or local Tax
purposes). Each of Buyer and Seller shall notify the other in the event of
an examination, audit or other proceeding regarding the Allocation determined
under this Section 11.1.

Section 11.2 Cooperation with Respect to Like-Kind Exchange. Buyer agrees
that Seller may, at Sellers election at or prior to the Closing Date, direct
that all or a portion of the Purchase Price be delivered to a "qualified
intermediary" (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1031(k) - 1(g)(4))
identified by Seller (a "Qualified Intermediary") in order to enable Sellers
relinquishment of the Assets to qualify as part of a like-kind exchange
of property covered by Section 1031 of the IRC and any corresponding state
income Tax provision. If Seller so elects, Buyer shall cooperate with Seller
in connection with Sellers efforts to effect such like-kind exchange, which
cooperation shall include, without limitation, taking such actions as Seller
requests in order to enable Seller to qualify such transfer as part of a like-
kind exchange of property covered by Section 1031 of the IRC (including any
actions required to facilitate the use of a Qualified Intermediary.)
Notwithstanding anything herein, the structuring of the transactions in a
manner that qualifies the transactions as part of a like-kind exchange shall
not be a condition to Closing. Buyer agrees that Seller may assign all or
part of its rights and delegate all or part of its obligations under this
Agreement to a Qualified Intermediary to qualify the transfer of the Assets as
part of a like-kind exchange of property covered by Section 1031 of the IRC
and any corresponding state income Tax provision. Any and all representations,
obligations, agreements, warranties and covenants made by Seller to Buyer in
connection with this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and
continue to inure to the benefit of Buyer, notwithstanding any assignment of
this Agreement to a Qualified Intermediary in connection with such Section
1031 exchange. Nothing in this Section 11.2 shall in any manner relieve Seller
from any of its obligations under this Agreement, and Seller shall remain
primarily liable to Buyer pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Buyer and
Seller agree in good faith to use reasonable efforts to coordinate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any other transactions
engaged in by either Buyer or Seller; _provided_ that such efforts do not
result in an unreasonable delay in the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Buyers cooperation and actions taken
pursuant to this Section 11.2 shall not increase Buyers liabilities or
obligations pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and Seller shall
indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from any out-of-pocket cost or expense
(including but not limited to legal fees, opinions of counsel or other costs
incurred in implementing any transaction under this Section 11.2), or any
obligation or liability incurred by Buyer in connection with any action taken
by Buyer under this Section 11.2 or such Section 1031 exchange.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 11.2, in no event
shall Seller transfer title to any of the Assets to any Person other than
directly to Buyer or its designee. 

 



53 Section 11.3 Transaction Taxes. All transfer, documentary, recording,
notarial, sales, use, registration, stamp and other similar taxes, fees and
expenses (including, but not limited to, all applicable stock transfer, real
estate transfer or conveyance Taxes and including any penalties, interest and
additions to such tax) ("Transaction Taxes") incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne one-half by
Buyer and one-half by Seller, regardless of whether the Tax authority seeks to
collect such Taxes from Seller or Buyer. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in
timely making and filing all Tax Returns as may be required to comply with the
provisions of laws relating to such Transaction Taxes. Seller shall prepare
all tax filings related to any Transaction Taxes, which shall be subject to
the reasonable review of Buyer, and also shall notify Buyer of any claimed
material exemptions from Transaction Taxes for which no filing is required
which shall be subject to the reasonable review of Buyer.

Section 11.4 Real and Personal Property Taxes. All real (including public
utility realty tax) and personal property Taxes and assessments arising with
respect to the Assets and any similar utility Taxes of any other jurisdiction
shall be prorated between Buyer and Seller based on the relative periods of
time the Assets were owned by each respective party or their respective
Affiliates during the fiscal period for which such Taxes are imposed by the
applicable taxing jurisdiction (as such fiscal period is or may be reflected
on the bill rendered by such taxing jurisdiction, but in the case of
Taxes imposed based on the specific day of ownership of assets or other
specified standard not tied to a fiscal period, a fiscal period shall be
deemed to be the three hundred sixty five (365) day period ending with such
date). Upon receipt by Buyer of the tax bill, invoice or other statement
regarding such real and personal property Taxes, Buyer shall calculate the
_pro rata_ share of such tax bill, invoice or other statement attributable to
Buyer and Seller. To the extent such Taxes have not otherwise been accrued or
accounted for in the Base Statement or the Final Closing Statement, Buyer then
shall forward, as soon as practicable, to Seller a copy of such tax bill,
invoice or statement along with the supporting documentation relating to the
calculation of the _pro rata_ share to Seller that had not otherwise been
accrued or accounted for in the Base Statement or the Final Closing Statement.
Seller then shall forward to Buyer payment of its _pro rata_ share of such
Taxes in immediately available funds as soon as practicable and in advance of
the due date of the tax bill, invoice or statement and in time to avoid the
incurrence of penalties, interest or other increases or additions to such
Taxes. In the event Seller first receives a tax bill, invoice or statement
relating to the Assets from a taxing authority, Seller shall promptly forward
such tax bill, invoice or statement to Buyer.

 

Section 11.5 Other Taxes. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 11.3 and
11.4, and subject to the provisions and limitations in Article XII, Seller
shall indemnify Buyer from and against and in respect of any and all Losses
incurred by Buyer, which may be imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered by
or assessed against Buyer, directly or indirectly, to the extent relating to
or arising from (a) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of Seller or with
respect to the Assets for all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing
Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle
Period deemed to end on the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Tax Period"), (b) all
Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group
of which Seller (or any predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was a
member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury
Regulation §1.1502-6 or any

 



54  analogous or similar state, local, or foreign law or regulation, (c) any and
all Taxes of any Person (other than Seller) imposed on Seller as a transferee
or successor, by contract (excluding customary Tax indemnification provisions
in commercial contracts not primarily relating to Taxes) or pursuant to any
law, rule, or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction
occurring before the Closing, and (d) any Taxes of Seller that do not relate
to the Business or the Assets purchased pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 11.6 Straddle Period. In the case of any taxable period that includes
(but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the amount of
any Taxes based on or measured by income or receipts of Seller for the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the
books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose,
the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which
Seller holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time)
and the amount of other Taxes of Seller for a Straddle Period that relates to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for
the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

Section 11.7 Cooperation on Tax Matters. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Article XI and any
audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the other Partys request) the provision
of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder.

 

Section 11.8 Tax Returns. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 11.3 and
11.4,

 

(a) Seller shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed when due
(including extensions) all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by
Seller with respect to the Assets for taxable years or periods ending on or
before the Closing Date that are due on or before the Closing Date, and Seller
shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax
Returns. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
past practice.

(b) Except as provided in Section 11.8(a), Buyer shall prepare and file or
cause to be prepared and filed when due all Tax Returns that are required to
be filed with respect to the Assets for taxable years or periods ending on or
before the Closing Date. At least twenty (20) days prior to filing any such
Tax Return, Buyer shall submit a copy of such Tax Return to Seller for
Sellers review. Buyer shall consider in good faith any comment that Seller
submits to Buyer no less than ten (10) days prior to the due date of such Tax
Returns. Buyer shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of
such Tax Returns.

 

Section 11.9 Effect of Indemnity Payments. Buyer and Seller hereby agree that
any and all indemnity payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall, to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable law, be treated for all Tax purposes as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

 



55 Section 11.10 Survival of Obligations. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, the obligations of Buyer and Seller set forth in this
Article XI shall not be subject to any restrictions or limitations other than
those expressly set forth in this Article XI and shall survive the Closing.

 

ARTICLE XII

 

INDEMNIFICATION

Section 12.1 Indemnification by Seller. From and after Closing and subject to
the other provisions of this Article XII, Seller shall indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer, its Representatives, Affiliates, and each of their successors
and permitted assigns (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnitees") from and against
any and all Losses actually incurred by a Buyer Indemnitee, and resulting
from:

 

(a) (i) any representations and warranties made by Seller in this Agreement or
in any Related Document not being true and correct when made, or (ii) any
representations and warranties made by Seller in this Agreement or any Related
Document not being true and correct as of the Closing Date, each of which
representations and warranties will be deemed for purposes of this Section
12.1(a)(ii) to have been made by Seller as of the Closing Date, except that
those representations and warranties that are made as of a specific date will
be deemed for purposes of this Section 12.1(a)(ii) to have been made
by Seller as of such specific date;

(b) any breach or default by Seller in the performance of its covenants,
agreements, or obligations under this Agreement or any Related Document;

(c) the Retained Liabilities; and

 

(d) the Excluded Assets.

Section 12.2 Indemnification by Buyer. From and after Closing and subject to
the other provisions of this Article XII, Buyer shall indemnify and hold
harmless Seller, its Representatives, Affiliates, and each of their
successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees") from
and against any and all Losses actually incurred by a Seller Indemnitee, and
resulting from:

 

(a) (i) any representations and warranties made by Buyer in this Agreement or
in any Related Document not being true and correct when made, or (ii) any
representations and warranties made by Buyer in this Agreement or any Related
Document not being true and correct as of the Closing Date, each of which
representations and warranties will be deemed for purposes of this Section
12.2(a)(ii) to have been made by Buyer as of the Closing Date, except that
those representations and warranties that are made as of a specific date will
be deemed for purposes of this Section 12.2(a)(ii) to have been made by
Buyer as of such specific date;

(b) any breach or default by Buyer in the performance of its covenants,
agreements, or obligations under this Agreement or any Related Document; and

(c) the Assumed Liabilities.

 



56 Section 12.3 Limitations on Sellers Liability. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, the liability of Seller under this
Agreement and any documents delivered in connection herewith or contemplated
hereby shall be limited as follows:

 

(a) EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT ARISING OUT OF FRAUD, CRIMINAL MISREPRESENTATION OR
WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, IN NO EVENT SHALL SELLER BE LIABLE TO THE BUYER
INDEMNITEES FOR ANY EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL,
REMOTE OR SPECULATIVE DAMAGES; _provided, however,_ that if Buyer is held
liable to a third party for any of such damages and Seller is obligated to
indemnify Buyer for the matter that gave rise to such damages, then Seller
shall be liable for, and obligated to reimburse Buyer for, such damages.

(b) Except as provided below, the representations and warranties of Seller set
forth in this Agreement or any Related Document shall survive the Closing
until the date that is twenty-four (24) months after the Closing Date;
_provided however_ , that (i) the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 5.1 (Organization, Existence and Qualification), Section 5.2
(Authority Relative to this Agreement and Binding Effect), in the first and
last sentences of Section 5.4(a) (Title to Assets; Encumbrances), and in
Section 5.17 (Brokers) shall survive indefinitely, and (ii) the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 5.8 (Taxes), 5.12
(Employee Benefit Matters) and 5.13 (Employee and Labor Matters) and in the
Employee Agreement shall survive for a period equal to the applicable statute
of limitations (giving effect to any extensions or waivers thereof). The other
terms of this Agreement and the Related Documents, including the covenants
and agreements made in connection herewith and therewith, shall survive the
Closing. All representations and warranties, covenants and agreements of
Seller under this Agreement and the indemnities granted by Seller in Section
12.1 shall terminate at 5:00 p.m., Central time, on the applicable survival
termination date set forth above; _provided, however,_ that such indemnities
shall continue to survive with respect only to any specific matter that is
the subject of a proper Claim Notice delivered in good faith in compliance
with the requirements of this Section 12.3 until the earlier to occur of (i)
the date on which a final nonappealable resolution of the matter described in
such Claim Notice has been reached, including the determination of all related
Losses, if any, regardless of when such Losses are finally determined or (ii)
the date on which the matter described in such Claim Notice has otherwise
reached final resolution, including the determination of all related Losses,
if any, regardless of when such Losses are finally determined. In no event
shall any amounts be recovered from Seller under Section 12.1 or otherwise for
any matter for which a Claim Notice is not delivered to Seller prior to the
close of business on the applicable expiration date set forth above.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall Seller indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees, or be otherwise liable in any
way whatsoever to the Buyer Indemnitees, for any Losses (determined after
giving effect to the other provisions of this Section 12.3) otherwise subject
to indemnification by Seller pursuant to Section 12.1(a) (other than in
respect of any claim for any inaccuracy or breach (or deemed inaccuracy or

 



57  breach) of the representations and warranties contained in Section 5.4(a),
which claims shall not be subject to the limitations set forth in this Section
12.3(c)) until the Buyer Indemnitees have incurred Losses otherwise
indemnifiable pursuant to Section 12.1(a) that in the aggregate exceed
$10,000,000.00 (the "Deductible"), after which Seller shall then be liable for
all Losses incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees that are indemnifiable pursuant
to Section 12.1(a) in excess of such amount up to the maximum amount set forth
in Section 12.3(d). Losses subject to indemnification by Seller pursuant to
Section 12.1(a) (other than in respect of any claim for any inaccuracy or
breach (or deemed inaccuracy or breach) of the representations and warranties
contained in Section 5.4(a)) relating to any single breach or series of
related breaches by Seller shall not constitute Losses, and therefore shall
not be applied toward the Deductible or be indemnifiable hereunder, unless
such Losses relating to any single breach or series of related breaches exceed
$100,000.00. For purposes of this Section 12.3, the Losses resulting from any
breach of the representations and warranties of Seller (other than the
representations and warranties of Seller in Section 5.11 and the last sentence
of Section 5.15) shall be determined without regard to the effect of any
qualifications relating to materiality or Material Adverse Effect (it being
understood that such qualifications shall not be disregarded for purposes of
determining whether or not any breaches of such representations or warranties
have occurred).

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) in no
event shall Seller indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees, or be otherwise liable in
any way whatsoever to the Buyer Indemnitees, for any Losses (determined after
giving effect to the other provisions of this Section 12.3) otherwise subject
to indemnification by Seller pursuant to Section 12.1(a) (other than in
respect of any claim for any inaccuracy or breach (or deemed inaccuracy or
breach) of the representations and warranties contained in Section 5.4(a))
that in the aggregate exceed $100,000,000.00, and (ii) in no event shall
Seller indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees, or be otherwise liable in any way
whatsoever to the Buyer Indemnitees, for any Losses (determined after giving
effect to the other provisions of this Section 12.3) otherwise subject to
indemnification by Seller pursuant to Section 12.1(a) (solely in respect of
any claim for any inaccuracy or breach (or deemed inaccuracy or breach) of the
representations and warranties contained in Section 5.4(a)) that in
the aggregate exceed the Purchase Price.

(e) Seller shall have no liability for the portion of any claim or Loss for
which Buyer has recovered or has been specifically authorized to recover
through rates; _provided, however_ , that Buyer shall have made a good faith
effort to recover any such claim or Loss through rates and that such recovery
is not indeterminable due to the terms of any rate settlement agreed to by
Buyer. No cost or expense relating to any such claim or Loss that is actually
recovered on the basis of the foregoing shall be included in determining the
extent of Losses suffered by the Buyer Indemnitees for purposes of Section
12.3(c) or Section 12.3(d). If at any time subsequent to the receipt by a
Buyer Indemnitee of an indemnity payment from Seller hereunder, such Buyer
Indemnitee (or any Affiliate thereof) receives any recovery, settlement or
other similar payment with respect to the Loss for which it receives such
indemnity payment, such Buyer Indemnitee shall promptly pay to Seller an
amount equal to the amount of such recovery, less any expense incurred by
such Buyer Indemnitee (or its Affiliates) in connection with such recovery,
but in no event shall any such payment exceed the amount of such indemnity
payment.

 



58 (f) Seller shall have no liability for the portion of any claim or Loss to the
extent (but only to the extent) the liability for such Loss was reflected in
Net Assets and taken into account in determining the Final Purchase Price.

(g) Notwithstanding any language contained in any Related Document (including
deeds and other conveyance documents relating to the Real Property), any
representations and warranties of Seller set forth in any Related Document,
the indemnification obligations of Seller, and the limitations on such
obligations, set forth in this Agreement shall control. No provision set forth
in any such Related Document shall be deemed to enlarge, alter or amend
the terms or provisions of this Article XII.

Section 12.4 Limitation on Buyers Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT ARISING
OUT OF FRAUD, CRIMINAL MISREPRESENTATION OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, IN NO EVENT
SHALL BUYER BE LIABLE TO THE SELLER INDEMNITEES FOR ANY EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE,
SPECIAL, REMOTE OR SPECULATIVE DAMAGES; _provided, however,_ that if Seller is
held liable to a third party for any of such damages and Buyer is obligated
to indemnify Seller for the matter that gave rise to such damages, then Buyer
shall be liable for, and obligated to reimburse Seller for, such damages.

 

Section 12.5 Claims Procedure.

(a) All claims for indemnification under Section 12.1 or 12.2, or any other
provision of this Agreement except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, shall be asserted and resolved pursuant to this Article XII. Any
Person claiming indemnification hereunder is referred to as the "Indemnified
Party" and any Person against whom such claims are asserted hereunder is
hereinafter referred to as the "Indemnifying Party." In the event that any
Losses are asserted against or sought to be collected from or Threatened to be
sought from an Indemnified Party by a third party, including a Governmental
Body, said Indemnified Party shall with reasonable promptness provide to the
Indemnifying Party a Claim Notice. If the Indemnified Party fails to notify
the Indemnifying Party of any Losses in accordance with the provisions of this
Article XII in reasonably sufficient time such that the Indemnifying Partys
ability to defend against the Losses is prejudiced, then the Indemnifying
Party shall not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect
to such Losses to the extent (but only to the extent) of such prejudice.
The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from the personal delivery
or receipt of the Claim Notice (the "Notice Period") to notify the Indemnified
Party (i) whether or not it disputes the liability of the Indemnifying
Party to the Indemnified Party hereunder with respect to such Losses and/or
(ii) whether or not it desires, at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party, to defend the Indemnified Party against such Losses;
_provided, however,_ that any Indemnified Party is hereby authorized prior to
and during the Notice Period to file any motion, answer or other pleading that
it shall reasonably deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or
those of the Indemnifying Party (and of which it shall have given notice and
opportunity to comment to the Indemnifying Party) and not prejudicial to the
Indemnifying Party. In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the
Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the
Indemnified Party against

 



59  such Losses and expressly confirms in writing its obligation to indemnify
and hold harmless the Indemnified Party for the Losses that are reasonably
likely to result from such claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right
to defend all appropriate proceedings, and with counsel reasonably acceptable
to the Indemnified Party, which proceedings shall be promptly settled or
prosecuted by them to a final conclusion. If the Indemnified Party desires to
participate in, but not control, any such defense or settlement, it may do so
at its sole cost and expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that the participation
of such claim by counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party will not, in the
reasonable judgment of counsel to the Indemnified Party, create a conflict or
potential conflict of interest between such parties. If requested by the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate with
the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Losses that the
Indemnifying Party elects to contest or, if appropriate and related to the
claim in question, in making any counterclaim against the Person asserting the
third party Losses, or any cross-complaint against any Person. No claim may
be settled or otherwise compromised without the prior written consent of both
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Indemnifying Party may pay, compromise, settle or otherwise dispose
of any claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party only
if (i) such settlement involves only the payment of money, (ii) such payment
is made in full solely by the Indemnifying Party without recourse to the
Indemnified Party, and (iii) such settlement does not impose any obligations
or restrictions on the Indemnified Party of any nature. In no event will the
Indemnifying Party have the authority to agree, without the consent of the
Indemnified Party, to any relief binding on the Indemnified Party other than
the payment of money damages by the Indemnifying Party without recourse to the
Indemnified Party.

 

(b) The Indemnified Party shall provide reasonable assistance to the
Indemnifying Party and provide access to its books, records and personnel as
the Indemnifying Party reasonably requests in connection with the
investigation or defense of the Losses. The Indemnifying Party shall promptly,
upon receipt of reasonable supporting documentation, reimburse the Indemnified
Party for out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the latter in
providing the requested assistance.

(c) With regard to third party claims for which Buyer or Seller is entitled
to indemnification under Section 12.1 or 12.2, such indemnification shall be
paid by the Indemnifying Party upon (i) the entry of an Order against the
Indemnified Party and the expiration of any applicable appeal period or (ii)
a settlement with the consent of the Indemnifying Party, _provided_ that no
such consent need be obtained if the Indemnifying Party fails to respond to
the Claim Notice as provided in Section 12.5(a). Notwithstanding the
foregoing but subject to Section 12.5(a), and _provided_ that there is no
dispute as to the applicability of indemnification, expenses of counsel to the
Indemnified Party shall be reimbursed on a current basis by the Indemnifying
Party as if such expenses are a liability of the Indemnifying Party.

Section 12.6 Exclusive Remedy. Except (i) for claims arising out of fraud,
criminal misrepresentation, or willful misconduct, and (ii) as otherwise
provided in Sections 2.4(b), 2.4(c), 3.2(b), 6.1(c)(i), 6.2(b), 6.4, 6.10(b),
9.2, 11.2 and 11.5, the rights, remedies and obligations of the Buyer
Indemnitees and the Seller Indemnitees set forth in this Article XII will

 



60  be the exclusive rights, remedies and obligations of such Persons after the
Closing with respect to all post-Closing claims relating to this Agreement,
the events giving rise to this Agreement and the transactions provided for
herein or contemplated hereby or thereby. Except for claims arising out of
fraud, criminal misrepresentation or willful misconduct, no Proceeding for
termination or rescission, or claiming repudiation, of this Agreement may be
brought or maintained by either party against the other following the Closing
Date no matter how severe, grave or fundamental any breach, default or
nonperformance may be by one party. Accordingly, except as otherwise provided
in this Section 12.6, the parties hereby expressly waive and forego any and
all rights they may possess to bring any such Proceeding.

Section 13.3 Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned, by operation of
law or otherwise, by any party hereto without the prior written consent of
the other party hereto, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller may assign all or part of its
rights or delegate all or part of its duties under this Agreement, without
the prior written consent of Buyer, to a Qualified Intermediary chosen by
Seller to structure all or part of the transactions contemplated hereby as a
like-kind exchange of property covered by 

 



62  Section 1031 of the IRC; _provided_ that no such assignment or delegation
shall relieve Seller of its obligations hereunder, and Seller shall remain
primarily liable to Buyer pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

Section 13.4 Successor Bound. Subject to the provisions of Section 13.3, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

Section 13.5 Governing Law. The validity, performance, and enforcement of this
Agreement, all Related Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, unless expressly provided to the contrary, shall be governed by the
laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to the conflicts of law
provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than
the State of Delaware.

Section 13.6 Construction of Agreement. The terms and provisions of this
Agreement represent the results of negotiations between Buyer and Seller, each
of which has been represented by counsel of its own choosing, and neither of
which has acted under duress or compulsion, whether legal, economic or
otherwise. Accordingly, the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be
interpreted and construed in accordance with their usual and customary
meanings, and Buyer and Seller hereby waive the application in connection with
the interpretation and construction of this Agreement of any rule of law to
the effect that ambiguous or conflicting terms or provisions contained in this
Agreement shall be interpreted or construed against the party whose attorney
prepared the executed draft or any earlier draft of this Agreement. It is
understood and agreed that neither the specification of any dollar amount in
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in the Schedules or Exhibits is intended to
imply that such amounts or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included
or other items, are or are not material, and none of the parties shall use the
fact of the setting of such amounts or the fact of any inclusion of any such
item in the Schedules or Exhibits in any dispute or controversy between the
parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter is or is not material for
purposes hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that all contracts included on
_Schedule 5.11_ are Material Contracts. The word "including" in this
Agreement shall mean including without limitation. Words in the singular shall
be held to include the plural and vice versa and words of one gender shall be
held to include the other genders as the context requires. The terms
"hereof," "herein," and "herewith" and words of similar import shall, unless
otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole
(including all of the Schedules and Exhibits hereto) and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement, and Article, Section, paragraph,
Exhibit and Schedule references are to the Articles, Sections, paragraphs,
Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement unless otherwise specified.

Section 13.7 Publicity. Neither party hereto, nor any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives, shall issue, make or cause the publication of
any press release or other announcement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or otherwise make any disclosures relating
thereto, without the consent of the other party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided, however,_ that such consent shall

 



63  not be required where such release or announcement is required by applicable
law or the rules or regulations of a securities exchange, in which event the
party so required to issue such release or announcement shall endeavor,
wherever possible, to furnish an advance copy of the proposed release to the
other party.

 

Section 13.8 Waiver. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
neither the failure nor any delay on the part of any party to exercise any
right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor
shall any single or partial exercise or waiver of any such right, power or
privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of
any other right, power or privilege available to each party at law or in
equity. The rights and remedies of the parties hereunder are cumulative and
are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would otherwise have
hereunder. 

Section 13.9 Parties in Interest. This Agreement (including the documents and
instruments referred to herein) is not intended to confer upon any Person,
other than the parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns, any
rights or remedies hereunder; _provided, however_ , that the indemnification
provisions in Article XII shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the Buyer Indemnitees and the Seller Indemnitees as provided therein.
Without limiting the foregoing, no provision of this Agreement (including the
documents and instruments referred to herein) creates any rights in any
employee or former employee of Seller (including any beneficiary or dependent
thereof) in respect of continued employment or resumed employment, and no
provision of this Agreement creates any rights in any such Persons in respect
of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any
employee benefit plan or arrangement; _provided_ , _further_ , that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 13.9, each of this
Section 13.9, Section 13.15, Section 13.17 and Section 13.20 is intended to
benefit, and be enforceable by, the Financing Sources and their stockholders,
partners and members.

 

Section 13.10 Section and Paragraph Headings. The section and paragraph
headings in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 13.11 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended only by an instrument
in writing executed and delivered by the parties hereto.

 

Section 13.12 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto and the documents specifically referred to herein and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, understanding,
representations and warranties of the parties hereto, and supersede all prior
agreements, both written and oral, between Buyer and Seller. All Exhibits
and Schedules annexed hereto or referred to herein are hereby incorporated in
and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in full herein. Disclosure
of any fact or item in any Schedule referenced by a particular paragraph or
Section in this Agreement shall, should the existence of the fact or item or
its contents be relevant to any other paragraph or Section, be deemed to be
disclosed with respect to that other paragraph or Section whether or not any
explicit cross-reference appears therein but only to the extent that such
relevance is clearly and readily apparent from the face of such disclosure;
_provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, no disclosures shall
be deemed to be disclosed on _Schedule 5.20_  except for such disclosures
explicitly set forth thereon or explicitly incorporated by reference into
_Schedule 5.20_.

 



64 Section 13.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

Section 13.14 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the greatest extent possible.

Section 13.15 Consent to Jurisdiction. The parties hereby irrevocably submit
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the
State of Delaware over any dispute arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and each party
irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such dispute or proceeding
shall be heard and determined in such courts. The parties hereby irrevocably
waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which
they may now or hereafter have to the venue of any dispute arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum for the
maintenance of such dispute. Each party agrees that a judgment in any such
dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in
any other manner provided by applicable law. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary and without limitation of the rights of the
Financing Sources set forth in Section 13.20, the parties hereby agree that
they will not bring or support, or permit any of their Affiliates or
Representatives to bring or support, any action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing
Source (or any Financing Sources stockholders, partners and members) in any
way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or relating
in any way to the Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other
than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or if
under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts,
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof), and hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to
the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of, any such action in any such court.

Section 13.16 Enforcement. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Accordingly, each of the parties shall be 

 



65  entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, including an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any state or
federal court located in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties hereto further hereby waives (a) any defense in any action for
specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any
requirement under any law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

Section 13.17 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, INCLUDING ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE
FINANCING OR ANY CLAIM OR PROCEEDING INVOLVING THE FINANCING SOURCES. 

Section 13.18 Time of Essence. This Agreement contains a number of dates and
times by which performance or the exercise of rights is due, and the parties
hereto intend that each and every such date and time be the firm and final
date and time, as agreed. For this reason, each party hereto hereby waives and
relinquishes any right it might otherwise have to challenge its failure to
meet any performance or rights election date applicable to it on the basis
that its late action constitutes substantial performance, to require the other
party to show prejudice, or on any equitable grounds. Without limiting the
foregoing, time is of the essence in this Agreement. If the date specified in
this Agreement for giving any notice or taking any action is not a Business
Day (or if the period during which any notice is required to be given or any
action taken expires on a date which is not a Business Day), then the date
for giving such notice or taking such action (and the expiration date of such
period during which notice is required to be given or action taken) shall be
the next day which is a Business Day.

Section 13.19 Guarantee. The Laclede Group, Inc. agrees to take all action
necessary to cause Buyer to perform all of its respective agreements,
covenants and obligations under this Agreement and the Related Documents. The
Laclede Group, Inc. unconditionally guarantees to Seller the full and complete
performance by Buyer of its respective obligations under this Agreement. This
is a guarantee of payment and performance and not of collectability. The
Laclede Group, Inc. hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of
performance, filing of any claim, any right to require any proceeding
first against Buyer, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever in connection
with the performance of its obligations set forth in this Section 13.19.

Section 13.20 Financing Sources. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, neither the Seller, nor any of its stockholders, partners,
members, Affiliates or Representatives, and each of their successors and
permitted assigns shall have, and the Seller hereby waives, any rights or
claims against each of the Financing Sources and each of the Financing
Sources respective stockholders, partners and members, in connection with
this Agreement or the Financing, whether at law or equity, in contract in tort
or otherwise. Without limiting the foregoing, the Financing Sources shall be
beneficiaries of all limitations on remedies 

 



66  and damages in this Agreement that apply to Buyer hereto and are express
third party beneficiaries of this Section 13.20 (which may not be changed
without the Financing Sources prior written consent).

 



67 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be executed
and delivered by their duly authorized officers as of the date first written
above.
