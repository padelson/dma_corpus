contemplated in clauses (A) to (D) of the second sentence of Article 3.5(b),
documented to the reasonable satisfaction of the RTA Representative, and a
calculation of the amount payable pursuant to Articles 3.5(b) and (c) and the
amount payable by the RTA Representative to Bemis or by Bemis to the RTA
Representative in accordance with such Articles. Within thirty (30) Business
Days following any price adjustment or indemnification payment giving rise to
an increase or reduction of the Divested Business Sale Price in accordance

payment by the RTA Representative to Bemis or by Bemis to the RTA

thirty (30) Business Days following receipt of such notice under the first or
second sentence of this Article 3.5 (e), including reasonably satisfactory
documentation of the amounts and calculations therein, the RTA Representative
shall pay or cause to be paid to Bemis (on behalf of the Designated
Transferee of the Divested Business) or, as applicable, Bemis shall pay or
cause to be paid to the RTA Representative (on behalf of PPPI) the amount
initially owed by it under Articles 3.5(b) and (c) or any required adjustment
payment in respect thereof, as applicable, provided that such amounts are not
at such time being contested in good faith in appropriate proceedings.

  



  

(f) Without prejudice to Article 3.5(b) to (e) but without any further
Liability or Cost to any member of the Seller Group, ***.

  



  

(g) Without prejudice to Article 3.5(i), the provision of Article 3.5(b)

Business pursuant to the Consent Decree.

  



  

(h) The provisions of Article 3.5(b) shall not apply to the sale of any
portion of the Bemis Group that is not required to be sold by the Consent
Decree and, in the event such additional assets are sold as part of a single
transaction with the sale of the Divested Business in accordance with the
Consent Decree, the Bemis Group shall allocate reasonably and in good faith
the purchase price received in connection with such sale to the Divested
Business and any such additional portion of the Bemis Group that is sold. The
costs referred to in clause (A) of the second sentence of Article 3.5(b)
shall be similarly allocated to the Divested Business and any such additional
portion of the Bemis Group and only the portion allocated to the Divested
Business shall be used for the application of the second sentence of Article
3.5(b) in respect of the costs under clause (A) thereof.  Bemis shall
prepare (or cause to be prepared) and deliver to the RTA Representative
within thirty (30) Business Days following such divestiture a statement
setting forth the allocation of the aggregate consideration received upon for
such divestiture and the related costs referred to above to the
Divested Business and such additional portion of the Bemis Group. If the RTA
Representative disputes such allocation within twenty (20) Business Days of
its receipt thereof, the Bemis Group and the RTA Representative shall seek to
resolve such matter in

portion has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.**

  



        
   

  



  

good faith negotiations, provided that if such matter cannot be resolved
within thirty (30) days following the RTA Representatives notice disputing
such allocation, the matter shall be submitted to an international recognized
independent valuation firm mutually selected by Bemis and the
RTA Representative for final resolution. The decision of such valuation firm
shall be final.  Adjustments to such consideration and indemnification
payments shall only be allocated to the Divested Business to the extent they
are specifically referable to the Divested Business for purposes of
determining the Divested Business Sale Price as determined reasonably and in
good faith. Further, no payments in respect of any lease or other contract
prepayments, early purchases, buy-outs or early termination and no payments
made in order to obtain or no longer require any Third Party Consents
relating to any additional portion of the Bemis Group sold (other than the
Divested Business) shall be taken into account in determining the allocation
of the purchase price received to such additional portion of the Bemis Group.

  



  

(i) If the Consent Decree is modified by and with the agreement of the
parties thereto to permit the Bemis Group to sell less than the Divested
Business, then Bemis shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and deliver to
the RTA Representative within thirty (30) Business Days following such
modification a statement setting forth an adjustment to the Reference Value
to reflect the reduced Divested Business. Such adjustment shall be
calculated reasonably and in good faith. If the RTA Representative disputes
such adjustment within twenty (20) Business Days of its receipt thereof, the
Bemis Group and the RTA Representative shall seek to resolve such matter in
good faith negotiations, provided that if such matter cannot be resolved
within thirty (30) Business Days following the RTA Representatives notice
disputing such adjustment, the matter shall be submitted to an international
recognized independent valuation firm mutually selected by Bemis and the RTA
Representative for final resolution. The decision of such valuation firm shall
be final.

  



  

(j) In the event of the sale of the Divested Business to more than one
purchaser in accordance with the Consent Decree, the provisions of this
Article 3.5(b) shall apply but only once and after the sale of the entire
Divested Business has been completed and in the aggregate for all sales that
shall have resulted in the entire Divested Business having been sold (and the
determination of the Divested Business Sale Price and the costs provided in
clauses (A) to (D) of the second sentence of Article 3.5(b), shall be
calculated in the aggregate after the completion of the last sale that shall
have resulted in the entire Divested Business having been sold).

  



  

(k) Each of the RTA Representative (for itself and on behalf of PPPI) and
Bemis (for itself and on behalf of the Designated Transferees of the Divested
Business) definitively waives and relinquishes any right of set-off or
counterclaim, deduction or retention which it might otherwise have against
any payment owed by it under this Article 3.5.

  



  

3.6 (a) In addition to the Sellers Guaranteed Obligations, AHS
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to Bemis and to each Designated
Transferee of the Sale Assets relating to the Divested Business pursuant to
this Agreement the due and punctual performance and observance by the RTA
Representative and any other member of the Seller Group of all its
obligations under or pursuant to Article 3.5 ( ** _Divested Business
Guaranteed Obligations_** ).

  



  

### (b) If and whenever any member of the Seller Group defaults for any
reason whatsoever in the performance of any of its Divested Business
Guaranteed Obligations, AHS shall as soon as reasonably practicable
unconditionally perform (or procure performance of) and satisfy (or procure
the satisfaction of) the relevant Divested Business Guaranteed Obligations.

  

### 

  

### (c) This guarantee shall be a continuing guarantee and accordingly remain
in force until all the Divested Business Guaranteed Obligations shall have
been performed or satisfied and shall be in addition to and without prejudice
to and not in substitution for any rights or security which Bemis or any
member of the Bemis Group may now or hereafter have or hold for the
performance and observance of the Divested Business Guaranteed Obligations.

portion has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange

### (d) As a separate and independent obligation, AHS agrees that any of the
Divested Business Guaranteed Obligations (including, any moneys payable)
which may not be enforceable against or recoverable from the relevant member
of the Seller Group by reason of any legal limitation, disability or
incapacity of that member of the Seller Group or any other fact or
circumstances (other than any provision of this Agreement) shall nevertheless
be enforceable against and recoverable from AHS as though the same had been
incurred by AHS and AHS was the sole or principal obligor in respect thereof.

  



  

(e) The liability of AHS under this Article 3.6 shall not be discharged,
released, diminished or impaired by:

  



  

#### (i) any variation of any of the Divested Business Guaranteed
Obligations;

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) any amendment, variation or assignment of this Agreement;

#### (iii) any winding up, dissolution, reconstruction, legal limitation,
incapacity or lack of corporate power or authority or other circumstances
affecting any member of the Seller Group (or any act taken by any member of
the Seller Group in relation to any such event); or

  

#### 

  

(iv) any other act, event, neglect or omission (whether or not known to any
member of the Seller Group or AHS) which would or might (but for this Article
3.6) operate to impair or discharge the liability of AHS or afford AHS or any
of the Sellers any legal or equitable defence.

the RTA Representative a reasonable opportunity to comment on such materials
and communications and Bemis shall not file or submit any such materials or
communications except after the RTA Representative has approved their
contents (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);

this Article 4.5(a)(ii) shall not be construed to modify Bemiss rights or
obligations under Article 4.5(a)(ix) with respect to such commitments,
undertakings or remedies in respect of any such materials or communications
regarding any commitments or undertakings of Bemis to any Competent Authority
or any other remedies of Bemis contemplated in Article 4.5(a)(ix).

information which is materially commercially sensitive to Bemiss existing
business may be supplied under Article 4.5(a)(ii) to legal advisers
designated by the RTA Representative on a "counsel to counsel" basis rather
than to the RTA Representative. Likewise, any materials referred to in
Article 4.5(a)(i) which contain information which is materially commercially

Business) may be supplied to Bemis legal advisers on a "counsel to counsel"
basis rather than to Bemis.

#### (iv) Bemis shall request, in all applications to any of the Competent
Authorities, that the Competent Authority should issue all written
communications concerning the applications to Bemis and the RTA
Representative simultaneously, unless such communications may contain

#### (viii) Bemis shall respond promptly to all requirements and requests
from any Competent Authority for further information relating to any
application Bemis has made seeking an Antitrust Approval and Bemis shall in
response promptly supply in good faith information to the Competent Authority
that Bemis believes having taken all due care to ensure that the same is
complete and accurate. This Article 4.5(a)(viii) shall not require Bemis to
submit information required from the RTA Representative which the RTA

any competition issues identified by such Competent Authority or which are
otherwise required in order to obtain the relevant Antitrust Approval and, if
the proposal is accepted, shall enter into and perform such commitments. Any
such proposed commitments or undertakings shall be prepared and negotiated by
Bemis acting reasonably and in good faith and not arbitrarily. Bemis shall
proffer, agree to and perform all remedies and undertakings required to
resolve any competition issues identified by the Competent Authority which
are required in order to obtain the relevant Antitrust Approval, but shall
not be required to agree to any remedy which, strategically or financially,

the Transferred Business, (B) Bemiss existing operations or (C) the
prospects of the combined business of the Transferred Business and Bemiss
existing operations, as determined by Bemis acting reasonably and in good
faith and not arbitrarily.

information, duly completed in each case, to the extent required by Law or by
a Competent Authority to support an application for an Antitrust Approval for
the sale of the Target Companies and the Sale Businesses and provide a copy
to Bemis promptly after filing. This Article 4.5(b)(i) shall not be
breached by a failure to submit information required from Bemis which Bemis
has not supplied to the RTA Representative or its legal advisers.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) In relation to these filings, the RTA Representative shall observe
the undertakings in Article 4.5(a)(ii) through (a)(viii) as if references in
those Paragraphs to Bemis were references to the RTA Representative,

Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP were references to Baker and McKenzie LLP;
and

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) The RTA Representative shall not contact any Competent Authority,
regarding the Antitrust Approval either in writing or orally without Bemiss
legal advisors prior consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and

the relevant landlord, effective as of the Closing Date (it being understood
that any such security deposits that are cash deposits shall remain in place

Sellers obligations under a Lease are guaranteed by any person which is not

any Liability or Cost in relation therewith, and _provided_   _further_ that
any payment or commitment made or Liability or Cost assumed or incurred by
the RTA Representative or any member of the Target Group or Asset Seller

shall not be construed to constitute any undertaking by the RTA
Representative to procure that any such Third Party Consents are in fact
obtained and (ii) do not apply to the agreements or licences for which
provision is made in Schedule 11 ( _Information Technology_ ).

  

### 

  

### (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
neither this Agreement nor any instrument of transfer or other document
delivered to Bemis at or prior to Closing shall constitute an assignment,
sublease, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any Sale Contract, Lease,

conveyance or delivery would violate applicable Law or constitute a breach of
contract or require any unavailable Third Party Consents.

Consent (irrespective of its materiality) except as expressly provided in
Article 3.1. To the extent that any Third Party Consent cannot be obtained

reflected in the 2008 Management Accounts.

Closing as contemplated by Article 4.12(c)(iv), the RTA Representative and
Bemis shall enter into (or cause their applicable Affiliates to enter into)

the Sellers that, in respect of itself and each member of the Bemis Group,
the statements set out in Schedule 6 ( _Purchaser s Warranties_) __ are as at

# ** **

  

# **CONDUCT OF CLAIMS**

  

# 

  

## 8.1 Without prejudice to the limitations on liability set out in Schedule
5 ( _Limitations on Liability_ ) and subject to the provisions in respect of
control of Environmental Indemnity Claims set forth in Articles 12.2 through
12.5, in the event that any claim or demand for which a party (an
**_Indemnifying Party_** ) or any of its Affiliates may have liability to
another party (an **_Indemnified Party_** ) or any of its Affiliates in
respect of any Claim, Indemnity Claim or otherwise under this Agreement, in
each case other than in respect of any Tax Claim (which is the subject of
Schedule 13 ( _Tax_ )), is asserted against or sought to be collected from
any Indemnified Party by a third party (a **_Third Party Claim_** ):

  

## 

  

### (a) the Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no event more than ten
(10) Business Days following such Indemnified Partys receipt of a Third
Party Claim, notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such Third Party
Claim, the amount or the estimated amount of damages sought thereunder to the
extent then ascertainable (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the
final amount of such Third Party Claim), any other remedy sought thereunder,
any relevant time constraints relating thereto and, to the extent
practicable, any other material details pertaining thereto, including all
reasonable information and facilities to investigate such Third Party Claim
(a **_Claim Notice_** );  _provided, however_ , that the failure timely to
give a Claim Notice shall affect the rights of an Indemnified Party hereunder
only to the extent that such failure has a prejudicial effect on the defenses
or other rights available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such
Third Party Claim;

  

### 

  

### (b) neither the Indemnified Party nor any of its Affiliates shall admit
any liability, settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise such Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party; and

  

### 

  

### (c) the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days (or such lesser
number of days set forth in the Claim Notice as may be required by court
proceeding in the event of a litigated matter) after receipt of the Claim
Notice (the **_Notice Period_** ) to notify the Indemnified Party that it
desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim.
During that period, if the Indemnified Party is Bemis or any of
its Affiliates, the Indemnified Party shall consult with the RTA
Representative in order to determine if the Third Party Claim may give rise
to a Liability or loss of any Seller Group member hereunder (including after
giving effect to any deductible under the provisions hereof, the provisions
of Paragraphs 2 and 6 of Schedule 5 ( _Limitations on Liability_ ) or
any limitation of Liability in any provision of this Agreement by reference
to a Relevant Loss).

  

### 

  

## 8.2 If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the
Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the
Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings and shall have the sole power to
direct and control such defense at its

   **[***] = Confidential treatment requested for redacted portion; redacted
portion has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.**

  



        
   

  



  

## expense _provided that_ if it appears reasonable that the ultimate
responsibility for the Third Party Claim will not be borne solely by the
Indemnifying Party then the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall consult in good faith to determine how best to defend such Third Party
Claim, including whether to enter into a joint or shared defense arrangement,
_provided, further_ that nothing herein shall obligate the Indemnified Party
or the Indemnifying Party to enter into any such arrangements.  Once the
Indemnifying Party has duly assumed (joint or shared, as the case may be, if
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have agreed to joint or
shared defense arrangements) the defense of a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
participate in any such defense and to employ separate counsel of its
choosing. The Indemnified Party shall participate in any such defense at its
expense unless (a) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are both
named parties to the proceedings and the Indemnified Party shall have
reasonably concluded that representation of both parties by the same counsel
would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between
them, (b) the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim
after the Indemnifying Party has failed to diligently pursue a Third Party
Claim it has assumed, as provided in the first sentence of Article 8.4 or (c)
the Indemnifying Party and  Indemnified Party have entered into a joint or
shared defense arrangement.

  

## 

  

## 8.3 The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party, settle, compromise or offer to settle or
compromise any Third Party Claim on a basis that would result in (a) the
imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree that would restrict the
future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates;
(b) a finding or admission of a violation of Law or violation of the rights
of any person by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates; (c) a
finding or admission that would have an adverse effect on other claims made
or threatened against the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates; or (d)
except to the extent within the thresholds set forth in Paragraph 2 of
Schedule 5 ( _Limitations on Liability_ ) hereof, any monetary liability
of the Indemnified Party that shall not be promptly paid or reimbursed by
the Indemnifying Party.

  

## 

  

## 8.4 If the Indemnifying Party (a) elects not to defend the Indemnified
Party against a Third Party Claim, whether by not giving the Indemnified
Party timely notice of its desire to so defend or otherwise; or (b) after
assuming the defense of a Third Party Claim, fails to take reasonable steps
necessary to defend diligently such Third Party Claim within ten (10)
Business Days after receiving written notice from the Indemnified Party to
the effect that the Indemnifying Party has so failed, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right but not the obligation to assume its own defense; it
being understood that the Indemnified Partys right to indemnification for a
Third Party Claim shall not be adversely affected by assuming the defense of
such Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall not settle a Third Party
Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

## 

  

## 8.5 The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in
order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third Party Claim,
including by providing access to each others relevant business records and
other documents, and employees; it being acknowledged and agreed that the
costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party relating thereto shall, subject
to the limitations on liability set out in Schedule 5 ( _Limitations on
Liability_ ), be Costs subject to indemnification. Without prejudice to the
generality of the foregoing, to the extent reasonably related to the Third
Party Claim the Indemnifying Party may request that the auditors (both past
and then current) of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates make
available their audit working papers in respect of audits of the accounts of
the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates for any accounting
period relevant to such Third Party Claim (subject to the Indemnifying Party
agreeing to hold harmless requirements that such auditors may reasonably
require).

  

## 

  

## 8.6 The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts **** to avoid production of confidential
information (consistent with applicable Law), and to cause all communications
among employees, counsel and others representing any party to a Third Party
Claim to be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-
product privileges.

  

## 

  

## 8.7 Subject to the provisions in respect of control of
Environmental Indemnity Claims set forth in Articles 12.2 through 12.5,
before an Indemnified Party makes a Claim or Indemnity Claim (other than in
respect of any Tax Claim) under this Agreement for a Cost or Liability (other
than in respect of any Tax Claims) that does not result from a Third Party
Claim (a **_Direct Claim_** ):

   **[***] = Confidential treatment requested for redacted portion; redacted
portion has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.**

  



        
   

  



  

### (a) the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing
of such Direct Claim, the amount or the estimated amount of damages sought
thereunder to the extent then ascertainable (which estimate shall not be
conclusive of the final amount of such Direct Claim), any other remedy sought
thereunder, any relevant time constraints relating thereto and, to the extent
practicable, any other material details pertaining thereto;

  

### 

  

### (b) the Indemnifying Party shall have a period of forty-five (45) days
within which to respond to such Direct Claim, and if the Indemnifying Party
does not respond within such forty-five (45) day period, the Indemnifying
Party shall be deemed to have accepted the Direct Claim; and

  

### 

  

### (c) if the Indemnifying Party rejects all or any part of the Direct
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall be free to seek enforcement of its rights
to indemnification under this Agreement with respect to such Direct Claim.

  

### 

  

## 8.8 The Indemnifying Party shall pay all amounts payable pursuant to this
Article 8 and, with respect to any Environmental Indemnity Claim, Article
12.2 through 12.5 in accordance with the payment provisions of this
Agreement promptly following receipt from an Indemnified Party of a bill,
together with all accompanying reasonably detailed back-up documentation, for
any Liability or Cost in respect of any Claim, Indemnity Claim or otherwise
under this Agreement, unless the Indemnifying Party in good faith disputes
such Liability or Cost, in which event it shall so notify the Indemnified
Party. In such case, the Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay to
the Indemnified Party in accordance with the payment provisions of this
Agreement the amount of any Liability or Cost for which it is liable
hereunder until five (5) Business Days following any final determination of
the related claim and the Indemnifying Partys liability therefor (a **_Final
Adjudication_** ). A Final Adjudication shall exist when (a) the parties to
the dispute have reached an agreement in writing; (b) a court of competent
jurisdiction shall have entered a final order or judgment not subject to stay
or appeal; or (c) an arbitration or like panel shall have rendered a final
non-appealable determination with respect to disputes the parties have agreed
to submit thereto.

  

## 

  

## 8.9 It shall be a condition to the right of an Indemnified Party to
pursue, enforce and obtain payment in respect of any Claim or Indemnity Claim
under this Agreement that it shall have complied with the terms and
conditions of this Article 8 and, in respect of any Environmental Indemnity
Claim, Articles 12.2 through 12.5.

## 9.1 If Closing has not occurred on or before the Longstop Date (as the
same may be extended in accordance with Article 9.2) and the RTA
Representative and Bemis have not agreed in writing to further extend the
Longstop Date, each of the RTA Representative and Bemis shall have the right
to terminate this Agreement (other than the Surviving Provisions) as of the
Longstop Date (as so extended) so long as the passing of the Longstop Date
without Closing occurring is not due to a material breach by the terminating
party of its obligations under this Agreement.

writing by the RTA Representative and Bemis, the Condition in Article 3.1(b)

Authorities;

### 

  

### (c) if the Condition in Article 3.1(d) has not been satisfied by
the Longstop Date, the RTA Representative or Bemis may elect to extend the
Longstop Date for a further period to March 31, 2010, to enable such
Condition to be fulfilled by the relevant party, which date shall be the new
Longstop Date for the purposes of this Agreement.

  

### 

  

As of the date of this Amended and Restated Agreement, it is acknowledged
that the Longstop Date has been extended to March 31, 2010 in accordance with

Change under Paragraph (b) of the definition thereof herein has occurred and
is continuing; or

  

### 

  

### (b) with effect no later than ten (10) Business Days from the date of
such notice of termination (as specified by the RTA Representative in such
notice) if (i) Bemis is in breach of its obligations under Article 4.8; (ii)
the Facilities Agreements are no longer in full force and effect, any
condition to completion of the transactions contemplated thereby (other than
the continued force and effect of this Agreement) has become incapable of
being satisfied by the Longstop Date, any such condition or any termination
right has been invoked or the Facilities Agreements have been repudiated by
any party thereto (in each case without regard to whether such action has
been properly or wrongfully taken); or (iii) the Share Purchase Agreement is
no longer in full force and effect (other than as a result of a breach by the
Seller Group member party thereto), and, in each case of clauses (ii) and
(iii) Bemis has not entered into financing arrangements that would permit it
to meet its obligations hereunder and to effect Closing by the Longstop Date
that are reasonably satisfactory to the RTA Representative.

  

### 

  

## 9.4 All rights and obligations of the parties shall cease to have effect
immediately upon termination of this Agreement in accordance with this
Article 9 and none of the parties (nor any of their Affiliates) shall have
any liability or obligation to the other parties (or their Affiliates) in
relation to the subject matter of this Agreement, except that:

  

## 

  

### (a) the Surviving Provisions shall continue in full force and effect;

  

### 

  

### (b) the termination shall not affect any rights or liabilities of any of
the parties which have already accrued at the time of termination, including
the right of the RTA Representative and the liability of Bemis for failure to
meet its obligations to proceed with Closing hereunder in the event of
termination

continuation of a Material Adverse Change that had not occurred or was not
continuing or (B) the Conditions in Articles 3.1(b), 3.1(c) or 3.1(d) failing
to be fulfilled by the Longstop Date as a result of a breach by Bemis or any
Bemis Group member of its obligations hereunder, (ii) pursuant to Article
9.3(a) if the alleged Material Adverse Change had not occurred or was not
continuing or (iii) pursuant to Article 9.3(b); and

Representative shall have the right in the case of an alleged Material
Adverse Change pursuant to Paragraph (b) of the definition thereof herein,

its prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed, _provided that_ such prohibition on response or communication by
Bemis shall only apply to the extent that such response or
communication could reasonably be expected to have a prejudicial effect on
the defenses or other rights available with respect to such matter; and

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) afford the RTA Representative or the relevant Seller Group member
the opportunity and right to participate in or, at the RTA Representatives
election, control any communication, action, suit, investigation or
proceeding concerning any matter for which the RTA Representative or any
Seller Group member could reasonably be expected to have liability hereunder
arising under or relating to the Environment, any Environmental Matter,
Hazardous Matter, Environmental Law, Environmental Permit or Environmental
Indemnity Claim, (unless Bemis provides to the RTA Representative a written
undertaking acceptable to the RTA Representative providing that any such
action, suit, investigation or proceeding arising from or relating thereto
and any Liabilities or Costs arising therefrom or from any such other action,
suit, investigation or proceeding shall be the sole responsibility of Bemis
and the relevant Bemis Group members); _provided that_ the RTA
Representative shall not without Bemiss prior written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, enter into any settlement with
respect to such matters if such settlement (A) would require Bemis or any
Bemis Group member to pay any amounts thereunder, (B) would compromise Bemis
or any Bemis Group members position in any other action, suit, investigation
or proceeding or would involve an admission of a violation of Law or the
rights of any person by Bemis or any Bemis Group member (but only to the
extent that such action, suit, investigation, proceeding or violation of Law
or rights of any person would reasonably be expected to result in Liabilities
or Costs to Bemis and the Bemis Group members exceeding the estimated amount
of the Seller Group members liability on any Environmental Indemnity Claim
with respect thereto and any related Environmental Matter) or (C) would
result in a material restriction of the future activities of the Bemis Group.

  

#### 

  

### (b) The relevant member of the Seller Group shall have the right to
control (or procure the control of) any Remediation for which that or any
Seller Group member could reasonably be expected to have liability hereunder
arising under or relating to the Environment or any Environmental Matter,
Environmental Law, Environmental Permit or Environmental Indemnity Claim to
the extent that the Seller retains competent consultants of recognized
standing and perform the Remediation without unreasonable interference to
Bemiss business, operations or property taking into account the feature of
such Remediation. If the relevant member of the Seller Group cannot meet
these conditions, Bemis shall be entitled to control the Remediation,
_provided however_ that such control by Bemis shall not, in and of itself,
relieve the relevant member of the Seller Group of their indemnification
obligations for any Liabilities or Costs covered under the indemnity under
Article 12.2. Bemis shall pay its own Costs incurred by it relating to the
inspection or review of any actions taken as part of the Remediation,
including the review or analysis of any reports, studies, assessments,
correspondence, test results relating to the Remediation; _provided that_ the
relevant member of the Seller Group shall pay such commercially reasonable
Costs to the extent Bemis incurred such commercially reasonable Costs due to
the failure of the relevant member of the Seller Group to retain consultants
and control the Remediation.

  

### 

  

### (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Bemis shall
have the unlimited right to control any Environmental Indemnity Claim that
does not exceed the *** limitation set forth in Article 12.3(a) and for which
the Bemis Group members are exclusively liable.

  

### 

  

### (d) In all cases where the relevant member of the Seller Group has the
right to control any Environmental Indemnity Claim, it shall do so in a
commercially reasonable manner, including minimizing interference to Bemiss
business, operations or property, providing reasonable notice prior to any
sampling, remediation or other activities and giving Bemis copies of all
relevant documentation including litigation documents, correspondence from
any Government Authorities or third parties, laboratory analytical results
and proposals and reports prepared by consultants.

### 

  

### (e) In all cases where Bemis has the right to control any Remediation or
Environmental Indemnity Claim it shall do so in a commercially reasonable
manner which minimizes the amounts which are required to pay in respect of
the Remediation or Environmental Indemnity.

  

### 

  

### (f) Nothing in this Article 12.5 shall prohibit Bemis from taking any
actions reasonably necessary in response to any emergency which presents an
immediate threat to human health or safety, to comply with any order by a
Governmental Authority which requires immediate Remediation measures or, to
avoid a requirement of any Law or a Governmental Authority to interrupt
production at any of the Properties and any such actions taken by Bemis in
compliance with this Article 12.5(f) may be taken without prejudice to its
right to indemnification under this Article 12.

## 15.1 From the date of this Agreement until Closing, the RTA Representative
and the relevant members of the Seller Group shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain in full force and effect each Centrally
Arranged Insurance Policy under which recovery is permitted after Closing in
respect of a loss affecting the Transferred Business, subject to renewals and
renegotiations of such insurance policies or insurance policies entered into
by the Seller Group to replace (on the basis that it secures similar
coverage) a Centrally Arranged Insurance Policy in the ordinary course.

  

## 

  

## 15.2 Subject to Article 15.3, at Closing, all insurance cover in relation
to the Transferred Business arranged under a Centrally Arranged Insurance
Policy shall cease (other than in relation to Pre-Closing Claims) and no
Target Company and no member of the Bemis Group shall make directly any claim
under any Centrally Arranged Insurance Policy after Closing.

  

## 

  

## 15.3 Following the date of this Agreement, the RTA Representative and
Bemis will co-operate in good faith to seek to make arrangements on arms
length commercial terms (which compensate the relevant member of the Seller
Group for the appropriate portion of the cost of premiums or increased
premiums) which will enable Bemis or the Target Companies or the Designated
Transferees (in relation to losses affecting assets comprised in the Sale
Businesses they purchase) to recover, or to enable the RTA Representative to
recover for their benefit, in respect of events which occur prior to
the Determination Time and give rise to loss, under claims-made Centrally
Arranged Insurance Policies where no claim for the loss is made prior to
the Determination Time.

  

## 

  

## 15.4 Following Closing, the RTA Representative or another member of the
Seller Group (or a claims handler appointed by the RTA Representative or the
relevant member of the Seller Group) shall continue to administer and collect
on a timely basis any Pre-Closing Claim capable of being enforced on behalf
of a member of the Target Group or Designated Transferee which has acquired a
Sale Business including, where appropriate, disputing with the relevant
insurer the amount recovered. Bemis shall (and shall procure that

## Company or Designated Transferee shall) (a) cooperate fully with the RTA
Representative and the relevant member(s) of the Seller Group to enable the
RTA Representative and the other relevant member(s) of the Seller Group to
comply with the requirements of the relevant insurer and (b) provide such
information and assistance as the relevant insurer and the RTA Representative
and the relevant member(s) of the Seller Group may request in connection with
any Pre-Closing Claim.

  

## 

  

## 15.5 Any monies received from an insurer by a member of the Seller Group
as a result of a Pre-Closing Claim in respect of a loss or damage suffered by
a Target Company or loss or damage suffered by an Asset Seller relating
solely to a Sale Business sold by it under this Agreement prior to Closing
shall be paid to Bemis net of (i) all excesses and deductibles and (ii) all
costs and expenses of recovery (including all reasonable handling and
collection charges by any claims handler appointed by the Sellers and any tax
payable on such monies) ( ** _Seller Insurance Proceeds_** ). For the
avoidance of doubt, any monies that are paid by any insurer directly to a
person who is not the insured in respect of any insured loss, liability or
damage in respect of any insured claim shall not be deemed to be received by
a member of the Seller Group.

  

## 

  

## 15.6 Bemis acknowledges and agrees that neither the RTA Representative nor
any other member of the Seller Group shall have any obligation under this
Agreement to pay to Bemis, any other member of the Bemis Group or any other
person an amount greater than the Seller Insurance Proceeds in respect of any
Pre-Closing Claim or claim made possible by the arrangements contemplated by
Article 15.3.

  

## 

  

## 15.7 With effect from Closing, Bemis undertakes that it shall not, and
shall procure that each other member of the Bemis Group shall not, make any
notification, submission or claim of any nature, howsoever arising, nor
assist any third party in making the same, pursuant to any Centrally Arranged
Insurance Policy except pursuant to this Article 15.

  

## 

  

## 15.8 No member of the Seller Group shall be obliged to pay to Bemis any
Seller Insurance Proceeds to the extent that Bemis or any other member of the
Bemis Group has already recovered from any member of the Seller Group or any
other person an amount in respect of the loss, liability or damage suffered
or incurred as a result of an event giving rise to a relevant Pre-Closing
Claim.

  

## 

  

## 15.9 Any right of Bemis or any of the Designated Transferees or Target
Companies to claim for any loss or impairment of an asset (other than a fixed
asset) under any Centrally Arranged Insurance Policy which arises under any
of those policies, or under this Article 15, will be recorded in the
Perimeter Working Capital Statement, net of all excesses and deductibles, as
if such right were a Reported Trading Receivable except insofar as the
insurance proceeds have been paid by the insurer in which case the cash thus
paid or, if it has not yet been received by a Designated Transferee or Target
Company, its right to receive the cash under this Article 15 will be recorded
as part of Perimeter Working Capital as if they were a Reported Trading
Receivable and not as Cash (even for the avoidance of doubt if it has been
received as cash at the Determination Time).

  

## 

  

## 15.10 Any right of Bemis or any Designated Transferee to make any claim
for any loss or impairment of a fixed asset shall not be recorded as required
by Article 15.10 but instead any proceeds shall be paid to Bemis, a
Designated Transferee or a Target Company, as required by Bemis, and the
amount of such proceeds shall be supplemented to include any deductible but
nothing in this Article 15.10 shall require payment of an amount greater than
the aggregate cost of replacing such fixed asset by another in substantially
the same condition and of substantially similar age or repairing any impaired
fixed asset and, if any payments received do exceed that cost, Bemis shall
cause them to be reimbursed or paid over to the RTA Representative promptly
after receipt.

any time prior to Closing on behalf of the relevant Target Company or any
Asset Seller any trading liabilities or expenses of any Target Company or
Asset Seller which arise in connection with the ordinary course carrying on
of the relevant Target Companys business or, as the case may be, of the
relevant Asset Sellers Sale Business or which are incurred by another member
of the Seller Group and recharged to that Target Company or Asset Seller. Any
amounts paid by a member of the Seller Group pursuant to this Article 16.1
shall be repayable by the relevant member of the Target Group or Asset Seller
to the relevant member of the Seller Group and, in the case of an Asset
Seller, the obligation to make such repayment shall form part of the Assumed
Obligations.

  

## 

  

## 16.2 Not later than twenty (20) Business Days after the Closing Date:

  

## 

  

### (a) Bemis shall cause each relevant Target Company and each relevant
Designated Transferee to deliver invoices to the relevant member of the
Seller Group for all Cross-Group Sale Trading Receivables and all Recharges
Receivable accrued in the ordinary course as at the Determination Time to
which it is entitled (in the case of a Designated Transferee, recognizing
that they are Sale Assets) in respect of the provision of goods, services,
facilities or other benefits in connection with the Transferred Business in
any period up to and including the Determination Time;

  

### 

  

### (b) each relevant member of the Seller Group shall deliver to each
relevant Target Company and to each relevant Designated Transferee invoices
for all Cross-Group Sale Trading Payables accrued and all Recharges Payable
accrued in the ordinary course as at the Determination Time for which the
person invoiced is responsible (in the case of a Designated Transferee,
recognizing that they are Assumed Obligations) in respect of the provision of
goods, services, facilities or other benefits to the relevant Target Company
or Asset Seller in connection with the Sale Business which a Designated
Transferee is to acquire from it in any period up to and including the
Determination Time; and

  

### 

  

### (c) (i) Bemis shall cause each relevant Designated Transferee of a
reporting unit for purposes of MaRCC forming part of an Asset Sellers Sale
Business to deliver invoices to that Asset Seller for all Notional Sale
Trading Receivables accrued in its favor at the Determination Time in respect
of the provision of goods, services, facilities or other benefits in
connection with the Transferred Business in any period up to and including
the Determination Time (whereupon such Notional Sale Trading Receivables
shall become payment obligations of that Asset Seller), and (ii) each
relevant Asset Seller shall deliver to each Designated Transferee of a
reporting unit for purposes of MaRCC forming part of an Asset Sellers Sale
Business invoices for all Notional Sale Trading Payables accrued by such
reporting unit at the Determination Time in respect of goods, services,
facilities or other benefits received from other reporting units of such
Asset Seller in any period up to and including the Determination
Time (whereupon such Notional Sale Trading Payables shall become payment
obligations of that Designated Transferee),

  

### 

  

 _provided that_ (i) where a Sale Trading Receivable is a Sale Asset and the
corresponding liability is an Assumed Obligation, the invoicing shall be
carried out at the direction of the RTA Representative on behalf of the
Designated Transferee acquiring the Sale Asset for payment by the Designated
Transferee assuming the Assumed Obligation and (ii) in the case of Notional
Sale Trading Receivables the invoicing shall be carried out at the direction
of the RTA Representative on behalf of the Designated Transferee that is the
creditor thereof.

  



  

## 16.3 The RTA Representative shall cause the relevant members of the Seller
Group and Bemis shall cause the Target Companies and Designated Transferees
to pay all amounts properly invoiced in accordance with Article 16.2 not
later than sixty (60) days after Closing and no party shall challenge any
amount invoiced and each

Commission.**

  



        
   

  



  

## party will procure that its Affiliates will pay the amounts so invoiced on
or before the end of such period of sixty (60) days. These amounts will be
payable in the currency in which they were incurred and, where no
currency was specified, in the currency consistent with the ordinary
practices of the Seller Group in the twelve (12) months prior to the date of
this Agreement.

  

## 

  

## 16.4 Following Closing, all trading arrangements and the provision of
services, facilities and benefits between any member of the Target Group and
any member of the Seller Group shall be made on the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Transitional Services Agreement, this Agreement and any
other relevant Transaction Documents, or any other relevant arrangements
entered into by the relevant parties, and payables and receivables arising
from such arrangements shall be invoiced separately from the invoices
delivered in accordance with Article 16.2.

## 16.5 The Share Sellers and Bemis each agree that, between the date of this
Agreement and Closing, they shall cooperate actively and in good faith to
attempt to minimise the amounts of certain Cross-Group Non-Trading Payables
(including Cross-Group Loans) and Cross-Group Non-Trading Receivables in
accordance with the principles set out in Schedule 14 ( _Cross-Group Debt_ )
and in a manner which does not give rise to adverse financial, fiscal or
economic consequences for any member of the Seller Group or any member of the
Bemis Group.

  

## 

  

## 16.6 All Cross-Group Non-Trading Payables shall be Cross-Group Loans **
__** to which Articles 1.11, 2.2 and 2.8 apply except where the RTA
Representative on behalf of the relevant Cross-Group Loan Seller determines
otherwise in relation to any Cross-Group Non-Trading Payables.  Between the
date of this Agreement and Closing, the RTA Representative and Bemis shall
co-operate actively and in good faith to establish whether it is preferable
for any Cross-Group Loans to be dealt with under Articles 16.7 to 16.9 as
Cross-Group Non-Trading Payables rather than as Cross-Group Loans to which
Article 1.11 applies, subject to this not giving rise to adverse financial,
fiscal or economic consequences for any member of the Seller Group or the
Bemis Group.

  

## 

  

## 16.7 Bemis shall procure the payment in cash at Closing without deduction
other than any deduction for or on account of Tax required by Law to the
relevant members of the Seller Group to which any Cross-Group Non-Trading
Payables (other than Cross-Group Loans) are then owed (whether or not then
due for payment) by any of the Target Companies of the amounts (if any) of
such Cross-Group Non-Trading Payables owed to them as shown in the statement
of Estimated Cross-Group Non-Trading Debt to be delivered pursuant to Article
2.4 (but excluding any Cross-Group Loans to be sold and transferred at
Closing pursuant to Article 1.11 and Articles 2.2 and 2.8) and such
liabilities shall be deemed to be discharged by the payments required by this
Article.

  

## 

  

## 16.8 (a) Except to the extent otherwise contemplated by the implementation
of any transaction in accordance with the principles set out in Schedule 14 (
_Cross-Group Debt_ ) or otherwise provided in this Article 16.8, the
RTA Representative shall procure the payment at Closing without deduction
other than any deduction for or on account of Tax required by Law to the
relevant Target Companies to which any Cross-Group Non-Trading Receivables
are then owed (whether or not then due for payment) by a member of the Seller
Group of the amounts (if any) of the Cross-Group Non-Trading Receivables owed
to them as shown in the statement of Estimated Cross-Group Non-Trading
Receivables and Recharges Receivable to be delivered pursuant to Article 2.4
and such liabilities shall be deemed to be discharged by the payments
required by this Article.

  

## 

  

### (b) As an exception to the foregoing, the RTA Representative shall cause
any Cross-Group Non-Trading Receivables of Thermaplate to be paid to Bemis,
whereupon Bemis shall recognize a debt to Thermaplate in the same amount.

  

### 

  

### (c) As a further exception to the foregoing, it is agreed that the Cross-
Group Non-Trading Receivables owed to Danaflex shall not be payable or
repayable to Danaflex except conditional on Completion having occurred and on
terms that such payment or repayment has no effect until after Completion
has occurred. The RTA Representative shall procure the payment to Danaflex
of the Cross-Group Non-Trading Receivables owed to it without deduction on
the first Business Day after the day on which Completion occurs. For these
purposes, **_Completion_** means (i) receipt by or on behalf of the

### Sellers of the consideration which pursuant to this Agreement is payable
at Closing and (ii) the delivery by the parties of the Material Deliverables
to be delivered at Closing in accordance herewith or the waiver of any such
delivery provided that in relation to the Sale Shares in respect of which
delivery of a Material Deliverable has been waived by Bemis (if applicable),
the completion of the steps in (i) and (ii) shall nevertheless be deemed, for
the avoidance of doubt, to have caused all right, title and interest to such
Sale Shares to be held for the account of the relevant Designated Transferee
and all rights in respect of such Share Sales accruing for the benefit of,
and liabilities attaching to such Share Sales being assumed by, the
Designated Transferee in accordance with Article 1.1.

  

### 

  

## 16.9 Within 5 Business Days after the Perimeter Closing Statements have
been finally agreed or determined in accordance with Schedule 15 ( _Post
Closing Financial Adjustments_ ), the following payments shall be made in
final settlement of the Cross-Group Non-Trading Payables (other than Cross-
Group Loans):

  

## 

  

### (a) if the amount set out in the Perimeter Closing Statements in respect
of a Cross-Group Non-Trading Payable (other than a Cross-Group Loan) is less
than the amount recorded in the Estimated Closing Statements in respect of
that Cross-Group Non-Trading Payable, the RTA Representative shall procure

Company to which it is owed an amount equal to the difference together with
interest at LIBOR plus one (1) per cent per annum on that amount for the
period from (but excluding) the Closing Date to (and including) the date of
payment calculated on a daily basis; or

  

### 

  

### (b) if the amount set out in the Perimeter Closing Statements in respect
of a Cross-Group Non-Trading Payable (other than a Cross-Group Loan) is
greater than the amount recorded in the Estimated Closing Statements in

LIBOR plus one (1) per cent per annum on that amount for the period from (but
excluding) the Closing Date to (and including) the date of payment calculated
on a daily basis.

been finally agreed or determined in accordance with Schedule 15 ( _Post

final settlement of the Cross-Group Non-Trading Receivables:

  

## 

  

### (a) if the amount set out in the Perimeter Closing Statements in respect
of a Cross-Group Non-Trading Receivable is greater than the amount recorded

to (and including) the date of payment calculated on a daily basis; it being
understood that any payment under this Article 16.10(a) owed to
Thermaplate shall be paid to Bemis on or as soon as practicable after
Closing, whereupon Bemis shall recognize a debt to Thermaplate in the same
amount; or

deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax save as may be required
by Law.

  

## 

  

## 23.6 If any deduction or withholding for or on account of Tax is required
by Law to be made from any such payment then, subject to Article 23.9, the
party making the payment (the **_Payer_** ) shall pay to the party receiving
the payment (the **_Payee_** ) such amount as will, after such deduction or
withholding has been made (and taking into account any withholding or
deduction on such amount), leave the Payee with the same amount as it would
have been entitled to receive in the absence of any such requirement to make
a withholding or deduction (the **_additional amount_** ); _provided that_
 the Payer shall not be obliged to pay an additional amount under this
Article 23.6 if and to the extent that any deduction or withholding on
account of Taxes consists of any Tax imposed on the income or gain of the RTA
Representative or a member of the Seller Group in respect of the disposal of
the Sale Shares, the Sale Assets or the Cross-Group Loans and such Tax is
imposed in the jurisdiction in which are situated, for Tax purposes, as the
case may be, the Sale Shares, the Sale Assets or the Cross-Group Loans in
respect of which the Payer is making the payment in question.

  

## 

  

## 23.7 If the Payee receives an additional amount by virtue of Article 23.6
and receives or is granted a credit against or repayment of any Tax paid by
it or other Relief in respect of, or calculated with reference to, the
withholding or deduction giving rise to such additional amount, the Payee
shall promptly pay, to the extent that it

   **[***] = Confidential treatment requested for redacted portion; redacted
portion has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.**

  



        
   

  



  

## can do so without prejudice to the retention of the amount of such credit,
repayment or other Relief, to the Payer such amount as the Payee shall have
concluded to be attributable to the relevant withholding or deduction and to
leave it (after such reimbursement) in no worse position (and, _provided
that_  it is in no worse position, no better position) than it would have
been in if the Payer had not been required to make such deduction or
withholding (such amount to be determined by the Payee acting in good faith
and to be certified as such by the Payee). Nothing contained in this Article
23.7 shall affect the right of the Payee to arrange its Tax affairs in
whatever manner it thinks fit, nor oblige the Payee to disclose any
information relating to its Tax affairs or any computations in
respect thereof, or which is otherwise confidential, or any information
disclosure of which would be unlawful.

  

## 

  

## 23.8 If any deduction or withholding is made from any payment under or in
connection with this agreement, the Payer will make the payment to the
relevant Tax Authority of the amount deducted or withheld, will supply to the
Payee within 30 days of such payments being made, an official receipt or
other evidence of such payment and will give all reasonable assistance to
enable the Payee to claim a credit, repayment or other Relief in respect of
the deduction or withholding as promptly as possible.

  

## 

  

## 23.9 The obligation of the Payer to pay any additional amount under the
preceding provisions of this Article 23 is subject to the Payees filing any
such forms or making any such declarations as may reasonably be requested of
it by the Payer in order to avoid the circumstances which would give rise to
any obligation of the Payer to pay an additional amount under Article 23.6 or
to reduce the amount of the deduction or withholding, _provided that_  the
filing of the relevant form or the making of the relevant declarations is not
to the detriment (other than to an extent which is in all
respects immaterial) of the Payee, as it may reasonably determine.

  

## 

  

## 23.10 Neither Bemis nor a member of the Bemis Group will assert that any
deduction or withholding is required by Law from any sum payable by it if and
to the extent that:

  

## 

  

### (a) that sum relates to the sale of Alcan Packaging Mexico or Alcan
Empaques Mexico and Bemis has received evidence reasonably satisfactory to it
that: (i) each transferor of the shares of Alcan Packaging Mexico or Alcan
Empaques Mexico holds a valid certificate of residence in France or the USA
for the purposes of, respectively, the double taxation treaties between
Mexico and the French Republic and Mexico and the United States of America;
and (ii) each transferor has appointed a tax representative in Mexico; and
(iii) that tax representative has notified its appointment to the Tax
Authority in Mexico and provided it with a copy of the certificate of
residence mentioned in (i) of the transferor for whom it acts as
representative; and/or

  

### 

  

### (b) that sum relates to the sale of Embalagens, Envatrip or Danaflex;
and/or

  

### 

  

### (c) that sum relates to the sale of Envaril and the person acquiring the
quotas of Envaril is not resident in Argentina for Tax purposes and the
transfer of the quotas of Envaril is not effected by means of a public deed.

  

### 

  

## 23.11 Nothing in Article 23.5 to Article 23.10 shall limit the rights of
Bemis or any member of the Bemis Group to be indemnified in respect of
Transfer Taxes in accordance with Part B of Schedule 13 ( _Tax_ ). If and to
the extent that any deduction or withholding is made in accordance with
Article 23.5 and that deduction or withholding is on account of a Transfer
Tax for which Bemis or any member of the Bemis Group is entitled to be
indemnified in accordance with Part B of Schedule 13 ( _Tax_ ), then that
deduction or withholding shall not give the Payee any entitlement to an
additional amount in accordance with Article 23.6, to the extent that it
relates to the Transfer Tax which gives rise to that indemnification right of
Bemis or any member of the Bemis Group.

  

## 

  

## 23.12 The VAT treatment of any supply pursuant to this Agreement is
provided for in Part B of Schedule 13.

# **ARTICLE 24.**

  

# ** **

  

# **SELLERS  GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS**

  

# 

  

## 24.1 The Sellers Guarantor unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to
Bemis and to each Designated Transferee of any Sales Shares, Sale Assets or
Cross-Group Loans pursuant to this Agreement the due and punctual performance
and observance by each Seller of all its obligations under or pursuant to
this Agreement (except for any obligations of the RTA Representative and any
other member of the Seller Group under Article 3.5 and the Divested Business
Guaranteed Obligations under Article 3.6), the Share Purchase Agreement and
the Transitional Services Agreement ( ** _Sellers  Guaranteed
Obligations_**).

  

## 

  

## 24.2 If and whenever any Seller defaults for any reason whatsoever in the
performance of any of its Sellers Guaranteed Obligations, the Sellers
Guarantor shall as soon as reasonably practicable unconditionally perform (or
procure performance of) and satisfy (or procure the satisfaction of) the
Sellers Guaranteed Obligations.

  

## 

  

## 24.3 This guarantee shall be a continuing guarantee and accordingly remain
in force until all the Sellers Guaranteed Obligations shall have been
performed or satisfied and shall be in addition to and without prejudice to
and not in substitution for any rights or security which Bemis or any member
of the Bemis Group may now or hereafter have or hold for the performance and
observance of the Sellers Guaranteed Obligations.

  

## 

  

## 24.4 As a separate and independent obligation, the Sellers Guarantor
agrees that any of the Sellers Guaranteed Obligations (including, any moneys
payable) which may not be enforceable against or recoverable from the
relevant Seller by reason of any legal limitation, disability or incapacity
of that Seller or any other fact or circumstances (other than any provision
of this Agreement, the Share Purchase Agreement or the Transitional Services
Agreement) shall nevertheless be enforceable against and recoverable from the
Sellers Guarantor as though the same had been incurred by the Sellers
Guarantor and the Sellers Guarantor was the sole or principal obligor in
respect thereof.

  

## 

  

## 24.5 The liability of the Sellers Guarantor under this Article 24 shall
not be discharged, released, diminished or impaired by:

  

## 

  

### (a) any variation of any of the Sellers Guaranteed Obligations;

  

### 

  

### (b) any amendment, variation or assignment of this Agreement, the Share
Purchase Agreement or the Transitional Services Agreement;

  

### 

  

### (c) any winding up, dissolution, reconstruction, legal limitation,
incapacity or lack of corporate power or authority or other circumstances
affecting any of the Sellers (or any act taken by any of the Sellers in
relation to any such event); or

  

### 

  

### (d) any other act, event, neglect or omission (whether or not known to
any of the Sellers or the Sellers Guarantor) which would or might (but for
this Article 24) operate to impair or discharge the liability of the Sellers
Guarantor or afford the Sellers Guarantor or any of the Sellers any legal or
equitable defence.

  

### 

  

## 24.6 Unless Rio Tinto plc becomes the Sellers Guarantor pursuant to
Article 24.7 at or prior to Closing, at or prior to Closing AHS shall procure
the issuance in favor of Bemis of an unconditional, irrevocable letter of
credit for its obligations under the guarantee provided in this Article 24
for a period of at least *** from the Closing Date in an initial undrawn
amount of ***, and AHS shall procure that such letter of credit be renewed or
replaced with another letter of credit for the same undrawn amount from time
to time as necessary such that a letter of credit for such amount shall be in
full force and effect at all times until the first Business Day after expiry
of *** commencing the Closing Date, _provided that_ notwithstanding
the foregoing, any amounts drawn under such letter of credit or otherwise
paid in satisfaction of any Claim (other than a Title Warranty Claim),
Indemnity Claim (other than a Pension Indemnity Claim) or Tax Claim shall
reduce the amount available under such letter of credit to the extent of any
such payment, and for the avoidance of doubt AHS may replace such letter of
credit with another letter

   **[***] = Confidential treatment requested for redacted portion; redacted
portion has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.**

  



        
   

  



  

## of credit in an amount equal to the initial undrawn amount less the
aggregate of all amounts previously so drawn or otherwise paid. Such letter
of credit (and any replacement thereof) shall be held in escrow in accordance
with the terms of an escrow agreement to be entered into between Bemis and
AHS (or in such case one of their designated Affiliates) and an escrow agent
to be designated by AHS at the cost of AHS and on terms and conditions that
are customary for this type of transactions.

  

## 

  

## 24.7 If Rio Tinto plc receives an advance tax ruling from the Canada
Revenue Agency in terms reasonably satisfactory to Rio Tinto plc confirming
that the guarantee provided in Article 24 if provided by Rio Tinto plc will
not constitute "property acquired by any person in substitution for property
distributed to the parent on the winding-up" for purposes of subparagraph
88(1)(c)(vi) of the Income Tax Act (Canada), then, upon receipt of such tax
ruling, AHS shall procure that Rio Tinto plc shall execute an instrument
(substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 11) assuming all past,
present and future obligations upon such guarantee provided that Bemis shall
release and discharge and cause each Bemis Group member to release and
discharge AHS from all past, present and future obligations under such
guarantee upon such assumption of such obligations by Rio Tinto plc,
whereupon Rio Tinto plc shall be the Sellers Guarantor, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Rio Tinto plc shall not be required to assume and shall not
assume the obligations of AHS under Article 24.6, which shall terminate and
be of no further force and effect upon assumption by Rio Tinto plc of AHSs
obligation under such guarantee. If such instrument is delivered after
Closing, then upon the delivery of such instrument the letter of credit shall
be returned to AHS or otherwise terminated in accordance with the terms of
escrow agreement.

RTA Representative and Bemis. The RTA Representative and Bemis shall use

applies, the party making the announcement or issuing the circular shall
endeavour on a commercially reasonable basis to consult with the other party
in advance as to its form, content and timing.

received or held by the RTA Representative or any of the Sellers relating to
any member of the Bemis Group and/or its business and, following Closing, the
Sale Assets, the Assumed Obligations, the Target Group, and any member
thereof and/or their relevant underlying businesses; and

   **[***] = Confidential treatment requested for redacted portion; redacted
portion has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.**

  



        
   

  



  

#### (iii) information relating to the provisions of, and negotiations
leading to, this Agreement (and for the avoidance of doubt the Original
Agreement) and any other Transaction Documents,

  

#### 

  

in each case including written information, information transferred orally,
visually, electronically or by any other means; and

  



  

### (b) **_Representatives_**  means, in relation to a party, its respective
Affiliates and its and their directors, officers, employees, agents and
advisers.

  

### 

  

## 26.2 Each of the Sellers, the Sellers Guarantor and Bemis shall (and
shall ensure that each of its respective Representatives shall) maintain
Confidential Information in confidence and not disclose Confidential
Information to any person except (i) as this Article 26 permits or (ii) as
the other party approves in writing, and shall not use Confidential
Information for any purpose not related to the Proposed Transactions.

  

## 

  

## 26.3 Article 26.2 shall not prevent disclosure by any member of the Seller
Group, Bemis or any of their respective Representatives to the extent it can
demonstrate that:

  

## 

  

### (a) disclosure is required by Law or by any stock exchange or any
Governmental Authority acting within its powers ( _provided that_  to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, the disclosing party shall first inform
the other party of its intention to disclose such information and take into
account the reasonable comments of the other party);

  

### 

  

### (b) disclosure is of Confidential Information which was lawfully in the
possession of that party or any of its Representatives without any obligation
of secrecy prior to its being received or held, _provided that_  this
Article 26.3(b) shall not be applicable to any member of the Seller Group in
relation to information relating to the Sale Assets, the Assumed Obligations
or the Target Group or any member thereof and/or their relevant underlying
businesses;

  

### 

  

### (c) disclosure is of Confidential Information which information was

### 

  

### (g) disclosure is made to Amcor Limited or any of its Affiliates in
connection with or by virtue of the preparation or implementation of the sale

provision of files and other records relating to the business sold to Amcor
Limited **** and its Affiliates under the agreement for such sale or
the disclosure letter under that agreement where these files, records or
disclosure letter also contain information relating to any of the Target
Companies or the Sale Businesses. At Bemis reasonable request, accompanied
by reasonable evidence that Amcor Limited or any of its Affiliates is
disclosing or unlawfully using Confidential Information under Article
26.1(a)(ii) in the possession of Amcor Limited or its Affiliates, the RTA
Representative shall cause the relevant Seller Group members to enforce, in
consultation with Bemis and at Bemiss cost, the contractual rights they may
have (if any) under their existing agreements with Amcor Limited or its
Affiliates in order to prevent or obtain damages for such disclosure or
unlawful use, provided that the RTA Representative shall not be obligated to
(or to cause the relevant Seller Group members to) enforce

   **[***] = Confidential treatment requested for redacted portion; redacted
portion has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.**

  



        
   

  



  

### such contractual rights if the RTA Representative determines acting
reasonably and in good faith and not arbitrarily that (i) it does not have or
would not prevail in seeking to enforce such contractual rights or (ii)
enforcing such rights would cause to the Seller Group disproportionate harm
to the benefit being sought by Bemis or material prejudice taking into
account the relations, contractual and otherwise, of the Seller Group with
Amcor Limited and its Affiliates.

  

### 

  

## 26.4 Each Seller, the Sellers Guarantor and Bemis undertakes that it (and
its Affiliates) shall only disclose Confidential Information to its
Representatives if it is reasonably required for purposes connected with this
Agreement (or any other Transaction Document) and only if the Representatives
are informed of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information.

  

## 

  

## 26.5 If this Agreement terminates, each party shall, on request by another
party, immediately:

  

## 

  

### (a) return to such party all written documents and other materials in its
possession containing such partys Confidential Information without keeping
any copies of them;

  

### 

  

### (b) destroy all information or other documents in its possession derived
from such Confidential Information; and

  

### 

  

### (c) so far as it is practicable to do so, expunge such Confidential
Information from any computer, word processor or other device.

  

### 

  

## 26.6 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 26, any
disclosure of Confidential Information permitted pursuant to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall in no way constitute a breach of this Article
26, including, for greater certainty, any such disclosure made by a
Representative or Bemis.

## 30.4 Each of the parties to this Agreement confirms that in the event of
any conflict, inconsistency or ambiguity between the terms of this Agreement
and the terms of any other Transaction Document (including without limitation
those agreements entered into in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico in accordance
with paragraph 2(g) of Schedule 8 ( _Closing and Post-Closing Arrangements_
)), the terms of this Amended and Restated Agreement shall govern.  Bemis
hereby agrees that nothing in any Transaction Document other than this
Agreement shall give or be construed to give, directly or indirectly,
any right or remedy of any person against any member of the Seller Group, or
any of its respective assets, and Bemis shall procure that no person shall
exercise any right or remedy under any such Transaction Document that Bemis
or its Designated Transferees would not have under this Agreement (giving
effect to the limitations on the rights and remedies of Bemis and its
Designated Transferees provided in Schedule 5 ( _Limitations on Liability_
) to or any other provision of this Agreement) and shall indemnify and
keep indemnified each member of the Seller Group against any such exercise of
any right or remedy.

# **ARTICLE 31. 
  
 RIGHTS AND REMEDIES**

  

# 

  

## 31.1 It is agreed that:

  

## 

  

### (a) no party shall have any claim or remedy in respect of any
statement, representation or warranty or undertaking made by or on behalf of
any other party (or any of its Connected Persons) in relation to the
Proposed Transactions which is not expressly set out in this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document;

  

### 

  

### (b) any terms or conditions implied by Law in any jurisdiction in
relation to the Proposed Transactions are excluded to the fullest extent
permitted by Law or, if incapable of exclusion, any right, or remedies in
relation to them are irrevocably waived to the fullest extent permitted by
Law;

   **[***] = Confidential treatment requested for redacted portion; redacted
portion has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.**

  



        
   

  



  

### (c) except for any liability in respect of a breach of this Agreement or
any other Transaction Document, no party (or any of its Connected Persons)
shall owe any duty of care or have any liability in tort or otherwise to any
other party (or its respective Connected Persons) in relation to the Proposed
Transactions; and

  

### 

  

### (d) no party shall be entitled to, or shall seek to, rescind or to
terminate its obligations under (i) this Agreement, except in accordance with
Article 9 ( _Termination_ ), or (ii) under any other Transaction Document,
except as expressly permitted by its terms.

  

### 

  

## 31.2 This Agreement shall exclude any Liability for (or remedy in respect
of) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law.

  

## 

  

## 31.3 Without prejudice to any of the other rights and remedies of the
parties under or pursuant to this Agreement each of the parties acknowledges
and agrees that the failure to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement
and achieve Closing would, unless such failure is the result of a failed
Condition that is capable of being invoked by such party or otherwise
directly results from a material breach of this Agreement by the other party,
give rise to irreparable harm for which monetary damages would not be an
adequate remedy. It is accordingly agreed that the parties, in addition to
other remedies, shall be entitled to enforce the terms under this Article
31.3 by decree of specific performance without the necessity of proving
the inadequacy of monetary damages as a remedy and to obtain injunctive
relief against any failure of the other party to fulfill its obligations
under this Agreement and achieve Closing.

  

## 

  

## 31.4 The rights and remedies of the parties under this Article 31 are
exclusive and in lieu of any and all other rights and remedies which the
parties may have under this Agreement or otherwise against each other with
respect to the Proposed Transactions for monetary relief with respect to (i)
any breach of any representation or Warranty or any failure to perform any
covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement and (ii) the Assumed
Obligations or the Excluded Obligations, and the parties each expressly
waives any and all other rights or causes of action it or its Affiliates may
have against the other party or its Affiliates now or in the future under any
Law with respect to the subject matter hereof. The remedies expressly provided
in this Agreement shall constitute the sole and exclusive basis for and means
of recourse between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

  

## 

  

# **ARTICLE 32.**

  

# ** **

  

# **COUNTERPARTS**

  

# 

  

This Agreement may be executed in any number of separate counterparts, each
of which is an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one
and the same Agreement.

  



  

# **ARTICLE 33.**

  

# ** **

  

# **AMENDMENT; WAIVER**

  

# 

  

## 33.1 Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, no failure or delay
by any party in exercising any right or remedy relating to this Agreement or
any of the other Transaction Documents shall affect or operate as a waiver or
variation of that right or remedy or preclude its exercise at any subsequent
time. No single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy shall
preclude any further exercise of it or the exercise of any other remedy.

  

## 

  

## 33.2 Any provision of this Agreement (or of any other Transaction
Document) may be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver
is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by or on behalf of all
the parties hereto, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the
waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any
right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor
shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

is severable. If any such provision is held to be or becomes invalid or
unenforceable in any respect under the Law of any jurisdiction, it shall have

reasonable basis to replace it in that respect with a valid and enforceable
substitute provision the effect of which is as close to its intended effect
as possible.

# **ARTICLE 38.**

  

# ** **

  

# **DISPUTE RESOLUTION**

  

# 

  

## 38.1 The parties to this Agreement agree to attempt to resolve any Dispute
by way of negotiation between senior executives who have authority to settle
such Dispute. In furtherance of the foregoing, any Disputing Party may
initiate the negotiation by way of written notice (an **_Escalation Notice_**
) demanding an in-person meeting involving representatives of the
Disputing Parties at a senior level of management of the Disputing Parties
(or if the Disputing Parties agree, of the appropriate strategic business
unit or division within such party). A copy of any Escalation Notice shall be
given to the Chief Legal Officer of each Disputing Party (which shall state
that it is an Escalation Notice pursuant to this Agreement). Any agenda,
location or procedures for such negotiation may be established by the
Disputing Parties from time to time; _provided, however_ , that the
negotiations shall be completed within thirty (30) days of the date
of receipt by a party of the Escalation Notice or within such longer period
to which the Disputing Parties may agree in writing prior to the expiration
of the initial thirty (30) day period.

  

## 

  

## 38.2 (a) If the Dispute has not been resolved by negotiation as provided
in Article 38.1 within thirty (30) days of the date of receipt by a party of
an Escalation Notice or such extended period as may be agreed by the
Disputing Parties, or should the Disputing Parties fail to meet within the
said thirty (30) day period, the Disputing Parties shall endeavour to settle
the Dispute by mediation. The party wishing to refer a Dispute to mediation
shall give written notice to the other (the **_Mediation Notice_**
) describing the Dispute, requiring that the Dispute be submitted to
mediation and proposing the name of a suitable person to be appointed
mediator.

  

## 

  

### (b) If the other party rejects the proposed mediator and the Disputing
Parties are unable to agree on a mediator within fifteen (15) days of receipt
by a party of a Mediation Notice, then either Disputing Party may request the
Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution to appoint a mediator from the Centre
for Effective Dispute Resolution panel of distinguished neutrals.

  

### 

  

### (c) The mediator shall be entitled to make recommendations to the
Disputing Parties which, unless the Disputing Parties otherwise agree in a
writing, shall not be binding upon them.

  

### 

  

### (d) The mediation shall continue until the earliest to occur of the
following: (i) the Disputing Parties reach written agreement as to the
resolution of the Dispute, (ii) the mediator makes a finding that there is no
possibility of resolution through mediation, or (iii) sixty (60) days have
elapsed since the receipt of a Mediation Notice (each, a
**_Mediation Expiration Event_** ). Following the occurrence of any
Mediation Expiration Event described above (and, in the case of (i) above,
unless the written agreement between the parties expressly limits the ability
of the parties to pursue any claim or related claim), subject to Article 40 (
_Interpretation, Governing Law and Jurisdiction_ ) __ the parties may seek any
and all available remedies regarding the Dispute in law or in equity.

  

### 

  

### (e) Each Disputing Party shall bear its own costs in connection with the
mediation; the fees and disbursements of the mediator shall be borne equally
by the Disputing Parties.

   **[***] = Confidential treatment requested for redacted portion; redacted
portion has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.**

  



        
   

  



  

### (f) If the Disputing Parties accept any recommendation made by the
mediator or otherwise reach agreement as to the resolution of the Dispute,
such resolution shall not become binding upon the Disputing Parties until it
is recorded in a written agreement executed by each of the Disputing Parties.

  

### 

  

### (g) Any mediation held in accordance with this Article 38 is confidential
and without prejudice. In the event that a Dispute is referred to a court
in accordance with Article 38.2 Paragraph (d), the mediator or any
other neutral involved in the mediation shall not take part in such court
proceeding, whether as a witness or otherwise, and any notes or other records
generated by him and any recommendation made by him in connection with the
mediation shall not be used in evidence or relied upon by either Disputing
Party without the consent of the other Disputing Party and of the mediator,
and neither Disputing Party shall make use as evidence nor rely upon
information supplied, or arguments raised (or the fact that an argument was
not raised), by the other Disputing Party in the mediation, all of which
shall be deemed to be part of settlement discussions and privileged from any
disclosure or use.

  

### 

  

# **ARTICLE 39.**

  

# ** **

  

# **BULK SALES**

  

# 

  

## 39.1 _United States._ The Sellers and Bemis agree to waive compliance with
Article 6 of the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in each of the
jurisdictions in which any of the Sale Assets are located to the extent that
Article 6 of the Uniform Commercial Code is applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

## 

  

## 39.2 _Canada_. APC and Bemis (on its own behalf and on behalf of the
Canadian Purchaser) agree to waive compliance with the requirements of the
provisions of the Bulk Sales Act (Ontario) and with Section 6 of the Retail
Sales Tax Act (Ontario), and any other applicable provincial bulk sales
legislation or retail sales tax legislation, as may be applicable in respect
of the purchase and sale of the APC Sale Business. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, APC agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Bemis or the
relevant Designated Transferee from and against any claims, demands, actions,
causes of action, damage, loss, costs, liability or expense which Bemis or
the Canadian Purchaser may suffer or be exposed to by virtue of the non-
compliance with the Bulk Sales Act (Ontario) or other applicable provincial
bulk sales legislation, other than in respect of any Assumed Obligation.

40.2 This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York without regard to principles of conflicts of
law.  Subject to Article 38 ( _Dispute Resolution_ ), each party hereto
agrees that it shall bring any action or proceeding in respect of any claim
arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contained in
or contemplated by this Agreement, exclusively in the Chancery Court of
Delaware and, if that court does not have or does not accept jurisdiction,
the other Federal or state courts in the State of Delaware (together, the
**_Chosen Courts_** ), and solely in connection with claims arising under
this Agreement or the transactions that are the subject of this Agreement (i)
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts; (ii)
waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or proceeding in the
Chosen Courts; (iii) waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an
inconvenient forum, waives any right to request transfer to another forum,
and waives any claim that the Chosen Courts do not have jurisdiction over any
party hereto and (iv) agrees that service of process upon such party in any
such action or proceeding shall be effective (and all objections to the
adequacy of service of process shall be waived and not made) if notice of any
complaint or action in the Chosen Courts is given in accordance with Article
28 ( _Notices_ ) of this Agreement. Each party hereto irrevocably designates
CT Corporation System as its agent for the receipt and forwarding of service
of process of any such claim or proceeding and each party hereto stipulates
that such consent and appointment is irrevocable and coupled with an

or attempted sale, sublease, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery to

   **[***] = Confidential treatment requested for redacted portion; redacted
portion has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.**

  



        
   

  



  

 **2.** ** **Following Closing, Bemis shall use commercially reasonable
efforts and procure that each Designated Transferee uses commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain promptly such Third Party Consents, and at
Bemiss written request the relevant Asset Seller and each relevant member of
the Seller Group shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to give all
reasonable assistance to Bemis and each relevant Designated Transferee to
obtain, with the cooperation of Bemis and its relevant
Designated Transferees, any material Third Party Consents in respect of any
Material Contract or any other material asset that would be a Sale Asset;
provided, further, that no member of the Seller Group shall be required to
pay any consideration therefor or be obligated to make any commitment, incur
any Liability and that any payment or commitment made or Liability assumed by

 **3.** ** **Pending such material Third Party Consent, the parties shall
cooperate with each other in any reasonable and lawful arrangements designed
to provide to the relevant Designated Transferee the benefits or use of such
contract or other asset and to the relevant Asset Seller and the Seller Group
the benefits, including any indemnities, that they would have obtained had
the contract or other asset been conveyed to such Designated Transferee at
Closing. Once the material Third Party Consent for the sale, assignment,
sublease, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such contract or other
asset not sold, assigned, subleased, transferred, conveyed or delivered at
Closing is obtained, the relevant Asset Seller shall assign, transfer, convey
and deliver such contract or other asset to the relevant Designated
Transferee at no additional cost (but without prejudice to Paragraph 2 of
this Part F).

  



  

 **4.** ** **To the extent that any contract or other asset cannot be

pursuant to this Part F, then Bemis (on behalf of the Designated Transferee)
and the relevant Asset Seller shall enter into such arrangements (including
subleasing, sublicensing or subcontracting) to provide to the parties hereto
(or their Affiliates) the economic and operational equivalent, to the extent
permitted and, if Third Party Consent is required for such arrangement, to

Party Consent and the performance by Bemis of the obligations thereunder;
provided that any such arrangements shall be limited to a period of six (6)
months unless the RTA Representative elects at its sole discretion to procure
the relevant Asset Seller to continue such arrangement after such period. The
relevant Asset Seller shall hold in trust for and pay to Bemis (or the
relevant Designated Transferee as directed by Bemis) promptly upon receipt
thereof, all income, proceeds and other monies received by such Asset Seller
or any of the members of the Seller Group in connection with its use of any
contract or other asset (net of any taxes and any other costs imposed upon
such Asset Seller or any member of the Seller Group) in connection with the
arrangements under this Part F. Bemis shall pay to the relevant Asset Seller,
promptly upon receipt of any invoice such Asset Seller, all losses generated
by such Asset Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection with Bemiss or
the relevant Designated Transferees use of any contract or asset in
connection with the arrangements under this Part F.

  



  

 **5.** ** **To the extent that Bemis is unable to obtain a release from a
relevant landlord as it relates to (a) the guarantee of a Sellers obligation
under a Lease with respect to a Business Leased Real Property in accordance
with Article 4.6(a)(iii)(B) or (b) a Seller or other member of the Seller
Group remaining liable in any way under such Lease, Bemis shall be
responsible for and shall make or cause to be made any payment due under such
Lease and shall indemnify and keep indemnified the relevant member of the
Seller Group from and against any and all Liabilities and Costs that
may arise or accrue under such guaranty or under such Lease from and after

avoidance of any doubt, the provisions of this paragraph 5 shall also apply
to the Lease, dated , *** by and between *** and APFA (by assignment from
APFT) and any other ancillary document in connection thereto relating
to APFAs Plant located in . *** Bemis shall use its reasonable commercial
efforts to obtain the release of APFT, APFA and each other member of the
Seller Group from any obligation under such Lease.

paragraph 5 above, Bemis hereby acknowledges and agrees that it shall be
responsible for and shall make or cause to be made any payment due in
relation to, and shall indemnify and keep indemnified the relevant member
of the Seller Group from and against, all

proposed assignment to Bemis or its Designated Transferee of any of the
Divested Business Lease Arrangements or the grant or proposed grant to Bemis
or its Designated Transferee of rights to use or access to any property or
assets subject to the Divested Business Lease Arrangements or the transfer or
proposed transfer of any such property or assets to Bemis or its Designated
Transferee, or the delay or failure to obtain any Third Party Consent in
relation thereto or otherwise in relation to the Divested Business Lease
Arrangements, and any prepayment, early purchase, early termination, other
payment or termination or any other payment under any of the Divested
Business Lease Arrangements as a result or in anticipation of any such
assignment, grant or transfer (actual or proposed). Without limitation to
the foregoing, the RTA Representative (a) may at any time after the 180th
day from Closing (which 180-day period may be extended by notice given by
Bemis to the RTA Representative by up to an additional 90 days provided Bemis
has complied with its obligations under the last sentence of this paragraph)
and (b) shall, if requested by Bemis during that period, cause any of the
Divested Business Lease Arrangements to be fully prepaid or terminated before
its stated maturity or the assets subject thereto to be purchased early and
in each case of clauses (a) and (b) Bemis shall be responsible for and shall
indemnify and keep indemnified the relevant member of the Seller Group from
and against, all Liabilities and Costs that may arise in connection with any

payment when due to or as directed by the RTA Representative.  Pending the
period referred to in the preceding sentence, Bemis shall conduct any
negotiations in relation to the Divested Business Lease Arrangements,
including regarding the terms of any such prepayment, termination or
purchase, and shall keep the RTA Representative reasonably informed thereof.
For the avoidance of doubt, after expiration of such period, the RTA
Representative may cause such prepayment, termination or purchase in
accordance with the terms of the Divested Business Lease Arrangements or such
other terms as may be available to it. Bemis shall use its
reasonable commercial efforts to obtain the release of PPPI and each other
member of the Seller Group from any obligation under the Divested Business
Lease Arrangements.

  



  

 **7.** ** **Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 4.6 and the other
provisions of this Agreement regarding Third Party Consents, including those
of paragraphs 1 to 6 above, Bemis acknowledges and agrees that to the extent
that Bemis (or any of its Designated Transferee) is allowed the benefits or
use of any contract or asset while any Third Party Consent relating thereto
has not been obtained, Bemis shall be responsible for and shall indemnify and
keep indemnified the members of the Seller Group from and against, and shall
pay to the relevant member of the Seller Group promptly upon receipt of any
invoice by the RTA Representative, all Liabilities and Costs incurred by any
member of the Seller Group under any such contract or in relation to any such
asset (including with respect to any breach of such contract or any damage to
such asset by any member of the Bemis Group or as a result of any member of
the Bemis Group having benefits or use of any such contract or asset while
any Third Party Consent has not been obtained).

commercially reasonable efforts (provided that no member of the Seller Group

payment and that any payment or commitment made or liability assumed by any
of the Target Companies shall be assumed by Bemis) to procure the execution
and delivery by the lessor thereunder of a partial assignment of such Shared
Equipment Lease to, or of a new lease with Bemis (or another member of the

(vi) For each U.S. Hired Employee who is eligible to participate in the
account balance portion of the Alcan Group Benefit Plan for Retired Salaried
Employees ( ** _Non-Grandfathered Salaried Employee_** ), the relevant Seller
shall amend (or cause to be amended) the Alcan Group Benefit Plan for Retired
Salaried Employees to provide as follows:

  



  

(A) the relevant Seller shall extend eligibility for benefits accrued at

satisfies the following conditions:

  



  

(1) the Non-Grandfathered Salaried Employee attains age 60 and completes 15

(2) the Non-Grandfathered Salaried Employee retires from Bemis; and

  



  

(3) the Non-Grandfathered Retired Employee commences receiving benefits under
one of the US Retained Plans within six (6) months after such retirement;

  



  

(vii) For each U.S. Hired Employee who is eligible to participate in the

Group Benefit Plan for Retired Union Employees (as then in effect) to each

year following the Closing (continued service for Bemis during such 1-year
period shall be included as continuous service for that purpose);

  



  

(2) the Grandfathered Hourly Employee retires from Bemis; and

  



  

(3) the Grandfathered Hourly Employee commences receiving benefits under one
of the US Retained Plans within six (6) months after such retirement;

  



  

(B) the relevant Seller shall provide a cash payment in the amount of
US$2,500 to each Grandfathered Hourly Employee who is not eligible for

following special eligibility requirements:

  



  

(1) the Grandfathered Hourly Employee retires from Bemis and upon such
retirement would have satisfied the age and service criteria for eligibility
for benefits under the Alcan Group Benefit Plan for Retired Hourly Employees,
as in effect as in on the date of Closing (crediting

   **[***] = Confidential treatment requested for redacted portion; redacted
portion has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.**

  



        
   

  



  

service with Bemis as service with the Seller for all purposes of this sub-
paragraph (B)); and

  



  

(2) the Grandfathered Hourly Employee commences benefits under one of the US
Retained Plans within six (6) months after such retirement.

  



  

Within five (5) days following each anniversary of the Closing, Bemis
shall provide a written list of the Hired Employees who were continuously
employed by Bemis throughout the period from Closing to each such
anniversary, and at any other time when a Seller Group so requests, so the
Seller can determine who is eligible for the benefits provided by paragraphs
3(b)(v) to (vii).

  



  

(viii) Certain members of the Seller Group are currently obligated to
contribute to the GCIU Fund, a multi-employer pension plan, pursuant to the
terms of two (2) collective bargaining agreements. As a result of Bemis
reaching contingent collective bargaining agreements with District Council
No. 2, Local 388-M, Teamsters (Newark, CA) and GC/IBT, Local
29-C (Minneapolis, MN) and as permitted pursuant to Paragraph 3(b)(iii) of
this Part B of Schedule 12 ( _Employment Terms and Employee Benefits_ ) of
this Agreement, Bemis agrees to continue contributing to the GCIU Fund on and
after the Closing as follows:  To the extent required under Section 4204 of
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act to avoid the imposition of any
withdrawal liability on any member of the Seller Group in connection with the
Closing, Bemis shall contribute to the GCIU Fund for substantially the same
number of contribution base units for which any member of the Seller Group
had an obligation to contribute under its collective bargaining agreements
with District Council No. 2, Local 388-M, Teamsters (Newark, CA) or
GC/IBT, Local 29-C (Minneapolis, MN) prior to the Closing. Unless the GCIU
Fund grants a waiver, Bemis shall provide to the GCIU Fund for a period of
five (5) plan years commencing with the first plan year beginning after the
Closing, a bond to be obtained by Bemis issued by a corporate surety
corporation, a sum to be provided held in escrow by a bank or similar
financial institution, or an irrevocable letter of credit held in escrow to
be obtained by Bemis, equal to the greater of (1) the average annual
contribution required to be made by the members of the Seller Group under the
GCIU Fund for the three (3) years immediately preceding the plan year in
which the Closing occurs, or (2) the annual contributions that the members of
the Seller Group were required to make under the GCIU Fund for the last plan
year prior to the plan year in which the Closing occurs. By way of
this provision, Bemis and the Seller Group inform the GCIU Fund of their
intent and joint request for a waiver of the bond, escrow, or letter of
credit held in escrow requirement set forth above. The Seller Group shall
cooperate to obtain such a waiver. If the waiver request is denied, the
bond, escrow or letter of credit shall be paid by Bemis to the GCIU Fund if
Bemis withdraws from or fails to make a contribution to the GCIU Fund at any
time during the first five plan years beginning after the Closing Date. As
required by Section 4204 of ERISA, if Bemiss actions result in a complete or
partial withdrawal prior to the end of the fifth plan year for the GCIU Fund
beginning after the Closing Date, the relevant member of the Seller Group
shall be secondarily liable to the GCIU Fund for any withdrawal liability it
would have had to the GCIU Fund if the liability of Bemis is not paid. For
the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this paragraph are without
prejudice to Paragraph 3(b)(ii) of this Part B of Schedule 12 ( _Employment
Terms and Employee Benefits_ ) of this Agreement.

  



  

 **4.** ** ****STATUTORY PLANS**

  



  

On or after Closing, Bemis shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify the
Sellers and keep the Sellers and each Seller Group member indemnified from
and against, all contributions and other liabilities to statutory social
security, pensions or other benefits plans operated under public Law, statute
or regulation in any jurisdiction in respect of Hired Employees, Target
Employees and Former Employees.

 **PART C : LTIPS, EPA, RETENTION PLANS**

  



  

Each relevant member of the Seller Group also shall, retain, comply with and
indemnify Bemis and each member of the Bemis Group from and against any and
all liabilities, losses and costs incurred or suffered by any member of the
Bemis Group relating to the Rio Tinto Alcan Downstream Businesses Long-Term
Cash Incentive Plan 2009 (14 September 2009), Downstream Business Long-Term
Cash Incentive Plan (9 September 2008), Alcan Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan

) and Alcan Employee Performance Award Plan Up to Grade 37 (May 2004) ( **
_EPA 37_** ) and any Employee Benefit Arrangements providing for retention or
change of control payments made or promised in order to induce any Business
Employee or Target Employee to continue his or her employment with the
relevant Target Group member or Seller Group member (collectively,
**_Retention Plans_** ). Following the Closing, the LTIPS, EPA 38, EPA 37 and
Retention Plans shall be the responsibility of and administered by
the relevant member of the Seller Group at its discretion (including
without limitation regarding whether or not to make any payments thereunder
in respect of any outstanding grants). At the request of the RTA
Representative, Bemis shall pay or cause to be paid to Target Employees after
Closing such amounts under EPA 37 and EPA 38 as the RTA Representative may
request and the RTA Representative shall promptly reimburse such amounts to
Bemis or the relevant Target Company.

For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a conflict between the other

otherwise defined in this Schedule 13, all capitalized terms shall have the

 **PART B**

  



  

 **TRANSFER TAXES**

  



  

 **1.** ** ****TRANSFER TAX AND VAT**

  



  

1.1 All Transfer Taxes arising in respect of the acquisition of the Sale
Shares and the Cross-Group Loans shall be borne equally by Bemis on the one
part and the relevant Share Seller or Cross-Group Loan Seller on the other.
All Transfer Taxes arising in respect of the acquisition of the AP2F Patents
shall be borne equally by Bemis on the one part and the relevant member of
the Seller Group which is selling the AP2F Patents on the other, subject to
the proviso that, if the member of the Bemis Group which acquires the AP2F
Patents is not a company formed under the Law of a state of the United
States, that relevant member of the Seller Group shall not be required to
bear an amount in excess of half of the Transfer Taxes which would have
arisen if the AP2F Patents had been acquired by Bemis.

  



  

1.2 The party which has, or whose group member has, the primary obligation
(by Law or by custom) (the **_Payer_** ) to do so shall file all necessary
returns and other documentation relating to such Transfer Taxes and the
relevant Share Seller or Cross-Group Loan Seller, or AP2F or Bemis, as the
case may be, shall cause their respective Affiliates to sign any such returns
or other documentation (except that a party shall not be required to sign any
document which it reasonably considers not to be accurate and correct in all
material respects). To the extent that any Transfer Taxes are required to be
remitted to any Governmental Authority, the Payer shall discharge such
obligation and whichever of (a) Bemis and (b) the relevant Share Seller or
Cross-Group Loan Seller or AP2F is not the Payer or is not a member of
whichever of the Bemis Group or the Seller Group the Payer belongs to, shall
pay an amount equal to one-half of such Transfer Taxes to the Payer or at its
direction, in accordance with Paragraph 1.1, by the later of (i) five (5)
Business Days after receiving a demand from the Payer to do so and (ii)
two (2) Business Days before the date on which that obligation would have
had to be discharged in order to avoid incurring a liability to interest or a
charge or penalty.

  



  

1.3 All Transfer Taxes arising in respect of the acquisition of the Sale
Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Obligations, in either case from
PPPI, shall be borne by Bemis (including in respect of any mislocated assets
related to the relevant Sale Business). Bemis shall, or shall procure that
its Affiliate shall, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, prepare
and file all necessary returns and other documentation relating to such
Transfer Taxes and shall pay such Transfer Taxes. PPPI shall cooperate with
any reasonable requests from Bemis in connection with such Transfer Taxes,
including signing any returns or documents required by Law to be signed by it
(except that PPPI shall not be required to sign any document which it does
not consider to be accurate and correct in all material respects). Bemis
shall indemnify PPPI and each Affiliate of PPPI against any Costs incurred in
connection with such Transfer Taxes.

  



  

1.4 All Transfer Taxes arising in respect of the acquisition of the Sale
Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Obligations, in either case from APC
or APFA, as the case may be (the **_Relevant Seller_** ), shall be borne by
the Relevant Seller (including in respect of any mislocated assets related to
the relevant Sale Business).  The Relevant Seller shall, to the extent
permissible under applicable Law, prepare and file all necessary returns and
other documentation relating to such Transfer Taxes and shall pay such
Transfer Taxes. Bemis shall cooperate with any reasonable requests from the
Relevant Seller in connection with such Transfer Taxes, including procuring
the signing of any returns or documents required by Law to be signed by it or
any member of the Bemis Group (except that Bemis shall not be required to
procure the signing of any document which it does not consider to be accurate
and correct in all material respects). The Relevant Seller and the Seller
Group shall indemnify Bemis and each member of the Bemis Group against any
Costs incurred in connection with such Transfer Taxes.

  



  

1.5 To the extent that any VAT is chargeable on any supply pursuant to this
Agreement, the person making the supply (the **_Supplier_** ) shall deliver
to the recipient of the supply (the **_Recipient_** ): (i) a valid VAT

   **[***] = Confidential treatment requested for redacted portion; redacted
portion has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.**

  



        
   

  



  

invoice where required by applicable Law or practice; and (ii) any other
documentation as may be reasonably requested by the Recipient to assist it to
recover the VAT chargeable or payable, in each case, in such form and within
such timing as may be required by Law. An amount equal to the amount of VAT
chargeable or payable by the Supplier on the supply shall be paid in addition
to the consideration provided in this Agreement, by the Recipient to the
Supplier within five (5) Business Days of receipt of a valid VAT invoice (or
where no invoice is required, within five (5) Business Days of demand) or, if
later, two (2) Business Days before the date on which the obligation to
account for the VAT would have had to be discharged in order to avoid
liability to interest or a charge or penalty. The Supplier shall account for
all amounts in respect of VAT paid to it by the Recipient to the appropriate
Tax Authorities in compliance with applicable Laws.

  



  

1.6 Subject to Paragraph 1.7 the relevant Asset Seller and the relevant
Designated Transferee shall each enter into, on a timely basis, any election
or take any other action reasonably requested by the other, to the extent
permitted by Law, to permit the sale and transfer of any Sale Asset without
giving rise to Transfer Taxes or a charge to VAT.

  



  

1.7 Within 10 Business Days of Closing, Canadian Purchaser shall notify APC
in writing whether it intends to provide to APC a draft joint election under
section 167 of the Excise Tax Act (Canada) (and any corresponding election
under any other applicable Canadian provincial VAT Laws to the extent there
are assets in that province to which VAT could reasonably be expected to
otherwise apply) and/or the equivalent election in respect of Quebec Sales
Tax (QST) and if it so intends, shall within 10 Business Days of Closing
provide to APC such a draft joint election. The Canadian Purchaser will have
no obligation to provide such a draft joint election and if it chooses not to
do so, Paragraph 1.5 shall apply. Within 10 Business Days following receipt
of any such draft joint election, APC and Canadian Purchaser shall each sign
and Canadian Purchaser shall submit, in accordance with applicable law and
practice, the joint election (the **_GST Election_** ) in the form of the
draft joint election as amended to include any reasonable comments of APC.
Canadian Purchaser shall forthwith provide evidence, in form reasonably
acceptable to APC, that the GST Election has been duly and timely submitted.
Canadian Purchaser and APC shall promptly notify the other in the event of
having any material communication with the Canada Revenue Agency in respect
of any such GST Election or the VAT treatment of the sale of the Sale Assets
and shall consult with, and take account of the reasonable comments of, the
other prior to making any material response to such communication.

  



  

1.8 In the event that, notwithstanding the GST Election, it is determined by
the Canada Revenue Agency that there is a liability of the Canadian Purchaser
to pay, or of APC to collect and remit, any VAT in respect of all or part of
the relevant Sale Assets, an amount equal to such VAT shall be forthwith paid
by the Canadian Purchaser to the Canada Revenue Agency (if so determined by
the Canada Revenue Agency) or otherwise to APC. APC shall pay and remit that
amount to the Canada Revenue Agency.

  



  

1.9 Bemis covenants that the Canadian Purchaser shall be effectively
registered for VAT to the extent required for an effective GST Election and
that Canadian Purchaser shall comply with its obligations under this
Agreement.

  



  

1.10 Without prejudice to the generality of Paragraph 1.6 above, at least
seven (7) Business Days prior to Closing the Canadian Purchaser shall provide
APC with a draft purchase exemption certificate in respect of Ontario Retail
Sales Tax. At Closing the Canadian Purchaser shall deliver the duly completed
purchase exemption certificate to APC in the form of the draft certificate,
amended to include any reasonable comments of APC. The Canadian Purchaser
shall take any other action reasonably requested by APC in order to claim
exemption from Ontario Retail Sales Tax in respect of the relevant Sale
Assets to the maximum extent permitted by law. APC shall take all reasonable
steps to provide the Canadian Purchaser in a timely manner with a description
of the categories of the relevant Sale Assets, so as to enable the Canadian
Purchaser to deliver at Closing the duly completed purchase exemption
certificate in respect of Ontario Retail Sales Tax.

1.11 To the extent permitted by Canadian law, if APC so requests, (i) Bemis
shall cause the Canadian Purchaser to jointly elect with APC in a timely
manner and in the prescribed form, to have section 22 of the Income Tax Act
(Canada) ( **ITAC** ) (and any corresponding provisions of any applicable
Canadian provincial or territorial income tax legislation as may be relevant)
apply in respect of the amount paid by the Canadian Purchaser to APC for the
accounts receivable of APC comprised in the Sale Assets that are the proper
subject of the joint election. In the event that APC and the Canadian
Purchaser jointly elect, APC (and not the Canadian Purchaser) shall
be responsible for filing the requisite election form with the Canada
Revenue Agency and such other form as may be required by any relevant
provincial or territorial Tax Authority. APC and the Canadian Purchaser
shall prepare their respective Tax Returns in a manner consistent with such
joint elections.

  



  

1.12 To the extent permitted by Canadian law, if APC so requests, Bemis shall
cause the Canadian Purchaser to jointly elect in a timely manner and in the
prescribed form to have section 20(24) and 20(25) of the ITAC (and any
corresponding provision of any Canadian provincial or territorial income tax
legislation as may be relevant) apply to the obligations of APC in respect of
any undertakings which arise from the operation of the business in Canada and
to which Paragraph 12(1)(a) of the ITAC (or any relevant corresponding
provision of any Canadian provincial or territorial income tax legislation)
applies. The Canadian Purchaser and APC acknowledge that APC is transferring
assets to the Canadian Purchaser which have a value equal to the elected
amount as consideration for the assumption by the Canadian Purchaser of such
obligations of APC. In the event that APC and the Canadian Purchaser jointly
elect, APC (and not the Canadian Purchaser) shall be responsible for filing
the requisite election form with the Canada Revenue Agency and such other
form as may be required by any relevant Canadian provincial or territorial
Tax Authority.  APC and the Canadian Purchaser shall prepare their respective
Tax Returns in a manner consistent with such joint elections.

  



  

1.13 To the extent permitted by Canadian law, if APC so requests, Bemis shall
cause the Canadian Purchaser to, and APC shall, on a timely basis and using
the prescribed forms (or, if such forms are not available, in any manner
acceptable to the Canada Revenue Agency), execute joint elections (or take
any other action reasonably necessary) so that Paragraph 56.4(3)(b) of the
ITAC, as proposed by the Department of Finance in Bill C-10, Income Tax
Amendments Act 2006 (or such similar provisions as are or may be enacted)
(and any corresponding provisions of any applicable Canadian provincial
income tax legislation), applies to any amount received or deemed to be
received in respect of the covenant in Article 20 ( _Protective Covenants
Post-Closing_ ). If such elections are executed, or such other action taken,
APC agrees to, and Bemis covenants that Canadian Purchaser agrees to:

  



  

(a) make any filing and take any other action reasonably necessary to give
effect to such elections or other action under this sub-Paragraph; and

  



  

(b) prepare their respective Tax Returns in a manner consistent with such
joint elections or other action.

2.1 The parties agree that, with respect to the US Hired Employees (other
than those of Thermaplate), the standard procedure set forth in US Revenue
Procedure 2004-53, 2004-2 C.B. 320 shall apply.

1.1 The RTA Representative and Bemis shall cooperate to provide each other on
or before the Closing Date, any sale-for-resale certificates or exemption
certificates reasonably required by the RTA Representative or Bemis (as the
case may be) to minimize (or eliminate) the imposition of sales Tax or use
Taxes in respect of the sale of the Sale Businesses.

  



  

1.2 On Closing, each Share Seller that is selling a Target Company formed
under the laws of one of the states of the United States and every Asset
Seller that is conveying an item of real property physically located in one
of the states of the United States or the Virgin Islands, shall provide to a
person to be designated by Bemis at least four (4) Business Days prior to
Closing a certification of non-foreign status in compliance with Treas. Reg.
§1.1445-2(b)(2).

  



  

1.3 Each seller of Sale Shares, Sale Assets, AP2F Patents or Cross-Group
Loans that is formed under the laws of one of the states of the United States
shall provide to a person to be designated by Bemis at least four (4)
Business Days prior to Closing a completed US Form W-9, signed under
penalties of perjury, if it is reasonable for Bemis or a member of the Bemis
Group to request such a Form W-9 to be provided. Each seller of Sale Shares,
Sale Assets AP2F Patents or Cross-Group Loans that is not formed under the
laws of one of the states of the United States shall provide to a person
to be designated by Bemis at least four (4) Business Days prior to Closing
a completed US Form W8-BEN, signed under penalties of perjury, if it
is reasonable for Bemis or a member of the Bemis Group to request such a Form
W8-BEN to be provided. Any such request shall be made in writing by Bemis or
a member of the Bemis Group at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to
Closing.

  



  

 **2.** ** ****RETURNS ETC.**

  



  

2.1 The RTA Representative or its duly authorised agent shall, at the
relevant Share Sellers cost, prepare the Tax Returns of, or relating to,
each Target Company for all tax accounting periods ended on or prior to
Closing, to the extent that the same shall not have been prepared before
Closing. The RTA Representative shall ensure that each such Tax Return shall
be sent to Bemis no later than twenty (20) Business Days before the expiry of
the time limit for submitting that return to the relevant Tax Authority
without incurring interest or penalties taking into account, where relevant,
any timely filed requests to extend that time limit.  The RTA Representative
shall take into account any reasonable and timely comments made by Bemis in
preparing the Tax Returns. Where the Tax Return in question is a group or
consolidated Return including matters relating to a Target Company, the
RTA Representative shall not be required to disclose to Bemis pursuant to
this Paragraph any part of that Tax Return (except for any pro forma Tax
Return prepared solely with respect to that Target Company).

  



  

2.2 Bemis shall procure that each Target Company shall cause those Tax
Returns which are mentioned in Paragraph 2.1, and which are filed after the
Closing Date, to be authorised, signed and submitted in a timely manner to
the appropriate Tax Authority without amendment or with such amendments as
the RTA Representative shall agree and shall give the RTA Representative or
its agent all such assistance as may be required to file those Tax Returns
and documents with the appropriate authorities; _provided that_ Bemis shall
not be obliged to procure that any Target Company take any such action as is
mentioned in this sub-clause in relation to any Tax Return that is not true
and accurate in all material respects. The relevant Share Seller shall pay
(or cause to be paid) all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns.

  



  

2.3 The RTA Representative or its duly authorised agent shall prepare all
documentation and deal with all matters (including correspondence) relating
to the Tax affairs of each Target Company for all Tax accounting periods
ended on or prior to the Closing Date and Bemis shall procure that each
Target

   **[***] = Confidential treatment requested for redacted portion; redacted
portion has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.**

  



        
   

  



  

Company shall confer such authority and afford such access to its books,
accounts and records as is necessary and reasonable to enable the RTA
Representative or its duly authorised agent to prepare those Tax Returns and
conduct matters relating thereto in accordance with the RTA Representatives
rights under this clause. If the RTA Representative or its duly authorized
agent wishes to file an amended Tax Return in relation to a Tax accounting
period of a Target Company ended on or prior to the Closing Date, then it
shall consult with Bemis about whether such a filing would have a material
adverse effect in respect of the Tax affairs of that Target Company or any
other member of the Bemis Group for any period commencing after Closing. The
RTA Representative shall not proceed to file such a Tax Return if Bemis
can identify a material negative Tax impact to the Target Company in a period
(or portion thereof) beginning after Closing that is more likely than not to
occur if the amended Tax Return were filed in the manner desired by the
RTA Representative. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the RTA
Representative shall be entitled to file such an amended Tax Return in any
case where such a filing (i) is required by Law; or (ii) solely enables the
relevant Target Company to utilise net operating losses arising in Argentina
or Mexico in respect of a period (or portion thereof) beginning before
Closing. The relevant Share Seller shall reimburse any reasonably incurred
external expenses of the Bemis Group in assisting the RTA Representative in
filing an amended Tax Return in relation to a Tax accounting period of a
Target Company ended on or prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

2.4 Subject to Paragraphs 4 and 5, nothing done by a Target Company pursuant
to this clause shall in any respect restrict or reduce any rights Bemis may
have to make a claim against the relevant Share Seller under this Schedule 13
in respect of any such Tax Liability.

  



  

2.5 In respect of any Straddle Period _,_ Bemis shall procure that the Tax
Returns of each of the Target Companies shall be prepared on a basis which is
consistent with the manner in which the Tax Returns of each of the Target
Companies concerned were prepared for all Tax accounting periods ending prior
to the Closing Date except to the extent that this is incompatible with
applicable Law.

  



  

2.6 Bemis shall procure that each of the Target Companies provide to the RTA
Representative all Tax Returns relating to the Straddle Period no later than
twenty (20) Business Days before the expiry of the time limit on which such
Tax Returns are required to be filed with the appropriate Tax Authority
without incurring interest or penalties or, if earlier, in the case of
Danaflex, three (3) months after the end of the relevant Tax accounting
period, taking into account, where relevant, any timely filed requests to
extend that time limit.  Bemis shall further procure that each of the Target
Companies shall include the RTA Representatives reasonable comments before
those Tax Returns are submitted to the appropriate Tax Authority.  The
relevant Share Seller shall pay to Bemis its share (as determined under this
Schedule 13) of any Tax shown as due thereon in accordance with Paragraph 10
( _Due Date for payment_ ).

  



  

2.7 The RTA Representative shall provide such assistance as Bemis shall
reasonably request in preparing all Tax Returns relating to the Straddle
Period.

  



  

2.8 Each of the RTA Representative and Bemis shall take all reasonable steps
to procure that any time limit for filing a Tax Return or other information
with an appropriate Tax Authority is extended in a timely manner, where it
has been requested in writing by the other party to do so.

  



  

2.9 Bemis shall, at the request of the RTA Representative, procure that each
Target Company provides such information and assistance as the RTA
Representative may reasonably require in relation to any pre-Closing period
or the Straddle Period, in connection with its obligations under this clause
or the Tax affairs of the relevant Share Seller or any member of the Seller
Group.  The relevant Share Seller shall reimburse Bemiss or the Target
Companys reasonably incurred external expenses in respect thereof.

  



  

2.10 For the purposes of determining the amount of a Tax or a Tax Liability
(or right to repayment thereof) attributable to periods (or parts thereof)
ending on or prior to Closing, a Tax accounting period of the relevant Target
Company shall be deemed to have ended on, and at the time of, Closing if and
to the

extent that that would not otherwise be the case; _provided that_ , in the
case of Taxes that are imposed as a fixed amount per period, the amount of
the Tax Liability imposed for the period ending on Closing shall
be determined by multiplying the amount of Tax for the whole Straddle Period
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the period
prior to and including Closing and the denominator of which is the total
number of days in the Straddle Period. If, on the Closing Date, a
transaction occurs after Closing and outside of the ordinary course of
business, while the Target Company is under Bemiss control, Bemis shall
procure that the Target Company shall treat the transaction for all
US Federal income tax purposes as occurring at the beginning of the following
day in accordance with Treas. Reg. §1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B).

  



  

2.11 Each relevant Share Seller shall terminate, or cause the Target
Companies to terminate, as of the Closing Date, all Tax sharing agreements or
similar agreements addressing the sharing or surrender of Tax losses, credits
or other allowances (but only with respect to the Target Companies) and Bemis
shall procure that, with effect from the Closing Date, the Target Companies
shall not pursue any claims or entitlements under any such agreements in
respect of the period on or prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

 **3.** ** ****INDEMNITY**

  



  

3.1 The relevant Share Seller (in respect of the Target Sub-Group it is
selling) and the relevant Asset Seller (in relation to the Sale Assets it is
selling) and AP2F (in relation to the AP2F Patents) shall indemnify and hold
harmless Bemis (and the relevant Target Company) from and against:

  



  

(a) Tax Liabilities (other than Transfer Taxes) that are imposed on the
Target Companies, or Tax Liabilities (other than Transfer Taxes) of the
Seller Group relating to the Sale Businesses, or Tax Liabilities of AP2F
(other than Transfer Taxes) relating to the AP2F Patents, in each case for
periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to Closing;

  



  

(b) Tax Liabilities arising as a result of the non-compliance with Section 6
of the Retail Sales Tax Act (Ontario) and any other applicable provincial
retail sales Tax or bulk sales (or similar) legislation, as contemplated by
Article 39.2;

  



  

(c) any stamp duty (including any interest, fines or penalties), which is
paid by a Target Company after the Closing Date on any instrument executed by
a Target Company prior to the Closing Date but only where: (a) it is
necessary to stamp the instrument as a result of the refusal of a
Tax Authority to allow a material benefit to a Target Company without
the production of such document, or (b) such instrument is required by
the court, arbitrator or referee to be stamped in order to be produced as
evidence in civil proceedings or a hearing (having force of Law) before an
arbitrator or referee to which such instrument is material, or (c) stamping
such instrument is necessary to effect registration in respect of the holding
of a material asset and such registration is necessary to protect the rights
of the Target Company in respect thereof;

  



  

(d) any Costs (other than Taxation) properly incurred by Bemis or a Target
Company in connection with any Taxes (or with any successful claim therefor)
for which the relevant Share Seller or Asset Seller or AP2F is required to
indemnify Bemis under this Schedule 13;

  



  

(e) any Tax Liabilities of a Target Company arising in a period (or portion
thereof) beginning after Closing to the extent they are the direct result and
consequence of the satisfaction, capitalization, distribution or transfer of
(i) a Cross-Group Loan after the Closing Date; or (ii) a Cross-Group Non-
Trading Receivable that is in existence after the Closing Date, but only to
the extent that the Tax Liability does not exceed the Tax Liability which
would have arisen if the relevant Cross-Group Loan or Cross-Group Non-Trading
Receivable had been repaid at Closing at its outstanding principal amount
together with accrued but unpaid interest as at Closing; or

  



  

(f) any Tax Liabilities of a Target Company formed under the laws of
Argentina arising in a period (or portion thereof) beginning after Closing to
the extent they are the direct result and consequence

   **[***] = Confidential treatment requested for redacted portion; redacted
portion has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.**

  



        
   

  



  

of the satisfaction, capitalization or discharge of a Cross-Group Loan or
Cross-Group Non-Trading Receivable after the Closing Date, but only to the
extent those Target Companies are insolvent under the Law of Argentina on the
Closing Date and the Tax Liability at issue is a direct result and
consequence of the fact that the Target Companies were insolvent under the
Law of Argentina on the Closing Date. For the purposes of this Paragraph
3.1(f), a Target Company formed under the Law of Argentina shall be regarded
as "insolvent" at a given date if at that date (i) the shares or members
quotas (as the case may be) of that Target Company do not have a fair market
equity value of at least US$1; or (ii) the outstanding Cross-Group Loans of
that Company have a fair market value which is less than their face value.

  



  

(g) Where Clause 3.1(f) applies, Bemis shall procure that all reasonable
steps are taken as promptly as practicable following Closing (and taking into
account the procedures and proposals in Schedule 14 ( _Cross-Group Debt_
)) so as to ensure, in a manner which minimises to the greatest extent
practicable the Tax Liability of a Target Company, that (i) the shares or
members quotas (as the case may be) of each Target Company formed under the
Law of Argentina have a fair market equity value of at least US$1; and (ii)
the outstanding Cross-Group Loans of that Company have a fair market value
not less than their face value.

  



  

3.2 In any case falling within Paragraph (b) or (c) of the definition of Tax
Liability the amount that is to be treated for the purposes of this Schedule
13 as a Tax Liability of the Target Company (the **_Deemed Tax Liability_**
) shall be determined as follows:-

  



  

(a) in a case which falls within Paragraph (b), the Deemed Tax Liability
shall be the amount of the repayment that would have been obtained but for
the loss, reduction or setting off mentioned in that sub-Paragraph; and

  



  

(b) in a case which falls within Paragraph (c), the Deemed Tax Liability
shall be the amount of Tax which becomes payable but which would have been
saved or relieved but for the loss or reduction of such Relief.

  



  

 **4.** ** ****LIMITS ON PARAGRAPH 3**

  



  

The indemnity in Paragraph 3 ( _Indemnity_ ) and the Tax Warranties shall not
cover any Tax Liability or related cost or expense of a Target Company:

  



  

4.1 to the extent that that Tax Liability does not relate to US Taxes and
arises or is increased as a result only of any increase in rates of Tax or
any change in Law or practice or any withdrawal of any extra-statutory
concession by a Tax Authority or any change in accountancy practice or
principles, being an increase, withdrawal or change made, in any such case,
after the Closing Date with retrospective effect; or

  



  

4.2 to the extent that that Tax Liability would not have arisen but for a
voluntary transaction, action or omission carried out or effected by Bemis or
a Target Company, or any other member of the Bemis Group, at any time
after Closing, other than any such transaction, action or omission carried
out or effected under a legally binding commitment of a Target Company
created on or before Closing; or

  



  

4.3 to the extent that that Tax Liability arises by reason of a voluntary
disclaimer by a Target Company after Closing of the whole or part of any
Relief to which it is entitled or by reason of the revocation by a Target
Company or a member of the Bemis Group after Closing of any claim for Relief
made (whether provisionally or otherwise) by it prior to Closing other than
at the RTA Representatives request; or

  



  

4.4 to the extent that that Tax Liability does not relate to US Taxes and
arises as a direct result and consequence of any changes required after
Closing under generally accepted accounting practice in a relevant
jurisdiction in the bases, methods or policies of accounting of Bemis or a
Target Company or

   **[***] = Confidential treatment requested for redacted portion; redacted
portion has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.**

  



        
   

  



  

any member of the Bemis Group and, for the avoidance of doubt, an increased
risk of audit of a Target Company as a result of such a change is not
considered a direct result and consequence for these purposes; or

  



  

4.5 to the extent that that Tax Liability does not relate to US Taxes and has
been made good by insurers or otherwise compensated for without cost to
Bemis, the relevant Designated Transferee or a Target Company _provided that_
if a Tax Liability has been made good by insurers but there is an increase in
the premium payable which is directly referable to that Tax Liability, then
the limitation in this Paragraph 4.5 shall not apply to the expense incurred
by Bemis, the relevant Designated Transferee or a Target Company in respect
of that increased premium; or

  



  

4.6 to the extent that that Tax Liability arises or is increased as a
consequence of any failure by Bemis to comply with any of its obligations
under this Schedule 13; or

  



  

4.7 to the extent that that Tax Liability does not relate to US Taxes and
arises as a direct result and consequence of a cessation of, any trade or
business carried on by a Target Company, being a cessation occurring on or
after Closing and, for the avoidance of doubt, an increased risk of audit of
a Target Company as a result of such a cessation is not considered a direct
result and consequence for these purposes; or

  



  

4.8 to the extent that Bemis or any member of Bemiss Group has already made
recovery in respect of that Tax Liability by means of a claim for breach of
any of the Warranties or under Paragraph 3 or otherwise under the Agreement
or any related agreement; or

  



  

4.9 to the extent that that Tax Liability comprises interest, penalties,
charges or costs insofar as attributable to the unreasonable delay or default
of any member of the Bemis Group after the Closing Date; or

  



  

4.10 to the extent that that Tax Liability is a Transfer Tax or VAT governed
by Part B of this Schedule 13; or

  



  

4.11 to the extent that Tax Liability is reflected as a liability or a
reduction in an asset in the calculation of Perimeter Working Capital, in the
Perimeter Closing Statements, in accordance with Schedule 15 ( _Post Closing
Financial Adjustments_ ); or

  



  

4.12 to the extent that that Tax Liability has been discharged on or prior to
Closing; or

  



  

4.13 if or to the extent that that Tax Liability relates to a mere timing
difference between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial
statements of a Target Company and their recognition in respect of that
Target Company for Tax accounting purposes; or

  



  

4.14 if, or to the extent that that Tax Liability arises from or as a result
of any election under Section 338(g) of the Code in respect of Thermaplate by
any member of the Bemis Group.

  



  

4.15 if, or to the extent that, Embalagens has a Tax Liability to the
Brazilian Tax Authority in respect of the prior underpayment of Brazilian
Federal Tax in respect of the plant at Maua and which is referred to in the
16 April 2007 infraction notice received by Embalagens and more particularly
described in the Disclosure Letter, and which liability is fully reflected as
such in the Perimeter Closing Statements.

  



  

 **5.** ** ****EXCLUSIONS**

  



  

5.1 The liability of a relevant Share Seller or Asset Seller under this
Schedule 13 shall be subject to the limitations in Schedule 5 of the
Agreement ( _Limitations on Liability_ ) to the extent they are expressed to
apply to this Schedule 13.

   **[***] = Confidential treatment requested for redacted portion; redacted
portion has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.**

  



        
   

  



  

5.2 No member of the Seller Group shall be liable for any Tax Claim unless it
receives from Bemis written notice describing in reasonable detail the
matters on which the Tax Claim is based not later than five (5) Business Days
after the expiry of the relevant statutory limitation period in respect of
the issue which is the subject of that Tax Claim.

  



  

5.3 Bemis shall not pursue any Tax Claim (other than a Tax Claim in respect
of corporate income Tax) against the relevant Share Seller or Asset Seller:

  



  

(a) with respect to any Target Company unless the total of all non-corporate
income Tax Claims with respect to that Target Company exceeds *** in which
case the relevant Share Seller shall be liable for the full amount of the Tax
Claims subject to the provisions of this Schedule 13; and

  



  

(b) with respect to the APFT Sale Business unless the total of all non-
corporate income Tax Claims with respect to the APFT Sale Business exceeds
*** in which case APFA shall be liable for the full amount of the Tax Claims
subject to the provisions of this Schedule 13; and

  



  

(c) with respect to the PPPI Sale Business unless the total of all non-
corporate income Tax Claims with respect to the PPPI Sale Business exceeds
*** in which case PPPI shall be liable for the full amount of the Tax Claims
subject to the provisions of this Schedule 13; and

  



  

(d) with respect to the APC Sale Business unless the total of all non-
corporate income Tax Claims with respect to the APC Sale Business exceeds ***
in which case APC shall be liable for the full amount of the Tax Claims
subject to the provisions of this Schedule 13.

  



  

5.4 Bemis shall not, and shall procure that each Target Company and each
other member of the Bemis Group shall not, enforce any statutory right of
recovery against any member of the Seller Group in respect of a Tax Liability
to the extent that the Bemis Group or a Target Company has made a recovery in
respect of that liability under this Schedule 13 and Bemis and the Target
Companies shall not be entitled to make a claim under this Schedule 13 in
respect of a Tax Liability to the extent that it, or a member of the Bemis
Group, has made a recovery in respect of that liability under any statutory
right or otherwise.

  



  

 **6.** ** ****MITIGATION**

  



  

6.1 Bemis shall, at the direction in writing of the RTA Representative,
procure that each Target Company shall take all such steps as the RTA
Representative may require to:-

  



  

(a) use in the manner hereinafter mentioned all such Reliefs, arising as a
consequence of or by reference to any Event occurring on or before the
Closing Date or in respect of a period ended on or before Closing Date which
are not treated as an asset of the Target Company in the calculation of
Perimeter Working Capital (but not Reliefs arising as a consequence of or by
reference to an Event occurring after the Closing Date or in respect of a
period (or portion thereof) commencing after the Closing Date), as are
available to that Target Company to reduce or eliminate any Tax Liability in
respect of which Bemis would have been able to make a claim against the
relevant Share Seller under this Schedule 13 (such Reliefs including Reliefs
made available to a company by means of a surrender or other method of
transfer from another company), the said use being to effect the reduction or
elimination of any such Tax Liability to the extent specified by the RTA
Representative and permitted by Law, and to provide to the
RTA Representative, at the relevant Share Sellers expense, a certificate
from the auditors (for the time being) of that Target Company (or another
nationally recognized accounting firm in the United States) confirming that
all such Reliefs have been so used; and

   **[***] = Confidential treatment requested for redacted portion; redacted
portion has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.**

  



        
   

  



  

(b) make all such claims and elections specified by the RTA Representative in
respect of any Tax accounting period of a Target Company commencing before
the Closing Date as have the effect of reducing or eliminating any such Tax
Liability as is mentioned in Paragraph 6.1(a), provided that no such claim or
election shall require that Target Company to use any Relief which arises
solely as a consequence of or by reference to an Event occurring after the
Closing Date or in respect of a period (or any portion thereof) commencing
after the Closing Date or is treated as an asset in the calculation of
Perimeter Working Capital and provided further that the claim or election
shall be in compliance with applicable Law. If the RTA Representative or its
duly authorized agent wishes a Target Company to make a claim or election in
relation to a Tax accounting period of a Target Company commencing before the
Closing Date, then it shall consult with Bemis about whether such a
filing would have a material adverse effect in respect of the Tax affairs of
that Target Company or any other member of the Bemis Group for any period
commencing after Closing. The RTA Representative shall not file an election
if Bemis can identify a material negative Tax impact on the Target Company
for a period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date that would
be more than likely to occur if the election were filed. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, the RTA Representative shall be entitled to file such an
election in any case where such a filing solely enables the relevant Target
Company to utilise net operating losses arising in Argentina or Mexico in
respect of a period (or portion thereof) beginning before Closing.

  



  

6.2 In the event that the Reliefs referred to in Paragraph 6.1(a) are not
available because they have been used by a Target Company or a member of the
Bemis Group after the Closing Date other than in accordance with Paragraph
6.1 or otherwise ceased to be available to a Target Company because of a
voluntary act outside the ordinary course of business of a member of the
Bemis Group, the relevant Tax Liability shall be deemed for the purpose of
this Schedule 13 and the Tax Warranties to be reduced or eliminated as if
such Reliefs had been available and applied in accordance with Paragraph 6.1.

  



  

 **7.** ** ****RELIEFS ETC.**

  



  

7.1 If the auditors for the time being of a Target Company (or other
nationally recognized accounting firm in the United States) shall certify (at
the request and expense of the RTA Representative) that any Tax Liability
which has resulted in a payment having been made or becoming due from the
relevant Share Seller or a member of the Seller Group under this Schedule 13
or for breach of the Tax Warranties shall give rise to a Relief for a Target
Company which would not otherwise have arisen, the Target Company is able to
use the Relief in order to effect a reduction in Taxes that would otherwise
have to be paid by the Target Company, the statute of limitations for the
period in which the Relief is used has closed without the relevant Tax
Authority successfully challenging the Relief, and the auditor (or other
accounting firm) certifies that the use of the Relief shall not have the
effect of rendering another Target Company Tax attribute irrevocably
incapable of utilisation, then the amount of that Relief shall be dealt with
in accordance with Paragraph 7.2; save to the extent that it can be dealt
with under Paragraph 7.6.  If the Relief in question is a deduction from or
offset against income, profits or gains, the amount to be so dealt with shall
be a sum equal to the amount of Tax that shall be saved through the use of
that Relief on the basis of the rates of Tax current on the date of the
certification made by the auditors (or another accounting firm) under this
sub-clause, and on the assumption that there are no other Reliefs available
to the Target Company (other than deductions in computing profits for the
purposes of Tax).

  



  

7.2 Where it is provided under Paragraph 7.1 that any amount (the **_Relevant
Amount_** ) is to be dealt with in accordance with this Paragraph:-

  



  

(a) the Relevant Amount shall first be set off against any payment then due
from the relevant Share Seller or a member of the Seller Group under this
Schedule 13 or for breach of any Tax Warranty; and

   **[***] = Confidential treatment requested for redacted portion; redacted
portion has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.**

  



        
   

  



  

(b) to the extent there is an excess, a refund shall be made to the relevant
Share Seller or a member of the Seller Group of any previous payment or
payments made by relevant Share Seller or that member of the Seller Group
under this Schedule 13 or for breach of any Tax Warranty and not previously
refunded under this clause up to the amount of such excess; and

  



  

(c) to the extent that the excess referred to in Paragraph 7.2(b) is not
exhausted under that sub-paragraph, the remainder of that excess shall be
carried forward and set off against any future payment or payments which
become due from relevant Share Seller or a member of the Seller Group under
this Schedule 13 or for breach of any Tax Warranty.

  



  

7.3 Where any such certification as is mentioned in Paragraph 7.1 has been
made, the RTA Representative or Bemis may request the auditors for the time
being of the relevant Target Company (or other nationally recognized
accounting firm in the US) to review such certification in the light of all
relevant circumstances, including any facts which have become known only
since such certification, and to certify whether such certification remains
correct or whether, in the light of those circumstances, the amount that was
the subject of such certification should be amended.

  



  

7.4 If the auditors (or other nationally recognized accounting firm in the
US) certify under Paragraph 7.3 that an amount previously certified should be
amended, that amended amount shall be substituted for the purposes of
Paragraph 7.3 as the Relevant Amount in respect of the certification in
question in place of the amount originally certified, and such adjusting
payment (if any) as may be required by virtue of the above-mentioned
substitution shall be made as soon as practicable by the relevant Share
Seller or member of the Seller Group or (as the case may be) to the relevant
Share Seller or member of the Seller Group.

  



  

7.5 If a relevant Share Seller or a member of the Seller Group has made a
payment under Paragraph 3 ( _Indemnity_ ) or for breach of the Tax Warranties
and a Target Company or another member of the Bemis Group either is
immediately entitled at the due date for the making of that payment to
recover from any person (not being a Target Company but including any Tax
Authority) any sum in respect of the Tax Liability that has resulted in that
payment becoming due from the relevant Share Seller or a member of the Seller
Group, or at some subsequent date becomes entitled to make such a recovery,
then Bemis shall procure that the Target Company or other member of the Bemis
Group entitled to make that recovery shall promptly notify the RTA
Representative of its entitlement and shall, if so required by the RTA
Representative and at the sole expense of the relevant Share Seller or other
member of the Seller Group, promptly take all appropriate steps (including
any steps requested by the RTA Representative) to enforce that recovery
(keeping the RTA Representative fully and promptly informed of the progress
of any action taken), and Bemis shall pay to the relevant Share Seller (or to
such person as the RTA Representative directs) whichever is the lesser of:

  



  

(a) any sum so recovered by the Target Company or other member of the Bemis
Group in respect of that Tax Liability (including any interest or repayment
supplement paid by the Tax Authority or other person on or in respect thereof
less any Tax chargeable on the Target Company or other member of the Bemis
Group in respect of that interest or repayment supplement); and

  



  

(b) the amount paid by the relevant Share Seller or the relevant member of
the Seller Group under Paragraph 3 (Indemnity) or for breach of the Tax
Warranties in respect of that Tax Liability.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Bemis shall not be required to pay the
aforementioned amount if and to the extent that:

  



  

(i) without prejudice to the provisions of Paragraph 4.5 regarding insurance
arrangements, this would require a member of the Bemis Group (other than a
Target Company with respect to rights that it held before Closing or a
Designated Transferee with respect to rights that it acquires by virtue of
acquiring the Sale Business) to exercise a right of recovery against a person
(other than a Tax Authority) where that right exists independently of this
Agreement; or

   **[***] = Confidential treatment requested for redacted portion; redacted
portion has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.**

  



        
   

  



  

(ii) this would otherwise require a Target Company or another member of the
Bemis Group to exercise a right of recovery against a Tax Authority involving
the use of any Relief: (A) to which any member of the Bemis Group is
entitled, other than a Relief to which the Target Company is entitled or a
Relief to which a Designated Transferee becomes entitled by virtue of
acquiring the Sale Assets; or (B) by the Target Company where that Relief
arises by reference to an Event occurring in, or by reference to a period (or
a portion of a period) beginning after Closing; or (C) which is a Relief
reflected as an asset in the Perimeter Closing Statements.

  



  

7.6 If a Target Company is or may be entitled to receive from any Tax
Authority a repayment or reduction for Taxation relating to any period
(including a portion of a Tax accounting period) ended on or before the
Closing Date in excess of the amount (if any) included as an asset in the
calculation of Perimeter Working Capital in respect of such repayment or
reduction, then:

  



  

(a) Bemis shall give the RTA Representative full details of the entitlement
as soon as practicable and in any event within ten (10) Business Days of
Bemis becoming aware of the entitlement arising;

  



  

(b) Bemis shall at the request of the RTA Representative promptly take all
appropriate steps (including any steps requested by the RTA Representative)
to procure that the repayment or reduction shall be obtained, keeping the RTA
Representative fully informed of the progress of any action taken; and

  



  

(c) Bemis shall procure that an amount equal to the repayment or reduction
(including any repayment supplement or interest) received by Bemis, a Target
Company or any other member of the Bemis Group less any amount taken into
account in the Perimeter Net Debt or Perimeter Working Capital Statements in
respect of the repayment or reduction and any additional Tax incurred by the
recipient in respect of the repayment or reduction shall be paid to the
relevant Share Seller (or to another member of the Seller Group at the RTA
Representatives direction) within five (5) Business Days of receipt.

  



  

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the relevant Share Seller shall not be
entitled to any refunds of Taxes or Tax Liability resulting from the
carryback of a Tax attribute that was generated in a period beginning after
the Closing Date and carried back to a period (or portion thereof) ending on
or prior to the Closing Date. In addition, the relevant Share Seller shall
not be entitled to a refund of Taxes (other than US Taxes) resulting solely
from a reduction of Tax rates or a change in Law which occurs after Closing
but with retroactive effect.

  



  

7.7 Bemis shall procure that Danaflex files in a timely manner any necessary
Tax Returns, amended Tax Returns and/or Refund claims required to ensure that
the New Zealand Foreign Investor Tax Credit to which Danaflex becomes
entitled as a result of paying a dividend prior to Closing (the ** _FITC_** )
is applied to generate a refund and/or elimination (the ** _NZ Refund_** )
of the corporate income Tax otherwise payable by Danaflex in respect of the
following Tax accounting periods in the following order:

  



  

(a) the Tax accounting period ended 31 December 2009;

  



  

(b) the Tax accounting period ended 31 December 2008.

  



  

7.8 Promptly following Danaflex receiving the benefit of the NZ Refund
(whether by way of refund and/or elimination of its liability to corporate
income Tax), Bemis shall procure that an amount (the ** _Further Sum_** ) is
paid to FEEP by the Designated Transferee in respect of Danaflex. The Further
Sum shall be:

  



  

(i) the New Zealand dollar amount of the NZ Refund (including any associated
interest or repayment supplement); less

   **[***] = Confidential treatment requested for redacted portion; redacted
portion has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.**

  



     

      
 

  



  

(ii) any Tax (quantified in New Zealand dollars) to which Danaflex is subject
in respect of the NZ Refund; less

  



  

(iii) an amount in New Zealand dollars equal to the New Zealand corporate
income Tax to which Danaflex would otherwise be subject in respect of the
period from 1 January 2009 to the Closing Date, (treating that period as
being a Tax accounting period if it would not otherwise be such a period) and
for which FEEP would otherwise be liable under Paragraph 3.1.

  



  

The Further Sum quantified as aforesaid will be translated into US Dollars at
the spot rate of exchange at which New Zealand dollars can be converted into
US Dollars at close of business in New Zealand on the date when Danaflex
receives the benefit of the NZ Refund. For the avoidance of doubt, Bemis
shall procure that Danaflex files its Tax Return for the Tax accounting
period ended 31 December 2009 not later than 30 April 2010. No Further Sum
shall be payable under this Paragraph 7.7 if and to the extent that an amount
corresponding to that Further Sum is (i) reflected as an asset in the
Perimeter Working Capital; or (ii) the Supplementary Dividend which gives
rise to the Further Sum does not have the effect of reducing Perimeter
Working Capital nor increasing Perimeter Net Debt nor giving rise to a
liability of FEEP under Paragraph 3.1; or (iii) the New Zealand corporate Tax
liability for 2008 has not been paid on or prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

 **8.** ** ****CLAIMS PROCEDURE**

  



  

8.1 Upon Bemis, a Designated Transferee or a Target Company, becoming aware
of a Tax Notice which may give rise to a Tax Claim, Bemis shall within twenty
(20) Business Days of such person becoming aware of such Tax Notice, give
written notice of that Tax Notice to the RTA Representative or, as the case
may be, procure that the relevant Target Company or Designated Transferee
gives written notice of that Tax Notice to the RTA Representative, and Bemis
shall further procure that that Target Company or Designated Transferee (if
the relevant Share Seller or Asset Seller assures the Designated Transferee
and that Target Company to their reasonable satisfaction that they shall be
indemnified against all losses, costs, damages and expenses, including
interest on overdue Tax, which may be incurred thereby) takes such action and
gives such information and assistance in connection with the affairs of that
Target Company or Designated Transferee as the RTA Representative may
reasonably by written notice request to avoid, resist, appeal or compromise
the issue that is the subject of the Tax Notice; _provided that_ Bemis shall
not be obliged to procure that the Target Company or Designated Transferee
appeal against any Tax Assessment if, the RTA Representative having been
given written notice of that Tax Assessment in accordance with the preceding
provisions of this Paragraph 8.1, that Target Company or Bemis has not within
thirty (30) **** days thereafter received instructions in writing from the
RTA Representative, in accordance with the preceding provisions of this
Paragraph 8.1, to make that appeal.

  



  

8.2 The actions which the RTA Representative may reasonably request under
Paragraph 8.1 shall include that Target Company or Designated Transferee
applying to postpone (so far as legally possible) the payment of any Tax
and/or allowing the RTA Representative to take on or take over at its own
expense the conduct of all or any proceedings of whatsoever nature arising in
connection with the Tax Notice in question, and, if the RTA Representative
takes on or takes over the conduct of proceedings, Bemis shall provide and
shall procure that that Target Company or Designated Transferee provides such
information and assistance as the RTA Representative may reasonably require
in connection with the preparation for and conduct of those proceedings.
The relevant Share Seller or Asset Seller shall reimburse that Target
Companys or Designated Transferees reasonably incurred external expenses in

member of

RTA Representatives prior written consent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Bemis shall not, and shall procure that
each Target Company or Designated Transferee and any of their respective
advisers shall not, submit any correspondence or send any other document to
any Tax Authority where Bemis or any such person is aware, or could
reasonably be expected to be aware, that the effect of submitting such
correspondence or sending such document could be to put such Tax Authority on
notice of any matter which could give rise to, or could increase, a Tax
Claim, without first affording the RTA Representative a reasonable
opportunity to comment thereon and without including such comments so far as
it is reasonable to do so.

  



  

8.4 The RTA Representative shall not settle any issue that is the subject of
a Tax Notice with respect to a Target Company or Designated Transferee in a
manner which it should be aware, acting reasonably, would materially and
adversely affect Bemis or that Target Company in respect of a taxable period
ending after the Closing Date without Bemiss prior consent (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  



  

8.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Paragraph 8, Bemis shall
not be obliged to procure that any Target Company or Designated Transferee
appeals any issue that is the subject of a Tax Notice in any forum beyond the
first independent judicial body competent to hear appeals against the
decisions of the relevant Tax Authority, unless the RTA Representative first
obtains an opinion from leading Tax counsel to the effect that such appeal
has a reasonable prospect of success.

the making of that payment shall be:-

  



  

(a) the later of the date falling five (5) Business Days after written demand
therefor is made by Bemis; and two (2) Business Days before the date that is
the last date on which the Target Company or Designated Transferee would have
had to have paid the Tax that has given rise to the liability of the relevant
Share Seller or Asset Seller under this Schedule 13 in order to avoid
incurring a liability to interest or a charge or penalty in respect of that
Tax Liability; or

  



  

(b) in a case falling within Paragraphs (b) or (c) of the definition of Tax
Liability, the date falling seven days after the date when the RTA

(or other nationally recognized accounting firm in the United States) have
certified, at the request of Bemis or the Target Company, that the relevant
Share Seller or Asset Seller has a liability for a determinable amount under
Paragraph 3 and has received a copy of such certification.

  



  

9.2 If any payment required to be made by a Share Seller or Asset Seller
under this Schedule 13 is not made by the due date for the making thereof,
then, except to the extent that the liability of the relevant Share Seller or
Asset Seller under Paragraph 3 compensates Bemis for the late payment by
virtue of its extending to interest and penalties, that payment shall carry
interest from that due date until the date when the payment is actually made
at the Default Interest Rate.

  



  

 **10.** ** ****DEDUCTIONS FROM PAYMENTS, ETC.**

made, leave the recipient with the same amount as it would have been entitled
to receive in the absence of any such requirement to make a deduction or
withholding.

  



  

 **11.** ** ****COUNTERCOVENANT**

  



  

11.1 Bemis covenants with each relevant Share Seller or Asset Seller to
procure that the relevant Designated Transferee pays to the relevant Share
Seller or Asset Seller (or to any other member of the Seller Group as
directed by the RTA Representative) (by way, to the extent possible of
adjustment to the Consideration payable for the relevant Sale Shares or, as
the case may be, the Sale Assets, under the Agreement but not so as to limit
the amount payable where not possible) an amount equal to any of the
following:

  



  

(a) any liability or increased liability to Tax of any member of the Seller
Group that arises as a result of or by reference to (i) any reduction or
disallowance of any Tax losses or other Relief that would otherwise have been
available to the relevant member of the Seller Group in connection with any
consolidation arrangements with Thermaplate; or (ii) any carryback from
Thermaplate of any Tax attribute into a consolidated return relating to a
member of the Seller Group where and to the extent that such reduction or
disallowance or carryback occurs as a result of any voluntary transaction,
action or omission taken after the Closing Date by Thermaplate other than at
the written direction, or with the written consent, of the RTA
Representative;

  



  

(b) any liability or increased liability to Tax of any member of the Seller
Group which arises in respect of income, profits or gains or Events of any
Relevant Company (whether or not such Tax is actually assessed on
that Relevant Company) where (and to the extent that):

  



  

(i) the liability for that Tax arises in circumstances such that Bemis would
not have been entitled to make a claim against any relevant Share Seller or
Asset Seller under Paragraph 3 of this Schedule 13 in respect of that Tax had
it been paid by the Relevant Company; or

  



  

(ii) an amount has been paid by a relevant Share Seller or Asset Seller under
Paragraph 3 of this Schedule 13 in respect of that Tax.

  



  

and, for the purposes of this Paragraph, the term "Relevant Company" shall
mean a Target Company and any other member of the Bemis Group; and

  



  

(b) any costs and expenses properly incurred by the relevant Share Seller or
Asset Seller or any member of the Seller Group in connection with any such
liability or increased liability to Tax (or Tax Notice therefor) or in taking
any action under this Paragraph 11.

  



  

11.2 The RTA Representative shall not, and shall procure that each member of
the Seller Group shall not, enforce any statutory right of recovery against
Bemis or any member of the Bemis Group in respect of a liability to Tax to
the extent that it has made a recovery of that liability under Paragraph 11.1
and the RTA Representative shall not be entitled to make a claim under
Paragraph 11.1 in respect of a liability to Tax to the extent that it, or a
member of the Seller Group, has made a recovery in respect of that liability
under any statutory right or otherwise.

  



  

11.3 (a) Upon the RTA Representative becoming aware of a Tax Notice relevant
for the purposes of this Paragraph, the RTA Representative shall forthwith
give written notice of that Tax Notice to Bemis, and the RTA Representative
shall or, as the case may be, shall procure that each relevant member of the
Seller Group (a **_relevant Associate_** ) will (if Bemis shall indemnify the
relevant Share Seller or Asset Seller and/or the relevant Associate to the
reasonable satisfaction of the relevant Share Seller or Asset Seller against
all losses, costs, damages and expenses, including interest on overdue Tax,
which may be incurred thereby) take such action and give such information and
assistance in connection with the affairs of the relevant Share Seller or
Asset Seller and/or the relevant Associate as Bemis may

   **[***] = Confidential treatment requested for redacted portion; redacted
portion has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.**

  



        
   

  



  

reasonably and promptly by written notice request to avoid, resist, appeal or
compromise the Tax Notice: _provided that_ the RTA Representative shall not be
obliged to appeal against any Tax Assessment or to procure that the relevant
Associate appeals against any Tax Assessment if, Bemis having been given
written notice of the receipt of that Tax Assessment in accordance with the
preceding provisions of this sub-clause, the RTA Representative or the
relevant Associate has not within 30 days thereafter received instructions in
writing from Bemis, in accordance with the preceding provisions of this sub-
clause, to make that appeal.

  



  

(b) The actions which Bemis may reasonably request under sub-Paragraph
11.3(a) shall include (without limitation) the RTA Representative and/or the
relevant Associate applying to postpone (so far as legally possible) the
payment of any Tax and/or allowing Bemis to take on or take over at its own
expense the conduct of all or any proceedings of whatsoever nature arising in
connection with the Tax Notice in question, and, if Bemis takes on or takes
over the conduct of proceedings, the RTA Representative shall provide and/or
shall procure that the relevant Associate shall provide such information and
assistance as Bemis may reasonably require in connection with the preparation
for and conduct of those proceedings. In a case where Bemis has not,

of a Tax Notice be avoided, resisted, appealed or compromised, the
RTA Representative shall procure that no claim, action or issue in respect of
which Bemis could be required to procure a payment under this Paragraph 11 is
settled or otherwise compromised without the RTA Representatives prior
written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The
RTA Representative shall, and shall procure that each relevant Associate and
any of their respective advisers shall not submit any correspondence or send
any other document to any Tax Authority where the RTA Representative or any
such person is aware, or could reasonably be expected to be aware, that the
effect of submitting such correspondence or sending such document could be to
put such Tax Authority on notice of any matter which could give rise to, or
could increase, a Tax Claim, without first affording Bemis a reasonable
opportunity to comment thereon and without including such comments so far as
it is reasonable to do so.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Paragraph 11, the RTA
Representative shall not be obliged to appeal, nor to procure that any
relevant Associate appeals any issue that is the subject of a Tax Notice in
any forum beyond the first relevant independent judicial body competent to
hear appeals against the decisions of the relevant Tax Authority, unless
Bemis first obtains an opinion from leading Tax counsel to the effect that
such appeal has a reasonable prospect of success.

written demand therefor is made by the RTA Representative; and two (2)
Business Days before the last date on which the relevant Share Seller or
Asset Seller or, as the case may be, the relevant Associate would have had to
have paid to the appropriate Tax Authority the Tax that has given rise to
Bemiss liability under Paragraph 11.1 in order to avoid incurring a
liability to interest or a charge or penalty in respect of that Tax.

  



  

(b) If any payment, in cleared funds, required to be procured by Bemis under
Paragraph 11.1 is not made by the due date for the making thereof, then,
except to the extent that Bemiss liability under Paragraph 11.1 compensates
the relevant Share Seller or Asset Seller or, as the case may be, the
relevant Associate for the late payment by virtue of its extending to
interest and penalties, that payment shall carry interest from that due date
until the date when the payment is actually made, in cleared funds, at the
Default Interest Rate.

  



  

11.5 (a) All sums (other than interest) procured to be paid by Bemis under
this Part shall be paid free and clear of all deductions or withholdings
whatsoever, save only as may be required by law.

entitled to receive in the absence of any such requirement to make a
deduction or withholding.

 **ALLOCATION**

  

 ** **

  

 **1.** ** ****ALLOCATION OF CONSIDERATION AMONG SALE ASSETS**

  



  

1.1 The amount of the consideration attributable to each class of Sale Assets
(as classified for Canadian income tax purposes) where the Asset Seller of
the relevant Sale Business is APC shall be determined by allocating the final
consideration for the relevant Sale Business as set out in the Final Business
Allocation among the Sale Assets of that Sale Business in accordance with the
relative fair market value of each Sale Asset. Where the Asset Seller of the
relevant Sale Business is APFA or PPPI, the consideration for each such Sale
Business shall be determined, based on the final consideration for the
relevant Sale Business as set out in the Final Business Allocation, in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations
thereunder (which consideration shall, for the avoidance of doubt include the
amount of any liabilities discharged as determined for purposes of Section
1060 of the Code), and an allocation of such consideration shall be made
amongst the various classes of Sale Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of
the Code and any applicable Treasury Regulations thereunder and based on a
valuation study conducted by an independent appraiser of repute who shall
value the fixed assets.

  



  

1.2 As promptly as practicable, and no later than sixty (60) Business Days
after the date the Final Business Allocation is determined, Bemis shall
prepare and deliver to the RTA Representative an allocation schedule
allocating the final consideration to the Sale Assets of APC in accordance
with Paragraph 1.1 (the **_Proposed Allocation Schedule_** )
_provided, however,_ that in no event shall the Proposed Allocation Schedule
be delivered to the RTA Representative less than ninety (90) Business Days
prior to the date on which APC is required to file its corporate income tax
return for the taxable period in which Closing occurred (such date to be
provided by the RTA Representative to Bemis at least one month in advance).
With respect to Sale Assets of PPPI and APFA, as promptly as practicable, and
no later than sixty (60) Business Days, after the Final Business Allocation
is determined, Bemis shall prepare and deliver to the RTA Representative an
IRS Form 8594 (the **_Proposed Form 8594_**) allocating the consideration
paid for the Sale Assets of PPPI and APFA amongst the classes of assets as
required in IRS Form 8594; provided, however, that in no event shall the
Proposed Form 8594 be delivered to the RTA Representative less than ninety
(90) Business Days prior to the date on which PPPI and/or APFA, or any
consolidated group of which PPPI and/or APFA is a member, is required to file
its US federal income tax return (including any extensions of such filing
deadline that the RTA Representative may, in its sole discretion, obtain) for
the taxable year in which the Closing occurred (such date to be provided by
the RTA Representative to Bemis at least one month in advance). The
RTA Representative shall have thirty (30) Business Days following delivery of
the Proposed Allocation Schedule or Proposed Form 8594, as the case may
be, during which to notify Bemis in writing (an **_Allocation Notice of
Objection_** ) of any objections to the Proposed Allocation Schedule or
Proposed Form 8594, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis of its
objections.  If the RTA Representative fails to deliver an Allocation Notice
of Objection in accordance with this Paragraph 1.2, the Proposed
Allocation Schedule or Proposed Form 8594, as the case may be, shall be
conclusive and binding on all parties to the Agreement and shall become the
**_Final Allocation Schedule_** or the **_Final Form 8594_**. If the RTA
Representative submits an Allocation Notice of Objection, then (A) for twenty
(20) Business Days after the date Bemis receives the Allocation Notice of
Objection, Bemis and the RTA Representative shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to agree on the allocations (if agreement is reached the agreed
schedule shall become the Final Allocation Schedule or Final Form 8594) and
(B) failing such agreement, the matter shall be resolved in accordance with
Paragraph 1.3.

  



  

1.3 If the RTA Representative and Bemis have not agreed on the Final
Allocation Schedule or Final Form 8594 within twenty (20) Business Days after
delivery of an Allocation Notice of Objection, then the RTA Representative
and Bemis shall each have the right to deliver notice to the other party of
its or their intent to refer the matter for resolution to an internationally
recognized firm of accountants (the **_Accounting Expert_** ) to be selected
by mutual agreement of the RTA Representative and Bemis, or

portion has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.**

  



        
   

  



  

failing that, to be chosen by an independent third party that is mutually
agreeable to the RTA Representative and Bemis. The Accounting Expert shall
act as expert and not as arbitrator. Within two (2) Business Days of
selection of the Accounting Expert, the RTA Representative and Bemis shall
each deliver to the other and to the Accounting Expert a notice setting forth
in reasonable detail their proposed allocations. The RTA Representative and
Bemis shall make readily available to the Accounting Expert all relevant
books and records and any work papers (including those of their respective
accountants, to the extent permitted by such accountants) relating to the
Proposed Allocation Schedule or the Proposed Form 8594 and all other items
reasonably requested by the Accounting Expert in connection therewith. Within
fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of the proposed allocations, the
Accounting Expert shall deliver the Final Allocation Schedule and provide a
written description of the basis for its determination of the allocations
therein; _provided that_ , if the Accounting Expert requests a hearing before
making a determination, such hearing shall be held within twenty (20)
Business Days of delivery by the RTA Representative and Bemis of their
respective proposed allocations and the delivery of the Final Allocation
Schedule shall be made within ten (10) Business Days of such hearing. The
Final Allocation Schedule determined by the Accounting Expert shall be
binding except in the case of manifest error. The fees and expenses of
the Accounting Expert shall be apportioned among the RTA Representative and
Bemis as the Accounting Expert shall determine.  Each party shall bear the
costs of its own counsel, witnesses (if any) and employees.

  



  

1.4 If a price adjustment in respect of the Sale Business sold by APC is made
in accordance with Articles 2.12, 2.13 or 2.14, in each case in accordance
with the Allocation Percentages, such adjustment shall be allocated across
the relevant Sale Assets according to the proportion the existing allocation
to a Sale Asset determined in accordance with Paragraph 1.1 above bears to
the final consideration for the relevant Sale Business as set out in the
Final Business Allocation except to the extent that such adjustment is made
in respect of a particular Sale Asset or Sale Assets in which case the
adjustment shall be allocated to such Sale Asset or Sale Assets. Where the
Asset Seller of the relevant Sale Business is PPPI or APFA, the allocation
shall be made in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and any applicable
Treasury Regulations.

  



  

1.5 In the event an allocation of consideration attributable to a Sale Asset
is required at a time, or to a level of detail, not practicable in accordance
with the above procedure (including without limitation for the purposes of
any Transfer Tax or VAT), the RTA Representative and Bemis shall co-operate
to agree such allocation by reference to the fair market value of the
relevant Sale Asset.

efforts to achieve the principles set out in this Schedule 14 in a manner
which does not give rise to adverse fiscal, financial or economic
consequences for any member of the Seller Group or any member of the Bemis
Group.  To the extent that it does not prove workable to implement a
principle in respect of a Cross-Group Debt (other than Recharges)

payment in respect of each such matter will be determined by measuring the
differences between (a) the Perimeter Cash and Perimeter External Debt for
the relevant Target Sub-Group as shown or reflected in the Estimated
Perimeter Cash and Estimated Perimeter External Debt, and (b) those items as
shown or reflected in the Perimeter Closing Statement for the relevant Target
Sub-Group (and applying the Initial Allocation Percentage where the Share
Sellers exceed one in number).
