THE SALE

Section 2.01.  _Sale and Purchase of Shares_. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ "), (i) the Sellers shall
transfer, convey, assign and deliver to Purchaser and/or one or more of its
designees, and Purchaser and/or one or more of its designees shall purchase
and acquire from the Sellers, all of the Sellers right, title and

 



18  interest in and to the Shares and (ii) the Tata JV Seller shall transfer,
convey, assign and deliver to Purchaser and/or one or more of its designees,
and Purchaser and/or one or more of its designees shall purchase and acquire
from the Tata JV Seller, all of the Tata JV Sellers right, title and interest
in and to the Tata JV Shares, in each case free and clear of all Liens (other
than Liens imposed under federal, state or foreign securities laws and Liens
imposed solely due to actions of Purchaser) (clauses (i) and (ii) together,
the " _Sale_ "). The transfer of certain Foreign Transferred Companies
organized in jurisdictions in which local Laws require specified formalities
or other procedures to be observed in order to legally effect a transfer of
such entity shall be effected pursuant to short-form acquisition agreements as
further described in _Section 2.08_.

 

Section 2.02. _Purchase Price_. In consideration for the Shares and the Tata
JV Shares, at the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver to the Sellers (and/or one
or more of Parents designees) an aggregate of (a) $9,000,000,000.00 (nine
billion dollars) in cash (the " _Pre-Adjustment Cash Amount_ ") plus or minus
(as applicable) (b) the Closing Adjustment, if any, pursuant to _Section
2.04_ (the sum of (a) and (b), the " _Purchase Price_ "). The Purchase Price
shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in _Section 2.05_.

 

Section 2.03. _Closing_. (a) The Closing shall take place (i) at the offices
of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, New York
10019, at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on the date that is three (3) Business
Days after the date on which all of the conditions set forth in _Article 8_
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or
waived on the Closing Date, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions) are satisfied or waived, or (ii) at such other place, time or date
as may be mutually agreed upon in writing by Parent and Purchaser. The date
on which the Closing occurs is the " _Closing Date_."

(b) At the Closing:

 

(i) Parent or the other Sellers, as applicable, shall:

 

(A) deliver or cause to be delivered to Purchaser and/or one or more of its
designees (x) certificates evidencing the Shares and the Tata JV Shares to
the extent that such Shares or the Tata JV Shares are in certificate form,
duly endorsed in blank or with stock powers duly executed in proper form for
transfer and (y) to the extent that such Shares or the Tata JV Shares are not
in certificate form, stock powers or other instruments of transfer duly
executed in blank, in each case, with any required stock transfer stamps
affixed thereto;

 

(B) deliver to Purchaser the certificate required to be delivered pursuant to
_Section 8.02(c)_;

 

(C) execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, as applicable,
to Purchaser each of the Ancillary Agreements to which any member of the
Parent Group is a party;

 



19 (D) deliver to Purchaser each payoff letter obtained with respect to
the Specified Indebtedness pursuant to _Section 5.09_;

(E) for each Seller that (x) is a United States Person, within the meaning of
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, and (y) transfers pursuant to this Agreement
shares of a Transferred Company that is a domestic corporation, deliver to
Purchaser a duly executed certificate of non-foreign status, substantially in
the form of the sample certification set forth in Treasury Regulation Section
1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv)(B);

 

(F) deliver to Purchaser one or more duly executed IRS Forms 8023 and such
other forms, in each case, required to be delivered pursuant to _Section
7.01(c)_;

(G) deliver to Purchaser the resignation or removal, effective as of the
Closing, of those directors and officers of any Transferred Entity as
requested by Purchaser to Parent in writing at least five (5) Business Days
prior to the anticipated Closing Date; and

 

(ii) Purchaser shall:

 

(A) deliver to Parent (or to any Affiliate designated by Parent) on behalf of
the Sellers by wire transfer, to an account or accounts designated by Parent
(or by such Affiliate) prior to the Closing, immediately available funds in an
aggregate amount equal to the Purchase Price;

 

(B) deliver to Parent the certificate required to be delivered pursuant to
_Section 8.03(c)_;

 

(C) execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, to the Sellers
each of the Ancillary Agreements to which Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party; and

(D) deliver to Parent one or more duly executed IRS Forms 8023 and such other
forms, in each case, required to be delivered pursuant to _Section 7.01(c)_.

Section 2.04. _Closing Adjustment_. (a) Not less than five (5) Business Days
prior to the anticipated Closing Date, Parent shall provide Purchaser with an
estimated statement of Working Capital and Net Indebtedness as of the opening
of business on the Closing Date (the " _Statement of Estimated Closing
Working Capital and Indebtedness_ "), which shall be accompanied by a notice
(the " _Closing Notice_ ") signed by an authorized officer of Parent that sets
forth (i) Parents good faith determination of the Closing Adjustment and the
Purchase Price after giving effect to the Closing Adjustment and (ii) the
account or accounts to which Purchaser shall transfer the Purchase Price
pursuant to  _Section 2.03_.

 



20 (b) The Closing Notice shall specify an amount (which may be positive or
negative) (the " _Closing Adjustment_ ") that shall be equal to (i) the
amount of Working Capital set forth in the Statement of Estimated Closing
Working Capital and Net Indebtedness, less (ii) the Target Working Capital
Amount, less (iii) the amount of Net Indebtedness set forth in the Statement
of Estimated Closing Working Capital and Indebtedness. Parent shall make its
representatives reasonably available to Purchaser prior to the Closing and
following delivery of the Closing Notice to discuss its calculation of the
Closing Adjustment and shall consider Purchasers reasonable comments in good
faith. If the Closing Adjustment is a positive amount, then the Purchase Price
shall be equal to the Pre-Adjustment Cash Amount increased by the amount of
the Closing Adjustment. If the Closing Adjustment is a negative amount, then
the Purchase Price shall be equal to the Pre-Adjustment Cash Amount decreased
by the absolute value of the Closing Adjustment.

 

(c) The Statement of Estimated Closing Working Capital and Indebtedness shall
be prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles attached as
_Schedule II-A_ hereto (the " _Accounting Principles_ "), and in the case of
the calculation of Working Capital set forth therein, in accordance with the
definition of "Working Capital."

 

(d) For illustrative purposes, _Annex I of Schedule II_ sets forth a
calculation of the Working Capital as if the Closing had occurred on March
31, 2015 (the " _Illustrative Working Capital Statement_ ").

Section 2.05. _Post-Closing Statements_. (a) Within ninety (90) days after
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare in good faith and deliver to Parent
a statement of Working Capital and Net Indebtedness as of the opening of
business on the Closing Date (the " _Initial Working Capital and Indebtedness
Statement_ ") in accordance with the Accounting Principles, and in the case of
the calculation of Working Capital set forth therein, in accordance with the
definition of "Working Capital." The Sellers will, and will use their
reasonable best efforts to cause their accountants and other representatives
to, cooperate with and assist Purchaser in connection with the preparation of
the Initial Working Capital and Indebtedness Statement, including by
providing to Purchaser reasonable access upon reasonable notice to their
books, records and work papers and making available upon reasonable notice
personnel to the extent reasonably required; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the accountants of the Sellers shall not be obliged to make any work papers
available to Purchaser or its representatives except in accordance with such
accountants normal disclosure procedures and then only after such Person has
signed a customary agreement relating to such access to work papers in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants.

(b) Following the Closing through the date that the Final Working Capital and
Indebtedness Statement becomes final and binding, the Sellers and their
representatives will be permitted to review Purchasers and the Transferred
Entities books, records and work papers relating to the Initial Working
Capital and Indebtedness Statement. Purchaser will, and will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its accountants and other representatives to,
cooperate with and assist the Sellers in the conduct of such review,

 



21  including by providing to Parent reasonable access upon reasonable notice to
such books, records and work papers and making available upon reasonable
notice personnel to the extent reasonably required; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the accountants of Purchaser shall not be obliged to make any work papers
available to the Sellers or their representatives except in accordance with
such accountants normal disclosure procedures and then only after such
Person has signed a customary agreement relating to such access to work papers
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants.

 

(c) Purchaser agrees that, following the Closing through the date that the
Final Working Capital and Indebtedness Statement becomes final and binding,
it will not take or permit to be taken any actions with respect to any
accounting books, records, policies or procedures on which the Business
Financial Statements or the Initial Working Capital and Indebtedness Statement
is based, or on which the Final Working Capital and Indebtedness Statement is
to be based, that would materially impede or delay the determination of the
amount of Working Capital or Indebtedness as of the Closing Date or the
preparation of any Notice of Disagreement or the Final Working Capital and
Indebtedness Statement in the manner and utilizing the methods provided by
this Agreement.

 

Section 2.06. _Reconciliation of Post-Closing Statements_. (a) Parent shall
notify Purchaser in writing no later than forty-five (45) days after Parents
receipt of the Initial Working Capital and Indebtedness Statement if Parent
believes the Initial Working Capital and Indebtedness Statement contains
mathematical errors or was not prepared in accordance with _Section 2.05_,
which notice shall describe the basis for such belief and to the extent
practicable set forth the specific adjustments to Purchasers calculation that
Parent believes in good faith should be made (the " _Notice of Disagreement_
"). Any matters and amounts set forth in the Initial Working Capital and
Indebtedness Statement not raised in the Notice of Disagreement received by
Purchaser prior to the expiration of such 45-day period shall be deemed to
have been accepted by Parent and shall become final and binding upon the
parties in accordance with _Section 2.06(c)_.

 

(b) During the thirty (30) days immediately following the delivery of a Notice
of Disagreement (the " _Resolution Period_ "), Parent and Purchaser shall
seek in good faith to resolve any differences that they may have with respect
to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement.

 

(c) If at the end of the Resolution Period Parent and Purchaser have been
unable to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the
matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement, Parent and Purchaser shall
submit all matters that remain in dispute with respect to the Notice of
Disagreement (along with a copy of the Initial Working Capital and
Indebtedness Statement marked to indicate those items that are not in
dispute) to (i) Deloitte and Touche LLP, or in the event that Deloitte and Touche
LLP is unable or unwilling to serve in the capacity as the Independent
Accounting Firm, another independent certified public accounting firm in the
United States of national reputation mutually acceptable to Parent and
Purchaser or (ii) if Parent or Purchaser are unable to agree upon another such
a firm within ten (10) Business Days after the end of the Resolution Period,
then within an additional ten (10) Business Days, Parent and

 



22  Purchaser shall each select one such firm and those two firms shall, within
ten (10) Business Days after their selection, select a third (3rd) such firm
(Deloitte and Touche LLP or the other firm selected in accordance with clause
(i) or the third firm selected in accordance with clause (ii), as applicable,
the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "). Within thirty (30) days after the
Independent Accounting Firms selection, the Independent Accounting Firm
shall make a final determination in accordance with the Accounting Principles
(and in the case of the calculation of Working Capital, in accordance with the
definition of " _Working Capital_ "), binding on the parties to this
Agreement, of the appropriate amount of each of the items in the Initial
Working Capital and Indebtedness Statement that remain in dispute as indicated
in the Notice of Disagreement that Parent and Purchaser have submitted to the
Independent Accounting Firm. With respect to each disputed item, such
determination, if not in accordance with the position of either Parent or
Purchaser, shall not be in excess of the higher, or less than the lower, of
the amounts advocated by Parent in the Notice of Disagreement or by Purchaser
in the Initial Working Capital and Indebtedness Statement with respect to such
disputed line item. The statement of Working Capital and Indebtedness that is
final and binding on the parties, as determined either through agreement of
the parties pursuant to _Section 2.06(a)_ or _Section 2.06(b)_ or through
the action of the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this  _Section
2.06(c)_, is referred to as the " _Final Working Capital and Indebtedness
Statement_."

(d) All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by
the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by the Sellers on the
one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand. During the review by the
Independent Accounting Firm, Purchaser and the Sellers shall, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective accountants to, each make
available to the Independent Accounting Firm interviews with such personnel,
and such information, books and records and work papers, as may be reasonably
required by the Independent Accounting Firm to fulfill its obligations under
_Section 2.06(c)_; _provided_ , that the accountants of Parent or Purchaser
shall not be obliged to make any work papers available to the Independent
Accounting Firm except in accordance with such accountants normal disclosure
procedures and then only after such Independent Accounting Firm has signed a
customary agreement relating to such access to work papers in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants. In acting under this
Agreement, the Independent Accounting Firm shall be entitled to the privileges
and immunities of an arbitrator.

 

Section 2.07. _Post-Closing Adjustment_. The " _Post-Closing Adjustment_ "
shall be equal to (a)(i) the amount of Working Capital set forth in the Final
Working Capital and Indebtedness Statement less (ii) the amount of Working
Capital set forth in the Statement of Estimated Closing Working Capital and
Indebtedness, plus (b) (x) the amount of Net Indebtedness set forth in the
Statement of Estimated Closing Working Capital and Indebtedness less (y) the
amount of Net Indebtedness set forth in the Final Working Capital and
Indebtedness Statement. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive amount,
then Purchaser shall pay in cash to Parent (or one or more Affiliates
designated by Parent) the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment. If the Post-
Closing Adjustment is a negative amount, then Parent (or an Affiliate
designated by Parent) shall pay in cash to Purchaser the absolute value of
the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment. Any such

 



23  payment shall be made within five (5) Business Days after the Final Working
Capital and Indebtedness Statement becomes such, together with interest
thereon at the Interest Rate from the Closing Date until the date of payment.

Section 2.08. _Foreign Acquisition Agreements_. The transfer of each
Foreign Transferred Company organized in a jurisdiction in which local Laws
require observance of specified formalities or procedures to legally effect a
transfer of such entity shall be effected pursuant to short-form acquisition
agreements (the " _Foreign Acquisition Agreements_ ") on a country-by-country
basis. Each Foreign Acquisition Agreement shall be in substantially the same
form as Exhibit F hereto, except, as Parent and Purchaser may agree, including
for: (i) the deletion of provisions that are inapplicable to such Foreign
Transferred Company; (ii) such changes as may be necessary to satisfy the
requirements of applicable local Law; and (iii) such changes as may be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and Purchaser regarding employees and
employee benefit matters in order to adapt such agreement to the particular
circumstances of the relevant Foreign Transferred Company and country;
_provided_ , in each case, that the Foreign Acquisition Agreements shall
serve purely to effect the legal transfer of the applicable Transferred Entity
and shall not have any effect on the terms and conditions of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the allocation of assets and Liabilities
as between them, all of which shall be determined by this Agreement, or in
any way modify, amend or constitute a waiver of, any provision of this
Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement.

 

Section 2.09. _Withholding_. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the payment of the Purchase Price and any payment required to
be made by Purchaser pursuant to _Section 2.07_ such amounts as Purchaser is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to any such payment under the
Code or any provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. To the extent that
Purchaser withholds such amounts with respect to any Person and properly and
timely remits such withheld amounts to the applicable Governmental Entity,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to or on behalf of such Person. Purchaser shall (x)
promptly, and in any event no later than thirty (30) days prior to making any
payment described in this _Section 2.09_ (or, in the event any withholding or
deduction is required as a result of a change in Law occurring after such
date, such shorter period as is reasonable taking into account the relevant
circumstances), notify Parent in writing if Purchaser determines that any
withholding or deduction is required under the Code or any provision of
state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law with respect to any portion of such payment
(and such notice shall describe the basis for such deduction or withholding)
and (y) during such thirty (30) day (or shorter) period, provide Parent with
a reasonable opportunity to provide such forms, certificates or other
evidence, and reasonably cooperate with Parent to, eliminate or reduce any
such required deduction or withholding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the
extent any deduction or withholding with respect to a payment described in
this _Section 2.09_ was not required prior to, and is required as a result
of, a transfer or assignment by Purchaser (or any of its successors
or assigns) of any of its rights under this Agreement pursuant to _Section
11.08_ to an entity that is organized under the laws of, or is tax resident
in, a jurisdiction other than the United States, Purchaser shall (x) make (or
cause to be made) such deduction or withholding and

 



24  remit (or cause to be remitted) such deducted or withheld amounts to the
relevant Governmental Entity, and (y) pay to the relevant Seller such
additional amounts as necessary such that the relevant Seller receives the
same amount as it would have received had no such transfer or assignment been
made (including with respect to any additional amounts payable pursuant to
this sentence); _provided_ , that Parent shall reasonably cooperate with
Purchaser (including by providing any forms, certificates or other evidence
that Parent may reasonably provide) to eliminate or reduce any such required
deduction or withholding.

power and authority to carry on its businesses as now being conducted and (ii)
is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation
or other legal entity in each jurisdiction where the conduct of its business

or material other equity interest in any other Person.

due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by Purchaser,
constitutes, and each Ancillary Agreement, when executed and delivered by the
member of the Parent Group party thereto, and, assuming the due authorization,

any provision of the respective articles of incorporation or by-laws (or
similar governing documents) of the Sellers or any Transferred Entity, (ii)
result in a breach, violation or infringement of, or constitute (with or
without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any

obligation) under, or require the consent of or notice to any Person under,
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract, material Purchase
Order, Permit, Export Control Authorization or other instrument to which any

the Transferred Entities and the members of the Parent Group (to the extent
relating to the Business) are, and since July 19, 2010 have been, in

hereof, of each (i) Transferred Entity Benefit Plan covering Service Providers
located within a Material Employee Jurisdiction, (ii) material Seller Benefit
Plan and (iii) Multiemployer Plan to which any Transferred Entity contributes
for the benefit of a Service Provider, and identifies whether it is a U.S.
Transferred Entity Benefit Plan, International Transferred Entity Benefit
Plan, U.S. Seller Benefit Plan or International Seller Benefit Plan. The
Sellers have made available to Purchaser the summary plan description for each
material Seller Benefit Plan. The Sellers have made available to Purchaser
true and complete copies of each Transferred Entity Benefit Plan covering
Service Providers located within a Material Employee Jurisdiction (or the
current prospectus or summary plan description, if such plan is not written)
and all amendments thereto, and, as applicable: (A) summaries of material
modifications; (B) the most recently prepared actuarial reports and financial
statements; and (C) all material documents and correspondence relating thereto

during the two years prior to the date hereof.

 



30 (b) Except, with respect to any Seller Benefit Plan, as would not reasonably
be expected to result in a material liability to any Transferred Entity, (i)
each Seller Benefit Plan and Transferred Entity Benefit Plan is and has been
operated and maintained in material compliance with its terms and ERISA, the
Code and other applicable Laws, (ii) no material Action (other than routine
claims for benefits) is pending against or involves or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, is threatened against or threatened to involve, any (A) Transferred
Entity Benefit Plan or (B) any Seller Benefit Plan with respect to any
Service Providers before any arbitrator or any Governmental Entity, (iii) all
material contributions, premiums and payments that are due with respect to (x)
any Service Provider under any Seller Benefit Plan and (y) any Transferred
Entity Benefit Plan have been made within the time periods prescribed by the
terms of such plan and applicable Law and (iv) all material contributions,
premiums and payments (other than, if applicable, any payment not yet due

due are properly accrued to the extent required to be accrued under applicable
accounting principles and have been properly reflected on the Business
Financial Statements or disclosed in the notes thereto.

 

(c) No Transferred Entity Benefit Plan is a plan that is subject to Title IV
or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, and there is no liability
under Title IV of ERISA with respect to any Transferred Entity participating
in a Seller Benefit Plan that could reasonably be expected to become a
liability of a Transferred Entity, Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
following the Closing Date solely as a result of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. None of the assets of
any Transferred Entity are now, nor after the passage of time would they
reasonably be expected to be, subject to any lien imposed under Section
303(k) of ERISA or Section 430(k) of the Code by reason of a failure of any
Transferred Entity or any of their ERISA Affiliates (or any predecessor of any
such entity) to make timely installments or other payments required under
Section 412 of the Code to a Seller Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA.
From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser and its Affiliates will receive the
benefit of any funds that are set aside, or held in trust, by the Parent
Group for the purpose of funding any accrued liabilities under the
International Transferred Entity Benefit Plans, up to the amount of such
liabilities, or the amount taken into account in the Business Financial
Statements as an asset funding the liabilities under the International
Transferred Entity Benefit Plans, if greater.

(d) Each Seller Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS
or has applied to the IRS for such favorable determination letter within the
applicable remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code, and to
the Knowledge of Parent, there are no existing circumstances that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any such
Seller Benefit Plan. No Transferred Entity Benefit Plan is a plan that
intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code. No Transferred Entity
Benefit Plan has or would reasonably be expected to have any obligation to
gross-up, indemnify or otherwise reimburse any Service Provider for any
Tax incurred by such Service Provider.

 



31 (e) No Seller Benefit Plan for which Purchaser and its Affiliates (including
the Transferred Entities) following the Closing would reasonably be expected
to have any liability or Transferred Entity Benefit Plan provides or promises,
any post-employment or post-retirement medical, dental, disability,
hospitalization, life or similar benefits (whether insured or self-insured)
to any Service Provider (other than coverage mandated by applicable Law,
including Section 4980B of the Code).

 

(f) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or together with any other
event) will (i) entitle any (A) Service Provider (to the extent that any
Transferred Entity would reasonably be expected to have any liability with
respect thereto) or (B) Business Employee to any payment or benefit,
including any bonus, retention, severance, retirement or job security payment
or benefit under a Transferred Entity Benefit Plan or Seller Benefit Plan,
(ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or
funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits
under, or increase the amount payable or trigger any other obligation under,
(A) any Seller Benefit Plan with respect to any (x) Service Provider (to the
extent that any Transferred Entity would reasonably be expected to have any
liability with respect thereto) or (y) Business Employee or (B) any
Transferred Entity Benefit Plan or (iii) limit or restrict the right of any
Transferred Entity, or after the Closing, Purchaser, to merge, amend or
terminate any Transferred Entity Benefit Plan.

to comply in any material respect with the provisions of any Collective
Bargaining Agreement, and there are no material grievances (other than
individual employee grievances) outstanding against Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (including any Seller or any Transferred Entity) under any such
agreement. As of the date hereof, (i) there are no material unfair labor
practice complaints pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against
(x) any Transferred Entity or (y) Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(including any Seller) (to the extent it would reasonably be expected to
result in a material liability to any Transferred Entity) before the NLRB or
any other Governmental Entity, and (ii) there is no, and during the three (3)
years preceding the date of this Agreement there has not been any, material

Service Providers.

title, (iii)function, (iv) annual salary or wage rate, (v) most recent annual
bonus received and current target annual bonus opportunity and (vi) the value
of the most recent annual long term incentive awards received and current
target annual long term incentive award opportunity, _provided_ that, with
respect to any Key Employee who is identified pursuant to _Section 1.01(a) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ after the date of this Agreement, Parent
shall provide the foregoing information with respect to such Key Employee
within five Business Days of being so identified. Five Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, Parent will provide Purchaser with an updated version of
the information listed in the preceding sentence, updated as of such date. As
of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of Parent, no Key Employee has
either orally resigned or communicated in writing to the appropriate human
resources representative of Parent, any Transferred Entity or his or her
applicable employer that he or she intends to resign as a result of the

Parent, there is no, default under any restrictive covenants affecting the

that is complete and accurate, in all material respects, of all of the
material real property leased as of the date hereof by any Transferred Entity

after the Closing for Taxes of any other Person (other than another
Transferred Entity).

 

(i) None of the Transferred Entities (i) has, in the last five (5) years, been

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

Section 5.01. _Access_. (a) After the date of this Agreement until the

except to the extent relating to Tax matters (access, cooperation and
procedures with respect to which are governed exclusively by _Article 7_ ) (i)
afford to representatives of Purchaser reasonable access to the

Entities (other than to the extent related to any Excluded Assets), including,
to the extent produced in the ordinary course, and subject to applicable Law
(A) the Sikorsky "[ ]Q[ ] Earnings Release", (B) the Sikorsky "Q[ ]
201[ ] Balance Sheet Review" and (C) Sikorsky "Industrial Cooperation

by the Sellers, (ii) instruct the employees, counsel, accountants and other
representatives, in each case, as appropriate or relevant, of the Transferred
Entities and members of the Parent Group (to the extent relating to the
Business) to reasonably cooperate with Purchaser in good faith in connection
with the foregoing, (iii) maintain in operation the electronic data room(s)
made available by Parent to Purchaser and its representatives in connection
with the Sale and continue to provide Purchaser and its representatives with
access through such electronic data room(s) to all information contained
therein as of the date of this Agreement to the same extent provided prior to
the date hereof (for the avoidance of doubt, with no obligation to update the
electronic data room(s)). For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, it is understood and agreed that the Tata JV Seller is
not required to provide access to the offices, properties, employees or books
and records of the Tata JV (except, subject to the limitations set forth in
this _Section 5.01_, to the extent that the Tata JV Seller is rightfully in
possession of books and records of the Tata JV and is permitted to disclose
such books and records to Purchaser under applicable Law, the joint venture
agreement, confidentiality agreements or other documents applicable to the
Tata JV).

 

(b) Purchaser agrees that any permitted investigation undertaken by Purchaser
pursuant to the access granted under _Section 5.01(a)_ shall be conducted in
such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the operation of the
Business or any other business of Parent and its Subsidiaries. Purchaser and
its representatives shall not communicate with any employee of Parent and
its Subsidiaries (including any employees of the Transferred Entities)
without the prior written consent (including via email) of an authorized
employee of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that subject to applicable Law, the parties shall establish reasonable
protocols for communications between employees relating to pre-Closing
integration planning activities and to facilitate the provision of the access
rights of Purchaser set forth in  _Section 5.01(a)_). Notwithstanding
_Section 5.01(a)_, prior to the Closing Date Purchaser and its
representatives shall not conduct any Phase II Environmental Site Assessment
or conduct any sampling of soil, sediment, surface water, ground water or
building material

 



50  at, on, under or within any facility or property of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the Business Owned Real Property or Business Leased
Real Property. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
neither Parent nor the Sellers nor any Transferred Entity nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or disclose (i)
personnel records relating to individual performance or evaluation records or
medical histories (other than occupational histories) or (ii) information
where, upon the reasonable advice of counsel, such access or disclosure would
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such party or contravene any Laws
or obligation of confidentiality to a third party. Parent and Purchaser shall
endeavor in good faith to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements,
if practicable and without cost or Liability to Parent, the Sellers or
the Transferred Entities, in a manner that does not give rise to any of the
circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, none of the Sellers shall make available, or
cause the Transferred Entities to make available, Business Employee personnel
files until after the Closing Date, except that, to the extent reasonably
requested by Purchaser, Parent will make available, or cause the Transferred
Entities to make available, personnel records for the Key Employees and other
select Business Employees prior to the Closing Date (upon the written consent
of the relevant Key Employee or Business Employee to the provision of such
records; provided, that Parent and the Transferred Entities shall reasonably
cooperate with Purchaser to obtain any such consents).

(c) At and after the Closing, except to the extent relating to Tax matters
(access, cooperation and procedures with respect to which are governed
exclusively by _Article 7_ ), (i) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, afford the Sellers and their respective representatives,
during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, reasonable access to the
books, records and employees of each Transferred Entity to the extent that
such access may be reasonably requested by Parent, including in
connection with its financial statements, any Action or investigation
(including in connection with the matters covered under _Section 5.13_), any
SEC or other Governmental Entity reporting obligations and any other
requirement or request of any Governmental Entity, or as reasonably necessary
in connection with addressing or resolving any other dispute or issue with any
Governmental Entity, including with respect to contract pricing matters and
(ii) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford the Purchaser
and its Subsidiaries and their respective representatives, during normal
business hours, upon reasonable notice, reasonable access to the books,
records and employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries to the extent related to
the Business or the Transferred Entities (but not to the extent related to any
Excluded Asset) and reasonably requested by Purchaser, including in connection
with its financial statements, any Action or investigation (including
in connection with the matters covered under _Section 5.13_), any SEC or
other Governmental Entity reporting obligations and any other requirement or
request of any Governmental Entity, or as reasonably necessary in connection
with addressing or resolving any other dispute or issue with any Governmental
Entity, including with respect to contract pricing matters; _provided_ , that
nothing in this Agreement shall limit any of Purchasers, Parents or their
respective Subsidiaries rights of discovery. The terms and conditions of
_Section 5.01(b)_ shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to any access required to be
provided pursuant to this

 



51   _Section 5.01(c)_. Promptly following the Closing, Parent shall deliver or
cause to be delivered to Purchaser a copy of a DVD-ROM or flash drive
containing a correct and complete copy of all of the contents, as of the date
of this Agreement and any other contents added by Parent after the date hereof
(it being understood that Parent is not obligated to add any contents to the
electronic data room(s) after the date hereof), of the electronic data
room(s) made available to Purchaser in connection with the Sale.

(d) Except for Tax Returns and other documents governed by _Section
7.08(c)_, (i) Purchaser agrees to hold all the books and records of each
Transferred Entity or the Business existing on the Closing Date and not to
destroy or dispose of any thereof for a period of six (6) years from the
Closing Date or such longer time as may be required by Law, and thereafter, if
it desires to destroy or dispose of such books and records, to offer first in
writing at least sixty (60) days prior to such destruction or disposition
to surrender them to Parent, and (ii) Parent and its Subsidiaries agree to
hold all books and records of the Parent Group to the extent related to the
Transferred Entities or the Business (except to the extent related to any
Excluded Asset) existing on the Closing Date and not to destroy or dispose of
any thereof for a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date or such longer
time as may be required by Law, and thereafter, if it desires to destroy or
dispose of such books and records, to offer first in writing at least sixty
(60) days prior to such destruction or disposition to surrender them to
Purchaser; _provided_ , that neither party shall be required to retain such
books and records for which the other party has been provided with a copy.

Section 5.02. _Confidentiality_. (a) The parties expressly agree
that, notwithstanding the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement with respect
to termination thereof, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are
incorporated into this Agreement by reference and shall continue in full force
and effect until the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchasers
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate upon the
Closing only in respect of (i) Section 11 and Section 12 of the
Confidentiality Agreement (ii) that portion of the Evaluation Materials (as
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) to the extent relating to the
Business. The parties expressly agree that, notwithstanding the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement with respect to termination thereof, if, for any
reason, the Sale is not consummated, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect for a period of twenty-four (24) months
following the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

(b) Except as may otherwise be expressly provided in the Intellectual Property
Agreement, for a period of three (3) years from the Closing Date ( _provided_
, that with respect to trade secrets of the Business contained in any
Sensitive Business Information, the confidentiality obligations in this
_Section 5.02(b)_ shall remain in effect for so long as the relevant
information remains a trade secret under applicable Law), Parent shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, hold in confidence any nonpublic information
that is proprietary and competitively sensitive (" _Sensitive
Business Information_ ") to the extent relating to the Business (and not to
the business of Parent or any of its Affiliates other than the Business) from
and after the Closing; _provided_ that the foregoing restriction shall not
apply to information (i) that becomes available on a non-confidential basis
to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from and after the Closing from a third
party source that

 



52  is not known by Parent or its applicable Subsidiaries to be under any
obligations of confidentiality with respect to such information, (ii) that is
in the public domain or enters into the public domain through no fault of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) to the extent used by Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries in order to comply with the terms of this Agreement or any
of the Ancillary Agreements or any other Contract between Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries,
on the other hand, (iv) that is, following the Closing, independently derived
by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries without use of such Sensitive Business
Information or (v) subject to the immediately following sentence, that Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries is required by Law or required or requested
pursuant to legal or regulatory process to disclose. In the event that Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries is required by Law or required or requested
pursuant to legal or regulatory process to disclose such information, Parent
shall reasonably promptly notify Purchaser in writing unless not permitted by
Law or such legal or regulatory process to so notify, which notification
shall include the nature of such legal or regulatory requirement or request,
as applicable, and the extent of the required or requested disclosure, and
will use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Purchaser, at
Purchasers expense, to assist Purchaser in obtaining a protective order or
other appropriate remedy. If such protective order or other appropriate remedy
is denied and Parent is nonetheless required to disclose Sensitive Business
Information, Parent will furnish only that portion of the Sensitive Business
Information that is legally required or requested to be disclosed and will
exercise its reasonable efforts, at Purchasers expense, to obtain reliable
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to any such information
that is legally required or requested to be disclosed. Effective as of the
Closing, Parent hereby assigns (or to the extent another member of the
Parent Group is a party to any Pre-Closing Confidentiality Agreement, shall
cause such party to assign to Purchaser effective as of the Closing) to
Purchaser its rights under each Pre-Closing Confidentiality Agreement solely
with respect to the confidential information of the Transferred Entities and
the Business and solely if and to the extent such rights under the Pre-Closing
Confidentiality Agreements are assignable. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the date hereof, Parent shall, to the extent it has the right to do so
under the applicable Pre-Closing Confidentiality Agreement, instruct each
Person who executed a Pre-Closing Confidentiality Agreement to promptly return
or destroy all Sensitive Business Information in the possession of such
Person. Prior to the termination of this Agreement, without Purchasers prior
written consent, Parent shall not, to the extent relating to the Transferred
Entities or the Business, release any third party from, or waive, amend or
modify any provision of, or grant permission under, any Pre-Closing
Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 5.03. _Required Actions_. (a) Purchaser and the Sellers shall use
their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under any
applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Sale as promptly as
reasonably practicable, including (i) the preparation and filing of all forms,
registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate the Sale, (ii)
taking all actions necessary to obtain (and cooperating with each other in
obtaining) any consent, clearance, expiration or termination of a waiting
period, authorization, Order or approval of, or any exemption by, any
Governmental Entity (which actions shall include furnishing all information
required under the HSR Act

 



53  or any other Regulatory Laws) required to be obtained or made by Purchaser
or the Sellers or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the
Sale, and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the Sale and to fully carry out the purposes of this
Agreement. Additionally, each of the Sellers and Purchaser shall use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and shall
use reasonable best efforts to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under any applicable Laws to fulfill all conditions
precedent to this Agreement, in each case subject to the other provisions
of this _Section 5.03_ , and shall not, without the prior written consent of
the other party, except (i) as expressly required by this Agreement, or (ii)
as required by Law:

 

(A) (1) acquire or agree to acquire, by merger, consolidation, stock or asset
purchase or otherwise, any business or corporation, partnership or other
business organization or division thereof, (2) dissolve, merge or consolidate
with any other Person, or (3) enter into a joint venture or other material,
non-ordinary course business transaction with any other Person, in each case
if such transaction would reasonably be expected to prevent, delay, or impede
in any material respect the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; or

 

(B) take any action with the purpose, intent or knowledge ( _i.e_., knowledge
that the intended act would reasonably be expected to have the applicable
result) of causing any of the conditions precedent to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to fail to be satisfied or with the purpose,
intent or knowledge ( _i.e_., knowledge that the intended act would
reasonably be expected to have the applicable result) of preventing, delaying
or impeding the consummation of the Sale or any other transaction contemplated
by this Agreement; or

 

(C) agree or commit to do or take any of the actions described in _Section
5.03(a)(A)_ or  _Section 5.03(a)(B)_.

(b) Prior to the Closing, Purchaser, Parent and the Sellers shall, to the
extent not prohibited by applicable Law, each keep the others apprised of the
status of matters relating to the completion of the Sale and work
cooperatively in connection with obtaining all required consents, clearances,
expirations or terminations of waiting periods, authorizations, Orders or
approvals of, or any exemptions by, any Governmental Entity. In that regard,
prior to the Closing, subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and _Section
5.02_, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, each party shall as
promptly as reasonably practicable consult with the other parties to this
Agreement to provide any necessary information with respect to (and, in the
case of correspondence, provide the other parties (or their counsel) copies
of) all filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity or any other
information supplied by such party to, or correspondence with, a Governmental
Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Sale. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Joint Defense Agreement and _Section 5.02_,
to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, each party to this

 



54  Agreement shall promptly inform the other parties to this Agreement, and, if
in writing, furnish the other parties with copies of (or, in the case of oral
communications, advise the other parties orally of) any communication from
any Governmental Entity regarding the Sale, and permit the other parties to
review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other parties in connection with, any proposed written or oral communication
or submission with any such Governmental Entity. If any party to this
Agreement or any representative of such party receives a request for
additional information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity
with respect to the Sale, then such party will make, or cause to be made, as
promptly as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other
parties to this Agreement, an appropriate response to such request. Purchaser
and the Sellers shall not participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Entity in connection with this Agreement or the Sale (or make oral submissions
at meetings or in telephone or other conversations) or, in connection with any
proceeding by a private party regarding the transactions contemplated hereby
relating to the HSR Act or any other Competition Laws, with any other Person,
unless, to the extent reasonably practicable, it consults with the other
party(ies) in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such
Governmental Entity or applicable Law, gives the other party(ies) the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat. Subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement, Joint Defense Agreement and _Section 5.02_ and to the extent not
prohibited by applicable Law, each party shall furnish the other parties with
copies of all correspondence, filings, submissions and communications between
it and any such Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement and the
Sale, and furnish the other parties with such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other parties may reasonably request in

remove references concerning the valuation of the Business, (ii) as necessary
to comply with contractual arrangements and (iii) as necessary to
address reasonable privilege concerns; _provided_ that the obligation to
provide copies does not include documentary responses to a request for
additional information under the HSR Act. In furtherance and not in limitation
of the foregoing, the parties agree to consult and cooperate with one another
in connection with any submission by or on behalf of any party hereto in
connection with any Competition Laws; _provided_ that Purchaser, after prior,
good faith consultation with Parent and after considering in good faith
Parents views and comments, shall have the principal responsibility for
devising and implementing the strategy for satisfying the Competition Law
conditions set forth in _Section 8.01(a)_; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
the consent of each party shall be required prior to the taking of any action
(including the failure to take any such action), in connection with satisfying
the Competition Law conditions set forth in _Section 8.01(a)_ if such action
(or failure to act) would be reasonably likely to delay or impede in any
material respect the likelihood of satisfying any such conditions.

 

(c) Purchaser and Parent shall file, as promptly as practicable, but in any
event no later than thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement, their
respective notifications under the HSR Act and any other Competition Laws
where the applicants do not customarily submit a draft filing and/or
notification to the relevant Governmental Entity, and Purchaser and the
Sellers shall file, as promptly as practicable, any other

 



55  filings and/or notifications under applicable Competition Laws, but in any
event, any initial draft notifications of any other filings shall be submitted
no later than thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement. In the event
that the parties receive a request for additional information or documentary
materials after an initial notification pursuant to the HSR Act or any other
Competition Laws, the parties shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to certify substantial compliance with such requests, as applicable,
as promptly as practicable within three (3) months after receipt thereof (
_provided_ , that the parties shall consult with each other in good faith
with respect to the timing of any such certification, and consider in good
faith, acting reasonably, the views of the other party as to such timing,
including in the context of the optimal strategy in connection with obtaining
all necessary approvals so as to permit the Closing to occur in accordance
with the terms hereof (including such good faith consultation with respect to,
and consideration of, acceleration of such certification within such three (3)
month period)) and produce documents on a rolling basis, and counsel for both
parties will closely cooperate during the entirety of any such investigatory
or review process.

 

(d) Purchaser and the Sellers shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by
any Governmental Entity with respect to the Sale under any Regulatory Law. In
connection therewith, if any Action is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) challenging the Sale as violative of any Regulatory Laws,
Purchaser and the Sellers shall jointly (to the extent practicable) use their
reasonable best efforts to initiate and/or participate in any proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, in order to (i) oppose or defend against
such Action by any Governmental Entity to prevent or enjoin the consummation
of the Sale and/or (ii) take such action as necessary to overturn such Action
by any Governmental Entity to block consummation of the Sale, including by
defending any such Action brought by any Governmental Entity in order to
avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, overturned or terminated, including by
appeal if necessary, any Order that makes illegal or prohibits the
consummation of the Sale resulting from any such Action; _provided_ that
prior to taking any action described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii),
Parent and Purchaser shall first discuss in good faith whether taking such
action is reasonably likely to result in a successful outcome (it being
understood that Purchaser and the Sellers shall take the applicable action if
Parent so requests following such good faith discussion).

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject
to the remainder of this Section 5.03(e) (including the limitations set forth
below), the parties hereto understand and agree that Purchasers reasonable
best efforts shall include (i) entering into any settlement, undertaking,
consent decree, stipulation or agreement with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) selling,
divesting or otherwise holding separate (including by establishing a trust or
otherwise) or disposing of (including by way of an exclusive or non-exclusive
license), or taking, causing to be taken or refraining from taking any other
action, in the case of each of clause (i) and clause (ii), and otherwise
agreeing or committing to do any of the foregoing, with respect to any of
Purchasers or its Affiliates businesses, assets or properties or the
businesses, assets or properties of the Transferred Entities or the Business,
it being understood that Purchasers obligations pursuant to the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii) shall be limited to the following actions:

 



56 (A) selling, divesting or disposing of (including by way of an exclusive or
non-exclusive license), or the holding separate (including by establishing a
trust or otherwise) of, businesses, product lines or assets of (1) MST (but,
for the avoidance of doubt, no other businesses, product lines or assets of
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, except MSTs and Purchasers obligations
shall include (x) licensing, or causing the licensing, of intellectual
property owned or controlled by Purchaser or its Affiliates used or planned or
proposed (but not rejected by Purchaser) to be used on future programs
contemplated by Purchaser or its Affiliates as reflected in the Long Range
Plans of Purchaser or its Affiliates effective as of the date hereof or at or
prior to Closing (" _MST Intellectual Property_ ") (including up to a
perpetual, irrevocable, fully-paid, non-exclusive, world-wide license
providing for a field of use sufficient to allow the purchaser or licensee to
operate the applicable MST businesses, product lines and assets in the manner
operated by MST at the time of divestiture, and to pursue and perform on any
future programs of a substantially similar nature) and (y) de minimis assets
to effectively accomplishing a transaction otherwise required by this clause
(A)(1)), and (2) the Transferred Entities or Business (clauses (A)(1) and (2)
collectively, an " _Asset Disposal_ "), except that Purchaser shall have no
obligation to sell, divest, hold separate or dispose of businesses, product
lines or assets to the extent generating revenues in excess of $650 million in
the aggregate with respect to the foregoing clauses (A)(1) and (2) for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, and except that Purchaser shall not be
required to take any such action with respect to the X2 technology or its
applications from the Transferred Entities or the Business, without regard to
the revenues associated with that technology;

 

(B) accepting behavioral limitations, conduct restrictions or similar
commitments that limit freedom of action or result in the
voiding, elimination or release of any rights in respect of businesses,
product lines or assets of (1) MST (but, for the avoidance of doubt, no other
businesses, product lines or assets of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, except
Purchaser shall agree to behavioral limitations, conduct restrictions or
similar commitments with respect to MST Intellectual Property), and (2) the
Business or the Transferred Entities (excluding in each case, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Asset Disposal, which is the subject of the foregoing
clause (A)), except as would, individually or in the aggregate, when
aggregated with any Asset Disposal and any actions required to be taken
pursuant to the following clause (C), reasonably be expected to have
a "material adverse effect" on the Business and the Transferred Entities,
taken as a whole, or MST (with "material adverse effect," for purposes of this
clause (B), being measured in relation to the size of the Business
and Transferred Entities, taken as a whole); provided, however, that the
exercise by a third party of a pre-existing to the date hereof right to
terminate, or the voiding, elimination or termination of exclusivity rights by
a third party pursuant to a pre-existing to the date hereof right to
terminate such rights in, any teaming agreement shall not constitute, or be
considered in the calculation of, a material adverse effect for purposes of
this section; and

 



57 (C) accepting behavioral limitations, conduct restrictions or similar
commitments that limit freedom of action or result in the voiding,
elimination or release of any rights in respect of any business segment of
Purchaser (as set forth in Purchasers Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2014), other than the MST segment (it being agreed that for these
purposes the Business and Transferred Entities will be considered part of the
MST segment) (excluding in each case, for the avoidance of doubt, any Asset
Disposal, which is the subject of the foregoing clause (A), and
any limitations, restrictions or commitments which are the subject of the
foregoing clause (B)), except as would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to be material to any product category or capability
material to such business segment, it being agreed that none of (1)
integrating the Business or Transferred Entities into a business segment of
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries other than Purchasers MST business segment,
(2) deploying and instituting firewalls between any of Purchasers and its
Subsidiaries business units or segments or lines of business (including the
Business or Transferred Entities) and (3) acting as a non-discriminatory
merchant supplier of components or other products of the businesses, product
lines or assets of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including the Business or
Transferred Entities) would be material (each condition and action described
in clause (e)(i) or (e)(ii) that Purchaser is expressly not required to
accept or take after giving effect to the foregoing exceptions, shall be
deemed to be a " _Burdensome Condition_ "); _provided_ that, for all purposes
of determining whether a Burdensome Condition has occurred, (I) impacts on
the synergies or other benefits expected to be realized from the Sale will not
be taken into account and (II) impacts on the Business, the Transferred
Entities, Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries will be aggregated.

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.03 or otherwise,
Purchaser (a) shall have the right to choose which action(s) it will take in
order to comply with its obligations in this Section 5.03(e) ( _e.g._ , if
Purchasers obligations under this Section 5.03(e) require Purchaser to divest
one business line or another business line at the election of Purchaser, then
Purchaser shall be entitled to elect which business line it would divest), and
(b) shall have the right to choose when to offer to take any action(s) to
comply with its obligations in this Section 5.03(e); provided, that, subject
to Purchaser having the reasonable opportunity to make proposals and discuss
alternatives with applicable Governmental Entities, such actions are taken in
time to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as reasonably practicable.
For the avoidance of doubt, no actions taken pursuant to this Section 5.03(e)
shall be considered for purposes of determining whether a Business Material
Adverse Effect has occurred. Parent (i) shall not take or agree to take any
action identified in clause (a) or (b) of the second preceding sentence
without the prior written consent of Purchaser and (ii) if so requested by
Purchaser, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take or agree to
take any such identified action; _provided_ , that notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the Sellers shall not be obligated to take or agree or
commit to take any action (A) that is not conditioned on the Closing or (B)
that relates to any business, operations, assets, liabilities, product lines
or Subsidiaries not to be acquired by Purchaser pursuant to and in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



58 (f) Purchaser agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to provide such
security and assurances as to financial capability, resources and
creditworthiness as may be reasonably requested by any Governmental Entity or
other third party whose consent or approval is sought in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. Whether or not the Sale is consummated,
Purchaser shall be responsible for all filing fees and legal, economist and
other professional fees payable to any third party or any Governmental Entity
in order to obtain any consents, approvals or waivers pursuant to this 
_Section 5.03_, other than the fees of and payments to Parents and the
Sellers legal and professional advisors.

 

Section 5.04. _Conduct of Business_. (a) From the date of this Agreement
through the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement,
except (i) as otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement (including

Restructuring), (ii) as required by Law, (iii) to the extent relating to any
Excluded Assets (and not otherwise having a more than _de minimis_ adverse
effect on the Business), (iv) as disclosed in _Section 5.04 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule_ or (v) as otherwise consented to in writing by Purchaser
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
Parent shall cause the Transferred Entities and each member of the Parent
Group (with respect to the Business) to:

 

(A) conduct their respective businesses in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice;

Transferred Entity (except, in the case of clauses (2) and (3), as may
facilitate the elimination of intercompany accounts or arrangements (or the
extraction of Cash) contemplated by _Section 5.08_, _Section 5.09_ or
_Section 5.10_ );

 

(D) other than to a Transferred Entity, not issue, sell, pledge, transfer or
dispose of, or agree to issue, sell, pledge, transfer or dispose of, any

otherwise acquire, any options, warrants or rights of any kind to acquire any
shares of their capital stock of any class or other equity interests or any
debt or equity securities which are convertible into or exercisable or
exchangeable for such capital stock or other equity interests 

 



59  (except for issuances of shares by wholly-owned Transferred Entities to
their wholly-owned direct parent entities in connection with the elimination
of intercompany accounts or arrangements (or the extraction of Cash)
contemplated by _Section 5.08_, _Section 5.09_ or _Section 5.10_ );

(E) except for transactions among any of the Transferred Entities in the
ordinary course, not (1) incur in excess of $25,000,000 of third party (as

course of business and (y) sales or dispositions of businesses, product lines

any Transferred Entity Benefit Plan or any Collective Bargaining Agreement or
recognize any union, works council or other similar employee representative

Entity, (4) take any action to accelerate the vesting or payment of
compensation or benefits with respect to any Service Provider under any

(including any Seller) that is not the Transferred Entities; _provided_ ,
_however_ , Parent may grant awards and pay any cash incentive compensation or

(G) not enter into any Contract in relation to the Business for the sale

or any of their respective Affiliates in any Post-Closing Period; _provided_ ,
that any such action that results in the reduction or elimination of a Tax
Asset of a Transferred Entity that would otherwise exist as of immediately
prior to the Closing shall not for this purpose be considered as having the
effect of materially increasing the Tax Liability of Purchaser, any
Transferred Entity or any of their respective Affiliates;

(other than the expiration of the term of a Contract in accordance with its
terms) or cancel any Business Material Contract or (2) enter into or

_however_ , that no Transferred Entity or member of the Parent Group may
enter into a Contract including, or amend or modify a Contract or Purchase
Order to include (with respect to the Business), any provision of the type
described in _Section 3.15(a)(vi)_ (i.e. covenant that restricts or limits
in any material respect the ability of the Transferred Entities to compete in
any business or with any Person or in any geographic area);

 

(N) other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, not sell, lease, license or otherwise transfer or dispose of,

of the Transferred Entities or the Business other than settlements or
compromises of any Action where the amount paid in settlement or compromise
does not exceed $10,000,000 individually or $30,000,000 in the aggregate
(or unless Parent otherwise agrees to pay, or cause another member of the
Parent Group to pay, any amounts paid in such settlement or compromise) as
long as such settlement or compromise does not impose any equitable relief on
a Transferred Entity or the Business (it being agreed and understood that
this clause (O) shall not apply with respect to (x) Tax matters, which shall
be governed by clause (L) or (y) derivative, direct or other Actions brought
by or on behalf of Parent shareholders, except in the case of this clause
(y), to the extent any such settlement or compromise would impose any

used in the manufacture of, or sold together with, any products of the
Business) and related services that would otherwise not be prohibited by this
Agreement if entered into by a Transferred Entity with a third party or (4)
transactions to facilitate the elimination of intercompany accounts or
arrangements (or the extraction of Cash) contemplated by  _Section 5.08_,
_Section 5.09_ or _Section 5.10_ ; or

(Q) not agree or commit to do or take any action described in this _Section
5.04(a)_.

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Purchaser, directly
or indirectly, the right to control or direct Parents or any of its
Subsidiaries or the Transferred Entities businesses or operations. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct Purchasers or any of its Subsidiaries businesses
or operations.

Section 5.05. _Consents_. (a) (i) Parent shall, and shall cause each
Transferred Entity to, reasonably cooperate with Purchaser to obtain any
consents required from third parties in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this

 



63  Agreement (" _Third Party Consents_ ") under any material Contracts
(including, as applicable, the novation of customer Contracts with
Governmental Entities) to which any Transferred Entity is a party (other than
any Contracts that are Excluded Assets) (the " _Transferred Entity Contracts_
").

 

(ii) Except for those Parent Business Contracts set forth on _Section
5.05(a)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_, Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Parent Business Contracts to be
transferred, assigned or novated, as applicable, to a Transferred Entity as of
or prior to Closing in reasonable cooperation with Purchaser;  _provided_
that, with respect to any Parent Primary Business Contract, in lieu of
transferring, assigning or novating to a Transferred Entity such Parent
Primary Business Contract, Parent may elect to (following consultation with
Purchaser) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the agreement of the
third party that is the counterparty to such Parent Primary Business Contract
to enter into a new contract or amendment splitting or assigning in relevant
part (such agreement of such third party also being referred to herein as a
Third Party Consent) such Parent Primary Business Contract such that a
Transferred Entity will receive substantially the same rights, products or
services provided under such Parent Primary Business Contract to such
Transferred Entity or the Business prior to the Closing on terms and
conditions substantially similar in all material respects to those contained
in such Parent Primary Business Contract; _provided_ , that if Parent
exercises the election referred to in the foregoing proviso with respect to
any Parent 80% Plus Business Contract and Parent is not successful in
transferring to such Transferred Entity substantially the same rights,
products or services in all material respects provided under such Parent 80%
Plus Business Contract , then Parent shall, with respect to such Parent 80%
Plus Business Contract, at the request of Purchaser, comply with the first
sentence of this _Section 5.01(a)(ii)_ without regard to the foregoing
proviso, _provided_ , _further_ , that if Parent transfers, assigns, or
novates any Parent Primary Contracts pursuant to either the immediately
preceding proviso or the first sentence of this  _Section 5.06(a)(ii)_, the
provisions of Section 5.05(b)(iii) with respect to Holdover Contracts will
apply to such Parent Primary Contracts for the benefit of the Parent Group,
_mutatis mutandis_. Parent shall, and shall cause each Transferred Entity to,
reasonably cooperate with Purchaser to obtain any Third Party Consents in
connection with any such transfers, assignments, novations or splitting, as
applicable, of the Parent Business Contracts (including Parent
Primary Business Contracts); _provided_ , that in no event shall any Seller
have any further obligation under this _Section 5.01(a)(ii)_ with respect to
any such Third Party Consent that is not obtained on or prior to the date that
is the 180th day after the Closing Date. This _Section 5.01(a)(ii)_ shall not
apply to Shared Location Leases, which are governed by _Section 5.05(b)_.

 

(iii) With respect to any material Parent Business Contract (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any material Parent Primary Business Contract) (it
being understood that any Parent Business Contract that is a Business Material
Contract shall be a "material Parent Business Contract" or "material Parent
Primary Business Contract", as applicable, for purposes of this _Section
5.05_ ) in

 



64 respect of which a Third Party Consent is required but has not been obtained
at or prior to the Closing as contemplated by _Section 5.05(a)(ii)_, to the
extent not prohibited under the terms of such Contract, the applicable member
of the Parent Group that is party to such Parent Business Contract (or such
other member of the Parent Group as designated by Parent in good faith) shall
retain (or be transferred, as applicable) such Parent Business Contract (each,
a " _Holdover Contract_ "), and Parent and Purchaser shall, subject to the
assumption of all Liabilities (" _Holdover Contract Liabilities_ ") in
respect of or relating to such Holdover Contract by Purchaser (in the case of
any Holdover Contract that is a Parent Primary Business Contract, only to the
extent such Liabilities are in respect of the Business) until the earlier of
(a) the time such Third Party Consent has been obtained, (b) the expiration or
termination of such Holdover Contract in accordance with its terms and (c) the
one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date, cooperate in a mutually
agreeable arrangement under which Purchaser or a Transferred Entity obtains
the benefits and assumes the Liabilities thereunder in accordance with this
Agreement, including sub-contracting, sub-licensing or sub-leasing to
Purchaser or a Transferred Entity, or under which the applicable member of the
Parent Group would, to the extent commercially reasonable, enforce for the
benefit of Purchaser or a Transferred Entity, with Purchaser or a
Transferred Entity assuming the obligations of the applicable member of the
Parent Group under such Holdover Contract, any and all rights of the
applicable member of the Parent Group under such Holdover Contract against any
third party thereto. Purchaser agrees that it shall fully indemnify and hold
harmless Parent and its Affiliates for any Holdover Contract Liabilities and
Parent shall, to the extent not prohibited under the terms of such Contract,
use commercially reasonable efforts to as promptly as practicable pay or
cause to be paid to Purchaser or the applicable Transferred Entity when
received all monies, payment or other benefit received by any member of the
Parent Group under any such Holdover Contract or any claim or right or any
benefit arising thereunder (in the case of any Holdover Contract that is a
Parent Primary Business Contract, only to the extent such monies, payment,
benefit, claim or right or benefit are in respect of the Business). It is
understood and agreed that with respect to any such Holdover Contract, prior
to the one year anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent or the other
applicable member of the Parent Group may not voluntarily terminate such
Holdover Contract prior to its expiration date (A) for convenience or (B)
pursuant to any applicable advance notice period as set forth in such Holdover
Contract, if any, in respect of such termination. Neither Parent nor the other
applicable member of the Parent Group shall be obligated to renew or
otherwise extend for any period any such Holdover Contract (and Parent or the
other applicable member of the Parent Group shall be permitted to deliver any
applicable notice of non-renewal or non-extension); _provided_ , that, if a
Holdover Contract provides for a specified, finite number of renewal terms
that become automatically effective or become effective upon written notice of
the member of the Parent Group party thereto, in either case prior to the date
that is one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date, then Parent
shall exercise such renewal rights to the extent so directed by Purchaser;
_provided_ , that Parents obligations under the immediately preceding 

 



65  proviso shall only apply if and to the extent any such renewed or extended
term does not (in whole or in part) extend beyond the eighteen (18) month
anniversary of the Closing Date.

 

(iv) To the extent that (a) any Transferred Entity is receiving immediately
prior to the Closing from a third party any rights to Intellectual Property
pursuant to a Contract between a member of the Parent Group and such third
party, (b) such Transferred Entity would otherwise lose such rights to
Intellectual Property as of and as a result of the Closing, and (c) such
member of the Parent Group is able to extend such rights to such Transferred
Entity without obtaining the consent of, or incurring any monetary expense
payable to, the applicable third party, Parent shall, and shall cause such
member of the Parent Group to, extend such rights to the applicable
Transferred Entity. If the foregoing obligation would apply but for the
consent of the applicable third party being required, then Parent shall, and
shall cause such member of the Parent Group to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain such consent and extend such rights to the applicable
Transferred Entity; provided, that in no event shall any Seller have any
further obligation under this _Section 5.05(a)(iv)_ with respect to any such
Third Party Consent that is not obtained on or prior to the date that is one
hundred-eighty (180) days after the Closing Date.

 

(b) At or prior to Closing, Purchaser and Parent (or their applicable
Subsidiaries) shall enter into a lease, sublease or other occupancy agreement
(each, a " _Shared Location Lease_ ") governing each piece of real property
(i) set forth on _Section 5.05(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ or (ii)
mutually identified and agreed upon pursuant to the last sentence of this
_Section 5.05(b) _(each, a " _Shared Location_ "), in each case in accordance
with the terms set forth on _Section 5.05(b) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule_. Purchaser and Parent shall cooperate in good faith to negotiate
the form of Shared Location Leases by no later than sixty (60) days from the
date hereof. To the extent that the consent of a third-party landlord is
necessary for a Shared Location Lease and such consent is not obtained at or
prior to Closing, the lease, sublease or other occupancy agreement requiring
such landlord consent shall be treated as a Holdover Contract pursuant to
_Section 5.05(a)(iii)_ above. From and after the date hereof and prior to
the Closing, Purchaser and Parent shall cooperate in good faith to mutually
identify and agree upon any real property by no later than sixty (60) days
from the date hereof that (A) is used by both the Business and the
other operations of the Parent Group and that is not listed on _Section
5.05(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ and (B) is appropriate to treat as
a Shared Location pursuant to the terms of this _Section 5.05(b)_ and 
_Section 5.05(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, including 
_Section 5.03_, to the extent that transfers of, replacements of, or
notifications with respect to Transferred Company Permits (including Business
Environmental Permits) are required in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the parties hereto shall use
reasonable best efforts to effect such transfers, replacements and
notifications and Seller, Parent and their Subsidiaries shall cooperate with
the reasonable requests of Purchaser in furtherance of effecting such
transfers,

 



66  replacements and notifications until such Transferred Company Permits have
been transferred, replaced or are the subject of notifications accepted by the
pertinent Governmental Entity;  _provided_ , that in no event shall any
Seller have any further obligation under this _Section 5.05(c)_ with respect
to any such Transferred Company Permit that is not obtained transferred,
replaced or noticed, as applicable, on or prior to the six (6)-month
anniversary of the Closing Date.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none
of Purchaser, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall have any
obligation to make payments or incur any costs or expenses, grant any
concession or incur any Liability to obtain any Third Party Consents or to
effect the transfers, replacements or notifications contemplated by this
_Section 5.05_, and the failure to receive any such Third Party Consents or
to effect any such transfers, replacements or notifications shall not be taken
into account with respect to whether any condition to the Closing set forth
in _Article 8_ shall have been satisfied.

Section 5.06. _Environmental Transfer Statutes_ _._ The parties agree and
acknowledge that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are subject
to and trigger the requirements of the Connecticut Transfer Act, Conn. Gen.
Stat. §§ 22a-134 _et_   _seq_ _._ , (the " _Transfer Act_ "; for purposes of
this _Section 5.06_, terms in quotations herein are defined by the Transfer
Act). Purchaser agrees, as of the Closing, to complete or caused to be
completed the following actions related to the facilities (the " _CT
Facilities_ ") listed on _Section 5.06 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_
(the " _Connecticut Facilities Actions_ "): all Form III "certifying party"
Transfer Act obligations associated with each relevant "transfer of
establishment," including payment of filing fees, occurring as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereunder, and all other actions required
to investigate, monitor, "remediate," and otherwise achieve compliance with
the "remediation standards," for all the CT Facilities, under the Transfer Act
regardless of the type of Transfer Act form filed in connection with
each such facility. As of the Closing, the Sellers agree to complete or
caused to be completed the following actions related to the CT Facilities
listed on _Section 5.06 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_: the Form II
"certifying party" Transfer Act obligations associated with the relevant
"transfer of establishment," including payment of associated filing fees,
occurring as the result of the transactions contemplated hereunder. Parent
shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser in connection with Purchasers
Connecticut Facilities Actions by preparing and delivering each "Form III,"
"Form II" and the associated "Environmental Condition Assessment Forms,"
drafted by a "licensed environmental professional," and by providing
assistance to Purchaser as Purchaser may reasonably request, to the extent
such requested cooperation and assistance imposes no out-of-pocket expense not
promptly reimbursed by Purchaser and no excessive time commitments on Parent
or its representatives. The provisions of this _Section 5.06_ shall survive
the Closing.

 

Section 5.07. _Public Announcements_. No party to this Agreement nor any
Affiliate or representative of such party shall issue or cause the
publication of any press release or public announcement in respect of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (i) as

 



67  may be required by Law or stock exchange rules, in which case the party
required to publish such press release or public announcement shall use
reasonable efforts to provide the other party a reasonable opportunity to
comment on such press release or public announcement in advance of such
publication, and (ii) as are consistent (as to nature and scope) with any
press release or public statement previously issued pursuant to this 
_Section 5.07_ for which the prior written consent of the other party has
previously been granted. The parties hereto agree that the initial press
release to be issued with respect to the Sale following execution of this
Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by Parent and Purchaser.

Section 5.08. _Intercompany Accounts_. At or prior to the Closing, (a) all
intercompany accounts, except for those accounts listed on _Section 5.08 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule_, between Parent, any Seller and/or any of
their respective Subsidiaries (other than any Transferred Entity), on the one
hand, and any Transferred Entities, on the other hand, shall be settled or
otherwise eliminated and (b) any or all Cash (including Trapped Cash) of the
Transferred Entities may be extracted by the Parent Group, in the case of each
of clause (a) and clause (b), in such a manner as the Sellers shall determine
in their sole discretion and, with respect to clause (a), as of and following
the Closing, no party shall have any further Liability with respect to such
intercompany accounts;  _provided_ , that no such intercompany account shall
be settled or otherwise eliminated, or Cash extracted, in any particular
manner if doing so in such manner would create or give rise to any Liability
(other than a Liability for Taxes) to a Transferred Entity or the Business as
of or following the Closing (unless such Liability (i) is owed solely by one
Transferred Entity to another Transferred Entity or (ii) is fully reflected as
a payable in Working Capital on the Final Working Capital and Indebtedness
Statement and, following the timely payment of such payable, no Transferred
Entity or the Business will have any further Liability with respect to such
Liability). For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to clause (a) of this
_Section 5.08_, intercompany accounts between and among any of the
Transferred Entities shall not be affected by this provision.

 

Section 5.09. _Termination of Indebtedness_. As of or prior to the Closing,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Transferred Entities to (a) fully discharge
the Indebtedness listed on _Section 5.09 of the Seller Disclosure_ (the "
_Specified Indebtedness_ ") (including all outstanding principal, interest and
fees owing thereon) and to obtain the release of all Liens in favor of the
holders of the Specified Indebtedness and (b) use reasonable best efforts to
deliver to Purchaser payoff letters evidencing the discharge of such
Indebtedness and release of such Liens, as applicable.

 

Section 5.10. _Termination of Intercompany Arrangements_. Effective at the
Closing, other than any intercompany accounts governed by Section _5.08_ ,
all arrangements, understandings or Contracts, including all obligations to
provide goods, services or other benefits, by any member of the Parent Group,
on the one hand, and any Transferred Entity on the other hand, shall
be terminated without any party having any continuing obligations or
Liabilities to the other (and in a manner that does not result in any
Liability (other than a Liability for Taxes) to a Transferred Entity or the
Business as of or following the Closing, unless such Liability, (i) is owed
solely by one Transferred Entity to another Transferred Entity or (ii) is
fully reflected as a payable in Working

 



68  Capital on the Final Working Capital and Indebtedness Statement and,
following the timely payment of such payable, no Transferred Entity or the
Business will have any further Liability with respect to such Liability),
except for (a) this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and (b) the other
Contracts listed in _Section 5.10 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_.

 

Section 5.11. _Guarantees; Commitments_. (a) From and after the Closing,
Purchaser and the Transferred Entities, jointly and severally, shall forever
indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers and any of their respective Affiliates
against any Liabilities that the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates
suffer, incur or are liable for by reason of or arising out of or in
consequence of (i) the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates issuing,
making payment under, being required to pay or reimburse the issuer of, or
being a party to, any guarantee, indemnity, surety bond, letter of credit,
letter of comfort or other similar obligation to the extent relating to the
Business listed on _Section 5.11(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ (which
list may be supplemented by Parent and the Sellers after the date hereof and
at least three (3) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date to
include any such guarantee, indemnity, surety bond, letter of credit, letter
of comfort or other similar obligation to the extent relating to the Business
entered into in the ordinary course of business) (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Guarantees_ "), (ii) any claim or demand for payment made on the
Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to any of the
Indemnified Guarantees or (iii) any Action by any Person who is or claims to
be entitled to the benefit of or claims to be entitled to payment,
reimbursement or indemnity with respect to any Indemnified Guarantees.

 

(b) Without limiting _Section 5.11(a)_ in any respect, Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause itself or the Transferred Entities to be
substituted in all respects for the Sellers and any of their respective
Affiliates and for the Sellers and their respective Affiliates to be released,
effective as of the Closing, in respect of all obligations of the Sellers and
any of their respective Affiliates under each of the guarantees, indemnities,
letters of credit, letters of comfort, commitments, understandings, agreements
and other obligations of such Persons related to the Business listed in
_Section 5.11(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ (which list may be
supplemented by Parent and the Sellers after the date hereof and at least
three (3) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date to include any
such guarantee, indemnity, surety bond, letter of credit, letter of comfort
or other similar obligation to the extent relating to the Business entered
into in the ordinary course of business) (collectively, the " _Substituted
Guarantees_ "), and the Sellers shall reasonably cooperate in Purchasers
efforts. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, at Parents or
a Sellers request, Purchaser shall, and shall after the Closing cause the
Transferred Entities to use their respective reasonable best efforts to
assign or cause to be assigned, any lease underlying a Substituted Guarantee
to a Subsidiary of Purchaser meeting the applicable net worth and other
requirements in such lease to give effect to the provisions of the preceding
sentence. For any items listed in _Section 5.11(b) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule_ for which Purchaser or any Transferred Entity, as applicable, is not
substituted in all respects for the Sellers and their respective Affiliates
(or for which the Sellers and their respective Affiliates (other than the
Transferred Entities) are not released), effective as of the Closing,
Purchaser shall continue to use its reasonable best efforts, and shall 

 



69  cause the Transferred Entities to use their reasonable best efforts, to
effect such substitution and release after the Closing, and Parent and the
Sellers shall continue to reasonably cooperate in Purchasers efforts;
_provided_ , that, none of the Sellers or any of their respective Subsidiaries
shall have any obligation to make payments or incur any costs or expenses,
grant any concession or incur any other Liability in connection with such
cooperation pursuant to this Section _5.11_ except to the extent Purchaser
agrees to promptly reimburse Sellers or any of their respective Subsidiaries
or agrees to fully indemnify Parent and its Affiliates for any
such Liabilities to Parents satisfaction. Without limiting the foregoing,
neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries shall extend or renew any
Contract containing or underlying a Substituted Guarantee unless, prior to or
concurrently with such extension or renewal, the Transferred Entities are
substituted in all respects for the Sellers and any of their respective
Affiliates, and the Sellers and their respective Affiliates are released, in
respect of all obligations of the Sellers and any of their respective
Affiliates under such Substituted Guarantee. In no event shall Parent,
Purchaser, the Transferred Entities or any of their respective Affiliates be
obligated to pay any money to any person to effect the substitutions described
in this _Section 5.11(b)_, other than _de minimis_ amounts.

Section 5.12. _Insurance_. The parties agree to the provisions regarding
insurance set forth on _Section 5.12 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_.

Section 5.13. _Litigation Support_. (a) In the event and for so long as any
party is prosecuting, contesting or defending any legal proceeding, Action,
investigation, charge, claim, or demand, in each case by, with or against a
third party (including any Governmental Entity) in connection with (i) any
transactions contemplated under this Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation,
circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event,
incident, action, failure to act, or transaction relating to, in connection
with or arising from the Business or the Transferred Entities (including the
Specified Matter), at the reasonable written request of such party, each other
party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates (and its and
their officers and employees) to, reasonably cooperate with such party and its
counsel in such prosecution, contest or defense, including making available
its personnel, participating in meetings, and providing such testimony and
access to its non-privileged books and records as shall be reasonably
necessary in connection with such prosecution, contest or defense, at the sole
cost and expense of the prosecuting, contesting or defending party.

 

(b) The cooperation and information sharing obligations of a party under this
_Section 5.13_ shall be limited to the extent any such cooperation or
disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such party or
contravene any Laws or obligation of confidentiality to a third party;
_provided_ , that the parties shall endeavor in good faith to make
appropriate substitute arrangements, if practicable and without cost or
Liability to either party, in a manner that does not give rise to any of the
foregoing circumstances.

 

Section 5.14. _Payments_. (a) The Sellers shall promptly pay or deliver to
Purchaser any monies or checks that have been sent to a member of the Parent
Group after the Closing Date to the extent they are due to the Business,
including by customers,

 



70  suppliers or other contracting parties of the Transferred Entities or the
Business for goods or services provided by the Business and otherwise
consistent with the terms of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

(b) Following the Closing, Parent and the Sellers agree that Purchaser shall
have the right and authority to endorse, without recourse, any check or other
evidence of indebtedness received by Purchaser in respect of any receivable of
the Business to the extent they are due to the Business, including by
customers, suppliers or other contracting parties of the Transferred Entities
or the Business for goods or services provided by the Business and otherwise
consistent with the terms of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and
Parent and the Sellers shall furnish Purchaser such evidence of
this authority as Purchaser may reasonably request.

(c) Purchaser shall promptly pay or deliver to Parent any monies or checks
that have been sent after the Closing Date to any Transferred Entities to the
extent they are due to the business(es) of the Parent Group (other than the
Business), including by customers, suppliers or other contracting parties of
the Parent Group or such business(es) for goods or services provided by such
business(es) and otherwise consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

 

Section 5.15. _Use of Marks_. (a) Except as expressly provided in this Section
5.15, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall use, or have the
right to use, any of the following marks of Parent or any member of the Parent
Group: the "United Technologies," "UTC," "UTX names," or the UTC gear icon
logo, or any variations or derivatives thereof or any names, trademarks,
service marks or logos that are confusingly similar thereto (the " _UTC Names_
"). Purchaser promptly (but in any case within fifteen (15) Business Days of
Closing) shall cause each of the Transferred Entities having a corporate name
that includes the UTC Names to apply to change its corporate name to a name
that does not include any UTC Name, including making within fifteen (15)
Business Days of Closing any legal filings necessary to effect such change.

(b) The Transferred Entities may, and Parent and its Affiliates, as
applicable, hereby grant to the Transferred Entities a limited, non-
exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable right to, continue temporarily
to use the UTC Names following the Closing strictly in accordance with this
_Section 5.15(b)_; _provided_ that Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Transferred Entities) (i) not to
hold itself out as having any affiliation with Parent or any member of the
Parent Group (except to the extent such affiliation is implied by the use of
the UTC Names as contemplated herein), and (ii) to use commercially reasonable
efforts to minimize and eliminate use of the UTC Names. In any event, as soon
as practicable after the Closing Date (and in any event within one hundred
and twenty (120) days thereafter) Purchaser shall and shall cause each of its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Transferred Entities) to (i)
cease and discontinue use of all UTC Names and (ii) complete the removal of
the UTC Names from all products, signage, vehicles, properties, technical
information, stationery and promotional or other marketing materials and other
assets of the Transferred Entities to the extent such removal is reasonably
practicable under the circumstances.

 



71 (c) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed
as restricting or limiting Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing, the Transferred Entities) from using or referencing the UTC
Names in a manner that would constitute "fair use" under applicable Law if
such use were made by any other Person.

Section 5.16. _Non-Solicitation; Non-Compete_. (a) For a period of eighteen
(18) months from the Closing Date, none of (x) Parent or its Subsidiaries
(including through any of their respective officers, directors or employees),
on the one hand, or (y) Purchaser (acting through its corporate head office
function) or its Mission Systems Subsidiaries and business units (including
the Transferred Entities) (including through any of their respective officers,
directors or employees), on the other hand, shall, without the prior consent
of the other party (it being understood that for purposes of this _Section
5.16_, such prior written consent may be communicated directly between the
Senior Vice President of Human Resources and Organization of Parent and the
Senior Vice President of Human Resources of Purchaser, who shall act in good
faith, and reasonably, in considering and responding to requests from the
other under this _Section 5.16_) directly or indirectly, solicit for
employment or hire (whether as an employee, consultant or otherwise)
any Restricted Employee of the other party (or its Subsidiaries); _provided_
, that neither party nor its Subsidiaries shall be precluded from soliciting
or hiring, or taking any other action with respect to any such Restricted
Employee of the other party (or its Subsidiaries) (i) whose employment with
such other party or its Affiliates (including, in the case of Purchaser, a
Transferred Entity) was (A) terminated other than for cause by such other
party or such other partys Affiliate, or, in the case of any Restricted
Employee who is a Business Employee, terminated in a Qualifying Termination,
in each case, prior to commencement of employment discussions between such
restricted soliciting party or its Subsidiaries (or any of their officers,
directors or employees) and such Person, or (B) terminated voluntarily by the
resignation of such Person (other than, in the case of a Restricted Employee
who is a Business Employee, a Qualifying Termination), more than six (6)
months prior to the commencement of employment discussions between such
restricted soliciting party or its Subsidiaries (or any of their officers,
directors or employees) and such Person, or (ii) who responds to general or
public solicitation not targeted at employees of such other party or any of
its Affiliates, including (in the case of Purchaser) the Transferred Entities,
including by a bona fide search firm. " _Restricted Employee_ " shall
mean, (1) with respect to the restrictions on Purchaser (acting through its
corporate head office function) and its Mission Systems Subsidiaries and
business units (including the Transferred Entities), an employee of the PandW,
UTAS or UTRC divisions of Parent or the corporate office of Parent who is
classified by Parent or its Subsidiaries as level 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 as of the

restrictions on Parent and its Subsidiaries, a Business Employee who is
classified by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entities)

Party shall not, other than in connection with any services to be provided by
or on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any of the
Ancillary Agreements (but only for so long as such services are being provided

member, partner or otherwise, own, manage, operate or engage in a Competitive
Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) a Restricted Party may acquire a

Competitive Business represents less than 12.5% of the revenues for the most
recently completed fiscal year of the aggregate company or business acquired
or (B) to the extent the Competitive Business represents more than 12.5% of
the revenues for the most recently completed fiscal year of the aggregate
company or business acquired, that Restricted Party shall (1) enter into a
binding agreement to, and shall, divest to an unaffiliated third party the
portion of the business or assets acquired in such acquisition which conducts
the Competitive Business as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event
not later than one (1) year, following the closing of the acquisition of such
Person or business ( _provided_ , _however_ , that such one (1)-year period

anniversary following the closing of the acquisition of such Person or
business) or, at such Restricted Partys election in its sole discretion, in
lieu of complying with the immediately preceding clause (1), (2) cause the

or within the twelve (12) months prior to the date hereof, including
designing, manufacturing, marketing, selling, distributing, servicing and
supporting aerospace systems, aerospace components, ISR and Space solutions

substantially similar business lines (collectively, the " _Restricted Party
Businesses_ "); _provided_ , that (x) with respect to any Restricted Party
Business that is also a Primary Business Service, the Restricted Parties shall
be permitted to engage in such Restricted Party Business only to the extent
the Restricted Parties engage in such Primary Business Service (1) for
products for which the Restricted Parties are or become the design holder and

month period prior to the date hereof, and (y) with respect to any Restricted
Party Business that is also a Secondary Business Service, the Restricted
Parties shall be permitted to engage in such

 



74  Restricted Party Business only to the extent the Restricted Parties engage

Parties are or become the original equipment manufacturer or to the extent
the Restricted Parties are engaged in such Restricted Party Business as of the
date of this Agreement or within the twelve (12) month period prior to the
date hereof (without any limitation on the Restricted Parties expanding in
such Restricted Party Business or a substantially similar business (including
to become an original equipment manufacturer in respect thereof)).

 

(e) The foregoing shall not supersede or modify any existing applicable
restrictions or limitations contained in Contracts binding upon
any Restricted Party, including in respect of the utilization of any
intellectual property (including know-how) that it has gained license or
access to by virtue of a Contract with a Transferred Entity. The parties
acknowledge that the restrictions contained in this _Section 5.16_ are
reasonable in scope and duration in light of the nature, size and location of
the Business. The parties further acknowledge that the restrictions contained
in this _Section 5.16_ are necessary to protect Purchasers significant
investment in the Business, including its goodwill. It is the desire and
intent of the parties that the provisions of this _Section 5.16_ be enforced
to the fullest extent permissible under applicable Law. If all or part of
this _Section 5.16_ is held invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced
by any Law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. If any part of this
_Section 5.16_ is held to be excessively broad as to duration, scope,
activity or subject, such part will be construed by limiting and reducing it
so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent permissible under applicable
Law or public policy.

Section 5.17. _Financing_. (a) Prior to the Closing, the Sellers (other than
the Tata JV Seller) shall, and shall cause the Transferred Entities to, and
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their advisors and
representatives (including auditors) to, provide all cooperation that is
necessary, customary or advisable and reasonably requested by Purchaser to
assist Purchaser in the arrangement of debt financing in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that nothing herein
shall require such cooperation to the extent it would (i) unreasonably
disrupt the conduct of the business or operations of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to agree to pay
any commitment or other fees, reimburse any expenses, provide any security,
provide any agreements, opinions, authorization letters, certificates or other
instruments, or otherwise incur any liability or give any indemnities or (iii)
require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action that
would reasonably be expected to conflict with, or result in any violation or
breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, any organizational document of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, any
applicable Laws or any Contract. Purchaser shall promptly, upon request by
Parent, reimburse Parent for all reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Transferred Entities, whose costs and expenses in connection
with any such debt financing shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, be the sole responsibility of Purchaser) or their respective
representatives in connection with any such debt financing, including the
cooperation contemplated by this _Section 5.17_, and shall indemnify and hold
harmless Parent, its Subsidiaries and their respective representatives from
and against any and all Liabilities suffered or incurred by any of them
in connection

 



75  with the arrangement of any such debt financing and any information used in
connection therewith, except with respect to any fraud or intentional
misrepresentation or willful misconduct by any such Persons.

(b) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding either
party obtained by the other party or its advisors or other representatives

Purchasers sole expense, in obtaining all amendments to or transfers of all
Export Control Authorizations for which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is
the applicant that are necessary for the lawful operation of the Business
after the Closing; _provided_ that Purchaser shall be responsible for
obtaining the new Export Control Authorizations (or amendments to or transfers
of any and all such Export Control Authorizations, as applicable). The Sellers
shall permit the Purchaser or the Transferred Entities, as applicable, to
utilize the applicable Export Control Authorizations applied for and held by
the Transferred Entities under the Parent Groups DDTC registration codes,
subject to any approvals of Governmental Entities necessary to allow such
utilization (and Sellers shall cooperate with Purchaser and use their
reasonable best efforts to assist Purchaser in obtaining any approvals of
Governmental Entities necessary to allow such utilization), from and after
the Closing until Purchaser has obtained new, amendments to or transfers of,
as applicable, all Export Control Authorizations that are necessary for the
lawful operation of the Business after the Closing. Purchaser and the
Transferred Entities shall assume all responsibility for utilizing such Export
Control Authorizations to the extent permitted by Governmental Entities from
and after the Closing, and fully indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its
Affiliates from and against any and all Liabilities and Losses arising out of
or relating to any such utilization. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to make
payments or incur any Liability to obtain any consent, approval, amendment or
transfer contemplated by this _Section 5.18_, and the failure to receive or
effect any such consent, approval, amendment or transfer shall not be taken
into account with respect to whether any condition to the Closing set forth
in _Article 8_ shall have been satisfied.

Section 5.19. _Directorate of Defense Trade Controls Notification_. Parent
shall notify the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls of Parents intent to
sell the Business not less than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing. The
Sellers and Purchaser shall submit the necessary "Material Change
Notification" to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls within five (5)
days of the Closing as required pursuant to International Traffic in Arms
Regulations § 122.4(a). Purchaser shall submit the necessary request to the
Directorate of Defense Trade Controls to amend Export Control Authorizations
as soon as practicable, but in any event no later than sixty (60) days after
receiving the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls acknowledgement of its
"Material Change Notification."

 



76 Section 5.20. _Consent Agreement_. The parties acknowledge that Parent is
currently party to that certain Consent Agreement and Order, dated June 28,
2012, between Parent and the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, Bureau of
Political-Military Affairs, U.S. Department of State (the " _State Department
Consent Agreement_ "). Parent and the Transferred Entities shall use their
reasonable best efforts prior to Closing to continue to perform all work
necessary to fully implement and complete all requirements of the State
Department Consent Agreement, to the extent applicable to the Business.
Purchaser hereby agrees and acknowledges that from and after the Closing,
Purchaser will be bound by the terms and conditions of the State Department
Consent Agreement applicable to the Business or the Transferred Entities,
unless the Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance, approves an
exception to this requirement. Parent shall notify the Directorate of Defense
Trade Controls, Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance as promptly as
practicable, but in any event no later than thirty (30) days after the date of
this Agreement of the proposed Sale. Thereafter, as may be reasonably
requested from time-to-time by Purchaser, Parent and the Sellers shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cooperate with and assist Purchaser (which
assistance shall include timely providing information in the possession of
Parent or any of its Affiliates, responding in good faith to any request for
information from the State Department and attending joint meetings with the
State Department to the extent reasonably requested by Purchaser) in
connection with the pursuit by the Purchaser of an exception to application of
the State Department Consent Agreement to the Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entities) after the Closing;
_provided_ , that Parent shall not be required to advocate for such exception
or otherwise on behalf of Purchaser. Such support described in the immediately
foregoing sentence may extend to Purchasers pursuit, in the alternative, of
other or additional efforts to limit the scope of the State Department Consent
Agreement, including limiting the application of the State Department Consent
Agreement solely to the Transferred Entities and substituting comparable
processes of the Purchaser for those developed to satisfy the terms and
conditions of the State Department Consent Agreement. Parent acknowledges and
agrees that (a) from and after the Closing, the payment of the fifth and
final $7,000,000 penalty installment payment pursuant to paragraph 20 of the
State Department Consent Agreement shall be the sole responsibility of Parent,
(b) Parent shall be directly responsible to pay any fees and expenses of any
SCO (as defined in the State Department Consent Agreement) appointed pursuant
to the terms and conditions of the State Department Consent Agreement and (c)
Parent shall be responsible for any fines or penalties actually incurred by
Purchaser or its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entities) under the
State Department Consent Agreement to the extent levied in response to a
voluntary disclosure of the Business under the State Department
Consent Agreement that remains outstanding as of the Closing (and does not
relate to any activities taken by the Business or Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entities) from and after the Closing).

 

Section 5.21. _Pre-Closing Restructuring_. Prior to the Closing, Parent will
cause the Transferred Companies and the Transferred Companies Subsidiaries
to complete the transactions described on _Section 5.21 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule_ (the " _Pre-Closing Restructuring_ ").

 



77 Section 5.22. _Connecticut Reinvestment Act_. From and after the Closing, and
for as long as the Business is subject to the Reinvestment Contract by and
between the State of Connecticut and Parent, effective as of June 30, 2014
(the " _CARA Agreement_ "), Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, maintain the Businesss Headquarters Function (as defined in the CARA
Agreement) in the State of Connecticut. Purchaser shall (without limiting the
generality of _Article 10_ ) indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its
Affiliates for and from any all Liabilities arising under the CARA Agreement
from or related to the Purchasers or its Affiliates removal, relocation or
reduction of the Businesss Headquarters Function during the SAC Clawback
Period, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any payment by Parent of any
Clawback Amount pursuant to Section 4.1(e) of the CARA Agreement or the SAC
Penalty Clawback Amount (in each case as such terms are defined in the CARA
Agreement). Neither Parent nor its Affiliates shall amend or modify the CARA
Agreement in a manner that modifies the SAC Clawback Period (as defined in the
CARA Agreement) or the scope of Purchasers potential Liability under this
_Section 5.22_ from the scope of Purchasers potential Liability applicable
to Purchaser under the CARA Agreement as of the date hereof.

Section 5.23. _Mutual Release_. (a) Effective as of the Closing and except as
otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement (including _Section 5.23(b)_)
or in any of the Ancillary Agreements, each of the Sellers, on behalf of
itself and each of its respective Subsidiaries and each of their respective
successors and assigns, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on behalf of itself

their respective successors and assigns, on the other hand, hereby

and the Sellers (in the case of the Purchaser) and each of their respective
Subsidiaries, and each of their respective heirs, executors, administrators,

from all debts, demands, actions, causes of action, suits,
accounts, covenants, contracts, agreements, damages, claims and other
Liabilities whatsoever of every name and nature, both in law and in equity,
arising out of or related to events, circumstances or actions taken by such
other party occurring or failing to occur, in each case, at or prior to the
Closing. Neither party hereto shall make, and each party hereto shall not
permit any of its Subsidiaries or their respective representatives to make,
any claim or demand, or commence any Action asserting any claim or demand,
including any claim of contribution or any indemnification, against any of the
other partys Affiliates or any of the other partys Releasees with respect to
any Liabilities released pursuant to this  _Section 5.23_.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, _Section 5.23(a) _shall not constitute a
release from, waiver of, or otherwise applies to the terms of this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement or any Liability or Contract expressly contemplated
by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to be in effect after the
Closing, or any enforcement thereof;  _provided_ that for the avoidance of
doubt, with respect to any Ancillary Agreement that constitutes an amendment
to an existing Contract, the release set forth in _Section 5.23(a)_ shall
apply to the terms of such existing Contract and any enforcement thereof for
all periods prior to the Closing (i.e., before such amendment goes into
effect), unless otherwise contemplated by such Ancillary Agreement. Without

 



78  limiting the generality of the foregoing, nothing contained in _Section
5.23(a)_ shall waive, release or otherwise discharge any Person from any
Liability (i) retained, assumed, transferred, assigned or allocated to the
Sellers, on the one hand, or Purchaser or the Transferred Entities, on the
other hand, in accordance with this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or

best efforts to (at Purchasers sole expense, including with respect to the
preparation thereof whether or not the Closing occurs before or after March

that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (or such other nationally recognized "Big 4"
accounting firm) issue a consent to enable Purchaser to include such audited
financial statements with any Form 8-K required to be filed by Purchaser with
the SEC to report the Sale.

 

(b) If requested by Purchaser within ten (10) calendar days following the end
of the applicable calendar quarter, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts

subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments and the absence of

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Parents
performance under this _Section 5.24_ shall not be taken into account with
respect to whether (i) any condition to Closing set forth in _Article 8_ shall
have been satisfied, or (ii) any breach or default under any of Sellers
covenants or obligations has occurred for purposes of _Section 9.01_ or
_Article 10_ , and shall not otherwise delay the Closing hereunder.

 



79 Section 5.25. _Ancillary Agreements_. (a) Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, after the date of this Agreement, Parent and Purchaser shall
cooperate to as promptly as practicable and in good faith finalize in
definitive form any Shared Location Lease in accordance with the terms hereof,

delivered by the applicable parties at the Closing. Each Shared Location Lease
shall contain the terms set forth on _Section 5.05(b) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule_ and such other terms as mutually agreed by the parties and as are
customary (and not inconsistent with the terms set forth on _Section 5.05(b)
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ ) for leases of the nature of the
applicable Shared Location Lease.

 

(b) With respect to each other Ancillary Agreement, the applicable parties
shall execute and deliver such agreement at the Closing in accordance with
the terms hereof, with only such ministerial additions, deletions and
modifications as necessary to complete the missing terms contemplated by the
form to be completed by the parties or to correct any scriveners errors (

clarifications around the Transition Services Agreement (including, where
applicable, determining the actual Service Fee that will be charged for a
particular Service (as each such term is defined in the Transition Services
Agreement) in accordance with Section 2.1 thereof), if and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party; _provided_ , _further_ , that not
agreeing to any such further clarifications shall not be deemed a breach
hereof or in any way impact the closing conditions set forth in _Article 8_ or
otherwise delay the Closing hereunder), unless further changes are mutually
agreed by the applicable parties. This  _Section 5.25(b)_ shall not apply to
any Foreign Acquisition Agreements, which are governed by _Section 2.08_.

(c) If the applicable parties are unable to reach agreement on any material
term or condition of the any Shared Location Lease (to the extent not already
set forth in _Section 5.05(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ ) such that a
definitive agreement is not executed and delivered at the time of Closing,
the Closing shall not be delayed but instead the applicable term sheet shall
become a binding obligation and shall remain in effect until a definitive
agreement replacing such term sheet has been mutually negotiated and executed
by all parties thereto.

Section 5.26. _Designated Customer Matter_. From and after the date hereof
(and until the Closing), Parent shall cause the Business to use its
commercially reasonable efforts, acting in good faith, to resolve in a
commercially reasonable manner as promptly as reasonably practicable (taking
into account and in the context of Purchasers rights in the penultimate
sentence of this _Section 5.26_) the delays, if any, and any related disputes
with the applicable customer in connection with the matter described under
_Section 3.15 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ under the heading
"Designated Customer Matter". Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent shall, or shall cause the Business to, keep Purchaser
reasonably informed, to the extent practicable, on a reasonably current
basis, of any material developments arising in connection with the Designated
Customer Matter (including by providing copies of any material correspondence
made or received by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred
Entities) in connection with the Designated Customer Matter), and otherwise
consult with Purchaser in good faith (including in person to the extent
reasonably requested by Purchaser (with appropriate

 



80  prior notice)) on a reasonably current basis with respect to the Designated
Customer Matter and the resolution thereof. In connection with such
discussions and consultation, Parent shall consider in good faith Purchasers
reasonable comments and suggestions with respect to the Designated Customer
Matter and the resolution thereof, including any good faith offers of
assistance by Purchaser in connection therewith; _provided_ , that (i)
subject to clause (ii), until the Closing, Parent shall retain control over
the Designated Customer Matter and the resolution thereof, if any, and (ii)
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred
Entities) shall agree or commit to any concessions ( _e.g_. increasing in a
material respect the obligations on the Business or decreasing in a material
respect the benefits to the Business) to the applicable customer involved in
the Designated Customer Matter that would reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, material and adverse to the Business (in the
context of the overall relationship with the applicable customer involved in
the Designated Customer Matter) without the prior written consent of
Purchaser (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). The cooperation and information sharing obligations of a party under
this _Section 5.26_ shall be limited to the extent any such cooperation or
disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such party or
contravene any Laws or obligation of confidentiality to a third party;
_provided_ , that the parties shall endeavor in good faith to make
appropriate substitute arrangements, if practicable and without cost or
Liability to either party, in a manner that does not give rise to any of the
foregoing circumstances.

 

Section 5.27. _Notices of Certain Events_. Each of Parent and Purchaser shall
promptly notify the other of: any event or circumstances that have resulted,
or would reasonably be expected to result, in the conditions set forth in
_Section 8.02_ not being met, in the case of Parent, or in the conditions set
forth in _Section 8.03_ not being met, in the case of Purchaser; _provided_
, _however_ , that the failure to deliver any notice pursuant to this _Section
5.27_ shall not (a) be taken into account with respect to whether any
condition to the Closing set forth in  _Article 8_ shall have been satisfied,
or (b) be deemed a breach or default for purposes of the parties termination
rights pursuant to _Section 9.01_ or the parties indemnification obligations
pursuant to _Article 10_ and shall not otherwise delay the Closing hereunder.

Section 5.28. _Subsequently-Identified Negotiated Agreements in
the Intellectual Property Agreement_. During the period beginning on the date
of this Agreement and ending on the later of (a) the date that is nine (9)
months from the date of this Agreement and (b) the Closing Date, if Parent
or Purchaser (as the " _Notifying Party_ ") provides written notice to the
other party (the " _Notified Party_ ") that the Notifying Party, has
identified an agreement governing Intellectual Property as between any
Transferred Entity, on the one hand, and Parent or any member of the Parent
Group, on the other, entered into on arms length terms between a member of
the Parent Group, on the one hand, and a Transferred Entity, on the other (and
such written notice includes a copy of such agreement and an explanation of
the basis on which the Notifying Party came to such determination) (a "
_Negotiated Agreement Request_ "), the Notified Party shall consider the
Negotiated Agreement Request in good faith and, within sixty (60) days of
receipt of the Negotiated Agreement Request, approve or deny the Negotiated
Agreement Request. If the Notified Party approves the Negotiated Agreement
Request, or does not

 



81  dispute the Negotiated Agreement Request within sixty (60) days, the
agreement included as part of the Negotiated Agreement Request shall be
treated as a Negotiated Agreement (as defined in the Intellectual Property
Agreement) for all purposes under the Intellectual Property Agreement, at such
time as the Intellectual Property Agreement takes effect. If the Notified
Party denies the Negotiated Agreement Request, the Notifying Party
may challenge that determination under the dispute resolution provisions in
Article IX of the Intellectual Property Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
once effective, the terms of the Intellectual Property Agreement will control
over the terms of any agreement the Notifying Party identifies and provides
notice to the Notified Party of pursuant to this _Section 5.28_, unless (i)
the Notified Party approves the applicable Negotiated Agreement Request or
does not dispute the applicable Negotiated Agreement Request with sixty (60)
days of receipt of the Negotiated Agreement Request or (ii) the agreement
included as part of the Negotiated Agreement Request is determined to have
been entered into on arms length terms in accordance with the dispute
resolution provisions in Article IX of the Intellectual Property Agreement.

 

Section 5.29. _Treatment of Specified Actions_. (a) Subject to _Section
5.29(c)_, from and after the date hereof and prior to the Closing, Parent
shall control and defend the Specified Matter and any Actions arising
therefrom or from the same, similar or overlapping facts and circumstances
(the " _Specified Actions_ ", it being understood that Specified Actions does
not include the Specified Demand, which is governed by _Section
10.03(b)(iv)_), in each case subject to the provisions of this _Section
5.29_. In connection therewith, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to keep counsel for Purchaser informed, on a reasonably current basis, of any
material developments arising in connection with the Specified Actions
(including by providing copies of any material correspondence or filings made
or received by Parent or its Subsidiaries and any material rulings, orders,
or awards issued by any Governmental Entity in connection with the Specified
Actions); _provided_ , that the determination of whether or not to enter into
a settlement of the Specified Actions prior to Closing shall be in Parents
sole discretion; _provided_ _further_ , that in no event shall Parent propose
to enter into or enter into any settlement of any Specified Action that
imposes or would impose any injunctive or other equitable relief or finding
or admission of any violation of Law or admission of any wrongdoing by any
Transferred Entity, the Business or any Business Employee without the prior
written consent of Purchaser (in its sole discretion). If Parent enters into
any settlement agreement with respect to the Specified Actions, Parent shall
provide to counsel for Purchaser a copy of any applicable settlement agreement
as promptly as practicable following its execution.

 

(b) Subject to _Section 5.29(c)_, from and after the Closing, to the extent
not settled prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall control and defend the
Specified Actions. Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
reasonably cooperate with Purchaser in connection with Purchasers defense
and/or settlement of any Specified Actions pursuant to  _Section 5.13_.

(c) Any amount paid or payable in a settlement entered into by Parent prior to
the Closing (whether paid or payable by any member of the Parent Group or any
Transferred Entity), including in respect of any fines, penalties, damages,
judgments or

 



82  awards (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not expenses, including attorneys
fees, which shall be borne by the party incurring such expenses, including
attorneys fees) shall be referred to herein as " _Specified Amounts_ ".
Parent and Purchaser agree that responsibility for payment of all Specified
Amounts shall be as follows (and to the extent that Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entities) has paid or is responsible
for the payment of any portion of the Specified Amounts, Parent and Purchaser
shall cause any applicable reimbursements or payments to be made between them
(or their applicable Subsidiaries)). In the event the Specified Actions are
settled prior to Closing, (i) Purchaser shall be solely responsible for the
first $16,000,000 of the Specified Amounts and (ii) Purchaser and Parent shall
each be responsible for one-half of the remainder of the Specified Amounts
above $16,000,000. In the event the Specified Actions are not settled prior to
Closing, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall not be responsible for any amounts
payable in respect of a settlement entered into by Purchaser, or otherwise,
in respect of the Specified Actions from and after the Closing.

 __Section 6.01. ___Treatment of Business Employees_. (a) Subject to
applicable Law, effective as of immediately prior to the Closing, Parent
shall (or shall cause its applicable Affiliates, including any Sellers (other
than the Tata JV Seller), to), in good faith and in consultation with
Purchaser, transfer the employment of each (i) employee primarily engaged in
rendering services in respect of the Business (other than any LTD Employee)
who is employed by a member of the Parent Group from such member to a
Transferred Entity and (ii) employee who is not primarily engaged in rendering
services in respect of the Business and who is employed by a Transferred
Entity from such Transferred Entity to a member of the Parent Group designated
by Parent; _provided_ , that to the extent that Parent determines in good
faith and in consultation with Purchaser that the employment of an employee
described in clause (i) cannot be transferred to a Transferred Entity prior to
the Closing because of restrictions imposed by applicable Law, (A) Purchaser
or one of its Subsidiaries shall make an offer of employment to such employee
on terms consistent with those applicable to Business Employees generally
under this _Article 6_ (or, if no such employing entity exists or there are
legal constraints to Purchaser making an offer of employment to such
employee, arrange for an offer of employment to be made by a third party as a
service provider to Purchaser or its applicable Subsidiary), (B) Parent and
Purchaser shall otherwise cooperate to cause such employee to become employed
by Purchaser or its applicable Subsidiary at, or as soon as reasonably
practicable following, the Closing (or, if no such employing entity exists or
there are legal constraints on Purchaser from employing such employee, arrange
for employment with a third party as a service provider to Purchaser or its
applicable Subsidiary) and (C) from and after such employees commencement of
employment with Purchaser or its applicable Subsidiary (or with a third party
as a service provider to Purchaser or its applicable Subsidiary), such
employee shall be considered a "Business Employee" for all purposes under this
Agreement. Parent and Purchaser shall (or shall cause their respective

the Business Employees.

(b) Purchaser shall provide or cause to be provided to the Business
Employees (other than any Union Employees), (i) during the period commencing

the Closing Date and (B) the end of the Continuation Period, the same wage
rate or cash salary level in effect for such Business Employees immediately
prior to the Closing and (ii) during the Continuation Period, equity and non-
equity incentive compensation (other than eligibility for, or receipt of,
equity incentive awards under Parents Employee Scholar Program), fringe

substantially comparable in value, in the aggregate, to those in effect with
respect to such Business Employees immediately prior to the Closing;
_provided_ that no Business Employee shall participate in any defined benefit
pension plan sponsored by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates unless
such participation is required pursuant to the terms of a Collective
Bargaining Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary and solely in
accordance with the terms of the Transition Services Agreement, (A) any
Business Employee who, as of immediately prior to the Closing, participates
in Parents Executive Leased Vehicle Program shall continue to be eligible to
participate in such program during the Continuation Period and Purchaser shall
bear all liability for the costs of the program in respect of such Business
Employees, and (B) during the Continuation Period, Business Employees who were
eligible to participate in Parents Employee Scholar Program immediately prior
to the Closing may continue to enroll and participate in courses pursuant to
such program and Purchaser shall bear all liability for tuition and other
costs of the program in respect of such Business Employees (for the avoidance
of doubt, any such Business Employees will not be eligible to receive equity
incentive awards in connection with their participation in such program).
Purchaser agrees that after the Closing (and no later than March 15, 2016
(assuming the Closing occurs prior to such date), or if the Closing occurs
after March 15, 2016, within a reasonable time thereafter), Purchaser will
grant 2016 annual equity incentive awards to the Business Employees who were
eligible to receive annual equity incentive compensation under Parents
program immediately prior to the Closing, to the extent Parent has not
granted such awards prior to the Closing, with such Purchaser awards to have a
target grant date fair value at least equal to the target grant date fair
value of the annual equity incentive awards granted to such eligible Business
Employee under Parents program in 2015. Effective as of January 1, 2017,
Purchaser shall cause the Business Employees (other than any Union Employees)
to commence participation in the broad-based employee benefit plans,
including health and welfare plans, covering, and at levels no less favorable
than apply to, similarly situated employees of Purchaser and its Affiliates.
Compensation and employee benefits for Union Employees shall be provided
in accordance with the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement as in
effect from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall not be
prohibited by this _Section 6.01(b)_ from terminating the employment of any
Business Employee following the Closing Date, subject to _Section 6.03_.

 



84 (c) Purchaser or its Affiliates shall provide the Business Employees full
credit for all service with Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the
Transferred Entities) (or any predecessor employer for which the foregoing

and (iii) any other service-based or seniority-based entitlement, in each case
maintained or made available for the benefit of Business Employees as of and
after the Closing by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, to the same extent
such service is recognized by a Seller and its applicable Affiliates
(including the Transferred Entities) under any similar plan, program, policy,
arrangement or entitlement immediately prior to the Closing, subject to
offsets for previously accrued benefits and to avoid the duplication of
benefits; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates shall be required to provide credit for such service for (i) level
of benefit or benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit pension plan
or (ii) eligibility under any frozen defined benefit pension plan, in each
case, that is sponsored or maintained by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates,
unless such credit is required pursuant to the terms of a Collective
Bargaining Agreement (however, for the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall be required to provide credit for such service for purposes
of the level of benefit accruals under any defined contribution profit-
sharing or matching plan).

Section 6.02. _Health Coverages_. Each Business Employee (and his or her
eligible dependents) eligible for coverage under a group health plan or plans
of the Purchaser or its Affiliates shall not be excluded from coverage on the
basis of any pre-existing condition of such Business Employee or dependent
(other than any limitation already in effect under the applicable group
health Seller Benefit Plan or Transferred Entity Benefit Plan) or on the basis
of any other exclusion or waiting period not in effect under the applicable
group health Seller Benefit Plan or Transferred Entity Benefit Plan. If a
Business Employee becomes eligible to participate in a Purchaser group health
plan for the first time following the Closing, Purchaser shall provide such
Business Employee full credit, for the first year of eligibility, for any
deductible, co-payment or out-of-pocket expenses already incurred by the
Business Employee under the applicable group health Seller Benefit Plan or
Transferred Entity Benefit Plan during the same plan year, if any, for
purposes of any deductible, co-payment or maximum out-of-pocket expense
provisions, as applicable, of such Purchaser group health plans. For the
avoidance of doubt, on and after the Closing Date, any claims for services
made by Business Employees that are incurred (but not reported) prior to the
Closing Date shall be submitted under the applicable group health Seller
Benefit Plan.

 

Section 6.03. _Severance_. With respect to any Business Employee who, during
the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary
thereof, experiences a Qualifying Termination, Purchaser shall provide
severance pay and benefits that are no less favorable than the severance pay
and benefits described on _Section 6.03 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_,
or are required pursuant to any Collective Bargaining Agreement, if
applicable, in each case, taking into account the Business Employees period
of employment with Parent and its Subsidiaries (including any Transferred
Entity) prior to the Closing and with Purchaser and its Subsidiaries on and
after the Closing.

 



85 Section 6.04. _Compensation and Benefits Arrangements_. Parent and Purchaser
shall cooperate in good faith to take all actions necessary to effectuate the
compensation and benefits arrangements described in _Section 6.04 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule_.

 

Section 6.05. _WARN_. Purchaser shall be solely responsible for, and agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the Parent Group from and against, any
Liabilities under WARN with respect to any Service Provider located in the
U.S. who is found to have suffered an "employment loss" under WARN on or after
the Closing Date or who, by reason of actions by Purchaser or its Affiliates
at or after the Closing, is deemed to have suffered an "employment loss" under
WARN at or prior to the Closing; _provided_ that Parent and Sellers have
cooperated in good faith with Purchaser and its Affiliates to deliver any
notices to Service Providers located in the U.S. and take any other actions as
of the Closing Date as may be needed to comply with WARN; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that no later than 15 days prior to the Closing Date, Parent has
provided Purchaser with a true and accurate schedule indicating how many
Service Providers located in the U.S. have had their employment terminated or
have been notified of an "employment loss" by Sellers or one of their
respective Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) during the
preceding 90-day period at each facility, site of employment and operating
unit of the Sellers and their respective Affiliates, which schedule has been
updated by Parent as of the Closing Date. Parent shall (subject to the
immediately preceding sentence) be solely responsible for, and agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates from and against, any
Liabilities under WARN with respect to any Service Providers located in
the U.S. who is found to have suffered an "employment loss" under WARN prior
to the Closing Date (other than by reason of actions by Purchaser or its
Affiliates at or after the Closing).

 

Section 6.06. _Accrued Vacation and Sick Leave_. Purchaser will recognize and
assume the liability with respect to accrued but unused vacation time and
sick leave (in the case of such sick leave, up to the caps or maximums allowed
under Purchasers sick leave policies) for all Business Employees in which
such recognition is permitted by applicable Law. In each jurisdiction where
payment of the value of accrued but unused vacation time to Business Employees
in connection with the Closing is required by applicable Law and, with respect
to Business Employees located in the Material Employee Jurisdictions only,
the relevant Business Employee has, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
been asked at least fourteen (14) days prior to the Closing to waive his or
her right to such payment in favor of the recognition of such accrued but
unused vacation time by Purchaser and has not done so, (i) Parent will pay,
or cause to be paid, all accrued but unused vacation time to such Business
Employees as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date and (ii)
Purchaser will credit each such Business Employee with unpaid vacation time
equal to the balance of the accrued but unused vacation paid to such Business
Employee pursuant to clause (i). Purchaser reserves the right to require any
Business Employee to use, within a reasonable amount of time after the
Closing, any accrued paid or unpaid vacation time in excess of any maximums or
caps imposed under any policy of Purchaser or its Affiliates applicable to
similarly situated employees of Purchaser or its Affiliates.

 



86 Section 6.07. _LTD Employees_. Each LTD Employee shall remain an employee of,
or have his or her employment transferred prior to the Closing to, a member
of the Parent Group, and shall continue to participate in Parents long-term
disability plan following the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of
that plan, as in effect from time to time. Subject to Parent notifying
Purchaser of an LTD Employees return to active employment within ten (10)
Business Days of such return, Purchaser or one of its Subsidiaries shall make
an offer of employment to such LTD Employee on terms consistent with those
applicable to Business Employees generally under this _Article 6_ , _provided_
that the LTD Employee returned to active employment with the Parent Group on
or prior to the expiration date of such LTD Employees eligibility for
disability benefits or approved leave period and within one (1) year following
the Closing Date (or such longer period required by applicable Law or any
applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement). From and after such LTD
Employees commencement of employment with Purchaser or one of its Affiliates,
such LTD Employee shall be considered a "Business Employee" for all purposes
under this Agreement.

 

Section 6.08. _Pension Plans_. Purchaser shall not assume any obligations
under or Liabilities with respect to, or receive any right or interest in any
trusts relating to, any assets of or any insurance, administration or other
contracts, or related obligations pertaining to, any Seller Benefit Plan that
is a "pension plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) subject to Section
412 of the Code or Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or a non-U.S. pension or
defined benefit plan. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that, if and to the extent required by any Collective Bargaining
Agreement, Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall provide benefits to the
Union Employees covered by such Collective Bargaining Agreement under a plan
sponsored by Purchaser or one of its Affiliates that is a "pension plan" (as
defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) subject to Section 412 of the Code or
Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or a non-U.S. pension or defined benefit plan
and Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be liable for all such benefits
required by the terms of the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement to be
accrued in respect of periods after the Closing, including to the extent that
such benefits take into account compensation received and services provided by
Union Employees prior to the Closing. Subject to applicable Law, Parent
shall, upon request from Purchaser, promptly provide to Purchaser information
relating to any Union Employee (including, without limitation, information
regarding compensation and length of service) as may reasonably be requested
by Purchaser in order to facilitate the provision (and calculation) of
benefits contemplated by the preceding sentence.

 

Section 6.09. _401(k) Plan_. Effective at or as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Closing, Purchaser shall permit each U.S. Business Employee who, as
of immediately prior to the Closing, was eligible to participate in a tax-
qualified defined contribution plan maintained by a Seller (collectively, the
" _Seller 401(k) Plans_ ") to be eligible to participate in Purchasers tax-
qualified defined contribution plan or plans with a cash or deferred feature
(the " _Purchaser 401(k) Plan_ "). If such participation in the Purchaser
401(k) Plan does not commence effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser
will, as soon as reasonably practicable after participation in the Purchaser
401(k) Plan commences, make a matching contribution with respect to each U.S.
Business Employee who participated in the Seller 401(k) Plans
immediately prior to the Closing in an amount

 



87  equal to the amount, if any, that otherwise would have been contributed in
respect of such U.S. Business Employee had such U.S. Business Employee been
able to participate in the Purchaser 401(k) Plan immediately after the
Closing. Purchaser shall continue to make available to U.S. Business Employees
and maintain for the benefit of U.S. Business Employees the Purchaser 401(k)
Plan in accordance with its terms during the Continuation Period. 

Section 6.10. _Flexible Spending Accounts_. To the extent any U.S. Business
Employee is participating in a Seller Benefit Plan that provides for
qualified flexible spending accounts for medical and/or dependent care
expenses as of the Closing, Purchaser shall permit each such U.S. Business
Employee, effective as of the Closing Date and through the Continuation
Period, to be eligible to participate in an employee benefit plan maintained
by Purchaser or its Affiliates that provides for qualified flexible spending
accounts for medical and/or dependent care expenses, as applicable. Purchaser
shall credit such accounts with the amount (positive or negative) credited as
of the Closing Date under comparable accounts maintained under Seller Benefit
Plans from the beginning of the plan year to the Closing Date. As soon as
practicable after the Closing Date, (a) the Parent Group shall pay to
Purchaser in cash the amount, if any, by which aggregate contributions made by
U.S. Business Employees to the Parent Groups flexible spending accounts
exceeded the aggregate benefits provided to U.S. Business Employees as of the
Closing or (b) Purchaser shall pay to the Parent Group in cash the amount, if
any, by which aggregate benefits provided to U.S. Business Employees under the
Parent Groups flexible spending accounts exceeded the aggregate
contributions made by U.S. Business Employees as of the Closing.

Section 6.11. _Collective Bargaining Agreements with Respect to Business
Employees_. Purchaser agrees that as of and following the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall recognize the unions or other counterparties that are
signatories to the Collective Bargaining Agreements as the representatives of
the Business Employees of the bargaining units described therein.

Section 6.12. _W-2 Matters_. Pursuant to IRS Revenue Procedure 2004-53,
Purchaser and the Sellers shall apply the "standard" method for purposes of
employee payroll reporting with respect to Business Employees.

 

Section 6.13. _Key Employee Resignations_. Parent shall promptly notify
Purchaser if, prior to the Closing Date, to the Knowledge of Parent, any Key
Employee either (a) communicates in writing to the appropriate human resources
representative of Parent or any Transferred Entity that he or she intends to
resign as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (b)
actually resigns or retires _._

Section 6.14. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Without limiting the generality
of  _Section 11.05_, nothing in this Agreement is intended to or shall _(a)_
be treated as an amendment to, or be construed as amending, any Seller Benefit
Plan, Transferred Entity Benefit Plan or other benefit plan, program
or agreement sponsored, maintained or contributed to by any Seller, any
Transferred Entity, the Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates, _(b)_
prevent Purchaser or its Affiliates from terminating any

 



88  Transferred Entity Benefit Plan or any other benefit plan in accordance with
its terms, (c) prevent Purchaser or its Affiliates, after the Closing Date,
from terminating the employment of any Business Employee or (d) confer any
rights or remedies (including third-party beneficiary rights) on any current
or former director, employee, consultant or independent contractor of any
Seller, any Transferred Entity, Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates or any beneficiary or dependent thereof or any other Person.

Section 6.15. _International Transferred Entity Benefit Plans_. Within thirty
(30) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, the Sellers shall
make available to Purchaser (a) a true and complete list, as of the date of
this Agreement, of each Transferred Entity Benefit Plan covering Service
Providers located within a jurisdiction other than a Material Employee
Jurisdiction and (b) with respect to the International Transferred Entity
Benefit Plans, documents that are substantially comparable (taking into
account differences in applicable Law and practices) to the documents required
to be provided in clauses (i) through (iii) of _Section 3.10(a)_.

 

Section 6.16. _Treatment of International Business Employees_. The following
terms and conditions shall, in addition to the other applicable terms and
conditions of this _Section 6.16_, apply to International Business Employees:

(a) In the case of International Business Employees, from and after the
Closing, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entities)
shall comply in all material respects with any additional obligations or
standards arising under applicable Laws governing the terms and conditions of
their employment or severance of employment in connection with the Sale or
otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, any severance benefits or termination
pay required to be provided to any Business Employee pursuant to applicable
Law as a result of Purchasers failure to comply with the provisions of this
Agreement shall be solely an obligation of Purchaser.

 

(b) In the case of any International Seller Benefit Plan, Parent or its
Affiliates, as the case may be, shall take any necessary actions to cause,
effective as of the Closing, any International Business Employees and former
international employees of the Business (and their respective eligible
dependents and beneficiaries) who are participating in any International
Seller Benefit Plan to cease participation in such International Seller
Benefit Plan. Except as otherwise provided by applicable Law, with respect to
any International Seller Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit or defined
contribution plan, Parent shall retain all assets and Liabilities with
respect to such International Seller Benefit Plan and their eligible
dependents and beneficiaries with respect to the participation of any Business
Employee prior to the Closing Date.

 

Section 6.17. _Employee Communications_. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, Parent and Purchaser shall coordinate
in good faith to develop a mutually agreed communications strategy with
respect to Business Employees, which shall require that each party shall
provide the other with a reasonable right to comment on and approve
(such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) any
written communications by the other party intended for distribution to
Business Employees prior to the Closing regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the terms of employment with Purchaser
following the Closing Date.

 



89 Section 6.18. _Certain Notifications_. Purchaser shall notify Parent promptly
(but in any event within twenty (20) calendar days) of the separation from
service with Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities)
of any Business Employee (a) who participates as of immediately prior to the
Closing in a Seller Benefit Plan that is a qualified defined contribution
plan or (b) who participates as of immediately prior to the Closing in a
Seller Benefit Plan that is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan. Parent
shall provide to Purchaser on the Closing Date a list of the Business
Employees described in each of clause (a) and clause (b). Purchasers
obligation under this covenant shall survive until all Business Employees
described in each of clause (a) and clause (b) have separated from service
with Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities).

TAX MATTERS

Section 7.01.  _Section 338(h)(10) Elections; Purchase Price Allocation_.
(a) Parent and Purchaser shall (or shall cause their relevant Affiliates to)
jointly make a timely and irrevocable election under Section 338(h)(10) of the
Code (and any corresponding elections under any applicable state or local Tax
Law) with respect to the acquisition of the Section 338(h)(10) Subsidiaries
pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, the " _Section 338(h)(10) Elections_
").

 

(b) Parent and Purchaser shall (and shall cause their relevant Affiliates to)
cooperate in the preparation of all forms, attachments and schedules
necessary to effectuate the Section 338(h)(10) Elections, including IRS Forms
8023 and 8883 and any similar forms under applicable state and local income
Tax Laws (collectively, the " _Section 338(h)(10) Forms_ ") in a manner
consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule and, if any, the
Allocation. Parent and Purchaser shall (or shall cause their relevant
Affiliates to) timely file such Section 338(h)(10) Forms with the applicable
taxing authorities. Each of Parent and Purchaser agrees that it shall not,
and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, revoke the Section 338(h)(10)
Elections following the filing of the Section 338(h)(10) Forms without the
prior written consent of Purchaser and Parent, respectively.

(c) Prior to the Closing, Parent and Purchaser shall agree on the form and
content of, and at Closing, Parent and Purchaser shall each deliver to the
other party one or more duly executed IRS Forms 8023 that reflect the Section
338(h)(10) Elections (and any analogous forms required to effectuate the
Section 338(h)(10) Elections for state or local Tax purposes).

(d) Purchaser shall make (and shall cause its Affiliates to make) an election
under Section 338(g) of the Code (and any corresponding elections under any
applicable state or local Tax Law) with respect to the acquisition of each
Foreign Transferred Entity

 



90  that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes as of
immediately prior to the Closing (such elections, the " _Section 338(g)
Elections_ "). Parent and Purchaser shall (and shall cause their relevant
Affiliates to) cooperate in the preparation of all forms, attachments and
schedules necessary to effectuate the Section 338(g) Elections (the " _Section
338(g) Forms_ ") and shall agree on the form and content of all Section
338(g) Forms prior to the Closing. Purchaser agrees that it shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, revoke the Section 338(g) Elections
after the filing of the Section 338(g) Forms without the prior written
consent of Parent. Neither Parent nor Purchaser shall (and each shall cause
its Affiliates not to) take or agree to take any action that would prevent or
impede, or could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede, the making of
any of the Section 338(g) Elections.

(e) For all U.S. federal (and applicable state and local) Tax purposes,
Parent and Purchaser agree to (and agree to cause their respective Affiliates
to) treat (i) the sale of the Shares of each of the Disregarded Entities
pursuant to this Agreement as a sale of the assets of each such Disregarded
Entity (and the assets of any of its relevant disregarded subsidiaries) by
the applicable Seller, (ii) the sale of the shares of the Section 338(h)(10)
Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with Treasury
Regulations Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 and (iii) the sale of the shares of any
Foreign Transferred Entity with respect to which a Section 338(g) Election is
made pursuant to _Section 7.01(d)_ in accordance with Treasury Regulations
Section 1.338-1 (the treatment described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above,
the " _Transaction Tax Treatment_ ").

 

(f) _Purchase Price Allocation_.

 

(i) For Tax purposes, Parent and Purchaser agree to (and agree to cause their
respective Affiliates to) allocate the Purchase Price (as adjusted to take
into account any payment pursuant to _Section 2.07_) and any other amounts
treated as consideration for such Tax purposes among the assets and shares
deemed sold for U.S. federal income tax purposes in accordance with _Schedule
III_ (such schedule, the " _Purchase Price Allocation Schedule_ ").

(ii) No later than one hundred and twenty (120) days after the Purchase Price
is finally determined hereunder (pursuant to _Section 2.06_), Purchaser shall
deliver to Parent a proposed allocation of the Purchase Price (as adjusted to
take into account any payment pursuant to _Section 2.07_) and other relevant
amounts as of the Closing Date, which allocation shall incorporate, reflect
and be consistent with the Transaction Tax Treatment and the Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule, and be determined in a manner consistent with Sections
338 and 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder
(the " _Purchaser s Draft Allocation_"). If Parent disagrees with Purchasers
Draft Allocation, Parent may, within thirty (30) days after delivery of
Purchasers Draft Allocation, deliver a notice (the " _Parent s Allocation
Notice_") to Purchaser to such effect, specifying those items as to
which Parent disagrees and setting forth Parents proposed allocation of the
Purchase Price (and other relevant amounts). If the Parents Allocation Notice
is duly delivered, Parent and Purchaser shall, during the twenty (20) days
following such delivery, negotiate in

 



91  good faith to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to
determine the allocation of the Purchase Price (and other relevant amounts).
If Parent and Purchaser are unable to reach such agreement, each of Parent
and Purchaser may separately determine the allocation of the Purchase Price
(and other relevant amounts); _provided_ , that any such allocation shall
incorporate, reflect and be consistent with the Transaction Tax Treatment and
the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule. The allocation of the Purchase Price
(and other relevant amounts) as prepared by Purchaser if no Parents
Allocation Notice has been timely delivered, as adjusted pursuant to any
agreement reached by Parent and Purchaser, if any (the " _Allocation_ "),
shall be conclusive and binding on all parties. The Allocation, if any, shall
be adjusted, as necessary, to reflect any subsequent payments treated as
adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 7.10_. Any such
adjustment shall be allocated, consistent with this _Section 7.01(f)_, to the
asset, assets, share or shares (if any) to which such adjustment is
attributable.

 

(iii) Parent and Purchaser shall (and shall cause their Affiliates to) (A)
prepare and file all Tax Returns (including the Section 338(h)(10) Forms), in
a manner consistent with the Transaction Tax Treatment, the Section 338(h)(10)
Elections, the Section 338(g) Elections, the Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule and, if any, the Allocation and (B) not take any position
inconsistent therewith on any Tax Return, in connection with any Tax
Proceeding or otherwise, in each case, except to the extent otherwise required
pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code (or any similar provision of applicable state, local or foreign Law).

Section 7.02. _Tax Indemnification by the Sellers_. Subject to _Section
10.02(b)(iv)_, effective as of and after the Closing Date, the Sellers shall
pay or cause to be paid, and shall indemnify Purchaser and each of its
Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entities after the Closing Date)
(collectively, the " _Purchaser Tax Indemnified Parties_ ") and hold each
Purchaser Tax Indemnified Party harmless from and against (a) any Taxes
imposed on the Transferred Entities for any Pre-Closing Period (and any Taxes
imposed on the Transferred Entities with respect to any transactions
contemplated by _Section 5.08_, _Section 5.09_, _Section 5.10_, or _Section
5.21_); (b) any Taxes of any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates
(other than any Transferred Entity) for which any Transferred Entity is liable
under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or 1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(2) (or under
any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law), as transferee or
successor, or by reason of having been a member of a consolidated, affiliated,
combined or other group for Tax purposes at any time before the Closing; (c)
any Taxes arising out of or relating to any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any
representation or warranty contained in _Section 3.13(h)_, ( _j)_ , _(k),
(l)_ or ( _m)_ or any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Sellers
contained in this Agreement; (d) any Taxes (other than Transfer Taxes)
imposed on any Seller or any Subsidiary thereof (or Purchaser as a method of
collecting such Taxes) with respect to the sale of the Shares pursuant to this
Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Taxes imposed on
the deemed asset sales resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Elections, but
not including any withholding Taxes in respect of which Purchaser is required
to pay additional amounts pursuant to the last sentence of

 



92   _Section 2.09)_; (e) any Taxes resulting from any action of any Seller, or
any Affiliate of any Seller, that causes any Section 338(h)(10) Election or
any Section 338(g) Election to be invalid; (f) Transfer Taxes for which
Sellers are responsible pursuant to Section 7.12; (g) any subsidies required
to be repaid or Taxes arising out of or relating to the reduction or
cancellation by a Governmental Entity in Poland of any public aid granted
with respect to a Pre-Closing Period under a special economic zone permit or
form of public aid regime in Poland to the extent such reduction or
cancellation results from Polskie Zaklady Lotnicze Sp. z.o.o.s failure to
satisfy the requirements thereof on or prior to the Closing; and (h) costs and
expenses, including reasonable legal and other professional advisor fees and
expenses attributable to any item described in clauses (a) to (g); _provided_
, _however_ , that the Sellers shall not be required to pay or cause to be
paid, or to indemnify or hold harmless the Purchaser Tax Indemnified Parties
from and against (i) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes were reflected as a
reserve or liability in Working Capital on the Final Working Capital and
Indebtedness Statement, (ii) any Taxes that are recoverable as a cost in a
cost-reimbursement or fixed-price (cost-redeterminable) government
contract of the Transferred Entities, or (iii) any Taxes for which Purchaser
is responsible pursuant to _Section 7.03_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, in the event any Taxes for which the Sellers
otherwise would be responsible pursuant to this _Section 7.02_ are set off
or otherwise reduced by the utilization of any loss, deduction or credit of a
Transferred Entity (x) attributable to and arising in a Post-Closing Period
(other than as a result of a carry back of a Subsequent Loss into a Pre-
Closing Period that is not permitted under _Section 7.06(c))_, then Sellers
shall pay or cause to be paid to the Purchaser Tax Indemnified Parties the
amount Sellers would have been required to pay to the Purchaser Tax
Indemnified Parties pursuant to this _Section 7.02_ in the absence of such
set-off or such other reduction or (y) attributable to and arising in a Pre-
Closing Period or a carry back of a Subsequent Loss into a Pre-Closing Period
that is not permitted under _Section 7.06(c)_, then Sellers shall not be
required to pay or cause to be paid to the Purchaser Tax Indemnified Parties
any amounts so set-off or otherwise reduced. For purposes of this Article 7,
the Intellectual Property Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the assignments pursuant to Sections 2.1.1, 2.2.1, 3.1 and 3.2 and the license
grants pursuant to Sections 4.1.1 and 4.2.1 thereof) shall be deemed to
be effective immediately prior to the Closing.

Section 7.03. _Tax Indemnification by Purchaser_. Subject to  _Section
10.03(b)(iii)_, effective as of and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
pay or cause to be paid, and shall indemnify each member of the Parent Group
(collectively, the " _Seller Tax Indemnified Parties_ ") and hold each Seller
Tax Indemnified Party harmless from and against (a) any Taxes imposed on the
Transferred Entities for any Post-Closing Period (other than such Taxes for
which Sellers are responsible under _Section 7.02_); (b) any Taxes arising
from any action or transaction by Purchaser, its Affiliates or the Transferred
Entities outside of the ordinary course of business on the Closing Date after
the Closing (other than any action or transaction taken at the written
direction of Parent); (c) any Taxes arising out of or relating to any breach
of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser contained in this Agreement; (d) any
Transfer Taxes for which Purchaser is responsible under  _Section 7.12_; and
(e) any costs and expenses, including reasonable legal or other professional
advisor fees and expenses attributable to any item described in this _Section
7.03(a) _to (d).

 



93 Section 7.04. _Straddle Periods_. To the extent permitted or required by
applicable Law, the taxable year of each of the Transferred Entities that
includes the Closing Date shall be treated as closing on (and including) the
Closing Date. To the extent not permitted or required by applicable Law, for
purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Straddle Period, (a) Property
Taxes of the Transferred Entities allocable to the Pre-Closing Period shall be
equal to the amount of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Period and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period, and (b) Taxes (other than Property Taxes) of the Transferred Entities
allocable to the Pre-Closing Period, including, for the avoidance of doubt,
such Taxes attributable to the ownership of any equity interest in a
partnership, other "flow through" entity or "controlled foreign corporation"
(within the meaning of Section 957(a) of the Code (or any similar provision of
state, local or non-U.S. Law)), shall be computed as if the taxable period of
each applicable entity ended as of the end of the day on the Closing Date and
in a manner consistent with past practices of the Transferred Entities (or of
Parent with respect to the Transferred Entities); _provided_ that (x)
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual
basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated
between the period ending on the Closing Date and the period beginning after
the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each period and (y)
any deductions in respect of (A) Parent Retention Payments, 2015 Incentive
Compensation payments and any compensatory equity awards with respect to
Parent Common Stock granted by Parent to Service Providers during the Pre-
Closing Period shall be allocated to the Pre-Closing Period and (B) Purchaser

provided) to Parent any information reasonably requested by Parent to

such cooperation, documentation and information reasonably requested by
Purchaser to timely prepare such Straddle Period Separate Tax Returns in such
manner. Purchaser shall deliver to Parent for its review and comment a copy of
such Straddle Period Separate Tax Returns at least thirty (30) days (or such
shorter period as is reasonable taking into account the Tax period and the
nature of the relevant Tax Return or other relevant circumstances) prior to
the due date thereof (taking into account any extensions) and Purchaser shall
(x) make such revisions to such Straddle Period Separate Tax Returns as are
reasonably requested by Parent to the extent such revisions relate to the Pre-

the Transferred Entities (or of Parent with respect to the Transferred
Entities) and (y) consider in good faith any other written comments received
from Parent reasonably in advance of such due date for filing such Straddle
Period Separate Tax Returns. If Purchaser disagrees with any comments
provided by Parent with respect to any Straddle Period Separate Tax Return,
the parties shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any such disagreement
prior to the due date for filing such Straddle Period Separate Tax Return
(taking into account extensions). If the parties are unable to so resolve any
such disagreement, such Straddle Period Separate Tax Return shall be filed as
prepared by Purchaser (as revised by Purchaser to reflect any comments of
Parent with which Purchaser agrees), and, at Parents request, the parties
shall promptly cause any remaining disagreement to be resolved by the
Independent Accounting Firm. Any decision of the Independent Accounting Firm
shall be consistent 

 



95  with the terms of this Agreement and shall be final and binding on all
parties. Purchaser shall promptly amend (or cause to be amended) the relevant
Straddle Period Separate Tax Return to reflect the determination of the
Independent Accounting Firm and shall file (or cause to be filed) such return.
The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne
equally by Parent and Purchaser. Parent shall pay Purchaser the amount of any
Taxes that are the responsibility of Sellers pursuant to _Section 7.02_ with
respect to any such Straddle Period Separate Tax Return no later than ten (10)
days after Purchaser notifies Parent in writing that it has filed, or caused
to be filed, such Tax Return. Purchaser shall not amend or revoke any such
Straddle Period Separate Tax Returns (or any notification or election relating
thereto) without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). At Parents reasonable
request and expense, Purchaser shall file, or cause to be filed, amended
Straddle Period Separate Tax Returns; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser
shall have no obligation to file, or cause to be filed, any amended Straddle
Period Separate Tax Return if such amended Straddle Period Separate Tax
Return, or the filing thereof, would reasonably be expected to have an adverse
effect on Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred
Entities) in a Post-Closing Period.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (A) neither
Parent nor the Sellers shall be required to provide any Person with any Tax
Return or copy of any Tax Return of (i) Parent or a member of the Parent Group
or (ii) a consolidated, combined or unitary group that includes any member of
the Parent Group (including any Combined Tax Return) and (B) in the case of a

able to do so and subject to obtaining any required consents from any other
holder of equity interests in such Business Joint Venture, make an election
under Section 754 of the Code (and any similar elections available under
applicable state or local law) with respect to such Business Joint Venture,
and if none of Purchaser, Parent or their respective Affiliates is legally
able to do so, then Parent shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser to
request that the other holders of equity interests in such Business Joint
Venture make such elections.

If, in respect of a taxable year that begins prior to the four (4) year
anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including
the Transferred Entities) actually realizes (determined on a "with and
without" basis), by way of a reduction of Taxes paid, a net Tax Benefit (for
the avoidance of doubt, determined by taking into account any related net Tax
cost, including any net Tax cost associated with the receipt of any
indemnification payment) as a result of (i) any adjustment in any Tax
Proceeding made with respect to any Tax Item by any taxing authority with
respect to Taxes for which Sellers are responsible under _Section 7.02_ or
(ii) any Tax Item arising in respect of any payment, loss, obligation,
liability or Tax paid or incurred by any member of the Parent Group or for
which Sellers are responsible to pay under this Agreement (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any deduction in respect of Parent Retention Payments,
2015 Incentive Compensation payments and any compensatory equity awards

 



96  with respect to Parent Common Stock granted by Parent to Service Providers
during the Pre-Closing Period), then Purchaser shall pay to Parent the amount
of such Tax Benefit within fifteen (15) days after such Tax Benefit is

entitled as a result of any adjustment described in clause (i)
above. Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the
Transferred Entities) not to, claim any Tax Item described in clause (ii)
above on any Tax Return for a Post-Closing Period; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if any such Tax Item is not permitted by Law to be claimed on a Tax
Return for which Parent has filing responsibility pursuant to _Section
7.05(a)_ and is permitted by Law to be claimed on a Tax Return for a Straddle
Period or Post-Closing Period, then Purchaser shall claim or cause its
relevant Affiliate (including the Transferred Entities) to claim such Tax
Item. Within fifteen (15) days after Purchaser notifies Parent in writing that
any Governmental Entity required Purchaser to pay any Taxes the reduction of
which constituted a Tax Benefit the amount of which Purchaser previously paid
over to Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.06(a)_ , Parent shall repay to
Purchaser such amount previously received by Parent.

 

(b) Parent shall be entitled to (i) any refunds or credits of any Taxes for
which the Sellers are responsible under  _Section 7.02_ and (ii) any refunds

_however_ , that Parent shall not be entitled to any refunds or credits if and
to the extent such refunds or credits were reflected as an asset in Working
Capital on the Final Working Capital and Indebtedness Statement or result from
the carryback of any Subsequent Loss (except for any such carryback that is
not permitted under  _Section 7.06(c)_). Purchaser shall be entitled to any
refunds or credits of Taxes of the Transferred Entities other than refunds or
credits to which Parent is entitled pursuant to the preceding sentence. Any
refunds or credits of Taxes of the Transferred Entities for any Straddle
Period shall be equitably apportioned between Parent and Purchaser in
accordance with the principles set forth in _Section 7.04_ and the first
sentence of this _Section 7.06(b)_. Each party shall pay, or cause its
Affiliates to pay, to the party entitled to a refund or credit of Taxes under
this _Section 7.06(b)_, the amount of such refund or credit (including any
interest paid thereon by a Governmental Entity and net of (x) any Taxes
imposed on the party receiving such refund or credit in respect of the receipt
or accrual of such refund or credit, (y) any amount reimbursed to a customer
as a result of such refund or credit under the Federal Acquisition Regulation
if such reimbursement relates to a Tax Liability recoverable as a cost in a
cost-reimbursement or fixed-price (cost-redeterminable) government contract of
the Transferred Entities and (z) any reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses associated with obtaining such refund or credit or making such
reimbursement) in readily available funds within fifteen (15) days of the
actual receipt of the refund or, in the case of a credit or a refund that is
not received but instead applied against Taxes otherwise payable, the filing
of the Tax Return actually applying such credit or refund against amounts
otherwise payable.

 



97 (c) Purchaser shall cause the Transferred Entities to carry forward or carry
back any item of loss, deduction or credit which arises in any taxable period
ending after the Closing Date (a " _Subsequent Loss_ ") solely into taxable
periods beginning after the Closing Date and, except to the extent otherwise
required by applicable Law, shall not permit or cause any Transferred Entity
to carry back any Subsequent Loss into a taxable period ending prior to or
including the Closing Date.

 

Section 7.07. _Tax Contests_. (a) If any Governmental Entity asserts a Tax
Claim, then the party to this Agreement first receiving notice of such Tax
Claim promptly shall provide written notice thereof to the other party or
parties to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of such
party to give such prompt notice shall not relieve the other party of any of
its obligations under this _Article 7_ , except to the extent that the other
party is prejudiced by such failure. Such notice shall specify in reasonable
detail the basis for such Tax Claim and shall include a copy of the relevant
portion of any correspondence received from the Governmental Entity.

(b) In the case of a Tax Proceeding of or with respect to any of the
Transferred Entities for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing
Date (other than a Tax Proceeding described in _Section 7.07(d)_), Parent
shall have the exclusive right to control such Tax Proceeding;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (x) if the resolution of such Tax Proceeding could reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse impact on Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including any Transferred Entity after the Closing), Parent shall
keep Purchaser apprised of material developments with respect to, and promptly
shall respond to any reasonable requests from Purchaser for information
relating to, such Tax Proceeding, and (y) Parent shall not settle, compromise
or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining the prior written
consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, if such settlement, compromise or abandonment could

(including the Transferred Entities) in any Post-Closing Period (disregarding,
for this purpose, any reduction or elimination of a Tax Asset of a Transferred
Entity existing immediately prior to the Closing).

Party shall not have any rights) under clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (v) above
with respect to any portion of such Tax Proceeding (and any actions, written
materials, meetings or conferences relating exclusively thereto) that could
not reasonably be expected to affect the liability of, or otherwise have an
adverse effect on, the Non-Controlling Party or any of its Affiliates. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Controlling Party_ " shall mean Parent if
Parent and its Affiliates are reasonably expected to bear the greater Tax

Tax Proceeding to Purchaser, and (y) keep Purchaser apprised of any material
developments with respect to such Tax Proceeding and respond to any reasonable
requests from Purchaser for information relating to such Tax Proceeding;
_provided_ , _further_ , that Parent shall in no event be required
pursuant to the foregoing proviso to provide Purchaser with any Tax Returns

Proceeding or take any other action that Parent reasonably determines could
have a material adverse effect on Parent or any of its Affiliates.

warranty has occurred, the applicable representation or warranty shall be
read without regard to any qualification or exception in such representation
or warranty relating to materiality or Business Material Adverse Effect;

representations and warranties referred to in clauses (ii) and (iii) (in the
case of clause (iii), only in respect of Section _3.06(b)_ and  _Section

(Authority Relative to this Agreement) or _Section 4.06_ (Brokers);

 



111 (iii) the cumulative indemnification obligations of Purchaser under

or demand asserted by a third party that the Indemnified Party has determined
has given or would reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of
indemnification under such agreement (such claim being a " _Third Party
Claim_ ") describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with
respect to the subject matter of such claim or demand (to the extent known or
reasonably ascertainable);  _provided_ , that the failure to provide such
notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations
under this _Article 10_ , except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is
actually prejudiced by such failure, it being agreed that notices for claims
in respect of a breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
must describe in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances (to the extent
known or reasonably ascertainable) with respect to the alleged breach and be
delivered prior to the expiration of any applicable survival period specified

as applicable.

 

(b) Upon receipt of a notice of a Third Party Claim for indemnity from an
Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 10.02(a)_ or  _Section 10.03(a)_,

delivered within twenty (20) Business Days of the receipt of notice of such
Third Party Claim, to assume the defense and control of such Third Party
Claim (at the expense of such Indemnifying Party); _provided_ that the
Indemnifying Party shall allow the Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity
to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel
and at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense
and control of any Third Party Claim pursuant to this _Section 10.04(b)_, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume and control such defense, but
the Indemnifying Party may nonetheless participate (but not control or make
decisions regarding) in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own
counsel and at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense
and control of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled
to select counsel, contractors and consultants of recognized standing and
competence. Purchaser or the Sellers, as the case may be, shall, and shall
cause each of their Affiliates and representatives to, reasonably cooperate
with the Indemnifying Party

 



112  in the defense of any Third Party Claim, including by furnishing books and
records, personnel and witnesses, as appropriate for any defense of such Third
Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense. If the
Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense and control of a Third Party Claim,
it shall be authorized to consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any
judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim, in its sole discretion without
the consent of the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , that (x) such settlement or
judgment does not involve any injunctive or other equitable relief or finding
or admission of any violation of Law or admission of any wrongdoing by any
Indemnified Party and (y) the Indemnifying Party shall (i) pay or cause to be
paid all amounts in such settlement or judgment (other than solely with
respect to the Deductible, to the extent such liabilities would constitute
Liabilities to which the Deductible would be applicable in accordance with the
applicable provisions of _Section 10.02(b)_ or _Section 10.03(b)_, as
applicable), (ii) not encumber any of the assets of any Indemnified Party or
agree to any restriction or condition that would apply to any Indemnified
Party or the conduct of any Indemnified Partys business and (iii) obtain, as
a condition of any settlement or other resolution, a complete
and unconditional release of any Indemnified Party affected by such Third
Party Claim. No Indemnified Party will consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to such Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party in its sole and
absolute discretion, provided that, with respect to any Third Party Claim that
the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense and control of within the
time periods set forth above, such consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(c) If the Indemnified Party receives any payment from an Indemnifying Party
in respect of any Losses pursuant to _Section 10.02_ or _10.03_ and the
Indemnified Party is entitled to recover all or a part of such Losses from a
third party (a " _Potential Contributor_ ") based on facts, events and
circumstances giving rise to the right of indemnification, the Indemnified
Party shall assign its rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as
reasonably necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from
the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment.

(d) In the event an Indemnified Party has a claim for indemnity under 
_Section 10.02_ or _Section 10.03_ against an Indemnifying Party that does
not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to give notice
in writing of such claim to the Indemnifying Party as promptly
as practicable. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such claim
and the basis for indemnification (taking into account the information then
available to the Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify the Indemnifying
Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder,
except to the extent such failure shall have actually prejudiced the
Indemnifying Party.

 

Section 10.05. _Exclusive Remedy and Release_. Except with respect to (i) the
Ancillary Agreements (other than the Foreign Acquisition Agreements), (ii)
the matters covered by _Sections 2.05_ through _2.07_ and (iii) any matter
relating to Taxes (which shall be governed exclusively by _Article 7_ ),
Purchaser and the Sellers acknowledge and agree that, following the Closing,
the indemnification provisions of _Sections 10.02_ and _10.03_ shall be the
sole and exclusive remedies of the Sellers and Purchaser, respectively, for
any Losses (including any Losses from claims for breach of contract,
warranty, tortious

 



113  conduct (including negligence) or otherwise and whether predicated on common
law, statute, strict liability or otherwise) (but excluding claims for fraud)
that each party may at any time suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a
result of, or in connection with the Sale or the other transactions
contemplated hereby, including any breach of any representation or warranty in
this Agreement by any party, or any failure by any party to perform or comply
with any covenant or agreement that, by its terms, was to have been performed,
or complied with, under this Agreement and the Foreign Acquisition Agreements.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waive any right of rescission they may otherwise have or to which
they may become entitled. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section
10.05_ shall limit any Persons right to seek and obtain any equitable relief
to which any Person shall be entitled to pursuant to _Section 11.11_ or to
seek any remedy on account of fraud by any Person.

 

Section 10.06. _Additional Indemnification Provisions_. With respect to each
indemnification obligation contained in this Agreement, all Losses shall be
net of any third-party insurance and indemnity proceeds that have been
recovered by the Indemnified Party in connection with the facts giving rise to
the right of indemnification, less the amount of out-of-pocket costs
incurred to obtain such proceeds (it being agreed that if third-party
insurance or indemnification proceeds in respect of such facts are recovered
by the Indemnified Party subsequent to the Indemnifying Partys making of an
indemnification payment in satisfaction of its applicable indemnification
obligation, such proceeds, less the amount of out-of-pocket costs incurred to
obtain such proceeds, shall be promptly remitted to the Indemnifying Party to
the extent of the indemnification payment made), and the Indemnified Party
shall use, and cause its Affiliates to use, commercially reasonable efforts to
seek full recovery under all insurance policies and indemnity provisions
covering such Loss to the same extent as it would if such Loss were not
subject to indemnification hereunder. Upon making any payment to the
Indemnified Party for any indemnification claim pursuant to this _Article 10_
, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment,
to any rights which the Indemnified Party may have against any third parties
with respect to the subject matter underlying such indemnification claim, and
the Indemnified Party shall assign any such rights to the Indemnifying Party.
From and after the Closing Date, no member of the Parent Group shall have any
right of contribution or indemnification against any of the Transferred
Entities for any amounts paid to any Purchaser Indemnified Party as a result
of any claim for indemnification under this Agreement arising from or
relating to a breach by Sellers or, prior to the Closing, any of the
Transferred Entities of any representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

 

Section 10.07. _Limitation of Liability_. In no event shall any Indemnifying
Party have liability to any Indemnified Party for any consequential, special,
incidental, exemplary, indirect or punitive or similar damages, or for any
loss of future revenue, profits or income, or for any diminution in value
damages measured as a multiple of earnings, revenue or any other
performance metric, except for any such damages to the extent actually paid
to a third party, including a Governmental Entity. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (a) with respect to any indemnification
obligation of the Sellers pursuant to Section _10.02(a)(iii)_ and _Section
10.02(a)(v)_ , to the extent related to

 



114  use of Intellectual Property assigned or licensed to a Transferred Entity or
any of its Affiliates pursuant to the Intellectual Property Agreement,
indemnifiable Losses shall be limited to any bodily injury or property damage
arising out of or related to such use and (b) with respect to any
indemnification obligation of Purchaser or the Transferred Entities pursuant
to Section _10.03(a)(iii)_ , to the extent related to use of Intellectual
Property assigned or licensed to Parent or its Affiliates pursuant to the
Intellectual Property Agreement, indemnifiable Losses shall be limited to any
bodily injury or property damage arising out of or related to such use.

 

Section 10.08. _Mitigation_. Each of the parties agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate its respective Liabilities upon
and after becoming aware of any event or condition that would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any Liabilities that are indemnifiable hereunder.

 

Section 10.09. _Specified Demand_. In connection with any defense or
settlement of the Specified Demand, no member of the Parent Group shall
(without the prior written consent of Purchaser) admit any wrongdoing,
misconduct, culpability or illegality on the part of any Transferred Entity,
the Business or any Business Employee, other than with respect to current or
former directors or executive officers of Parent who are not Business
Employees.

the other Sellers hereunder shall be a joint and several obligation of Parent
and the Sellers.

such disclosure is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure.

Section 11.02. _Headings; Definitions_. The section and article headings
contained in this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements are inserted for
convenience of reference only and will not affect the meaning or

Section 11.03. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Forum; Waiver of Jury Trial_.
(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any
choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware
or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of
any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. In addition, each of the
parties hereto irrevocably (i) submits to the personal jurisdiction of the
Delaware Court of Chancery in and for New Castle County, or in the event (but
only in the event) that such Delaware Court of Chancery does not have subject

the District of

 



116  Delaware, or in the event (but only in the event) that such United States
District Court also does not have jurisdiction over such dispute, any Delaware
State court sitting in New Castle County, in the event any dispute (whether
in contract, tort or otherwise) arises out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny

not bring any Action relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby in any court other than the Delaware Court of Chancery in

Delaware Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction over
such Action, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, or
in the event (but only in the event) that such United States District Court
also does not have jurisdiction over such Action, any Delaware State court
sitting in New Castle County. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding
may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without
the jurisdiction of any such court. Each party agrees that service of process
upon such party in any such Action shall be effective if notice is given in
accordance with _Section 11.07_.

119 Section 11.08. _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their
respective successors and assigns; _provided_ , that no party to this
Agreement may directly or indirectly assign any or all of its rights or
delegate any or all of its obligations under this Agreement without the
express prior written consent of each other party to this Agreement, except
that (a) Parent or any Seller may transfer or assign, in whole or from time to
time in part, its rights under this Agreement to any Affiliate of Parent, but
any such transfer or assignment will not relieve Parent or such Seller, as
applicable, of any of its obligations hereunder and (b) Purchaser may transfer
or assign, in whole or from time to time in part, to one or more of
its direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries, its rights and/or
obligations under this Agreement, but any such transfer or assignment will not
relieve Purchaser of any of its obligations hereunder. Any attempted
assignment in violation of this  _Section 11.08_ shall be void.

Section 11.09. _Amendments and Waivers_. (a) This Agreement may not be
modified or amended except by an instrument or instruments in writing signed
by the party against whom enforcement of any such modification or amendment is
sought. Any party to this Agreement may, only by an instrument in writing,
waive compliance by the other parties to this Agreement with any term or
provision of this Agreement on the part of such other parties to this
Agreement to be performed or complied with. The waiver by any party to this
Agreement of a breach of any term or provision of this Agreement shall not be
construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach.

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by law.

Section 11.10. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the
terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party hereto. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 11.11. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not
be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not
perform any provision of this Agreement in accordance with its specified
terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties
acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled in Law or in equity.
Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance

 



120  and other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate
remedy at Law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at Law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with such order or injunction. The
parties acknowledge and agree that the limitations on remedies of the parties
following valid termination of this Agreement set forth in _Section 9.03_
shall not limit the right of any party to obtain specific performance
pursuant to this _Section 11.11_ solely in respect of the provisions of this
Agreement that survive such termination in accordance with _Section 9.03_.
If, prior to the Outside Date, any party brings any Action in accordance with
_Section 11.03_ to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof by any other party, the Outside Date shall automatically be
extended by (x) the amount of time during which such action is pending, plus
twenty (20) Business Days or (y) such other time period established by the
court presiding over such action.

 

Section 11.12. _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Nonassertion of
Attorney-Client Privilege_. (a) Purchaser waives and will not assert, and
agrees to cause its Subsidiaries, including the Transferred Entities, to waive
and not to assert, any conflict of interest arising out of or relating to the
representation, after the Closing (the " _Post-Closing Representation_ "), of
Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any shareholder, officer, employee or
director of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (any such Person, a "
_Designated Person_ ") in any matter involving this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements or any other agreements or transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, by any legal counsel currently representing Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or
any other agreements or transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
including Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz (the " _Current Representation_ ").

 

(b) Purchaser waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause its
Subsidiaries, including the Transferred Entities, to waive and not to assert,
any attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication between any
legal counsel and any Designated Person occurring during the Current
Representation in connection with any Post-Closing Representation, including
in connection with a dispute with Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, and
following the Closing, with any Transferred Entity (including in respect of
any claim for indemnification by Purchaser), it being the intention of the
parties hereto that all such rights to such attorney-client privilege and to
control such attorney-client privilege shall be retained by Parent; _provided_
, that the foregoing waiver and acknowledgement of retention shall not extend
to any communication not involving this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements
or any other agreements or transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or to
communications with any Person other than the Designated Persons and their
advisors. Accordingly, from and after Closing, the Transferred Entities shall
not have any access to any such communications or to the files of the Current
Representation or to internal counsel relating to such engagement, and none of
Purchaser, the Transferred Entities or any Person acting or purporting to act
on their behalf shall seek to obtain the same by any process on the grounds
that the privilege attaching to such communications and files belongs to
Parent.

 



121 Section 11.13. _No Admission_. Nothing herein shall be deemed an admission
by Purchaser, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, in any Action or
proceeding by or on behalf of a third party, that Parent or any of its
respective Affiliates, or that such third party or any of its respective
Affiliates, is or is not in breach or violation of, or in default in, the
performance or observance of any term or provisions of any contract.

Section 11.14.  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or other
electronic method shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart of this Agreement.

 

[Remainder of page intentionally left blank]
