 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

 



 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of May 29,
2017, is by and among Ensco plc, a public limited company organized under the
Laws of England and Wales (" _Parent_ "), Echo Merger Sub LLC, a Texas limited
liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "),
and Atwood Oceanics, Inc., a Texas corporation (the " _Company_ " and,
together with Parent and Merger Sub, the " _Parties_ ").

 



 

 ** _WITNESSETH_** **:**

 



 

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with the Texas Business Organizations Code (" _TBOC_ "), the
Parties intend that Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the "
_Merger_ "), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in the
Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (sometimes referred to in such
capacity as the " _Surviving Company_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
(i) unanimously determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and
the Company Shareholders to enter into this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, (ii) approved the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and (iii) resolved to
submit this Agreement to a vote of the Company Shareholders and recommend
approval of this Agreement by the Company Shareholders;

 



 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent (the " _Parent Board_ ") has (i)
unanimously determined that it is in the best interests of Parent and the
Parent Shareholders to enter into, and has declared advisable, this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, (ii) approved
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and (iii)
resolved to recommend the passing of the Parent Shareholder Resolutions by the
Parent Shareholders;

 



 

WHEREAS, Parent, as the sole member of Merger Sub, has approved the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and approved this
Agreement; and

 



 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements specified herein in
connection with this Agreement.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree as follows:

      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE I.**

 



 

 ** _THE MERGER_**

 



 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the TBOC, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
the Company, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and
the Company shall continue its existence under Texas Law as the Surviving
Company in the Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

 



 

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 811 Main Street, 37th
Floor, Houston, Texas as soon as practicable (and in any event within five
business days) after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), or at such other
place, date and time as the Company and Parent may agree in writing. The date
on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

 



 

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the Company and Merger Sub
shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Texas a certificate of
merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed in accordance with, and
containing such information as is required by, the relevant provisions of the
TBOC in order to effect the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such
time as the Certificate of Merger has been filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Texas or at such other, later date and time as is agreed
between the Parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the TBOC (such date and time is hereinafter
referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The effects of the Merger shall be as
provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the TBOC.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Company, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company, all as provided under
the TBOC.

 



 

Section 1.5 _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Company_. At the
Effective Time, the Company Charter and Company Bylaws as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time will remain unchanged and will be the
articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company until duly
amended in accordance with the terms thereof and applicable Law.

 



 

Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers_. Subject to applicable Law, the officers
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
directors and officers of the Surviving Company and shall hold office until
their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier
death, resignation or removal.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 1.7 _Parent Board_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall take such actions as are necessary for the Parent Board to
expand the size of the Parent Board and to appoint two persons designated by
the Company (the " _Alpha Director Nominees_ ") to fill such vacancies,
effective as of the Effective Time, to serve until such personÂ’s successor is
elected by the Parent Shareholders or until such personÂ’s death, retirement,
resignation or removal by the Parent Shareholders. Each designee shall be a
current non-employee director of the Company as agreed between Parent and the
Company and shall qualify as an independent director of Parent under the
listing rules of the NYSE.

 



 

(b) Except as provided in _Article II_, the Parties shall ensure that the
remuneration (including any share or stock awards) to be paid to the Alpha
Director Nominees after the Effective Time shall be compatible with ParentÂ’s
directorsÂ’ remuneration policy.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II.**

 



 

 ** _CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_**

 



 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or limited liability company interests of Merger Sub:

 



 

(i) _Limited Liability Company Interest of Merger Sub_. The sole limited
liability company interest of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the
Surviving Company and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Company.

 



 

(ii) _Cancellation of Certain Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned
or held in treasury by the Company and each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned
by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist (the " _Cancelled Shares_ "), and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

 



 

(iii) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to the other provisions of
_Article II_, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to or upon the Effective Time, excluding any Cancelled
Shares (each, a " _Company Share_ "), shall be converted automatically into
and shall thereafter represent the right to receive 1.60 (the " _Exchange
Ratio_ ") Parent Class A Ordinary Shares (the " _Merger Consideration_ "),
credited as fully paid and free from all Liens.

 



 

All Company Shares converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_ shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the
Effective Time, and uncertificated Company Shares represented by book-entry
form

 



      
 

 



 

(" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and each certificate that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, represented any such Company Shares (each, a " _Certificate_
") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and the Fractional Share Cash Amount into which the Company
Shares represented by such Book-Entry Share or Certificate have been converted
pursuant to this _Section 2.1_, as well as any amounts to which holders of
Company Shares become entitled in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_.

 



 

(b) _No Dissenters Â’ Rights_. No dissentersÂ’ or appraisal rights shall be
available with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

(c) _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time (and as permitted by _Article V_), the outstanding Company
Shares or Parent Class A Ordinary Shares shall have been changed into, or
exchanged for, a different number of shares or a different class of shares by
reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization, share split, reverse share split, combination or exchange of
shares, or a stock dividend shall be declared with a record date within such
period, or any similar event shall have occurred, then the Exchange Ratio
shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect
such change; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 2.1(c)_ shall be
construed to permit the Company or Parent to take any action with respect to
its securities that is prohibited by _Section 5.1_ or the other terms of this
Agreement.

 



 

(d) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional Parent Class A Ordinary Shares shall
be issued in connection with the Merger, no certificates or scrip representing
fractional Parent Class A Ordinary Shares shall be delivered upon the
conversion of Company Shares pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a holder of Parent Class A Ordinary Shares.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Company
Shares converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled
to receive a fraction of a Parent Class A Ordinary Share (after aggregating
all shares represented by the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by
such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof and upon surrender thereof, cash
(without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying (i) the Parent
Closing Price by (ii) the fraction of a Parent Class A Ordinary Share (after
taking into account all Company Shares held by such holder at the Effective
Time and rounded to the nearest one thousandth when expressed in decimal form)
to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (the " _Fractional Share Cash
Amount_ "). No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or
any other rights in respect of any fractional Parent Class A Ordinary Shares.

 



 

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a bank
or trust company that is reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as
exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger
Consideration and shall enter into an agreement relating to the Exchange
AgentÂ’s responsibilities under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Fund_. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) allot to each
holder of record of Company Shares such whole number of Parent Class A
Ordinary Shares as such holder is entitled to receive under _Section
2.1(a)(iii)_, which allotment shall be conditional

 



      
 

 



 

only upon (and such Parent Class A Ordinary Shares shall be issuable upon)
compliance with _Section 2.2(d)_, and (ii) make available to the Exchange
Agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Fractional Share Cash Amounts
payable (such Parent Class A Ordinary Shares as are allotted to the holders of
record of Company Shares, together with any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto, and the cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Fractional Share
Cash Amount, the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 



 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event within five business days of the Closing Date,
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of
Company Shares (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass
(as applicable), only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent
and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the
Company may reasonably agree upon prior to the Effective Time) (the " _Letter
of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (as applicable) in exchange for the Merger
Consideration, any Fractional Share Cash Amount and any amounts to which such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with _Section
2.2(e)_.

 



 

(d) _Surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares_. Upon surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent, if applicable,
together with a Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
customarily be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of the shares represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Agreement, together with
any Fractional Share Cash Amount and amounts to which such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer or stock records of the Company, any Parent Class A
Ordinary Shares to be issued upon due surrender of the Certificate or Book-
Entry Share formerly representing such shares of Company Common Stock may be
issued to a transferee if such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer or
other similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive, upon such surrender, the Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect of the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
pursuant to this Agreement, together with any Fractional Share Cash Amount and
any amounts to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in
accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_.

 



 

(e) _Treatment of Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions, if
any, with a record date after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Class
A Ordinary Shares (or amounts in respect thereof), shall be paid to the holder
of any unsurrendered Company Share to be converted into Parent Class A
Ordinary Shares pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ until such holder shall
surrender such share in accordance with this _Section 2.2_. After the
surrender in accordance with this _Section 2.2_ of a Company Share to be
converted into Parent Class A Ordinary Shares pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)(iii)_, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive (in addition to
the Merger Consideration and any Fractional Share Cash Amount) an amount equal
to any such

 



      
 

 



 

dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which had been
paid upon a Parent Class A Ordinary Share prior to such time (or had been
declared prior to such time but are unpaid at such time) multiplied by the
number of Parent Class A Ordinary Shares being issued to such holder.

 



 

(f) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration delivered in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_
upon conversion of any Company Shares, together with the Fractional Share Cash
Amount and any amounts to which such Company Shares become entitled in
accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_, shall be deemed to have been delivered and
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares.
From and after the Effective Time, (i) all holders of Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights as shareholders of the Company
other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which the shares
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been converted
pursuant to this Agreement upon the surrender of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share in accordance with _Section 2.2(d)_ (together with any Fractional
Share Cash Amount and any amounts to which such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares become entitled in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_), without
interest, and (ii) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
with respect to all Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Company of Company Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing Company
Shares are presented to the Surviving Company, Parent or the Exchange Agent
for any reason, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

 



 

(g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to
holders of Certificates or Book- Entry Shares pursuant to this _Article II_,
and following any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly
provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time in the amount of such
losses, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund.
Any interest or other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent, upon demand.

 



 

(h) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that
remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for 180 days after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares who has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Company (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws), as general creditors thereof, for
satisfaction of its claim for Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Cash
Amount and any dividends and distributions which such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to this _Article II_ without any interest thereon.

 



 

(i) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any portion of the Exchange
Fund or the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, any portion of the Merger

 



      
 

 



 

Consideration or any cash to be paid in accordance with this _Article II_
that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares as of the second anniversary of the Effective Time (or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which the Merger Consideration or such cash
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity),
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.

 



 

(j) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Company, Parent, Merger Sub
and the Exchange Agent, and their respective affiliates (without duplication),
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax
authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry
Share in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

(k) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or
the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as
Parent or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Company with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or, if
subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject to _Section
2.2(h)_, Parent) shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration and any dividends and distributions
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Stock Awards_.

Company restricted stock units other than any Company restricted stock units
that are required to be settled in cash (" _Company RSUs_ ") that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, in
accordance with the terms of such awards, become fully vested as of the
Effective Time, with such awards that are subject to performance-based vesting
terms or conditions becoming earned and vested at the target level or such
higher level as determined by the compensation committee of the Company Board
in its sole discretion (but not to exceed 200% of the target level). As soon
as practicable after the Effective Time, such Company RSUs will be settled
through the issuance to the holders thereof of Parent Class A Ordinary Shares
in an amount equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock originally
subject to such award of Company RSUs, multiplied by the Exchange Ratio
(rounded down to the nearest whole share), and otherwise in accordance with
the terms of such awards and subject to the holderÂ’s obligations to satisfy
any tax withholding obligations in connection with the settlement of such
awards. Each award of Company restricted stock units that is required to be
settled in cash shall be treated in accordance with the terms of such award.

 



 

(b) _Company Stock Options_ _._ Each award of stock options that has been
granted under the Company Stock Plans (each, an " _Existing Option_ ") and
that remains outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically

 



      
 

 



 

and without any further action being required, become fully vested and
exercisable and converted into a stock option relating to Parent Class A
Ordinary Shares, on the same terms and conditions (including expiration terms)
as were applicable to such Existing Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time (each, a " _Converted Option_ "), except that (A) the number of Parent
Class A Ordinary Shares subject to such Converted Option shall be determined
by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the
corresponding Existing Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Exchange Ratio, and then rounded down to the nearest whole share, and (B) the
exercise price per share of the Converted Option shall equal the per share
exercise or strike price of the Existing Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole
cent.

 



 

(c) _Company Actions_. The Company shall take, or procure the taking of, all
action necessary, as applicable, to provide for the treatment of the Company
RSUs and Existing Options (collectively, the " _Company Stock Awards_ ") as
set forth in the foregoing provisions of this _Section 2.3_.

 



 

(d) _Parent Actions_. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume all of the
Company Stock Plans, including (i) all of the obligations of the Company with
respect to the Company Stock Awards and (ii) with respect to any amount of
shares (as adjusted pursuant to the Exchange Ratio) that remain (or may again
become) available for future issuance thereunder (" _Remaining Stock Plan
Shares_ "), subject to any limitations under applicable Law or any applicable
securities exchange listing requirements. In addition, Parent shall promptly
file with the SEC one or more appropriate registration statements with respect
to all Converted Options held by individuals who are actively employed or in
service with the Company as of the Effective Time and all Parent Class A
Ordinary Shares that may be issued in connection with the Company RSUs and
Remaining Stock Plan Shares.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Further Assurances_. If at any time before or after the Effective
Time, Parent or the Company reasonably believes or is advised that any further
instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary or
desirable to consummate the Merger or to carry out the purposes and intent of
this Agreement at or after the Effective Time, then Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company and their respective officers and directors shall execute and deliver
all such proper instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances and do all other
things reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate the Merger and to carry
out the intent and purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III.**

 



 

 ** _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_**

 



 

Except as disclosed (a) in the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date
hereof (without giving effect to any amendment to any such Company SEC
Document filed on or after the date hereof and excluding any disclosures set
forth in any such Company SEC Document in any risk factor section, any
disclosure in any section relating to forward-looking statements or any other
statements that are non-specific, predictive or primarily cautionary in nature
other than historical facts included therein), where the relevance of the
information as an exception to (or disclosure for purposes of) a particular
representation is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure, or (b)
in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent immediately
prior

 



      
 

 



 

to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ")
(each section of which qualifies the correspondingly numbered representation,
warranty or covenant if specified therein and such other representations,
warranties or covenants where its relevance as an exception to (or disclosure
for purposes of) such other representation, warranty or covenant is reasonably
apparent), the Company represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

 



 

Section 3.1 _Qualification, Organization, Subsidiaries, Capitalization_.

 



 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated and validly existing under
the Laws of the State of Texas. The Company has the requisite corporate power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry
on its business as presently conducted except for any such failures to have
such power and authority as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have
a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries is a
legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (where such
concept is recognized under applicable Law) under the Laws of its jurisdiction
of organization and has the requisite entity capacity, power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business
as presently conducted, except where the failure to be in good standing or to
have such power or authority would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed, and has all
necessary governmental approvals, to do business and is in good standing as a
foreign entity (where such concept is recognized under applicable Law) in each
jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of the business conducted by it makes such approvals, qualification or
licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly approved,
qualified or licensed and in good standing would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) The Company has made available to Parent, prior to the date hereof, true
and complete copies of the Company Charter, Company Bylaws and the certificate
of incorporation, certificate of limited partnership, certificate of
formation, bylaws, limited partnership agreement, limited liability company
agreement or comparable constituent or organizational documents for each of
its material Subsidiaries as identified in Section 3.1(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (the " _Company Material Subsidiaries_ "), in each case as
amended to and in effect as of the date hereof (collectively, the " _Company
Organizational Documents_ "). The Company is not in violation, and none of the
CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries is in material violation, of any of the Company
Organizational Documents.

 



 

(c) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 180,000,000 shares
of common stock, par value $1.00 per share (the " _Company Common Stock_ "),
and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, no par value (the " _Company
Preferred Stock_ "). As of the close of business on May 26, 2017 (i)
80,519,422 shares of Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding, (ii) no
shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding, (iii) no shares
of Company Common Stock were held in treasury and (iv) up to 760,135 shares of

issued upon the exercise of Existing Options, and (B) 2,988,083 shares of
Company Common Stock were subject to awards of Company RSU Awards, with
performance-based awards reflected in such number at the "target" level. The
Company has made available to Parent a complete and correct list of the
Company Stock Awards

 



      
 

 



 

outstanding as of the close of business on May 26, 2017, which includes, with
respect to each such Company Stock Award, as applicable, the: (x) exercise
price, if applicable, and (y) number of shares of Company Common Stock
underlying such award (which number represents, for outstanding Company RSUs
that were subject to performance-based vesting under the Company Stock Plans,
the "target" level). All outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are, and
all such shares of Company Common Stock that may be issued prior to the
Effective Time, when issued in accordance with the respective terms thereof,
will be, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and
free of preemptive rights. Except as set forth in this _Section 3.1(c)_,
there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, convertible
securities, exchangeable securities or other similar rights, agreements or
commitments to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (A)
obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (1) issue, transfer,
exchange, sell or register for sale any equity interests of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company or securities convertible into or exchangeable for

option, warrant, call, convertible securities or other similar right,
agreement or arrangement, (3) redeem or otherwise acquire any such equity
interests, (4) provide a material amount of funds to, or make any material

from or calculated based on the value of any equity security issued by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) granting any preemptive or
antidilutive or similar rights with respect to any publicly traded security
issued by the Company or its Subsidiaries. With respect to each grant of the
Company Stock Awards, each such grant was made in accordance with the terms of
the applicable Company Stock Plan, the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and
all other applicable Laws, including the rules of the NYSE.

 



 

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding bonds,
debentures, notes or other indebtedness, the holders of which have the right
to vote (or which are convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for
securities having the right to vote) with the Company Shareholders on any
matter.

 



 

(e) There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting
or registration of the equity interests of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(f) Except as set forth on Section 3.1(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
(i) no Subsidiary of the Company owns any equity interests of the Company and
(ii) the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company owns, directly or indirectly,
all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of each Subsidiary of the
Company, free and clear of any preemptive rights and any Liens other than the
Company Permitted Liens, and all of such equity interests are duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable (where such concept is applicable
and recognized under applicable Law) and free of preemptive rights. Except for
equity interests in the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries owns, directly or indirectly, any equity interest in any
person (or any security or other right, agreement or commitment convertible or
exercisable into, or exchangeable for, any equity interest in any person).
Except for any obligations pursuant to this Agreement, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to acquire any equity interest,
security, right, agreement or commitment or to provide funds to or make any
investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any
person. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any

 



       
 

 



 

obligation, other than pursuant to the Company Stock Plans, to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any equity interests of the Company or any such
Subsidiary.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Company Authority Relative to this Agreement; No Violation_.

 



 

(a) The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and each other document to be entered into by the
Company in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (together with
this Agreement, the " _Company Transaction Documents_ ") and, subject to
receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger. The execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and the other Company Transaction Documents
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have
been duly and validly authorized by the Company Board and, except for the
Company Shareholder Approval, no other corporate action on the part of the
Company or vote of the Company Shareholders is necessary to authorize the
execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and the other Company
Transaction Documents and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The Company Board has
unanimously duly and validly adopted resolutions (i) approving this Agreement
and the other Company Transaction Documents, including the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and (ii) declaring that it
is in the best interests of the Company Shareholders that the Company enter
into this Agreement and the other Company Transaction Documents and consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and therein. The Company
Board has further resolved that it will recommend that the Company
Shareholders approve this Agreement (such recommendation referred to herein as
the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "). None of the aforementioned
resolutions, as of the date hereof, have been rescinded, modified or withdrawn
in any way. Each of the Company Transaction Documents has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming each such Company
Transaction Document has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by each
other counterparty thereto, each of the Company Transaction Documents
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforcement may be subject to (A) the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, receivership, administration, arrangement, moratorium or other
Laws affecting or relating to creditorsÂ’ rights generally or (B) the rules
governing the availability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other
equitable remedies and general principles of equity, regardless of whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law (the " _Remedies Exceptions_
").

 



 

(b) Other than in connection with or in compliance with (i) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Texas, (ii)
the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ "), (iii) the U.S.

thereunder (the " _Securities Act_ "), (iv) the rules and regulations of the
New York Stock Exchange (" _NYSE_ "), (v) the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _HSR Act_ "), and any antitrust, competition,
foreign investment or similar Laws outside of the United States and (vi) the
approvals set forth in Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(collectively, the " _Company Approvals_ "), and, subject to the accuracy of
the representations and warranties of Parent and

 



      
 

 



 

Merger Sub in _Section 4.2(b)_, no authorization, consent, Order, license,
permit or approval of, or registration, declaration, notice or filing with, or
notice to, any United States, state of the United States or non-United States
governmental or regulatory agency, commission, court, body, entity or
authority, independent system operator, regional transmission organization,
other market administrator, international treaty or standards organization, or
national, regional or state reliability organization (each, a " _Governmental
Entity_ ") is necessary, under applicable Law, for the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement or the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby, except for such authorizations, consents,
Orders, licenses, permits, approvals or filings that, if not obtained or made,
would not reasonably be expected to materially impede or delay the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement
do not, and (assuming the Company Approvals are obtained) the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the provisions hereof
will not (i) result in any loss, suspension, limitation or impairment of any
right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to own or use any assets
required for the conduct of their business or result in any violation of, or
default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise
to any right of termination, cancellation, first offer, first refusal,
modification or acceleration of any material obligation or to the loss of a
benefit under any loan, guarantee of indebtedness or credit agreement, note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, agreement, contract, instrument, permit,
concession, franchise, right or license binding upon the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or by which or to which any of their respective properties,
rights or assets are bound or subject, or result in the creation of any liens,
claims, mortgages, encumbrances, pledges, security interests, equities or
charges of any kind (each, a " _Lien_ ") (other than the Company Permitted
Liens and any Liens created in connection with any action taken by Parent or
its affiliates), in each case, upon any of the properties or assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any contract to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their respective properties
or assets are bound, (ii) conflict with or result in any violation of any
provision of the Company Organizational Documents or (iii) conflict with or
violate any applicable Laws, except in the case of clauses (i) and (iii) for
such losses, suspensions, limitations, impairments, conflicts, violations,
defaults, terminations, cancellations, accelerations, or Liens as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Reports and Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has filed with or furnished to
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (" _SEC_ ") all reports,
schedules, forms, statements and other documents required to be filed or
furnished by it since September 30, 2015 (all such documents and reports filed
or furnished by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the " _Company SEC
Documents_ "). As of their respective dates of filing or, in the case of the
Company SEC Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant to the
requirements of the Securities Act, their respective dates of effectiveness,
or, if amended prior to the date hereof, as of the date of the last such
amendment, the Company SEC Documents complied, as to form, in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may

 



      
 

 



 

be, and none of the Company SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that
information set forth in the Company SEC Documents as of a later date (but
before the date hereof) will be deemed to modify information as of an earlier
date.

 



 

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules thereto) of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents (i)
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of
the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates
thereof, and the consolidated results of their operations and their
consolidated cash flows for the respective periods then ended (subject, in the
case of the unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and any
other adjustments described therein), (ii) were prepared in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the
case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto), (iii)
have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books and records of
the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries and (iv) comply, as to form, in
all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and with the
rules and regulations of the SEC, the Exchange Act and the Securities Act.

 



 

(c) There are no outstanding or unresolved comments from, or unresolved issues
raised by, the staff of the SEC relating to the Company SEC Documents. The
Company has heretofore made available to Parent true, correct and complete
copies of all written correspondence between the Company and the SEC occurring
since January 1, 2016. None of the Company SEC Documents is, to the knowledge
of the Company, the subject of ongoing SEC review, and no enforcement action
has been initiated against the Company relating to disclosures contained in or
omitted from any Company SEC Document.

 



 

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, nor does it
have any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract (including any contract relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, including any
structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on
the other hand) or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result, purpose or effect of
such contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the
CompanyÂ’s financial statements or other Company SEC Documents.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. The Company has established
and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The CompanyÂ’s disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to the
CompanyÂ’s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make

 



      
 

 



 

the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act. The CompanyÂ’s management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of the CompanyÂ’s internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the year ended September 30, 2016, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective. Based on its most recent evaluation of internal
controls over financial reporting prior to the date hereof, which has been
provided to Parent, management of the Company has disclosed to the CompanyÂ’s
auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect in any material respect the CompanyÂ’s ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the CompanyÂ’s internal control over financial reporting, and each such
deficiency, weakness and fraud so disclosed to auditors, if any, has been
disclosed to Parent prior to the date hereof.

 



 

Section 3.5 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. There are no liabilities or
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether known or
unknown and whether accrued, absolute, determined or contingent, that would be
required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries (including the notes thereto),
except for (i) liabilities or obligations disclosed and provided for in the
most recent balance sheets included in the Company Financial Statements (or in
the notes thereto) filed and publicly available prior to the date of this
Agreement, (ii) liabilities or obligations incurred in accordance with or in
connection with this Agreement, (iii) liabilities or obligations incurred
since September 30, 2016 in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice since the date of such balance sheet, (iv) liabilities or
obligations that have been discharged or paid in full, and (v) liabilities or
obligations that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 3.6 _Compliance with Law; Permits_.

 



 

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with, and are not in
default under or in violation of, any applicable international, federal,
state, local or foreign law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation (including
the non-applicability of the Takeover Code), convention, treaty, judgment,
Order, injunction, decree or agency requirement of any Governmental Entity
(collectively, " _Laws_ " and each, a " _Law_ "), except where such non-
compliance, default or violation would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Since
January 1, 2015, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received
any written notice or, to the CompanyÂ’s knowledge, other communication from
any Governmental Entity regarding any actual or possible violation of, or
failure to comply with, any Law, except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all franchises,
grants, authorizations, licenses, concessions, permits, easements, variances,
exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals, clearances, permissions,
financial assurance instruments, qualifications and registrations and Orders
of all applicable Governmental Entities, and all rights under any Company
Material Contract with all Governmental Entities, and have filed all tariffs,
reports, notices and

 



      
 

 



 

other documents with all Governmental Entities necessary for the Company and

lawsuits or arbitrations which have been asserted or instituted; and (ii) to

give rise to a claim or lawsuit against the Company with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to

Company Benefit Plans, which, in the case of clause (i) and (ii), could
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation or
liability, contingent or otherwise, with respect to any pension or other

transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in
combination with another event (i) entitle any current or former employee,
director, consultant or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
severance pay, unemployment compensation or other compensatory payment, (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of
compensation due any such employee, director, consultant or officer, or (iii)
trigger any funding obligation under any Company Benefit Plan or impose any
restrictions or limitations on the CompanyÂ’s rights to administer, amend or
terminate any Company Benefit Plan.

 



 

(i) The consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with another event,
result in any payment (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property)
to any "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.280G-1) of the Company that could, individually or in
combination with any other such payment, constitute an "excess parachute
payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code).

 



 

(j) No individual is entitled under any Company Benefit Plan or otherwise to
any gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under Section 4999 of the Code.

certificate delivered to the Company by Parent or Merger Sub in accordance
with the terms hereof, in entering into this Agreement, the Company has relied
solely upon its independent investigation and analysis of Parent and ParentÂ’s
Subsidiaries, and the Company acknowledges and agrees that it has not been

 **ARTICLE IV.**

 



 

 ** _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB_**

 



 

Except as disclosed (a) in the Parent SEC Documents filed prior to the date
hereof (without giving effect to any amendment to any such Parent SEC Document
filed on or after the date hereof and excluding any disclosures set forth in
any such Parent SEC Document in any risk factor section, any disclosure in any
section relating to forward-looking statements or any other statements that
are non-specific, predictive or primarily cautionary in nature other than
historical facts included therein), where the relevance of the information as
an exception to (or disclosure for purposes of) a particular representation is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure, or (b) in the disclosure
schedule delivered by Parent to the Company immediately prior to the execution
of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ ") (each section of
which qualifies the correspondingly numbered representation, warranty or
covenant if specified therein and such other representations, warranties or
covenants where its relevance as an exception to (or disclosure for purposes
of) such other representation, warranty or covenant is reasonably apparent),
Parent and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

 



 

Section 4.1 _Qualification, Organization, Subsidiaries, Capitalization_.

 



 

(a) Parent is a public limited company duly organized and validly existing
under the Laws of England and Wales and Merger Sub is a limited liability
company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws
of the State of Texas. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has the requisite entity
capacity, power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted except for any such
failures to have such power and authority as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of ParentÂ’s
Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing (where such concept is recognized under applicable Law) under the
Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has the requisite
capacity, power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted, except where the
failure to be in good standing or to have such power or authority would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified
or licensed, and has all necessary governmental approvals, to do business and
is in good standing as a foreign entity (where such concept is recognized
under applicable Law) in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased
or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
approvals, qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to
be so duly approved, qualified or licensed and in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Parent has made available to the Company, prior to the date hereof, true
and complete copies of ParentÂ’s articles of association and the articles of
association, certificate of incorporation, certificate of limited partnership,
certificate of formation, bylaws, limited partnership agreement, limited
liability company agreement or comparable constituent or organizational
documents for each of its material Subsidiaries as identified in Section
4.1(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule (the " _Parent Material Subsidiaries_
"), in each case as amended to and in effect as of the date hereof
(collectively, the " _Parent Organizational Documents_ "). Parent is not in
violation, and none of ParentÂ’s Subsidiaries is in material violation, of any
of the Parent Organizational Documents.

Shares, when issued in accordance with the respective terms thereof, will be,
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights. Except as set forth in this _Section 4.1(c)_ (and other
than the Parent Ordinary Shares issuable pursuant to the terms of awards
issued under the Parent Stock Plans (collectively, " _Parent Stock Awards_
")), there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
convertible securities, exchangeable securities or other similar rights,
agreements or commitments to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a

exchange, sell or register for sale any equity interests of Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such
equity interests, (2) grant, extend or enter into any such subscription,
option, warrant, call, convertible securities or other similar right,
agreement or arrangement, (3) redeem or otherwise acquire any such equity

from or calculated based on the value of any equity security issued by Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) granting any preemptive or antidilutive or
similar rights with respect to any publicly traded security issued by Parent
or its Subsidiaries. With respect to each grant of Parent Stock Awards, each
such grant was made in accordance with the terms of the applicable Parent
Stock Plan, the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and all other applicable
Laws, including the rules of the NYSE.

 



 

(d) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding bonds,
debentures, notes or other indebtedness, the holders of which have the right
to vote (or which are convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for
securities having the right to vote) with the Parent Shareholders on any
matter.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting or
registration of the equity interests of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(f) No Subsidiary of Parent owns any equity interests of Parent, and Parent or
a Subsidiary of Parent owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and
outstanding equity interests of each Subsidiary of Parent, free and clear of
any preemptive rights and any Liens other than Parent Permitted Liens, and all
of such equity interests are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable (where such concept is applicable and recognized under
applicable Law) and free of preemptive rights. Except for equity interests in
ParentÂ’s Subsidiaries, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries owns,
directly or indirectly, any equity interest in any person (or any security or
other right, agreement or commitment convertible or exercisable into, or
exchangeable for, any equity interest in any person). Except for any
obligations pursuant to this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any obligation to acquire any equity interest, security,
right, agreement or commitment or to provide funds to or make any investment
(in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any person.
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation, other than
pursuant to the Parent Stock Plans, to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any equity interests of Parent or any such Subsidiary.

 



 

(g) Since the date of its formation, Merger Sub has not engaged in any
activities other than in connection with this Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.2 _Company Authority Relative to this Agreement; No Violation_.

 



 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has the requisite corporate and limited
liability company power and authority, as applicable, to execute and deliver
this Agreement and each other document to be entered into by Parent and Merger
Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (together with
this Agreement, the " _Parent Transaction Documents_ ") and, subject to the
passing of the resolution referred to in clause (a) of the definition of
Parent Shareholder Resolutions, to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, including the Merger. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the other Parent Transaction Documents and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been
duly and validly authorized by the Parent Board and, except for the passing of
the resolution referred to in clause (a) of the definition of Parent
Shareholder Resolutions, no other company action on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub or vote of the Parent Shareholders and members of Merger Sub is
necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of
this Agreement and the other Parent Transaction Documents and the consummation
of the Merger. The Parent Board has duly and validly adopted resolutions (i)
approving and declaring advisable this Agreement and the other Parent
Transaction Documents, including the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, (ii) declaring that it is in the best
interests of the Parent Shareholders that Parent enter into this Agreement and
the other Parent Transaction Documents and consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, and (iii) appointing, conditional upon the
closing of the Merger and with effect from the Effective Time, the Alpha
Director Nominees to the Parent Board in accordance with _Section 1.7_(a).
The Parent Board has further resolved that, unless it has made a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section 5.5_, it will
unanimously and unqualifiedly recommend that the

 



      
 

 



 

Parent Shareholders vote in favor of the Parent Shareholder Resolutions at
duly held meetings of such shareholders for such purposes (the " _Parent Board
Recommendation_ "). None of the aforementioned resolutions, as of the date
hereof, have been rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any way. Each of the
Parent Transaction Documents has been duly and validly executed and delivered
by Parent and, assuming each such Parent Transaction Document has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by each other counterparty thereto, each of
the Parent Transaction Documents constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of Parent, enforceable against Parent in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforcement may be subject to (A) the effect of bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, receivership, administration, arrangement,
moratorium or other Laws affecting or relating to creditorsÂ’ rights generally
or (B) the Remedies Exceptions.

 



 

(b) Other than in connection with or in compliance with (i) the Companies Act
(ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of
the State of Texas, (iii) the Exchange Act, (iv) the Securities Act, (v) the
NYSE, (vi) the HSR Act and any antitrust, competition, foreign investment or
similar Laws outside of the United States and (vii) the approvals set forth in
Section 4.2(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the " _Parent
Approvals_ "), and, subject to the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Company in _Section 3.2(b)_, no authorization, consent,
Order, license, permit or approval of, or registration, declaration, notice or
filing with, or notice to, any Governmental Entity is necessary, under
applicable Law, for the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
or the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated
hereby, except for such authorizations, consents, Orders, licenses, permits,
approvals or filings that, if not obtained or made, would not reasonably be
expected to materially impede or delay the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) The execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement do not, and (assuming the Parent Approvals are obtained) the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the
provisions hereof will not (i) result in any loss, suspension, limitation or
impairment of any right of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to own or use any
assets required for the conduct of their business or result in any violation
of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or
give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, first offer, first
refusal, modification or acceleration of any material obligation or to the
loss of a benefit under any loan, guarantee of indebtedness or credit
agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, agreement, contract,
instrument, permit, concession, franchise, right or license binding upon
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or by which or to which any of their
respective properties, rights or assets are bound or subject, or result in the
creation of any Lien (other than Parent Permitted Liens and any Liens created
in connection with any action taken by the Company or its affiliates), in each
case, upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or any contract to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or by which any of their respective properties or assets are bound, (ii)
conflict with or result in any violation of any provision of the Parent
Organizational Documents or (iii) conflict with or violate any applicable
Laws, except in the case of clauses (i) and (iii) for such losses,
suspensions, limitations, impairments, conflicts, violations, defaults,
terminations, cancellations, accelerations, or Liens as would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 4.3 _Reports and Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has filed with or furnished to the SEC
all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents required to be
filed or furnished by it since January 1, 2016 (all such documents and reports
filed or furnished by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, the " _Parent SEC
Documents_ ") and Parent has filed prior to the date hereof all material
returns, particulars, resolutions and documents required to be filed or to be
delivered on behalf of Parent with the Registrar of Companies in England and
Wales. As of their respective dates of filing or, in the case of Parent SEC
Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant to the requirements
of the Securities Act, their respective dates of effectiveness, or, if amended
prior to the date hereof, as of the date of the last such amendment, the
Parent SEC Documents complied, as to form, in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, as the case may be, and none of the Parent SEC Documents contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except
that information set forth in the Parent SEC Documents as of a later date (but
before the date hereof) will be deemed to modify information as of an earlier
date.

 



 

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules thereto) of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents (i) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent
and its consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for
the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and any other adjustments
described therein), (ii) were prepared in conformity with GAAP (except, in the
case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto), (iii)
have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books and records of
Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries and (iv) comply, as to form, in all
material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and with the
rules and regulations of the SEC, the Exchange Act and the Securities Act.

 



 

(c) There are no outstanding or unresolved comments from, or unresolved issues
raised by, the staff of the SEC relating to the Parent SEC Documents. Parent
has heretofore made available to the Company true, correct and complete copies
of all written correspondence between Parent and the SEC occurring since
January 1, 2016. None of the Parent SEC Documents is, to the knowledge of
Parent, the subject of ongoing SEC review, and no enforcement action has been
initiated against Parent relating to disclosures contained in or omitted from
any Parent SEC Document.

 



 

(d) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, nor does it have
any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract (including any contract relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, including any
structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on
the other hand) or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result, purpose or effect of
such contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction

 



       
 

 



 

involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in
ParentÂ’s financial statements or other Parent SEC Documents.

 



 

Section 4.4 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. Parent has established and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. ParentÂ’s disclosure controls and procedures are
reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be
disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to ParentÂ’s management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. ParentÂ’s management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of ParentÂ’s internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the year ended December 31, 2016, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective. Based on its most recent evaluation of internal
controls over financial reporting prior to the date hereof, which has been
provided to the Company, management of Parent has disclosed to ParentÂ’s
auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect in any material respect ParentÂ’s ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
ParentÂ’s internal control over financial reporting, and each such deficiency,
weakness and fraud so disclosed to auditors, if any, has been disclosed to the
Company prior to the date hereof.

 



 

Section 4.5 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. There are no liabilities or
obligations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether known or unknown and
whether accrued, absolute, determined or contingent, that would be required by
GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries (including the notes thereto), except for (i)
liabilities or obligations disclosed and provided for in the most recent
balance sheets included in the Parent Financial Statements (or in the notes
thereto) filed and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement,
(ii) liabilities or obligations incurred in accordance with or in connection
with this Agreement, (iii) liabilities or obligations incurred since December
31, 2016 in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since the date of such balance sheet, (iv) liabilities or obligations that
have been discharged or paid in full, and (v) liabilities or obligations that
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

January 1, 2015, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written notice or, to ParentÂ’s knowledge, other communication from any
Governmental Entity regarding any actual or possible violation of, or failure
to comply with, any

Material Contract with all Governmental Entities, and have filed all tariffs,
reports, notices and other documents with all Governmental Entities necessary
for Parent and its Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their properties and
assets and to carry on their businesses as they are now being conducted (the "
_Parent Permits_ " and, together with the Company Permits, the " _Permits_ "),
except where the failure to have or to have filed such Parent Permits would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. All Parent Permits are valid and in full force and
effect and are not subject to any administrative or judicial proceeding that
could result in modification, termination or revocation thereof, except where
the failure to be in full force and effect or any modification, termination or
revocation thereof would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent and each of its
Subsidiaries is in compliance with the terms and requirements of all material
Parent Permits, except where the failure to be in compliance would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

or judicial) pending, alleging non-compliance with or other liability under
any Environmental Law, (ii) Parent and its Subsidiaries are, and except for

Subsidiaries of all Permits required under applicable Environmental Laws to
conduct their respective business and operations, and compliance with the
terms and conditions thereof), (iii) none of Parent and its Subsidiaries is

law).

claim or lawsuit against Parent with respect to any Parent Benefit Plan, any
fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the Parent Benefits Plans

which, in the case of clause (i) and (ii), could reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(e) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation or

to severance pay, unemployment compensation or other compensatory payment,
(ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of
compensation due any such employee, director, consultant or officer, or (iii)

(k) Parent and its Subsidiaries have, in relation to the Parent Benefit Plans,
at all times complied with all applicable Laws, regulations and requirements

(2) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other person any non-public
information in connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or
facilitating, a Takeover Proposal (other than, solely in response to an
unsolicited inquiry, to refer the inquiring person to this _Section 5.4_ and
to limit its conversation or other communication exclusively to such
referral), or (3) approve, recommend or enter into, or propose to approve,
recommend or enter into, any letter of intent or similar document, agreement,
commitment or agreement in principle (whether written or oral, binding or
nonbinding) with respect to a Takeover Proposal (other than (x) an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with _Section 5.4(b)_ or (y) in
accordance with _Section 7.1(j)_). Except to the extent

 



       
 

 



 

necessary to take any actions that the Company or any third party would
otherwise be permitted to take pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ _ _ (and in
such case only in accordance with the terms hereof), (A) the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not release any third party from, or waive, amend or modify
any provision of, or grant permission under, (x) any standstill provision in
any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
(y) any confidentiality provision in any agreement to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party other than, with respect to this clause (y),
any confidentiality provision, the waiver, amendment, modification or
permission of which does not, and would not be reasonably likely to,

Subsidiaries to, enforce such confidentiality and standstill provisions of any

if at any time from and after the date of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of its or their Representatives, directly or indirectly
receives a bona fide, unsolicited written Takeover Proposal from any person
that did not result from the CompanyÂ’s, its affiliatesÂ’ or the CompanyÂ’s or
its affiliatesÂ’ RepresentativesÂ’ failure to comply with the provisions of
_Section 5.4(a)_ and if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Company Superior Proposal, then the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, and
any of its or their Representatives, may, directly or indirectly, (i) furnish,
pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information (including
non-public information) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries, and
afford access to the business, properties, assets, employees, officers,
contracts, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to the
person who has made such Takeover Proposal and its Representatives and
potential sources of financing; _provided_ that the Company shall
substantially concurrently with the delivery to such person provide to Parent
any non-public information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that is provided or made available to such person or its Representatives
unless such non-public information has been previously provided or made
available to Parent and (ii) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions
or negotiations with the person making such Takeover Proposal and its
Representatives and potential sources of financing regarding such Takeover
Proposal. As used this _Section 5.4_, " _Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement_ " means any customary confidentiality agreement that contains
provisions that are no less restrictive to the third party executing such
agreement in the aggregate than those applicable to Parent that are contained
in the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that such confidentiality
agreement shall not prohibit compliance by the Company with any of the
provisions of this _Section 5.4_.

receipt) notify, orally and in writing, Parent after receipt by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their Representatives, of any
Takeover Proposal, including of the identity of the person making the Takeover
Proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof, and shall promptly
(and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt) provide unredacted copies
to Parent of any written proposals, indications of interest, and/or draft
agreements received from the person making the Takeover Proposal (or its
Representatives) relating to such Takeover Proposal. The

 



      
 

 



 

Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, as to the
status of (including changes to any material terms of, and any other material
developments with respect to) such Takeover Proposal (including by promptly
(and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt) providing to Parent
unredacted copies of any additional or revised written proposals, indications
of interest, and/or draft agreements relating to such Takeover Proposal). The
Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement
with any person subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the
Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with this
_Section 5.4_.

 



 

(d) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.4(d)_ or _Section
5.4(e)_, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A)

authorize or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or
modify, in a manner adverse to Parent the Company Board Recommendation, (C)
take any formal action or make any recommendation or public statement in
connection with a tender offer or exchange offer (other than a recommendation
against such offer or a customary "stop, look and listen" communication of the
type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) (it being
understood that the Company Board may refrain from taking a position with
respect to such tender offer or exchange offer until the close of business as
of the tenth business day after the commencement of such tender offer or
exchange offer pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act without such
action being considered a Company Adverse Recommendation Change), or (D)
adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or
recommend, to the Company Shareholders a Takeover Proposal (any action
described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "), or (ii) authorize, cause or permit the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, agreement,
commitment or agreement in principle with respect to any Takeover Proposal
(other than (x) an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in

7.1(j)_). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, at any time prior to receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval,
the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (i) in
response to a Company Intervening Event, or (ii) after receipt of a bona fide,
unsolicited Takeover Proposal, which the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside
legal counsel is a Company Superior Proposal, if and only if, (x) in the case
of clause (ii), such Takeover Proposal was received after the date hereof and
did not result from a breach of the provisions of this _Section 5.4_ and (y)
in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), the Company Board has determined in good
faith after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s outside financial advisors and
outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable
Law and the Company complies with _Section 5.4(e)_.

 



 

(e) Prior to making such Company Adverse Recommendation Change (i) in response
to a Company Intervening Event, the Company shall provide Parent with at least
four business daysÂ’ prior written notice of its intention to effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change and specifying, in reasonable detail, the
reasons therefor (including the material facts and circumstances related to
the applicable Company Intervening Event), and during such four business day
period, the Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to
negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice period, to the extent
Parent wishes to negotiate, to

 



      
 

 



 

enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement in a manner
that would obviate the need to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
or (ii) in connection with a Company Superior Proposal, (1) the Company shall
provide Parent with at least four business daysÂ’ prior written notice of its
intention to take such action (which notice shall specify the material terms
and conditions of any such Company Superior Proposal) and specifying, in
reasonable detail, the material terms and conditions of the Takeover Proposal,
(2) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to
negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice period, to the extent
Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms
of this Agreement such that it would cause such Company Superior Proposal to
no longer constitute a Company Superior Proposal, (3) following the end of
such notice period, the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any
revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and
shall have determined, after consultation with its outside financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, that the Company Superior Proposal would
nevertheless continue to constitute a Company Superior Proposal if the
revisions proposed by Parent were to be given effect, and (4) in the event of
any change to any of the material financial terms (including the form, amount
and timing of payment of consideration) or any other material terms of such
Company Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to
Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in clause (1) of
this _Section 5.4(e)_ and a new notice period under clause (1) of this
_Section 5.4(e)_ shall commence (except that the four business day notice
period referred to in clause (1) of this _Section 5.4(e)_ shall instead be
equal to the longer of (x) two business days and (y) the period remaining
under the notice period under clause (1) of this _Section 5.4(e)_ immediately
prior to the delivery of such additional notice under this clause (4)) during
which time the Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of
this _Section 5.4(e)_ anew with respect to such additional notice, including
clauses (1) through (4) above of this _Section 5.4(e)_.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4_ shall prohibit the Company or
the Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Company Shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or from making any "stop, look and listen" communication or any
other similar disclosure to the Company Shareholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act if, in the determination in good faith of the Company
Board, after consultation with outside counsel, the failure so to disclose
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or
obligations under applicable federal securities Law of the Company Board;
_provided_ that this _Section 5.4(f)_ shall not permit the Company Board to
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change except to the extent permitted by
this _Section 5.4_.

 



 

Section 5.5 _No Solicitation by Parent_.

 



 

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.5_, Parent shall, shall
cause each of its affiliates and its and their respective officers, directors
and employees to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and
their other Representatives to: (i) immediately cease any solicitation,
knowing encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any persons that may
be ongoing with respect to or may reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover
Proposal, and promptly instruct (to the extent it has contractual authority to
do so and has not already done so prior to the date of this Agreement) or
otherwise request, any person that has executed a confidentiality or non-
disclosure agreement within the 24-month period prior to the date of this
Agreement in connection with any actual or potential Takeover Proposal to
return or destroy all

 



      
 

 



 

such information or documents or material incorporating confidential
information in the possession of such person or its Representatives, and (ii)
until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article VII_, not, directly or indirectly, (1) solicit,
initiate or knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing non-public information) any inquiries regarding, or the making of
any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, a Takeover Proposal, (2) engage in, continue or otherwise participate
in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other person
any non-public information in connection with or for the purpose of
encouraging or facilitating, a Takeover Proposal (other than, solely in
response to an unsolicited inquiry, to refer the inquiring person to this
_Section 5.5_ and to limit its conversation or other communication
exclusively to such referral), or (3) approve, recommend or enter into, or
propose to approve, recommend or enter into, any letter of intent or similar
document, agreement, commitment or agreement in principle (whether written or
oral, binding or nonbinding) with respect to a Takeover Proposal (other than
(x) an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with _Section
5.5(b)_ or (y) in accordance with _Section 7.1(k)_). Except to the extent
necessary to take any actions that Parent or any third party would otherwise
be permitted to take pursuant to this _Section 5.5_ _ _ (and in such case
only in accordance with the terms hereof), (A) Parent and its Subsidiaries
shall not release any third party from, or waive, amend or modify any
provision of, or grant permission under, (x) any standstill provision in any
agreement to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or (y) any
confidentiality provision in any agreement to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party other than, with respect to this clause (y), any
confidentiality provision, the waiver, amendment, modification or permission
thereof does not, and would not be reasonably likely to, facilitate, encourage
or relate in any way to a Takeover Proposal or a potential the Takeover
Proposal and (B) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enforce
such confidentiality and standstill provisions of any such agreement, and
Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, immediately take all steps
within their power necessary to terminate any waiver that may have been
heretofore granted, to any person other than the Company or any of the
CompanyÂ’s affiliates, under any such provisions.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.5(a)_,
if at any time from and after the date of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the Parent Shareholder Approval, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
or any of its or their Representatives, directly or indirectly receives a bona
fide, unsolicited written Takeover Proposal from any person that did not
result from ParentÂ’s, its affiliatesÂ’ or ParentÂ’s or its affiliatesÂ’
RepresentativesÂ’ failure to comply with the provisions of _Section 5.5(a)_
and if the Parent Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover
Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Parent Superior
Proposal, then Parent and any of its Subsidiaries, and any of its or their
Representatives, may, directly or indirectly, (i) furnish, pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information (including non-public
information) with respect to Parent and its Subsidiaries, and afford access to
the business, properties, assets, employees, officers, contracts, books and
records of Parent and its Subsidiaries, to the person who has made such
Takeover Proposal and its Representatives and potential sources of financing;
_provided_ that Parent shall substantially concurrently with the delivery to
such person provide to the Company any non-public information concerning
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided or made available to such
person or its Representatives unless such non-public information has been
previously provided or made available to the Company and (ii) engage in or
otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making
such Takeover

 



      
 

 



 

Proposal and its Representatives and potential sources of financing regarding
such Takeover Proposal. As used in this _Section 5.5_, " _Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement_ " means any customary confidentiality agreement
that contains provisions that are no less restrictive to the third party
executing such agreement in the aggregate than those applicable to the Company
that are contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that such
confidentiality agreement shall not prohibit compliance by Parent with any of
the provisions of this _Section 5.5_.

 



 

(c) Parent shall promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt)
notify, orally and in writing, the Company after receipt by Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their Representatives, of any Takeover
Proposal, including of the identity of the person making the Takeover Proposal
and the material terms and conditions thereof, and shall promptly (and in no
event later than 24 hours after receipt) provide unredacted copies to the
Company of any written proposals, indications of interest, and/or draft
agreements received from the person making the Takeover Proposal (or its
Representatives) relating to such Takeover Proposal. Parent shall keep the
Company reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, as to the status of (including
changes to any material terms of, and any other material developments with
respect to) such Takeover Proposal (including by promptly (and in no event
later than 24 hours after receipt) providing to the Company unredacted copies
of any additional or revised written proposals, indications of interest,
and/or draft agreements relating to such Takeover Proposal). Parent agrees
that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement with any person
subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits Parent from providing
any information to the Company in accordance with this _Section 5.5_.

 



 

(d) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.5(d)_ or _Section
5.5(e)_, neither the Parent Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) fail
to include the Parent Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
(B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or authorize or publicly
propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse
to the Company the Parent Board Recommendation, (C) take any formal action or
make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender offer
or exchange offer (other than a recommendation against such offer or a
customary "stop, look and listen" communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) (it being understood that the Parent
Board may refrain from taking a position with respect to such tender offer or
exchange offer until the close of business as of the tenth business day after
the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act without such action being considered a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change), or (D) adopt, approve or recommend, or
publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend, to the Parent Shareholders a
Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to
as a " _Parent Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or (ii) authorize, cause or
permit Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent,
agreement, commitment or agreement in principle with respect to any Takeover
Proposal (other than (x) an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into
in accordance with _Section 5.5(b)_ or (y) in accordance with _Section
7.1(k)_). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, at any time prior to receipt of the Parent Shareholder Approval,
the Parent Board may make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change (i) in
response to a Parent Intervening Event, or (ii) after receipt of a bona fide,
unsolicited Takeover Proposal, which the Parent Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside
legal counsel is a Parent Superior Proposal, if and only if, (x) in the case
of clause (ii), such Takeover Proposal was received after

 



      
 

 



 

the date hereof and did not result from a breach of the provisions of this
_Section 5.5_ and (y) in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), the Parent Board
has determined in good faith after consultation with ParentÂ’s outside
financial advisors and outside legal counsel that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Parent Board
under applicable Law and Parent complies with _Section 5.5(e)_.

 



 

(e) Prior to making such Parent Adverse Recommendation Change (i) in response
to a Parent Intervening Event, Parent shall provide the Company with at least
four business daysÂ’ prior written notice of its intention to effect a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change and specifying, in reasonable detail, the
reasons therefor (including the material facts and circumstances related to
the applicable Parent Intervening Event), and during such four business day
period, Parent has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to
negotiate, in good faith with the Company during such notice period, to the
extent the Company wishes to negotiate, to enable the Company to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement in a manner that would obviate the
need to effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii) in connection
with a Parent Superior Proposal, (1) Parent shall provide the Company with at
least four business daysÂ’ prior written notice of its intention to take such
action (which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of any
such Parent Superior Proposal) and specifying, in reasonable detail, the
material terms and conditions of the Takeover Proposal, (2) Parent has
negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith
with the Company during such notice period, to the extent the Company wishes
to negotiate, to enable the Company to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement such that it would cause such Parent Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a Parent Superior Proposal, (3) following the end of such notice
period, the Parent Board shall have considered in good faith any revisions to
the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by the Company, and shall have
determined, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that the Parent Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue
to constitute a Parent Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed by the
Company were to be given effect, and (4) in the event of any change to any of
the material financial terms (including the form, amount and timing of payment
of consideration) or any other material terms of such Parent Superior
Proposal, Parent shall, in each case, have delivered to the Company an
additional notice consistent with that described in clause (1) of this
_Section 5.5(e)_ and a new notice period under clause (1) of this _Section
5.5(e)_ shall commence (except that the four business day notice period
referred to in clause (1) of this _Section 5.5(e)_ shall instead be equal to
the longer of (x) two business days and (y) the period remaining under the
notice period under clause (1) of this _Section 5.5(e)_ immediately prior to
the delivery of such additional notice under this clause (4)) during which
time Parent shall be required to comply with the requirements of this
_Section 5.5(e)_ anew with respect to such additional notice, including
clauses (1) through (4) above of this _Section 5.5(e)_.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.5_ shall prohibit Parent or the
Parent Board from taking and disclosing to the Parent Shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act
or from making any "stop, look and listen" communication or any other similar
disclosure to the Parent Shareholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act if, in the determination in good faith of the Parent Board, after
consultation with outside counsel, the failure so to disclose would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or obligations
under applicable federal securities Law of the Parent Board; _provided_ that
this _Section 5.5(f)_ shall not permit the Parent Board to make a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change except to the extent permitted by this _Section
5.5_.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.6 _Filings; Other Actions_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Form
S-4, which will include the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Each of Parent and the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Form S-4
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably
practicable after such filing and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as
necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. Each of Parent and the Company will cause the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the Parent Shareholders and Company
Shareholders, as applicable, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Form
S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall also take any
action required to be taken under any applicable state or provincial
securities laws in connection with the issuance and reservation of the Parent
Class A Ordinary Shares in the Merger, and the Company shall furnish all
information concerning the Company and the holders of Company Common Stock, or
holders of a beneficial interest therein, as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to,
the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be made by Parent or the
Company, as applicable, without the otherÂ’s prior consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and without providing the other
Party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. Parent or the
Company, as applicable, will advise the other promptly after it receives oral
or written notice of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective or any
supplement or amendment thereto has been filed, the issuance of any stop
order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Class A Ordinary
Shares for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any oral or written
request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form
S-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for
additional information, and will promptly provide the other with copies of any
written communication from the SEC or any state securities commission. If at
any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to Parent or the
Company, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors, is
discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so
that any of such documents would not include a misstatement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties
hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law,
disseminated to the Parent Shareholders and Company Shareholders, as
applicable.

 



 

(b) The Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in accordance with
applicable Law and the Company Charter and Company Bylaws, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold an annual or special meeting of its shareholders
(the " _Company Shareholder Meeting_ ") as soon as reasonably practicable
following execution of this Agreement for the purpose of approving by
requisite vote this Agreement. The Company Board shall, subject to _Section
5.4(d)_, include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company
Shareholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section
7.1_ and subject to compliance with _Section 5.4_, the Company, regardless of
whether the Company Board has approved, endorsed or recommended a Takeover
Proposal or has withdrawn, modified or amended the Company Board
Recommendation, will submit this Agreement for approval by

 



      
 

 



 

the Company Shareholders at such meeting.

 



 

(c) Parent, acting through the Parent Board, shall, in accordance with
applicable Law and ParentÂ’s articles of association, duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a general meeting of its shareholders (the " _Parent
Shareholder Meeting_ ") as soon as reasonably practicable following execution
of this Agreement for the purpose of approving by requisite vote the Parent
Shareholder Resolutions. The Parent Board shall, subject to _Section 5.5(d)_,
include the Parent Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain approval of the Parent Shareholder
Resolutions. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section 7.1_ and
subject to compliance with _Section 5.5_, Parent, regardless of whether the
Parent Board has approved, endorsed or recommended a Takeover Proposal or has
withdrawn, modified or amended the Parent Board Recommendation, will submit
the Parent Shareholder Resolutions for approval by the Parent Shareholders at
such meeting.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Parent or the Company, after consultation with the other Party hereto and
subject to such other PartyÂ’s approval (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), may adjourn or postpone the Parent
Shareholder Meeting or the Company Shareholder Meeting, as applicable, to the
extent it believes in good faith that such adjournment or postponement is
necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is provided to its shareholders or, if as of the time for
which the Parent Shareholder Meeting or the Company Shareholder Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus) there
are insufficient Parent Class A Ordinary Shares or shares of Company Common
Stock, as applicable, represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute
a quorum necessary to conduct business at such meeting.

 



 

(e) Parent and the Company will use their respective reasonable best efforts
to hold the Parent Shareholder Meeting and the Company Shareholder Meeting
simultaneously and as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement and shall cooperate in good faith to coordinate the timing of the
Parent Shareholder Meeting and the Company Shareholder Meeting with the
PartiesÂ’ anticipated Closing Date.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Efforts; Regulatory Approvals_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under any applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger,
including (i) the preparation and filing of all forms, registrations and
notices required to be filed to consummate the Merger and the provision of
information in connection therewith, (ii) the satisfaction of the conditions
to consummating the Merger, (iii) taking all reasonable actions necessary to
obtain (and cooperating with each other in obtaining) any consent,
authorization, Order or approval of, or any exemption by, any third party,
including any Governmental Entity (which actions shall include furnishing all
information and documentary material required under the HSR Act or other
antitrust, competition, foreign investment or similar Laws outside of the
United States) required to be obtained or made by the Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the

 



      
 

 



 

Merger or the taking of any action contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv)
the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the Merger and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.
Additionally, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to fulfill all conditions precedent to the Merger and shall not take
any action after the date of this Agreement that would reasonably be expected
to materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any consent,
authorization, Order or approval of, or any exemption by, any such
Governmental Entity necessary to be obtained prior to Closing. To the extent
that transfers of any Permits issued by any Governmental Entity are required
as a result of the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the
Merger (including Permits required pursuant to Environmental Laws), the
Parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to effect such transfers.

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the other covenants contained in
this _Section 5.7_, each of the Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, any and all steps
and to make, or cause to be made any and all undertakings necessary to resolve
objections, if any, that any Relevant Authority may assert under the HSR Act
and any other federal, state or foreign law designed to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions for the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of
trade or reduction of competition (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ ") or that
regulates foreign investment (" _Foreign Investment Laws_ "), with respect to
this Agreement, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
Antitrust Law or Foreign Investment Laws that may be asserted by any Relevant
Authority with respect to this Agreement, in each case, so as to enable the
Closing to occur as promptly as practicable including (i) proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any businesses,
assets, equity interests, product lines or properties of the Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company (or any of their respective subsidiaries) or any equity
interest in any joint venture held by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company (or
any of their respective subsidiaries), (ii) creating, terminating, or
divesting relationships, ventures, contractual rights or obligations of the
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company or their respective Subsidiaries and (iii)
otherwise taking or committing to take any action that would limit the
ParentÂ’s or the Merger SubÂ’s freedom of action with respect to, or its ability
to retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses, assets, equity
interests, product lines or properties of the Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company (including any of their respective Subsidiaries) or any equity
interest in any joint venture held by the Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
(or any of their respective Subsidiaries), in each case as may be required in
order to obtain all approvals and consents required directly or indirectly
under any Antitrust Law or Foreign Investment Laws, or to avoid the
commencement of any action to prohibit the Closing of the Agreement under any
Antitrust Law or Foreign Investment Laws, or to avoid the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or
other order in any action or proceeding seeking to prohibit the Closing of the
Agreement or delay the Closing of the Agreement beyond the End Date,
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be required to take any actions
under this _Section 5.7_ that would reasonably be expected to, individually
or in the aggregate, result in a one-year loss of revenues determined in
accordance with GAAP (as measured by the four full fiscal quarters for which
financial statements are available immediately preceding the relevant
measurement period) of more than $175.0 million on a combined basis for both
the Company and its Subsidiaries and Parent and its Subsidiaries. Nothing in
this _Section 5.7(b)_ shall require by the Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
to take or agree to take any action with respect

 



      
 

 



 

to its business or operations unless the effectiveness of such agreement or
action is conditioned upon the Closing.

 



 

(c) The Company and Parent shall each keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to the completion of the Merger and work cooperatively in
connection with obtaining all required consents, authorizations, Orders or
approvals of, or any exemptions by, any Governmental Entity undertaken
pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 5.7_. In that regard, prior to
the Closing, each Party shall promptly consult with one another with respect
to, and provide any necessary information with respect to (and, in the case of
correspondence, provide the other Parties (or their counsel) copies of), all
filings made by such Party with any Governmental Entity or any other
information supplied by such Party to, or correspondence with, a Governmental
Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Merger. Each Party to this
Agreement shall promptly inform the other Parties to this Agreement, and if in
writing, furnish the other Party (or their counsel) with copies of (or, in the
case of oral communications, advise the other Party (or their counsel) orally
of) any communication from any Governmental Entity regarding the Merger, and
permit the other Party to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good
faith the views of the other Party in connection with, any proposed
communication with any such Governmental Entity. If any Party or any
Representative of such Party receives a request for additional information or
documentary material, or other request for information, from any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Merger, then such Party will use reasonable best
efforts to make, or cause to be made, promptly and after consultation with the
other Party, an appropriate response in substantial compliance with such
request. Neither Party shall participate in any meeting or teleconference with
any Governmental Entity where material issues would likely be discussed in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger unless, so long as reasonably
practicable, it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the opportunity
to attend and participate thereat. Each Party shall furnish the other Party
with copies of all correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda
setting forth the substance thereof) between it and any such Governmental
Entity with respect to this Agreement and the Merger, and furnish the other
Party with such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other
Party may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of necessary
filings or submissions of information to any such Governmental Entity;
_provided_ , _however_ , that materials provided pursuant to this _Section
5.7_ may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the
Company and the Merger or other confidential information, (ii) as necessary to
comply with contractual arrangements, and (iii) as necessary to address
reasonable privilege concerns.

 



 

(d) The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) file, as
promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than ten (10) business days
after the date of this Agreement, all notifications required under the HSR
Act; and (ii) make any other required or advisable filings (as determined by
Parent) under any antitrust, competition, foreign investment or similar Laws
as promptly as practicable. In the event that the Parties receive a request
for information or documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act or other
request for information from any Governmental Entity, the Parties will use
their respective reasonable best efforts to respond to such request as
promptly as practicable, and counsel for both Parties will closely cooperate
during the entirety of any such response process.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Parties
agree

 



       
 

 



 

that it is ParentÂ’s sole right to control, direct and devise the strategy for
all filings, notifications, submissions, communications and other dealings and
decision-making in connection with the HSR Act and other antitrust,
competition, foreign investment and similar Laws. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this _Section 5.7(e)_ shall limit ParentÂ’s obligations
under _Section 5.7(a)_, _(b)_ , _(c)_ and _(d)_.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Takeover Statutes_. If any "moratorium," "control share
acquisition," "fair price," "supermajority," "affiliate transactions," or
"business combination statute or regulation" or other similar state or other
anti-takeover Laws and regulations may become, or may purport to be,
applicable to the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby, each
of the Company and Parent shall grant such approvals and take such actions as
are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of
such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to develop a joint communications plan and

Section 5.10 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Parent agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, existing as at
the date of this Agreement in favor of the current or former directors,
officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or its Subsidiaries
as provided in their respective certificate of formation or bylaws or other
organizational documents or in any agreement shall survive the Merger and
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a
period of six years from the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to,
maintain in effect any and all exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses provisions of the certificate of formation, bylaws or similar
organizational documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries in effect as at
the date of this Agreement or in any indemnification agreements of the Company
or its Subsidiaries with any of their respective current or former directors,
officers or employees in effect as at the date of this Agreement, and to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law shall not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify any such provisions or the exculpation, indemnification or
advancement of expenses provisions of the organizational documents of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any individuals who immediately before the Effective Time
were current or former directors, officers or employees

 



      
 

 



 

of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that all
rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses in respect
of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall
continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim.

 



 

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and
advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing) each current and former
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
each person who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other
employee benefit plan or enterprise if such service was at the request or for
the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, together with
such personÂ’s heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ "),
in each case against any costs or expenses (including advancing attorneysÂ’
fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit,
proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified
Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking consistent with
applicable Law and the Company Organizational Documents to repay such amounts
if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising out of, relating to
or in connection with any action or omission by them in their capacities as
such occurring or alleged to have occurred whether before or after the
Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection with such
Indemnified Party serving as an officer, director, employee or other fiduciary
of any entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the
Company). In the event of any such Action, Parent and the Surviving Company
shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any such Action.

 



 

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Company shall cause to be maintained in effect the coverage provided
by the policies of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance in effect as of the date hereof by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to matters existing or arising on or before the
Effective Time (provided that Parent may substitute these for policies with a
carrier with reasonably comparable credit ratings to the existing carrier of
at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions
that it reasonably considers are no less favorable to the insured or, if
insurance coverage that is no less favorable is unavailable, the best
available coverage); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be
required to pay an annual premium in excess of 300% of the last annual premium
paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverages (the
" _Maximum Amount_ ") required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such
case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such
amount. If the Company or Parent elects, then the Company or Parent, as
applicable, may, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a "tail policy" with
respect to acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to
the Effective Time that were committed or alleged to have been committed by
such Indemnified Parties in their capacity as such; _provided_ that in no
event shall the cost of such policy, if purchased by the Company, exceed six
(6) times the Maximum Amount and, if such a "tail policy" is purchased, Parent
shall have no further obligations under this _Section 5.10(c)_.

 



 

(d) Parent shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, pay
all

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees, that may be
incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided in this _Section 5.10_.

 



 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this _Section 5.10_ shall be
in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified
Party may have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other
organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
Surviving Company, any other indemnification arrangement, the TBOC or
otherwise.

 



 

(f) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Company or any of its successors
or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all its properties and assets
to any person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper
provision to be made so that the successor and assign of Parent or the
Surviving Company assumes the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.10_.

 



 

(g) The obligations of Parent under this _Section 5.10_ shall not be
terminated, amended or modified in any manner so as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party (including their successors, heirs and legal
representatives) to whom this _Section 5.10_ applies without the consent of
such Indemnified Party. It is expressly agreed that, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, (i) the Indemnified
Parties to whom this _Section 5.10_ applies shall be third-party
beneficiaries of this _Section 5.10_, and (ii) this _Section 5.10_ shall
survive consummation of the Merger and shall be enforceable by such
Indemnified Parties and their respective successors, heirs and legal
representatives against Parent and its successors and assigns.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any PartyÂ’s
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the Parties understand and agree
that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or the Company,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other PartyÂ’s
operations prior to the Effective Time and (b) prior to the Effective Time,
each of Parent and the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
operations.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of Parent Ordinary Shares
(including derivative securities with respect to Parent Ordinary Shares)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company or will become subject to such
reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Transaction Litigation_. Each Party shall provide the other
Party prompt written notice of any litigation brought by any shareholder of
that Party against such Party, any of its Subsidiaries and/or any of their
respective directors relating to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Unless, in the case of such litigation with
respect to the Company, the Company Board has made or is considering making a
Company Adverse

 



      
 

 



 

Recommendation Change, the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate (at ParentÂ’s expense) in the defense or settlement of any
shareholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors or executive
officers relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger. The Company agrees that it shall not settle or offer to
settle any litigation commenced prior to or after the date of this Agreement
against the Company or its directors, executive officers or similar persons by
any shareholder of the Company relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of
Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 



 

Section 5.14 _NYSE Listing_. Parent shall use its best efforts to cause the
Parent Class A Ordinary Shares to be issued in the Merger to be approved for
listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Closing Date.

 



 

Section 5.15 _Tax Matters_. The Parties shall (and shall cause their
respective affiliates to) use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that
Section 7874 of the Code, the regulations promulgated thereunder, or official
interpretation thereof as set forth in published guidance by the IRS (the "
_Expatriated Entity Rules_ "), should not apply in such a manner so as to
cause Parent to be treated as a "domestic corporation" for U.S. federal income
Tax purposes as a result of the Merger, including by (i) not taking any action
that such Party knows (or not failing to take any action which failure such
Party knows) is reasonably likely to result in such "domestic corporation"
treatment, and (ii) negotiating in good faith such amendments to this
Agreement as may be reasonably required in order to prevent such "domestic
corporation" treatment (it being understood that no Party will be required to
agree to any such amendment). If any Party is, or should reasonably become,
aware of any fact or circumstance that such Party may reasonably expect would
cause the representations in any of _Section 3.14(d)_ or _Section 4.14(c)_
to be untrue, then such Party shall promptly notify the other Parties. The
Parties agree to execute certificates, at such time or times as may be
reasonably requested by any Party, in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to the requesting Party, containing appropriate representations establishing
that the Expatriated Entity Rules should not apply in such a manner so as to
cause Parent to be treated as a "domestic corporation" for U.S. federal income
Tax purposes as a result of the Merger.

 



 

Section 5.16 _Certificate of Non-USRPHC Status_. The Company shall deliver to
Parent at the Closing a certification by the Company that meets the
requirements of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(c)(3) and Treasury
Regulations Section 1.897-2(h)(1)(i), dated within 30 days prior to the
Closing Date and in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent along
with written authorization for Parent to deliver such certification to the IRS
on behalf of the Company upon Closing.

 



 

Section 5.17 _Consent to Use of Financial Statements; Financing Cooperation_.
The Company hereby consents to ParentÂ’s inclusion of any audited or unaudited
financial statements, including those contained in any Company SEC Documents,
relating to and prepared by the Company reasonably requested by Parent to be
used in any financing or any filings that Parent desires to make with the SEC.
In addition, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts, at ParentÂ’s
sole cost and expense, to obtain customary comfort letters from
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP regarding financial statements of the Company as
reasonably requested by the lead underwriter(s) or initial purchaser(s) in
connection with any registered or private offering or otherwise and to obtain
the consent of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to the

 



      
 

 



 

inclusion of the financial statements referenced above in appropriate filings
with the SEC. Prior to the Closing, the Company will use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide Parent such information regarding the CompanyÂ’s
business, and make available such personnel, as Parent may reasonably request
in order to assist Parent in connection with any financing activities,
including any public offerings to be registered under the Securities Act or
private offerings, if permitted under _Section 5.2(b)_. Parent shall
indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives from and against any and all losses suffered or
incurred by them in connection with (a) any action taken by them at the
request of Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this _Section 5.17_ or in
connection with any registered or private offering of Parent or (b) any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than information provided
by the Company and its Subsidiaries specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference therein).

 



 

Section 5.18 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, Parent and its Subsidiaries will continue the
employment of all of the employees who are employed by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as of the day immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Affected Employees_ ") initially at the same salaries and wages of such
employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. During the period from the
Effective Time to and including the one year anniversary of the Closing Date,
Parent and its Subsidiaries (i) shall provide each Affected Employee with an
annual salary rate or hourly wage rate, as applicable, that is no less
favorable to such Affected Employee than the salary rate or wage rate provided
to such Affected Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii)
shall provide Affected Employees who are so employed by the Company or its
Subsidiaries as of the day immediately prior to the Effective Time, in the
aggregate, with employee compensation and benefits (excluding equity
compensation and long-term incentives) that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may
transition Affected Employees to ParentÂ’s bonus and incentive compensation
plans at any time in ParentÂ’s discretion and, following the end of the fiscal
year or benefit plan year, as applicable, in which the Closing Date occurs,
Parent may transition Affected Employees to other compensation and benefit
plans providing compensation and benefits that are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to those provided to ParentÂ’s other similarly situated
employees. Nothing in this Agreement shall be considered a contract between
Parent and its Subsidiaries and any Affected Employee or consideration for, or
inducement with respect to, any such employeeÂ’s continued employment and,
without limitation, all such employees are and will continue to be considered
to be employees at will pursuant to the applicable employment at will laws or
doctrines, subject to any express written agreement to the contrary with such
employee. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to honor, each change in control or severance agreement
between the Company and its Subsidiaries and any employee thereof and to
perform the obligations of the Company thereunder, and Parent shall provide,
or cause its Subsidiaries to provide, relocation benefits in accordance with
Company policy as in effect on the date of this Agreement to any Affected
Employee who becomes entitled to severance benefits following the Effective
Time pursuant to any Company Benefit Plan.

 



 

(b) With respect to each Affected Employee, Parent shall credit, or cause its
Subsidiaries to credit, the period of employment and service recognized by the
applicable employer immediately prior to the Effective Time (for purposes of
its corresponding plans,

 



      
 

 



 

programs, policies or similar employment-related arrangements) to have been
employment and service with Parent for purposes of determining the Affected
EmployeeÂ’s eligibility to join (subject to satisfaction of all non-service
related eligibility criteria) and vesting (but not benefit accrual for any
purpose other than vacation pay, severance and termination pay and sick leave)
under all employee benefit plans, programs, policies or similar employment
related arrangements of Parent and its Subsidiaries in which the Affected
Employee is eligible to participate; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
credit shall be provided to the extent that it would result in a duplication
of credit or benefits. Parent shall waive, and to the extent necessary to
effect the terms hereof, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the relevant insurance carriers and other third parties to waive, any
restrictions and limitations for medical conditions existing as of the
Effective Time of those Affected Employees and their dependents who were
covered immediately prior to the Effective Time under a group health plan
maintained by the Company, Parent or their Subsidiaries, but only to the
extent that such medical condition would be covered by ParentÂ’s group health
plan if it were not a pre-existing condition and only to the extent that such
limitations would not have applied under the applicable group health plan
covering the Affected Employee prior to the Effective Time. Further, Parent
shall offer, or cause its Subsidiaries to offer, at the Effective Time to each
Affected Employee coverage under a group health plan (as defined in Section
5000(b)(1) of the Code) which credits such Affected Employee towards the
deductibles, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions imposed under
such group health plan, for the plan year during which the Effective Time (or
such later date as the Affected Employees participate in such group health
plan) occurs, with any applicable expenses already incurred during such year
under the CompanyÂ’s or ParentÂ’s group health plan.

 



 

(c) The Company and Parent agree to cooperate in good faith to establish a
process to promptly integrate the Company Benefit Plans and the Parent Benefit
Plans following the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall pay, or shall cause
its Subsidiaries to pay, to each Affected Employee who was employed by the
Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time an amount,
to the extent then unpaid, equal to the unpaid portion of any annual incentive
bonus to which the Affected Employee were be entitled under the applicable
Company annual bonus plan for the year prior to the year in which the
Effective Time occurs.

 



 

(e) Except with respect to offers of employment to prospective new employees
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices, the Company
and Parent agree that they shall not make, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries not to make, any representations or promises, oral or written, to
any of their employees concerning continued employment following the Effective
Time, or the terms and conditions of that employment, except in writing with
the prior written consent of the other party.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement, whether express
or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any
Company Benefit Plan, Parent Benefit Plan or other compensation or benefit
plan, program or arrangement of the Company, Parent or their Subsidiaries, or
shall limit the right of the Company, Parent or any of their Subsidiaries, to
amend, terminate or otherwise modify any such plan or arrangement or to
terminate the employment of any Affected Employee at any time. No Affected
Employee or other

 



      
 

 



 

individual is an intended third party of this _Section 5.18_ and no such
person shall have any right to enforce any provision of this _Section 5.18_.

 



 

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, upon the Effective Time, a "change in control"
shall be deemed to have occurred for purposes of all Company Benefit Plans and
other employee plans, programs and arrangements of the Company that use
"change in control" or a similar term.

the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.20 _Intercompany Structure_. Within 30 days after the date hereof,
Parent shall deliver to the Company, for the CompanyÂ’s review and approval
(which approval shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed), a
plan by which Parent can effect, prior to the Effective Time, certain
intercompany transfers of equity and debt among Parent, Merger Sub and any
other affiliates of Parent, including any newly-formed or to-be-formed
entities, in accordance with the principles set forth in _Schedule 5.20_. The
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be effected in
accordance with such plan, which shall not be modified without the CompanyÂ’s
approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or
delayed). Parent and the Company shall work together in good faith in order to
achieve an efficient intercompany structure among Parent, such affiliates and
Merger Sub in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 5.21 _Company Bond Redemption_. At least 45 but not more than 75 days
prior to the Closing Date, if requested by Parent, the Company shall deliver a
redemption notice to the holders (the " _Noteholders_ ") of the CompanyÂ’s
6.50% Senior Notes due 2020 (the " _Company Notes_ ") providing for the
redemption of such Company Notes by the Company substantially concurrently
with the Closing. The redemption of such Company Notes, if any, shall be made
pursuant to Section 4.07 of that certain Indenture dated as of January 18,
2012 among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors of the Company party thereto
and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the " _Trustee_ "), as
supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture thereto dated January 18,
2012 (as so supplemented, the " _Indenture_ "), and shall be conditioned upon
the Closing. The Company shall comply with the provisions in Article IV of the
Indenture relating to the redemption of the Company Notes and shall provide
Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any documents
delivered by the Company to the Noteholders or the Trustee in connection with
the redemption.

the Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee shall become due and
payable in accordance with this _Section 7.3_, from and after such
termination and payment thereof pursuant to and in accordance with this
_Section 7.3_, the Party paying the Company Termination Fee or Parent
Termination Fee shall have no further liability of any kind for any reason in
connection with this Agreement or the termination contemplated hereby other
than as provided under this _Section 7.3_. Payment by the Company of the
Company Termination Fee or payment by Parent of the Parent Termination Fee, as
applicable, shall not relieve the Company or Parent, as applicable, from any
liability or damage resulting from fraud or a willful and material breach by
such Party of this Agreement; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing,
(A) if Parent accepts payment of the Company Termination Fee in connection
with a termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(i)(ii)_, none of the Company, any

officers, directors, partners, shareholders, managers, members, affiliates or
agents shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and (B) if the
Company accepts payment of the Parent Termination Fee in connection with a
termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)(ii)_, none of Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future officers,
directors, partners, shareholders, managers, members, affiliates or agents
shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Parties
hereto acknowledges that neither the Company Termination Fee nor the Parent
Termination Fee is intended to be a penalty, but rather liquidated damages in
a reasonable amount that will compensate a Party in the circumstances in which
such fee is due and payable and which do not involve fraud or willful and
material breach, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision. In no event shall the Company or Parent be entitled to more than
one payment of the

 



      
 

 



 

Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as the case may be, in
connection with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to which the Company
Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee is payable. " _Expense Reimbursement
Amount_ " means an amount, not to exceed $10,000,000, equal to the reasonable
out-of-pocket fees and expenses, incurred by or on behalf of the person
entitled to payment, in connection with the preparation, negotiation,
execution and performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, but excluding any VAT for which Parent (or any member of a VAT
grouping arrangement of which Parent is a member) is entitled to a refund,
repayment or credit from any relevant tax authority.

 



 

(c) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and that, without these agreements, the Company and Parent would not
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails to pay
in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to this _Section 7.3_, then (i)
the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall reimburse the Party entitled to
the Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee for all costs and
expenses (including disbursements and reasonable fees of counsel) incurred in
the collection of such overdue amount, including in connection with any
related Actions commenced and (ii) the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall
pay to the Party entitled to the Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination
Fee interest on such amount from and including the date payment of such amount
was due to but excluding the date of actual payment at the prime rate set
forth in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made plus 2%.

 



 

(d) The Company confirms that it is established outside of the European Union
for VAT purposes.

jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Texas.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Jurisdiction; Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed, or were threatened to be not performed, in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedy that may be available
to it, including monetary damages, each of the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement exclusively in any
Texas State or federal court sitting in Houston, Texas (or, if such court
lacks subject matter jurisdiction, in any appropriate Texas State or federal
court) and all such rights and remedies at law or in equity shall be
cumulative, except as may be limited by _Section 7.3_. The Parties further
agree that no Party to this Agreement shall be required to obtain, furnish or
post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 8.5_ and each Party waives
any objection to the imposition of such relief or any right it may have to
require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar
instrument. In addition, each of the Parties hereto irrevocably agrees that
any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights
and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder brought by the other Party hereto or its successors or assigns,
shall be brought and determined exclusively in any Texas State or federal
court sitting in Houston, Texas (or, if such court lacks subject matter

Parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or
proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and
agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or
otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any
claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named
courts, (b) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court

 



      
 

 



 

or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, any claim that (i) the suit, action or proceeding
in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such
suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, each of the Parties hereto hereby consents to the
service of process in accordance with _Section 8.7_; _provided_ , _however_ ,

effective on the date specified in such notice or five business days after the

the inability to deliver because of changed address of which no notice was

Section 8.8 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or delegated
by a Party hereto without the prior written consent of the other Party.
Subject to the first sentence of this _Section 8.8_, this Agreement shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted
under this Section shall be null and void.

invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such

 



      
 

 



 

invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the
remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If
any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 



 

Section 8.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement together with the exhibits
hereto, schedules hereto and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, between the Parties, or any of them, with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof, and, subject to _Section 5.10_, this
Agreement is not intended to grant standing to any person other than the
Parties hereto.

 



 

Section 8.11 _Amendments; Waivers_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval or the
passing of the Parent Shareholder Resolutions, any provision of this Agreement
may be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in
writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub; _provided_ , _however_ , that after receipt of the Company
Shareholder Approval or the passing of the Parent Shareholder Resolutions, if
any such amendment or waiver shall by applicable Law or in accordance with the
rules and regulations of the NYSE require further approval of the Company
Shareholders or the Parent Shareholders, as the case may be, the effectiveness
of such amendment or waiver shall be subject to the approval of the Company
Shareholders or the Parent Shareholders, as the case may be. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no failure or delay by any Party hereto in exercising any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right
hereunder.

Agreement are for convenience of the Parties only and shall be given no
substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this

Section 8.13 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees that (i) their
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth
herein are solely for the benefit of the other Party hereto, in accordance
with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and (ii) except for the
provisions of _Section 5.10_ (the " _Third Party Rights Clause_ "), this
Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any person other than
the Parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to
rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein.

 



 

(b) The Third Party Rights Clause confers a benefit on certain persons named
in _Section 5.10_ who are not a Party (each for the purposes of this clause a
" _Third Party_ ") and, subject to the remaining provisions of this clause, is
intended to be enforceable by the Third Party by virtue of the Contracts
(Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.

 



 

(c) The Parties do not intend that any term of this Agreement, apart from the
Third Party Rights Clause, should be enforceable, by virtue of the Contracts
(Rights of Third

 



      
 

 



 

Parties) Act 1999, by any person who is not a Party.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of clauses (a) and (b) above, this
Agreement may be rescinded or varied in any way and at any time by the Parties
without the consent of any Third Party.

 



 

Section 8.14 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
an Article or Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein"
and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires. If this Agreement requires
the Parties to "agree" or requires an "agreement" between the Parties, such
"agreements" must be in writing, unless specifically indicated otherwise. All
terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in
any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant thereto unless
otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to
the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term.
References in this Agreement to specific Laws or to specific provisions of
Laws shall include all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and any
statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument
referred to herein shall mean such statute as from time to time amended,
modified or supplemented, including by succession of comparable successor
statutes. Each of the Parties has participated in the drafting and negotiation
of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by all the
Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.15 _Definitions_. As used in this Agreement, the following terms
have the meanings set forth below:

 



 

" _Adverse 7874 Tax Law Change_ " means any change in applicable Law (whether
or not such change in Law is yet effective) with respect to Section 7874 of
the Code (or any other U.S. Tax Law), or official interpretation thereof as
set forth in published guidance by the IRS (other than IRS News Releases)
(whether or not such change in official interpretation is yet effective), or
any bill that would implement such a change which has been passed in identical
(or substantially identical such that a conference committee is not required
prior to submission of such legislation for the PresidentÂ’s approval or veto)
form by both the United States House of Representatives and the United States
Senate and for which the time period for the President of the United States to
sign or veto such bill has not yet elapsed, in each case, that, once
effective, more likely than not, as a result of the Merger, causes Parent to
