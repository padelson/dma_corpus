parties hereby agree as follows:

  



  

Article I 
 THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

  



  

Section 1.01   _The Offer_.

  



  

(a) (i) Provided that this Agreement has not been
terminated pursuant to _Section 7.01_ and that the Company shall have
complied with its obligations under this _Section 1.01_ and _Section 1.02_,
as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof (and, in any
event, within twenty (20) Business Days after the date of this Agreement), Sub
shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, commence, within the meaning of Rule
14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, the Offer. The obligations of Sub
to, and of Parent to cause Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject to the conditions set forth in
_Annex II_ (the " _Offer Conditions_ "), and not any other conditions.
Subject to _Section 1.01(a)(ii)_, the Offer shall initially expire at
12:01a.m. (New York City time) on the date that is twenty-one (21) Business
Days following the commencement of the Offer (determined using Rule
14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act). Sub expressly reserves the
right to waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition or modify the terms
of the Offer; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, without the prior written
consent of the Company, Sub shall not, and Parent shall not permit Sub to, (A)
reduce the number of Shares subject to the Offer, (B) reduce the Offer Price,
(C) amend, modify or waive the Minimum Tender Condition, (D) add to the Offer
Conditions or amend, modify or supplement any Offer Condition or other term of
the Offer in any manner adverse to any holder of Company Common Stock, (E)
except as expressly provided in _Section 1.01(a)(ii)_, terminate, extend or
otherwise amend or modify the expiration date of the Offer (or take any other
action that would have the effect of extending the expiration date of the
Offer), (F) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer or (G)
provide any "subsequent offering period" within the meaning of Rule 14d-11
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  



  

   

2

 



    



  

(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, (A) extend the Offer
on one or more occasions, in consecutive increments of up to ten (10)
Business Days (or such longer period as the parties may agree) each, if, at
any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer, any Offer Condition (other than
the Minimum Tender Condition) shall not have been satisfied or waived, until
such time as each such condition shall have been satisfied or waived and (B)
extend the Offer for the minimum period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the
Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that Sub shall not be required to extend the
Offer beyond the Outside Date. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, if, at any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer,
each Offer Condition (other than the Minimum Tender Condition) shall have
been satisfied or waived and the Minimum Tender Condition shall not have been
satisfied, then Sub may and, if requested by the Company, Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Sub to, extend the Offer up to twenty (20) Business Days;
_provided_ , _further_ , that Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer
beyond the Outside Date.

  



  

(iii)  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer
and this Agreement, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, (A) no later
than one (1) Business Day following any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer
(if each Offer Condition shall have been satisfied or, if permitted by this
Agreement, waived at such time) irrevocably accept for payment all Shares that
are validly tendered (and not properly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer (
_provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, if the date of such expiration
is the Outside Date, such acceptance shall occur on the Outside Date) (such
acceptance, the " _Offer Closing_ ") and (B) following such acceptance,
promptly (within the meaning of Section 14e-1(c) promulgated under the
Exchange Act), and in any event within three (3) Business Days (for this
purpose calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the
Exchange Act) after the expiration date of the Offer pay for each such Share
in an amount equal to $4.00 (such amount, or any other amount per share paid
in the Offer in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Offer Price_ ") net
to the seller in cash, without interest.

  



  

(iv)  The date and time at which the Offer Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Acceptance Time_." The Offer may not
be terminated prior to its expiration date (as such expiration date may be
extended and re-extended in accordance with _Section 1.01(a)(ii)_), unless
this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Section 7.01_. If
(A) at any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer, (1) each Offer Condition
(other than the Minimum Tender Condition) shall have been satisfied or
waived, (2) the Minimum Tender Condition shall not have been satisfied and (3)
no further extensions or re-extensions of the Offer are permitted or required
pursuant to _Section 1.01(a)(ii)_ or (B) this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 7.01_, then, in each case, Sub shall
promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours of such
termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer. The
termination of the Offer pursuant to _clause (A)_  of the immediately
preceding sentence is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer
Termination_ ," and the date on which the Offer Termination occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Termination Date_." If
the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Sub, or this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with _Section 7.01_, Sub shall promptly return, and shall
cause any depository acting on behalf of Sub to return, all tendered Shares to
the registered holders thereof.

(b) As soon as practicable on the date the Offer is first
commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act), Parent and Sub shall file with the SEC, in accordance with
Rule 14d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and
supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ "), which shall include, as
exhibits, an offer to purchase and a related letter of transmittal, a summary
advertisement, if any, and other ancillary Offer documents pursuant to which
the Offer will be made (such Schedule TO and the documents attached as
exhibits thereto, together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "
_Offer Documents_ "), and, subject to the Company's compliance with _Section
1.02_, cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the holders of Shares
as, and to the extent, required by applicable Law. The Company shall promptly
furnish to Parent and Sub in writing all information concerning the Company
that is required by the Exchange Act or otherwise reasonably requested by
Parent to be set forth in the Offer Documents. Parent, Sub and the
Company shall cooperate in good faith to determine the information regarding
the Company that is necessary or reasonably advisable to include in the Offer
Documents in order to satisfy applicable Laws. Prior to the filing of the
Offer Documents (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the dissemination
thereof to the shareholders of the Company, or responding to any comments of
the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, Parent and Sub shall
provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose
comments on such Offer Documents or response and Parent and Sub shall give
reasonable consideration to any timely comments provided by the Company. Each
of Parent, Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect,
and each of Parent and Sub shall, with the Company's cooperation, take
all reasonable steps to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to cause
the Offer Documents, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC
and disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities Laws. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent and Sub shall have no responsibility with respect to any
information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Offer Documents to the extent permitted by applicable Law.
Parent and Sub shall promptly notify the Company upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) or any request from the SEC
(or the staff of the SEC) for amendments or supplements to the Offer
Documents, and shall provide the Company with copies of all correspondence
between Parent, Sub and their respective Representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC (or the staff of the SEC), on the other hand (and shall orally
describe any oral comments). Parent and Sub shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to
any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect to the Offer
Documents.

  



  

(c)  Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided to Sub, on a
timely basis, all of the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Sub
becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer; _provided_ that in no
way shall this _Section 1.01(c)_ reduce, offset or limit the obligations of
Parent pursuant to _Section 2.02(a)_.

  



  

(d) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect
the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including
any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common
Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
merger, issuer tender offer, exchange of shares or other like change
with respect to Company Common Stock occurring after the execution of this
Agreement by all parties hereto and prior to acceptance for payment of, and
payment for, Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer, and such adjustment
to the Offer Price shall as so adjusted from and after the date of such
event, be the Offer Price; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
_Section 1.01(d)_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize the Company to
effect any such change that it is not otherwise authorized or permitted to
undertake pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 1.02   _Company Actions_. (a) The Company shall, in a manner
that complies with Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, file with
the SEC, on the date the initial Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, a
Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with
respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits
thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ "), which shall, subject to the provisions of
_Section 5.03_: (i) reflect the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
(ii) describe and make the Company Recommendation with respect to the Offer
(provided that there has not been a Change of Company Recommendation to the
extent permitted by _Section 5.03_). The Company and Parent shall
reasonably cooperate to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be mailed or otherwise
disseminated to the holders of Shares. Parent and Sub shall promptly furnish
to the Company in writing all information concerning Parent and Sub that is
required by the Exchange Act or otherwise reasonably requested by the Company
to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9. Parent, Sub and the Company shall
cooperate in good faith to determine the information regarding the Company
that is necessary or reasonably advisable to include in the Schedule 14D-9 in
order to satisfy applicable Laws. Prior to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the dissemination thereof to the
shareholders of the Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC (or the
staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a
reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on the Schedule
14D-9 (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or response and the Company
shall give reasonable consideration to any timely comments provided by
Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Company may amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 in connection with the
Company's board of directors effecting a Change of Company Recommendation in
accordance with _Section 5.03_ without the prior consent of Parent and
without providing Parent or its counsel an opportunity to review or comment
thereon. Each of the Company, Parent and Sub shall promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9, if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect, and the Company shall, with Parent and Sub's cooperation,
take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to
cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the
SEC and disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall have no responsibility with respect to any
information supplied by Parent or Sub for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Schedule 14D-9 to the extent permitted by applicable Law.
The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from
the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) or any request from the SEC (or the staff
of the SEC) for amendments or supplements to the Schedule 14D-9, and shall
provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC (or the staff of the SEC), on
the other hand (and shall orally describe any oral comments). The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect
to the Schedule 14D-9. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the
Offer Documents of the Company Recommendation contained in the
Schedule 14D-9. The Schedule 14D-9 shall include the fairness opinion of the
Company's financial advisor referenced in _Section 3.23_.

(b)  In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company
shall cause its transfer agent to furnish Parent and Sub promptly with such
assistance and such information as Parent, Sub or any of their Representatives
may reasonably request in order to disseminate and otherwise communicate the
Offer to the record and beneficial holders of Shares, including mailing labels
containing the names and addresses of the record holders of Shares as of the
most recent practicable date, together with copies of lists of shareholders,
security position listings and computer files in the Company's possession or
control regarding the beneficial owners of Shares, and shall furnish to Sub
such information (including updated lists of record holders and shareholders,
security position listings and computer files) as Parent may reasonably
request in communicating the Offer to the holders of Shares. Subject to the
requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary
to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the Transactions, Parent and Sub (i) shall keep confidential and
not disclose such information, including the information contained in any such
labels, lists, listings and files, in each case as required by the
Confidentiality Agreement, (ii) shall use such information only (and shall not
disclose any such information except) in connection with the Offer and the
Merger and, (iii) if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon
request, deliver to the Company or destroy, except with respect to securely
maintained electronically archived copies the destruction of which is not
feasible, all copies of such information then in their possession or control
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

Section 1.03   _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions in this Agreement, and in accordance
with the MBCA, at the Effective Time, Sub shall be merged with and into the

sometimes being referred to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), such
that following the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will be a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent and shall succeed to and assume all the
properties, rights, privileges, powers, franchises, debts, liabilities and
obligations of Sub and the Company in accordance with Section 724 of the
MBCA. The Merger shall be effected pursuant to Section 703a(3)(a) of the MBCA
and shall be effected as soon as practicable following the Acceptance Time

VI_ shall not be satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement at
such time (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at or immediately prior to the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), the Closing shall occur on the
second (2nd) Business Day after which each of the conditions set forth in
_Article VI_ shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement

immediately prior to the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
such conditions), or at such other place, date and time as the parties hereto
may agree in writing. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in
this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs, Corporations, Securities
and Commercial Licensing Bureau for the State of Michigan or at such other date
and time as is agreed between the parties and specified in the Certificate of
Merger (such date and time, the " _Effective Time_ ").

immediately prior to the Effective Time, and as so amended and restated,
shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (except that references to
the name of Sub shall be replaced by references to the name of the Surviving
Corporation), in each case until thereafter amended in accordance with
applicable Law and the applicable provisions of the articles of incorporation
and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b)   _Directors_. Subject to applicable Law, the parties hereto
shall take all requisite action such that the board of directors of the
Surviving Corporation effective as of, and immediately following, the
Effective Time shall consist of the members of the board of directors of Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance
with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(c)   _Officers_. The parties hereto shall take all requisite
action such that the officers of the Surviving Corporation effective as of,
and immediately following, the Effective Time shall consist of the officers of
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office in
accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.

Article II 
 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

  



  

Section 2.01   _Conversion of Securities_.

  



  

(a)  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or the holders of any
capital stock of the Company or Sub:

  



  

(i) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock (each, a " _Share_ " and collectively, the " _Shares_ ",
including each outstanding award of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
forfeiture restrictions or other restrictions (" _Restricted Stock_ ")),
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than
Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.01(a)(ii)_, shall
automatically be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash,
without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), and all of such Shares
shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and each certificate representing a Share (a " _Certificate_ ") or non-
certificated Share represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") that
formerly represented any of the Shares (other than Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with _Section 2.01(a)(ii)_) shall thereafter be cancelled and
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, into which the Shares
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares have been converted
pursuant to this _Section 2.01(a)(i) _upon the surrender thereof in
accordance with _Section 2.02_ and subject to _Section 2.05_.

  



  

(ii)   _Cancellation of Company-Owned Shares and Parent-Owned
Shares_. All Shares that are owned by the Company or held in the Company's
treasury and all Shares owned by Parent, Sub or any of their
respective wholly owned Subsidiaries (in each case, other than those held on
behalf of any third party) (collectively, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall
cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, with no
payment being made with respect thereto.

  



  

(iii)   _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share
of capital stock of Sub shall be automatically converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, no par
value per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation as of
immediately after the Effective Time.

  



  

(b)   _Merger Consideration Adjustment_. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, during the period from the
date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the number of outstanding
Shares shall have been changed into a different number of Shares or a
different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of
shares, readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or
stock distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within said
period, the Offer Price and the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately
adjusted to provide the holders of Shares the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; provided, that nothing in
this _Section 2.01(b)_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize the Company to
effect any such change that it is not authorized or permitted to undertake
pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 2.02   _Exchange of Certificates; Payment for Shares_.

  



  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent shall
designate Computershare Trust Company, N.A. or another U.S.-based nationally
recognized financial institution reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as agent (such paying agent, which, if practicable, shall also be the
depository pursuant to the Offer, the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the holders
of Shares to receive the funds to which such holders shall become entitled
pursuant to this Agreement and, without limiting the generality of _Section
1.01(c)_ or _Section 5.02(b)_, deposit, or cause to be deposited, prior to
or concurrently with the Acceptance Time, with the Paying Agent, in
immediately available funds, a cash amount equal to the sum of the Aggregate
Offer Consideration plus the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration (the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall be held in trust by the Paying
Agent for the benefit of the holders of Shares that Sub becomes obligated to
purchase, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, pursuant to the
Offer and for the benefit of the holders of Shares that are entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration. In the event the Exchange Fund shall be
insufficient to make the payments contemplated by _Section 1.01(a)(iii)_ and
this _Section 2.02_, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be
deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount sufficient to
make such payments, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the
Exchange Fund and will be held and disbursed in the same manner as funds
initially deposited with the Paying Agent to make the payments contemplated by
_Section 1.01(a)(iii)_ and this _Section 2.02_. Funds made available to the
Paying Agent shall, if Parent so chooses, be invested by the Paying Agent, as
directed by Parent, in short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations
fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States of
America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, pending payment thereof by the Paying
Agent to the holders of Shares pursuant to _Section 1.01(a)(iii) _and this
_Section 2.02_; _provided_ , that no such investment of such deposited funds
shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from
the obligation to make the payments required by _Section 1.01(a)(iii) _and
this _Section 2.02_, and following any losses from any such investment,
Parent shall promptly provide, or cause to be provided, additional funds to
the Paying Agent, to be held in trust by the Paying Agent for the benefit of
the holders of Shares, in the amount of such losses, which additional funds
will be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund and will be held and disbursed
in the same manner as funds initially deposited with the Paying Agent to make
the payments contemplated by _Section 1.01(a)(iii) _and this _Section
2.02_. Any interest or income produced by such investments shall become a
part of the Exchange Fund, and any cash amounts in excess of the amounts
payable in accordance with _Section 1.01(a)(iii)_ and this _Section 2.02
_shall be promptly returned to Parent. Parent shall direct the Paying Agent
to hold the Exchange Fund for the benefit of the former holders of Shares and
to make payments from the Exchange Fund in accordance with _Section
1.01(a)(iii)_ and this _Section 2.02_. The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to _Section 1.01(a)(iii)
_and this _Section 2.02_, except as expressly provided for in this
Agreement.

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As promptly as practicable
after the Closing and in any event not later than the third (3rd) Business
Day thereafter, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate whose Shares were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form, which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in
accordance with _Section 2.02(e)_) to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise
be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify, subject to the reasonable consent of the Company; and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section 2.02(e)_) for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, and upon delivery of a letter
of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such
Certificate and such other documents as may customarily be required by the
Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the portion of the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration
into which the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate were
converted pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)(i)_ (less any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.05_), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment may be made and Merger Consideration may be issued to a
person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall
pay to the Paying Agent any transfer and other similar Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered or shall establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Taxes either have been
paid or are not required to be paid. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying
Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)(i)_. In lieu thereof, each holder of
record of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose Shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall, upon receipt by the Paying
Agent of an "agent's message" in customary form (or such other customary
evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), be entitled to
receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to exchange and deliver as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event
more than two (2) Business Days thereafter), the Merger Consideration in
respect of each such Share (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in
_Section 2.05_), and the Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any portion of the Merger
Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section 2.02(e)_) or in respect of
any Book-Entry Share.

  



  

(c)   _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_.
As of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Shares on the records of the Company of Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Merger Consideration paid in
accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been
delivered and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to any
Shares. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares or as shareholders of the Company except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, into which the
Shares have been converted pursuant to  _Section 2.01(a)(i)_ upon the
surrender thereof in accordance with this _Section 2.02_ and subject to
_Section 2.05_. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares formerly representing Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

  



  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property; No
Liability_. At any time following the date that is two hundred seventy (270)
days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains unclaimed
by, or otherwise undistributed to, holders of Shares that were outstanding at
the Effective Time, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look
only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Shares and compliance with
the procedures set forth in _Section 2.02(b)_, without interest. If any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered prior to
the second (2nd) anniversary of the Effective Time, any unclaimed
funds payable with respect to such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent,
Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to
any person for any portion of the Exchange Fund or the Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

  



  

   

10

 



    



  

(e)   _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit (in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent) of that fact
by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the portion of the
Aggregate Common Stock Consideration into which the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate were converted pursuant to _Section
2.01(a)(i)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate may be required, as a condition precedent to the payment
of such Merger Consideration, to provide a bond in a customary amount as
Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably require, if so required by Parent or
by the policies and procedures of the Paying Agent, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against Parent, the Paying Agent or the Surviving
Corporation.

  



  

Section 2.03   _Treatment of Company Options, RSUs and Company Stock
Plans_.

  



  

(a)   _Treatment of Company Non-Employee Options_. At the
Effective Time, each Company Non-Employee Option that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled by virtue of the
Merger without any action on the part of the holder thereof and, in exchange
therefor, each holder of any such cancelled Company Non-Employee Option shall
be entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such Company
Non-Employee Option and in settlement therefor, a payment in cash of an
amount equal to the product of (y) the total number of Shares subject to such
cancelled Company Non-Employee Option, multiplied by (z) the excess, if any,
of (1) the Merger Consideration over (2) the exercise price per Share subject
to such cancelled Company Non-Employee Option, without interest (such amounts
payable hereunder, the " _Option Payments_ ") (less any required Tax
withholdings as provided in Section 2.05); provided, however, that any such
Company Non-Employee Option with respect to which the exercise price per
Share subject thereto is equal or greater than the Merger Consideration shall
be cancelled in exchange for no consideration. From and after the Effective
Time, no Company Non-Employee Option shall be outstanding or exercisable, and
each Company Non-Employee Option holder shall be entitled only to the payment
provided for in this _Section 2.03(a)_.

  



  

(b) _Treatment of Company Employee Options_. At the Effective
Time, each Company Employee Option that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of such Company
Employee Option, cease to represent an option to purchase Shares and shall be
converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of
(x) (A) in the case of a service-based Company Employee Option, the total
number of Shares subject to such Company Employee Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time or (B) in the case of a performance-based Company
Employee Option, the number of Shares earned based on actual performance, if
the performance period ends on or before the Closing Date, or the number of
Shares as set forth on _Section 2.03(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, if
the performance period ends after the Closing Date, and (y) the Equity Award
Conversion Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
of such Company Employee Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
divided by (B) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio; _provided_ , _however_
, that the conversion of the Company Employee Options as provided in this
_Section 2.03(b)_ shall in any event be done in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code; _provided_ , _further_ , that in
the case of any Company Employee Option to which Section 422 of the Code
applies, the conversion of such option shall be done in accordance with the
foregoing, subject to such adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy
the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code (such Company Employee
Options, as converted pursuant to this sentence, the " _Converted Options_
"). Each Converted Option will be subject to the same terms and conditions,
including vesting and exercisability, as applied to the Company Employee
Option for which the Converted Option was exchanged, except for
terms rendered inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or for such other changes that are necessary for the administration
of the Converted Option and not materially detrimental to the holder thereof.

  



  

   

11

 



    



  

(c)   _Treatment of non-Accelerated Restricted Stock Units_. At
the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided in  _Section 2.03(d)_, each
outstanding award of restricted stock units (" _RSUs_ ") in respect of
Shares granted pursuant to a Company Stock Plan (each, an " _RSU Award_ ")
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any
holder of such RSU Award, cease to represent a restricted stock unit award
denominated in Shares and shall be converted into a restricted stock unit
award denominated in shares of Parent Common Stock and relating to a number
of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (i) (A) in the case
of a service-based RSU Award, the total number of Shares subject to such RSU
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, or (B) in the case of a
performance-based RSU Award, the number of Shares earned based on actual
performance, if the performance period ends on or before the Closing Date, or
the number of Shares as set forth on Section 2.03(c) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, if the performance period ends after the Closing Date,
multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio, with any fractional
shares rounded down to the next lower whole number of shares (such RSU
Awards, as converted pursuant to this sentence, the " _Converted RSU Awards_
"). Each Converted RSU Award will be subject to the same terms and
conditions, including vesting and settlement, as applied to the RSU Award for
which the Converted RSU Award was exchanged, except for terms rendered
inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or for such other changes that are necessary for the administration of the
Converted RSU Award and not materially detrimental to the holder thereof.

  



  

(d) _Treatment of Accelerated Restricted Stock Units_. At the
Effective Time, each RSU Award that by its terms in effect as of the
date hereof shall automatically become fully or partially vested effective
immediately prior to or upon the consummation of the Transactions (without
the required occurrence of termination of employment or any other event) shall
be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such cancelled RSU
Award shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of
such RSU Award and in settlement therefor, a payment in cash of an amount
equal to the product of (y) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (z) the
number of Shares subject to such cancelled RSU Award, without interest
(such amounts payable hereunder, the " _RSU Payments_ ") (less any required
Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.05_).

  



  

   

12

 



    



  

(e)   _Parent Funding_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with the Surviving Corporation cash in the amount necessary to make
the payments required under _Section 2.03(a)_ and _Section 2.03(d)_, if any.
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay, as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time, the applicable Option Payments and RSU
Payments, if any, to the holders of Company Non-Employee Options described in
_Section 2.03(a)_ and the holders of RSUs described in _Section 2.03(d)_,
in each case, subject to _Section 2.05_.

  



  

(f)  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company's
board of directors or the appropriate committee thereof, as applicable, shall
(i) with respect to any performance-based Company Employee Option or RSU Award
for which the applicable performance period ends on or before the Closing
Date, certify the achievement of the applicable performance conditions without
the exercise of discretion and (ii) adopt any resolutions and take any other
actions which are reasonably necessary to effectuate the provisions of this
_Section 2.03_.

  



  

Section 2.04   _No Dissenter 's Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, no shareholder of the Company shall have any
dissenters' rights provided for in the MBCA in connection with the
Transactions.

  



  

Section 2.05   _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement in respect
of the Shares, Company Options and RSU Awards vested or cancelled in the
Merger, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment, or the vesting, waiver of restrictions or other
actions provided for in this Agreement, under the Code or any other
applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the
case may be, such withheld amounts (a) shall be remitted by the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable
Governmental Entity, and (b) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares, Company Options or RSU
Awards in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

Except (a) as disclosed in the publicly available Company SEC Documents filed
with, or furnished to, the SEC on or after January 1, 2017 and prior to the
date of this Agreement, other than (i) disclosures in the "Risk Factors"
sections of any such filings and any disclosure of risks included in any
"forward-looking statements" disclaimer contained in any such filings and
(ii) any other similar disclosures that are cautionary, predictive or forward-
looking in nature, in any such publicly available Company SEC Documents, in
each case, where the relevance of the information to a
particular representation or warranty is reasonably apparent on the face of
such disclosure or (b) as disclosed in the separate disclosure letter that
has been delivered by the Company to Parent and Sub prior to the execution of
this Agreement, including the documents attached to such disclosure letter
(the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any
item in any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall also
be deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other section or subsection in
this Agreement to which the relevance of such item to such other section or
subsection is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure), the Company
hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Sub as follows:

  



  

Section 3.01   _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_.

  



  

(a)  The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Michigan. The
Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted. The Company is duly qualified or otherwise authorized as a
foreign corporation to do business and is in good standing (or the equivalent
thereof), in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of
its properties or assets or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing has not had or would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(b)  Each Company Subsidiary is a corporation or other legal
entity duly incorporated or organized, validly existing and in good standing
(or the equivalent thereof) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization. Each Company Subsidiary has all requisite
corporate or other legal entity, as the case may be, power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business
as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to have such power and
authority would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Company
Subsidiary is duly qualified or otherwise authorized as a foreign corporation
or limited liability company to do business and is in good standing (or the
equivalent thereof), in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or
operation of its properties or assets or the conduct of its business requires
such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(c)   _Section 3.01(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter lists
all of the Company Subsidiaries and any other joint ventures, partnerships or
similar arrangements in which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has a
limited liability, partnership or other equity interest (or any other
security or other right, agreement or commitment convertible or exercisable
into, or exchangeable for, any interest in any such person, or any
contractual arrangement that approximates any such relationship) and the
amount and percentage of any such interest, and the amount and percentage
that any other person holds in such person. The Company does not directly or
indirectly control or own any capital stock of, or other voting securities or
equity or similar interests, or investment, or have any obligation to invest,
in any person which is not listed on _Section 3.01(c)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter. Neither the Company nor any "significant subsidiary" of
the Company, within the meaning of Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X promulgated
under the Exchange Act, has, since January 1, 2017, filed for bankruptcy or
filed for reorganization under the U.S. federal bankruptcy Laws or similar
state or federal Law, become insolvent (considered together with the Company
and the other Company Subsidiaries) or become subject to conservatorship or
receivership.

  



  

   

14

 



    



  

(d) The Company has made available to Parent prior to the date
of this Agreement true and complete copies of (i) the Third Amended and
Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company (the " _Company Charter_")
and (ii) the Bylaws of the Company (the " _Company Bylaws_ ," and
collectively with the Company Charter, the " _Company Organizational
Documents_ "), and the Organizational Documents for each Company Subsidiary,
in each case, as amended through the date of this Agreement. Each of the
Company Organizational Documents and the Organizational Documents for each
Company Subsidiary are in full force and effect, and neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary is in violation of any of the applicable provisions of
such documents.

  



  

Section 3.02   _Capitalization_.

  



  

(a)  The authorized capital stock of the Company is 600,000,000
shares, consisting of (i) 590,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and (ii)
10,000,000 shares of the Company's preferred stock (" _Company Preferred
Stock_ "). As of the close of business on December 3, 2019 (the " _Specified

186,969 shares of Restricted Stock), (ii) no shares of Company Preferred Stock
were issued and outstanding, (iii) no shares of Company Common Stock were
held in treasury and (iv) no other shares of capital stock of the Company
were issued or outstanding.

  



  

(b)  As of the close of business on the Specified Date, the
Company had no Shares or Company Preferred Stock reserved for issuance,
except for the Shares reserved for issuance under the Company Stock Plans (of
which there are 3,728,967 Shares subject to outstanding Company Options and
3,804,042 Shares subject to outstanding RSUs, in each case assuming
performance levels were achieved at 100%).

  



  

(c)   _Section 3.02(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
contains a correct and complete list as of the Specified Date of outstanding
Company Options, Restricted Stock and RSUs, including for each such award (as
applicable) (i) the holder (and, in the case of a Company Option, identifying
whether the holder is a former employee), (ii) the type of award, (iii)
the number (or, in the case of an award subject to performance conditions,
target number) of Shares currently subject to each award, (iv) the applicable
Company Stock Plan under which such award was granted, (v) the exercise price,
if applicable, and (vi) the grant date, term and vesting schedule. All
outstanding Shares are, and all Shares that may be issued upon the exercise of
Company Options or the vesting of RSUs shall be, when issued, duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to,
or issued in violation of, any preemptive right. Each Company Option was
issued with an exercise price that is at least equal to the fair market value
of a share of Company Common Stock, as determined in accordance with Section
409A of the Code, on the applicable date of grant.

  



  

   

15

 



    



  

(d) Except for the Company Options, Restricted Stock and RSUs
referred to in _Section 3.02(b)_ and set forth in _Section 3.02(c)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter and in the related award agreements and the issuance
of any Company Options, Restricted Stock or RSUs as set forth in _Section

concerning the Company, any Company Subsidiary or the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that no provision of
this Agreement is intended to eliminate or limit the available remedies with
respect to fraud.

proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal,
(B) furnish any non-public information regarding the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to any third person in connection with or in response to a
Competing Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Competing Proposal, (C) directly or indirectly through
intermediaries conduct, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions
or negotiations with any third person, or cooperate in any way with any such
third person, with respect to any Competing Proposal or any inquiry or
proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal
(other than, solely in response to an unsolicited inquiry, to refer the
inquiring person to the restrictions contained in this _Section 5.03_ and to
limit its conversation or other communication regarding such Competing
Proposal or inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Competing Proposal exclusively to such referral), (D) approve, recommend,
execute or enter into any letter of intent, acquisition agreement, merger

_Section 5.03_ by the Company.

  



  

   

48

 



    



  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, but subject to the last sentence of this _Section 5.03(b)_, if,
at any time following the date hereof and prior to the Acceptance Time, (i)
the Company has received a _bona fide_  written Competing Proposal from a
person that did not result from a breach of this _Section 5.03_ and that did
not result from action by any of the Other Employees that would have been a
breach of this _Section 5.03_ if such action had been taken by an officer or
director of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and (ii) the
Company's board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with its independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
Competing Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal and that the failure to take action with respect to which would be
inconsistent with the Company's board of directors' fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, then the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives may (A) furnish information (including non-public
information) with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the
person making such Competing Proposal and its Representatives;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company will not, will not permit the Company
Subsidiaries to, and will not authorize or permit its Representatives or
affiliates to, disclose any non-public information regarding the Company or
any Company Subsidiary to such person without first entering into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such person; _provided_ , further
that the Company shall promptly (but in no event later than twenty-four (24)
hours) deliver a copy to Parent of any Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
that it enters into, and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with
the person making such Competing Proposal and its Representatives regarding
such Competing Proposal. The Company will promptly (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours) advise Parent in writing (1) of the receipt of any
Competing Proposal or a request for information relating to the Company or
any Company Subsidiary that is reasonably likely to lead to, or that
contemplates, a Competing Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any
such Competing Proposal (including an unredacted copy of such Competing
Proposal or, where such Competing Proposal is not in writing, a description
of the terms thereof) and the identity of the person making any such Competing
Proposal and the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a current
basis of the material terms and status (including any change to the material
terms thereof or any material change to the status) of any Competing Proposal,
including by promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours
after receipt) providing to Parent copies of any proposals, indications of
interest, draft agreements and material correspondence relating to such
Competing Proposal or (2) if it commences furnishing non-public
information or commences discussions or negotiations as provided in this
_Section 5.03(b)_ and will contemporaneously provide to Parent any
information concerning the Company or any Company Subsidiary provided or made
available to such other person (or its Representatives) that was not
previously provided to Parent. The Company shall provide Parent with at least
two (2) Business Days' prior written notice of any meeting of the Company's
board of directors (or such lesser notice as is provided to members of the
Company's board of directors) at which the Company's board of directors is
reasonably expected to consider any Competing Proposal. The Company agrees
that it and the Company Subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement with
any person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that prohibits the
Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with, or
otherwise complying with, this _Section 5.03_.

  



  

   

49

 



    



  

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 5.03(d)_ or _Section
5.03(e)_, neither the Company's board of directors nor any committee thereof
shall (i) adopt, authorize, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
adopt, authorize, approve or recommend, any Competing Proposal, (ii)
withdraw, change, qualify, withhold or modify or amend in a manner adverse to
Parent, or publicly propose to withdraw, change, qualify, withhold or modify
or amend in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation, (iii)
fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9
when disseminated to the Company's shareholders, (iv) publicly recommend a
tender offer or exchange offer (other than the Offer), (v) make any public
statement inconsistent with the Company Recommendation ( _provided_ that any
public statement that includes only factual statements and that (i) reaffirms
the Company Recommendation or (ii) states that the Company's board of
directors has not changed the Company Recommendation shall not be considered a
statement inconsistent with the Company Recommendation), (vi) if a Competing
Proposal shall have been publicly announced or disclosed, promptly following
a written request from Parent to do so, fail to recommend against such
Competing Proposal or fail to reaffirm the Company Recommendation, and in any
event fail to do so on or prior to the tenth (10th) Business Day after the
Competing Proposal shall have been publically announced or disclosed, but in
any event at least one (1) Business Day prior to the then scheduled
expiration date of the Offer (any action set forth in the foregoing
_clauses (i)_ through _(vi)_ , a " _Change of Company Recommendation_ ") or
(vii) authorize, cause, approve, recommend or allow the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives to execute or
enter into any letter of intent, term sheet, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, joint
venture agreement or other similar agreement relating to, or that would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) or requiring, or that would reasonably
be expected to cause, the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate
the Transactions (each, a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ").

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company's board of
directors may make a Change of Company Recommendation if and only if, prior to
taking such action:

  



  

(i)  (A) a bona fide, written, Competing Proposal (that did
not result from a breach of this _Section 5.03_ and that did not result from
action by any of the Other Employees that would have been a breach of this
_Section 5.03_ if such action had been taken by an officer or director of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries) is made to the Company by a third
person and such Competing Proposal is not withdrawn and (B) the Company's
board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its
independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Competing
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and that failure to make a Change of
Company Recommendation would be inconsistent with the Company's board of
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

  



  

(ii) the Company provides Parent prior written notice of the
Company's intention to make a Change of Company Recommendation (a " _Notice
of Change of Recommendation_ "), which Notice of Change of Recommendation
shall (A) include the basis for such action, (B) identify the person making
the Superior Proposal and (C) attach the most current draft of any proposed
Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal and a
copy of any related financing commitments in the Company's possession or
under its control (or, in each case, if not provided in writing to
the Company, a written summary of the terms thereof) (it being agreed that
the delivery of the Notice of Change of Recommendation by the Company and, to
the extent that such disclosure is required by applicable U.S. federal
securities Law, the public announcement thereof shall not constitute a Change
of Company Recommendation);

  



  

   

50

 



    



  

(iii)  the Company and its Representatives have negotiated in good
faith with Parent, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, with respect to
any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent for at least
five (5) Business Days following receipt by Parent of such Notice of Change
of Recommendation (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to any of
the financial terms (including the form, amount and timing of payment of
consideration) or any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new Notice of Change of Recommendation and the Company and its
Representatives shall be required to comply with the requirements of this
_Section 5.03(d)_ anew with respect to such new Notice of Change of
Recommendation except that the five (5) Business Day period referred to above
shall instead be an additional two (2) Business Day period from the date
of such notice); and

  



  

(iv)  following the period referred to in _Section 5.03(d)(iii)_,
giving due consideration to any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent in writing to the Company, the Company's board of directors
has determined in good faith, after consultation with its independent
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Competing
Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if
such changes to which Parent has committed to in writing were to be given
effect and that failure to make a Change of Company Recommendation would be
inconsistent with the Company's board of directors' fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

  



  

(e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, other than in connection with a Competing Proposal, the
Company's board of directors may, at any time prior to, but not after, the
Acceptance Time, make a Change of Company Recommendation in response to an
Intervening Event if, prior to taking such action, the Company's board of
directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with the Company's board of directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior
to taking such action, (i) the Company has given Parent at least five (5)
Business Days' prior written notice of its intention to take such action, and
specifying in reasonable detail the Intervening Event and the potential
reasons that the Company's board of directors is proposing to effect a Change
of Company Recommendation, (ii) the Company has negotiated, and caused its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such five (5)
Business Day period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable
Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would
cause the Company's board of directors to not make such Change of Company
Recommendation, and (iii) following the end of such five (5) Business Days
period, the Company's board of directors shall have considered in good
faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement to which Parent has
committed in writing, and shall have determined, after consultation with its
independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel (assuming the
revisions proposed by Parent in writing were to be given effect), that the
Intervening Event is continuing and that the failure to make a Change of
Company Recommendation would be inconsistent with the Company's board of
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

  



  

   

51

 



    



  

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.03_ shall prohibit
the Company or the Company's board of directors from complying with its
disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to a
Competing Proposal, including (i) taking and disclosing to the shareholders
of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii)
making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the shareholders of the
Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act if, in any such case,
the Company's board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or obligations of the Company
or the Company's board of directors under applicable federal securities Laws;
_provided_ , that, this _Section 5.03(f)_ shall not be deemed to permit the
Company's board of directors to take any of the actions in _Section 5.03(c)_
and, for the avoidance of doubt, if any disclosure or other action taken
pursuant to this _Section 5.03(f) _includes a Change of Company
Recommendation, such disclosure or other action shall be deemed to be a
Change of Company Recommendation for all purposes under this Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.04   _Access to Information_. From the date of this Agreement
to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company
Subsidiary to: (a) provide to Parent and Sub and their respective
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours in such a
manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the operation of any business
conducted by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, upon reasonable prior
notice to the Company, to the officers, employees, Representatives,
properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and to their books and records, Contracts, Tax Returns,
accountant work papers, Permits and any report, schedule or other document
filed or received by it pursuant to the requirements of applicable Law; and
(b) furnish promptly such information concerning the business, properties,
Contracts, assets, liabilities and personnel of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as Parent or its Representatives may reasonably request;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to (or to
cause any Company Subsidiary to) afford such access or furnish such
information to the extent that the Company believes in good faith that doing
so would: (i) result in the loss of attorney-client privilege (provided that
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or
disclosure (or as much of it as possible) in a manner that does not result in
a loss of attorney-client privilege); or (ii) breach, contravene or violate
any applicable Law (including the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law). During
any visit to the business or property sites of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, each of Parent and Sub shall, and shall cause their
respective Representatives accessing such properties to, comply with all
applicable Laws and all of the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' safety
and security procedures previously made available to Parent. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.04, none of Parent,
Sub or any of their respective affiliates shall conduct any invasive
environmental testing or sampling of such real property without the Company's
prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Parent shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives to, hold all information provided or furnished pursuant to
this _Section 5.04_ in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

Section 5.05   _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
(including _Section 5.03_ ), each of Parent and the Company shall (and shall
cause each of their affiliates to) use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, and assist and
cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, all things necessary, proper
and advisable to consummate the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and to cause the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ and _Annex II_ to be
satisfied as promptly as reasonably practicable. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent shall (and shall cause Sub and each of
Parent's or Sub's affiliates to) and the Company shall (and shall cause each
of the Company Subsidiaries and each of the Company's and the Company
Subsidiaries' affiliates to) use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the
expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act as promptly
as practicable and to promptly obtain all actions or nonactions, consents,
Permits (including Environmental Permits), waivers, clearances, approvals,
authorizations and orders from Governmental Entities or other persons that
are required in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) as promptly as practicable,
and, with respect to filings required under the HSR Act, within ten (10)
Business Days after the date of this Agreement, make and not withdraw all
registrations and filings with any Governmental Entity or other persons
required in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the filings required of the parties or their
"ultimate parent entities" under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, and
promptly make any further filings in connection therewith that may be
necessary or advisable and (iii) execute and deliver, as promptly as
practicable, any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, in connection with the preparation and filing of
all documentation with respect to all Permits necessary to be obtained from
any Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions, each party
hereto will consult and cooperate with the other parties in good
faith; provide such information and assistance as is reasonably requested by
the other parties to complete any such documentation; permit the other
parties hereto a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
documentation in advance; and incorporate any reasonable comments of such
other parties.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause each of their
respective affiliates to, use their reasonable best efforts to take promptly
any and all steps reasonably necessary to avoid or resolve each and every
impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental
Entity or any other person in connection with this Agreement so as to enable
the Closing to occur expeditiously (and in any event, no later than the
Outside Date), including by becoming subject to, consenting to, or offering or
agreeing to, and otherwise taking action with respect to, any requirement,
condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order to: (i) sell,
license, divest or otherwise dispose of assets, business or any portion of
the business of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, Parent or any of their
respective affiliates; (ii) change the assets, business or any portion of the
business of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, Parent or any of their
respective affiliates; (iii) impose any restriction, requirement
or limitation on the operation of the business or any portion of the business
of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, Parent or any of their respective
affiliates; (iv) terminate any relevant venture or other arrangement; or (v)
litigate (or defend) against any administrative or judicial Proceeding
(including any Proceeding seeking a temporary restraining order
or preliminary injunction) challenging any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, unless the taking of any
or all such actions contemplated by the foregoing clauses (i) through (v) (A)
would, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Burdensome Condition or
(B) in the case of the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), is not conditioned
upon consummation of the Closing; _provided_ , that, if requested by Parent,
the Company and any Company Subsidiary will become subject to, consent to, or
offer or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any such
requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order so long
as such requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order
is only binding on the Company or such Company Subsidiary after the Closing
(in the event the Closing occurs); _provided_ , _further_ that, unless
requested by Parent pursuant to the immediately foregoing proviso, neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary will, without the prior written consent
of Parent, become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise
take any action with respect to, any such requirement, condition, limitation,
understanding, agreement or order if the taking of any or all such actions
would, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Burdensome Condition.

  



  

   

53

 



    



  

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in
this _Section 5.05_, each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties
prompt notice of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry,
investigation or legal Proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) keep the
other parties reasonably and timely informed as to the status of any such
request, inquiry, investigation or legal Proceeding; (iii) promptly inform
the other parties of any communication to or from the FTC, the Antitrust
Division or any other Governmental Entity regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (iv) use their reasonable best efforts
to respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries received from any
Governmental Entity or any other authority enforcing applicable Antitrust
Laws for additional information or documentation in connection with antitrust,
competition or similar matters (including a "second request" under the HSR
Act); provided that the parties agree that it is Parent's sole right to
devise the strategy for all filings, notifications, submissions and
communications in connection with any filing pursuant to Antitrust Laws
subject to this _Section 5.05_, so long as such strategy complies with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement; and (v) to the extent permitted by Law
and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including this
_Section 5.05_ ), provide such assistance as the other parties hereto may
reasonably request in connection with the taking of the actions contemplated
by this _Section 5.05_, including supplying the other parties hereto with
any information that such other parties may reasonably request in order to
effectuate the taking of such actions. Each party hereto will consult and
cooperate with the other parties and, to the extent reasonably
practicable, permit the other parties hereto a reasonable opportunity to
review and discuss in advance, and will consider the views of the other
parties in connection with, any filing, analysis, appearance, presentation,
memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental
Entity or by any Law, in connection with any such request, inquiry,
investigation or legal Proceeding, each party hereto will permit authorized
Representatives of the other parties to be present at each meeting or
conference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation or legal
Proceeding and to have access to and, to the extent practicable, be consulted
in advance in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or
submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with such request, inquiry,
investigation or legal Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties
hereto shall be permitted to redact any correspondence, filing or
communication (x) to the extent such correspondence, filing or communication
contains references concerning the valuation of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, the Offer and the Merger or (y) as necessary to address
reasonable privilege concerns. Parent and the Company may, as each deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to the other under this _Section 5.05_ as "Antitrust
Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the information contained therein
shall be given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will
not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors
of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the
source of the materials (Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its
legal counsel. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the foregoing, the
terms of this _Section 5.05_ shall not apply with respect to matters that
are the subject of _Section 5.13_.

  



  

   

54

 



    



  

Section 5.06   _Public Announcements_. The initial press release issued
by Parent and the Company announcing the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be a joint
press release in a form reasonably agreed to by the parties hereto, and
thereafter, except with respect to any public statement by the Company with
respect to any Change of Company Recommendation, Parent and the Company shall
consult with each other before issuing or otherwise making, and give each
other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other
public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable
Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange;  _provided_ that each of the Company and Parent may make
any public statements in response to questions by the press,
analysts, investors or analyst or investor calls, so long as such statements
are not inconsistent with previous statements made jointly by the Company and
Parent (or made by one party after having consulted with the other party). In
addition, unless a Change of Company Recommendation has occurred, the Company
shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with Parent regarding the
form and content of any public disclosure of any material developments or
matters involving the Company, including earnings releases and regulatory
matters, reasonably in advance of publication and release.

  



  

Section 5.07   _Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

  



  

(a) _Indemnification_. From and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each current or former director or officer of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries and each such person who performed services at the
request of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (each an "
_Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), in
each case as provided in the Company Organizational Documents or the
Organizational Documents of such Company Subsidiary, as applicable, or in any
contractual indemnification agreements that are listed on _Section 5.07(a)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter, in each case as in effect as of the date of
this Agreement, against (i) all losses, reasonable and documented expenses
(including, if and to the extent provided for in the Company Organizational
Documents or the Organizational Documents of any Company Subsidiary,
as applicable, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any covered matter), judgments, fines, claims, damages
or liabilities or amounts paid in settlement, arising out of actions or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and whether asserted
or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time) to the extent that they
are based on or arise out of the fact that such person is or was a director or
officer or performed services at the request of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Liabilities_ "), and (ii)
all Indemnified Liabilities to the extent they are based on or arise out of
or pertain to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, and including
any reasonable and documented expenses incurred in enforcing such person's
rights under this _Section 5.07_.

  



  

   

55

 



    



  

(b)   _Insurance_. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts
to, prior to the Effective Time, and if the Company is unable to, the
Surviving Corporation shall use reasonable best efforts to, promptly following
the Effective Time, obtain and fully pay the premium for an insurance and
indemnification policy (the " _D andO Insurance_") that provides coverage for a
period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time for events occurring
prior to the Effective Time from the Company's insurers or insurance carriers
with the same or better credit ratings as the Company's current insurance
carriers with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability not less
favorable in the aggregate to the Indemnified Parties than the
Company's existing directors' and officers' liability insurance policy;
_provided_ , that in no event shall the premium of the DandO Insurance exceed
300% of the current aggregate annual premium of the Company's existing policy
in place at the time of Closing (the " _Cap_ ") without the prior written
consent of Parent; _provided further_ that if the premium of such DandO
Insurance coverage would exceed the Cap, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain
a policy with the greatest coverage reasonably available for a cost not
exceeding the Cap.

  



  

(c)   _Successors_. In the event the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with
or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in
either such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors,
assigns or transferees of the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall assume
the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.07_.

  



  

(d)   _Benefit_. The provisions of this _Section 5.07_ are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party, each Indemnified Party's heirs, executors or administrators
and each Indemnified Party's Representatives, and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Parent, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation and shall not be amended in a manner that is adverse to any
Indemnified Parties (including their successors, assigns and heirs) without
the consent of the Indemnified Party (including the successors, assigns and
heirs) affected thereby.

  



  

(e)   _Non-Exclusivity_. The provisions of this _Section 5.07_
are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any Indemnified Party may have by
Contract or otherwise.

  



  

Section 5.08 _Takeover Statutes_. The parties shall use all reasonable
efforts (a) to take all action reasonably necessary so that no
Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to restrict or prohibit the
Transactions or the transactions contemplated by the Tender and Support
Agreement and (b) if any Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable, or
purports to be applicable, to restrict or prohibit any of the foregoing, to
take all action as is reasonably necessary so that such Transaction or
the transactions contemplated by the Tender and Support Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize (to the greatest extent
practicable) the effects of such Takeover Statute on such Transaction or the
Tender and Support Agreement.

  



  

   

56

 



    



  

Section 5.09   _Employee Benefit Matters_.

  



  

(a)  Subject to the last sentence of this _Section 5.09(a)_,
from and after the Effective Time and for a period ending on the first
anniversary of the Effective Time (the " _Benefit Protection Period_ "),
Parent shall provide or cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, to provide to each individual who is an employee of the
Company or a Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time
(each, a " _Company Employee_ ") (i) base salary or base wages, target annual
cash bonus and commission opportunities (excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, any equity based compensation opportunities and any retention bonus or
special one-time payments) that are no less favorable than those provided to
such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) severance
benefits to each Company Employee that are no less favorable than the
severance benefits that would have been provided in accordance with the
Company's severance plans or policies applicable to such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, as set forth on _Section
5.09(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter and (iii) retirement and health and
welfare benefits (including paid-time off) to each Company Employee that are
no less favorable, in the aggregate, to those provided to such Company
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time or, in Parent's discretion,
are substantially comparable to those made available to similarly situated
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries. Nothing herein shall be deemed to
be a guarantee of employment for any current or former employee of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, or, other than as provided in any
applicable employment agreement or other Contract, to restrict the right of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment of any such
employee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any terms and conditions of
employment for those Company Employees covered under a Collective Bargaining
Agreement shall be as provided under such Collective Bargaining Agreement or
as otherwise agreed between the Company and the applicable labor union.

  



  

(b)  Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.09(a)_, from
and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Corporation, to, assume and honor the Company's and
the Company Subsidiaries' employment, severance, retention, cash incentive
compensation and termination plans, policies, programs, agreements and
arrangements in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, in each
case, in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, including such terms pertaining to any right to amend or
terminate.

  



  

(c)  Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries, including
the Surviving Corporation, to, provide each Company Employee who participates
in the Company's annual cash incentive program for the 2019 calendar year a
payment (if unpaid prior to the Closing) no less than that due with respect
to such Company Employee's annual bonus under such program in accordance with
the terms thereof determined based on actual achievement of target performance
goals for the 2019 calendar year as determined by the Company's board of
directors.

  



  

   

57

 



    



  

(d) For all purposes (including for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate), level of benefits, entitlement to
benefits, vesting and benefit accruals (but not for purposes of defined
benefit pension plan accruals) under any "employee benefit plan" (as such
term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, but without regard to whether
the applicable plan is subject to ERISA) and any other employee benefit plan,
program, policy or arrangement maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, in which a Company Employee
is first eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time, including
any vacation, paid time off and severance plans, but excluding, for
the avoidance of doubt, any employee benefit plans that are frozen or
grandfathered as of the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company
Employee's service with or otherwise credited by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary shall be treated as service with Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation under the New Plans to the
same extent such service was recognized by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary under the analogous Company Benefit Plan in which such Company
Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in any duplication of benefits; _provided further_ ,
that such service will not be recognized for purposes of eligibility for
retirement vesting under the equity incentive plans of Parent.

  



  

(e)  Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries, including
the Surviving Corporation, to, waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting
periods under any New Plan providing welfare benefits, except to the extent
that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work
requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived
under the comparable Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, to use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize, or cause to
be recognized, the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar
expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) under such Company Benefit Plan during the calendar year in
which the Company Employee first becomes eligible to participate in a New
Plan, for purposes of satisfying such year's deductible and co-payment
limitations under the New Plan (to the same extent such credit was given under
the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time), subject to
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries timely providing adequate data to
Parent, in a format reasonably required by Parent.

  



  

(f)  If requested by Parent in writing delivered to the Company
not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the
Company's board of directors or appropriate committee shall adopt resolutions
and take such corporate action as is reasonably necessary to terminate each
Company Benefit Plan that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement
within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (collectively, the "
_Company 401(k) Plan_ "), effective as of the day prior to the Effective
Time. In the event Parent requests that the Company 401(k) Plan be terminated,
Parent shall take any and all actions as may be required, including
amendments to the Company 401(k) Plan or Parent's applicable 401(k) plan (the
" _Parent 401(k) Plan_ "), to (i) provide that Company Employees shall be
eligible to participate in the Parent 401(k) Plan, effective as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time, and (ii) permit the Company
Employees who are then actively employed to make rollover contributions of
"eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of
the Code) in the form of cash, notes (in the case of loans) or a combination
thereof from the Company 401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan.

  



  

   

58

 



    



  

(g)  If requested by Parent in writing delivered to the Company
not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective Time (with such
request to be made only in the event Parent does not request that the Company
401(k) Plan be terminated pursuant to _Section 5.09(f)_), the Company's
board of directors or appropriate committee shall adopt resolutions and take
such corporate action as is reasonably necessary to delegate plan
administration authority for any Company Benefit Plans that are qualified or
non-qualified retirement plans to Parent's Employee Benefits Plans
Administrative Committee and investment authority for such plans to Parent's
Employee Benefit Plans Investment Committee, effective as of the Closing Date
and contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Time. To the extent such
delegation of authority described in the preceding sentence is requested by
Parent, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence of such delegation (the
form and substance of which shall be subject to review and approval by
Parent) not later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time.

  



  

(h)  Prior to making any widely distributed written or orally
binding communications to the Company Employees pertaining to material
compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy
of the intended communication and a reasonable period of time to review and
comment on the communication, and shall consider any such comments in good
faith.

  



  

(i)  The Company shall provide Parent with an update to
_Section 3.02(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter within three (3) Business
Days prior to the anticipated Acceptance Time, to reflect any changes
occurring between the date of this Agreement and the applicable date of
delivery of such updated schedule.

  



  

(j)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall (i) be treated as an amendment of any Company Benefit Plan,
(ii) give any employee or former employee or any other individual associated
therewith or any employee benefit plan or trustee thereof or any other third
person any right to enforce the provisions of this _Section 5.09_, (iii)
obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their affiliates to (A)
maintain any particular benefit plan, except in accordance with the terms of
such plan, or (B) retain the employment of any particular employee or (iv)
subject to the requirements of this _Section 5.09_, limit the right of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of the Company Subsidiaries to
amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Company Benefit Plan following the
Effective Time.

  



  

Section 5.10   _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement,
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, shall be paid by the party incurring such expense.

  



  

Section 5.11   _Rule 16b-3 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall, to the extent necessary, take all such actions as may be
required to cause any dispositions of equity securities of the Company
(including derivative securities) resulting from the Transactions by any
officer or director of the Company who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the
Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to
the fullest extent permitted by Law.

  



  

   

59

 



    



  

Section 5.12 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company will take all such steps as may be required (a) to cause to be exempt
under Rule 14d-10(d) promulgated under the Exchange Act any employment
compensation, severance or employee benefit arrangements entered into on or
after the date of this Agreement by the Company, any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any affiliate of Parent with current or future directors,
officers or employees of the Company or its subsidiaries, in each case under
which any such person could become entitled to (i) any additional
compensation, enhanced severance or other benefits or any acceleration of the
time of payment or vesting of any compensation, severance or other benefits or
any funding of any compensation or benefits by the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, as a result of the Offer or (ii) any other compensation
or benefits from the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries related to or
contingent upon or the value of which would be calculated on the basis of the
Offer, and (b) to ensure that any such arrangements fall within the safe
harbor provisions of such rule.

  



  

Section 5.13   _Shareholder Litigation_. The Company shall promptly
notify Parent (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) upon becoming
aware of any litigation commenced against it or any of its directors, officers
or affiliates, relating to this Agreement or the Transactions and shall keep
Parent promptly and reasonably informed regarding any such litigation.
The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense
or settlement of any shareholder litigation against the Company and its
directors relating to this Agreement and the Transactions, including the
opportunity to review and comment on all filings or responses to be made by
the Company in connection with any such litigation, and the Company shall in
good faith take Parent's views into account. The Company agrees that it shall
not settle or offer to settle any action commenced prior to or after the date
of this Agreement against the Company or its directors, executive officers or
similar persons by any shareholder of the Company relating to this Agreement,
the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions without the prior written
consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

  



  

Section 5.14   _Parent Vote_. As soon as practicable after execution of
this Agreement by the parties hereto, Parent will approve and adopt this
Agreement in accordance with applicable Law as the sole stockholder of Sub.

  



  

Section 5.15   _Advice of Changes_. The Company and Parent shall each
(a) as promptly as practicable, advise the other party of any notice or other
written communication received from any counterparty to any Company Material
Contract with regard to any action, consent, approval or waiver that is
required to be taken or obtained with respect to such Company Material
Contract in connection with the consummation of the Transactions (and provide
a copy thereof), (b) as promptly as practicable, advise the other party of
any notice or other written communication from any other person alleging that
the consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions (and provide a copy thereof) or (c) use reasonable best efforts
to, as promptly as practicable, advise the other party upon receiving any
written communication from any Governmental Entity or third party whose
consent or approval is required for consummation of the Transactions that
causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any
such consent or approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such
consent or approval will be materially delayed.

Section 5.16   _Repayment of Debt_.

  



  

(a)  From and after the date of this Agreement, and through the
earlier of the Closing and the date on which this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with _Article VII_, the Company shall, and shall cause each of
the Company Subsidiaries and each of its and their Representatives to, use
their respective reasonable best efforts to provide all cooperation as may be
reasonably requested by Parent to assist Parent in any repayment of the
Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' debt obligations at or following the
Closing, including in each case taking all customary actions as may be
necessary or desirable to effect any such transactions.

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall this
_Section 5.16_ (i) except with respect to the fees, costs and expenses of
external counsel, require the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to
agree to or to pay any fees, incur or reimburse any costs or expenses, or
make any payment, prior to the occurrence of the Closing or otherwise incur
any liability relating to any such repayment that is effective prior to the
occurrence of the Closing, in each case to the extent Parent does not agree
to reimburse such amounts or (ii) require the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to execute or deliver any certificate, document, instrument or
Contract that is effective prior to the Closing (or that would be effective
if the Closing does not occur), other than customary payoff letters.

  



  

Section 5.17   _Resignations_. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent resignations executed by each

Article VII

  

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

  



  

Section 7.01   _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the Acceptance Time, only as follows:

  



  

(a)  by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

  



  

(b)  by either the Company or Parent, if the Acceptance Time
shall not have occurred on or before the date that is six (6) months after
the date of this Agreement (such date, the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if on the Outside Date the condition set forth in _clause _
_(b)_ or _clause (c)(i)_ of _Annex II_ (with respect to _clause (c)(i)_ ,
only as a result of a Judgment relating to an Antitrust Law) shall not have
been satisfied or, to the extent permitted by Law, waived by the party
entitled to waive such condition, then the Outside Date shall be extended
to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of this Agreement if
either Parent or the Company notifies the other, as applicable, on or prior
to the date that is six (6) months after the date of this Agreement of its
election to so extend the Outside Date; _provided_ _further_ that the right
to extend the Outside Date shall not be available to any party if the failure
of the condition set forth in _clause_ _(b)_ or  _clause (c)(i)_ of _Annex
II_ (with respect to _clause (c)(i)_ , only as a result of a Judgment
relating to an Antitrust Law) to be satisfied was due to the material breach
of such party of its obligations set forth in _Section 5.05_ (it being
understood that Parent and Sub shall be deemed a single party for purposes of
the foregoing proviso); _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this  _Section 7.01(b)_ shall not be available to any party if the
failure of the Acceptance Time to occur was due to the material breach of
such party of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of such
party set forth in this Agreement (it being understood that Parent and Sub
shall be deemed a single party for purposes of the foregoing proviso);

  



  

(c)  by either the Company or Parent, if the Offer Termination
shall have occurred;

  



  

(d)  by either the Company or Parent, if any Governmental Entity
of competent jurisdiction shall have issued or entered any Judgment that
permanently enjoins, restrains, prohibits or makes illegal the Offer or the
Merger, and such Judgment shall have become final and non-appealable;
_provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
7.01(d)_ shall not be available to any party if such Judgment was due to the
material breach of such party of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of such party set forth in this Agreement (it being understood that
Parent and Sub shall be deemed a single party for purposes of the foregoing
proviso);

  



  

(e)  by Parent, if (i) the Company shall have failed to include
the Company Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 or shall have effected a
Change of Company Recommendation or (ii) the Company has materially violated
or materially breached its obligations under _Section 5.03_;

  



  

(f) by the Company, if the Company's board of directors shall
have effected a Change of Company Recommendation pursuant to _Section 5.03_
_(d)_ in order to enter into a definitive acquisition agreement with respect
to a Superior Proposal concurrently therewith; _provided_ , that (i) the
Company has (A) complied with its obligations under _Section 5.03_ with
respect to such Superior Proposal in all but _de minimis_ respects and (B)
otherwise complied with its obligations under _Section 5.03_ in all material
respects and (ii) the Company pays Parent the Company Termination Fee pursuant
to _Section 7.02(b) _prior to, or concurrently with, such termination;

  



  

   

62

 



    



   

(g)  by Parent, if: (i)(A) there is an inaccuracy in the
Company's representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or (B)
the Company has failed to perform its covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement, in either case such that the conditions set forth in _clause
(c)(ii)_ or _(c)(iii)_ of _Annex II_ would not be satisfied; (ii) Parent
shall have delivered to the Company written notice of such inaccuracy or
failure to perform; and (iii) either such inaccuracy or failure to perform is
not capable of cure prior to the Outside Date or at least thirty (30) days
shall have elapsed since the date of delivery of such written notice to the
Company (or, if earlier than the end of such thirty (30) day period, the
Outside Date) and such inaccuracy or failure to perform shall not have been
cured; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be permitted to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.01(g)_ if the
inaccuracy of the representations or warranties of Parent or Sub contained in
this Agreement or Parent's or Sub's failure to perform its covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement would prevent Parent or Sub from
consummating the Transactions;

  



  

(h)  by the Company, if (i)(A) there is an inaccuracy in
Parent's or Sub's representations or warranties contained in this Agreement
or (B) Parent or Sub have failed to perform its covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement, in either case that would prevent Parent or Sub
from consummating the Transactions; (ii) the Company shall have delivered to
Parent written notice of such inaccuracy or failure to perform; and (iii)
either such inaccuracy or failure to perform is not capable of cure prior to
the Outside Date or at least thirty (30) days shall have elapsed since the
date of delivery of such written notice to Parent (or, if earlier than the
end of such thirty (30) day period, the Outside Date) and such inaccuracy or
failure to perform shall not have been cured; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 7.01(h)_ if the inaccuracy of the representations or warranties
of the Company contained in this Agreement or the Company's failure to
perform its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement is such that
a condition contained in _clause (c)(ii)_ or _(iii)_ of _Annex II_ would not
be satisfied;

  



  

Section 7.02   _Effect of Termination_.

  



  

(a)  In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the
Company or Parent as provided in _Section 7.01_, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the
part of Parent, Sub or the Company or their respective Subsidiaries, officers
or directors, in either case, except (i) with respect to the last sentence of
_Section 1.01(a)(iv)_, the last sentence of _Section 1.02(b)_, the last
sentence of  _Section 5.04_, _Section 5.10_, this _Section 7.02, Section
7.03_, _Section 7.04_ and _Article VIII_ and (ii) with respect to any
liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by a party as a result of the
fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful breach of any representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

   

63

 



    



  

(b)  In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

  



  

(i)  by (A) Parent pursuant to and in accordance with _Section
7.01(e)_ or (B) the Company pursuant to and in accordance with _Section
7.01(f)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee, within two
(2) Business Days following the date of such termination by Parent pursuant to
_clause (A)_ , or prior to or concurrently with such termination by the
Company pursuant to _clause (B)_ , the Company Termination Fee; _provided_
 that if either the Company or Parent (as applicable) terminates this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(b)_ or _Section 7.01(c)_ at any time
after Parent would have been permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.01(e)_, this Agreement shall be deemed terminated pursuant to
_Section 7.01(e)_ for purposes of this _Section 7.02(b)(i)_; or

  



  

(ii)  (A) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section
7.01(b)_,  _Section 7.01(c)_ or _Section 7.01(g)_ , (B) after the execution
of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement, a Pre-
Termination Competing Proposal Event shall have occurred, and (C) within
twelve (12) months after the termination of this Agreement, the Company shall
have (x) entered into a definitive agreement with respect to any Competing
Proposal (whether or not involving the same Competing Proposal) and
such Competing Proposal is subsequently consummated, or (y) otherwise
consummated a Competing Proposal within such period, then the Company shall
pay to Parent or its designee, concurrently with the consummation of such
Competing Proposal, the Company Termination Fee; _provided_ that for purposes
of this _Section 7.02(b)(ii)_ _(C)_ , the term "Competing Proposal" shall
have the meaning assigned to such term in clauses (a)(i) and (b) of the
definition of "Competing Proposal", except that all percentages therein shall
be changed to "50%".

  



  

(c)  Except in the case of fraud, intentional misrepresentation
or willful breach, the parties hereby acknowledge and agree that in the event
that the Company Termination Fee is paid by the Company to Parent pursuant to
and in accordance with _Section 7.02(b)_, the Company Termination Fee shall
be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of Parent and Sub for any and all
losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Sub, or any of their
respective affiliates, stockholders or Representatives in connection with
this Agreement (and the termination of this Agreement), the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or
the termination of this Agreement.

  



  

(d) Each of the Company, Parent and Sub acknowledges that (i)
the agreements contained in this _Section 7.02_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) without these
agreements, Parent, Sub and the Company would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner the Company
Termination Fee when due pursuant to _Section 7.02(b)_, and, in order to
obtain the Company Termination Fee, Parent or its affiliates commence a suit
that results in a judgment against the Company for the Company Termination
Fee or any portion thereof, then (x) the Company shall reimburse Parent for
all costs and expenses (including disbursements and reasonable fees of
counsel) incurred in connection with the collection of the
Company Termination Fee and (y) the Company shall pay to Parent interest on
such amount from and including the date payment of such amount was due to,
but excluding, the date of actual payment, at the prime rate set forth in The
Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made plus five percent (5%). Each of the parties hereto further acknowledges
that the Company Termination Fee is not intended to be a penalty, but rather
is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in
the circumstances in which such Company Termination Fee is due and
payable and which do not involve fraud, intentional misrepresentation or
willful breach, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount
would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In no event
shall the Company be required to pay to Parent more than one Company
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.02(b)_.

  



  

   

64

 



    



  

Section 7.03   _Amendment_. Subject to _Section 5.07(d)_, this
Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented in any and all respects
by the Company, Parent and Sub by action taken by or on behalf of their
respective boards of directors at any time prior to the Effective Time which,
subject to the following proviso, shall not require the approval or consent
of any holders of Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after the Acceptance
Time, no amendment may be made which, by Law or in accordance with the rules
of any relevant stock exchange, requires approval by the holders of Shares
without obtaining such approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto.

  



  

Section 7.04   _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent
and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
other, (b) waive any breach or inaccuracy of the representations and
warranties of the other contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance by the other with any of
the covenants, agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after the Acceptance Time, there may not be any
extension or waiver of this Agreement that decreases the Merger Consideration
or that adversely affects the rights of the holders of Shares hereunder
without the approval of the holders of Shares at a duly convened meeting of
the holders of Shares called to obtain approval of such extension or waiver.
Any extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in writing, but such
extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver
of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

Section 8.03 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced in any
jurisdiction such term or provision (a) shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability, without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement and (b) shall not, solely by virtue thereof, be invalid or
unenforceable in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as

fullest extent permitted by applicable Law to the end that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to the extent possible.

the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties;
provided, however, that Parent or Sub may assign any or all of its rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement to any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent so long as any such assignment would not
delay or prevent the Transactions or adversely affect the Company's
securityholders, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Sub of their
obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any
purported assignment or transfer in violation of this _Section 8.05_ shall
be null and void.

  



  

Section 8.06   _Parties in Interest_. Except for (a) _Article II_,

Party, such Indemnified Party's heirs, executors or administrators and each
Indemnified Party's representatives, each of whom shall be an express third-
party beneficiary of this Agreement, Parent, Sub and the Company hereby agree
that their respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth in
this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other parties hereto, in

rights under this Agreement. The parties hereto further agree that the rights
of third-party beneficiaries under _clauses (a)_ and _(b)_ of the preceding

hereto has participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which each party
acknowledges is the result of extensive negotiations between the parties. If
an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no

"Sections," "Annexes" and "Exhibits" are intended to refer to Sections of this
Agreement and the Annexes and Exhibits to this Agreement. All references in

Agreement." The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. References in this Agreement to specific Laws or to
specific provisions of Laws shall include all rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, and any statute defined or referred to herein or in

from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including by succession
of comparable successor statutes. Any agreement or instrument referred to
herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means

expressly specified. References to "written" or "in writing" include in
electronic form. When calculating the period of time before which, within
which or after which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this

shall be excluded and (y) if the last day of such period is not a Business
Day, the period in question shall end on the next succeeding Business Day.
References to documents being "made available" or "delivered" shall mean that
any such document was posted as of 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the date that
is two (2) Business Days prior to the date hereof in the electronic data room

Disclosure Letter.

  



  

Section 8.08   _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial
by Jury_.

  



  

(a)  This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether
at Law, in contract or in tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise
out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance hereof, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of
conflicts of Law, except to the extent the Laws of Michigan are mandatorily
applicable to the Transactions.

  



  

(b)  Each of the parties irrevocably agrees that any legal
Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any other
party or its successors or assigns shall be brought and determined in
the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within
the State of Delaware (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery shall decline to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, in which case, in any Delaware
state or federal court within the State of Delaware), and each of the parties
hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the
aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its property, generally and
unconditionally, with regard to any such Proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of the parties agrees not to commence any Proceeding relating
thereto except in the courts described above in Delaware, other than actions
in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or
award rendered by any such court in Delaware as described in this Agreement.
Each of the parties further agrees that notice as provided in this Agreement
shall constitute sufficient service of process, and the parties further waive
any argument that such service is insufficient. Each of the parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as described in this Agreement for any
reason, (ii) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of
any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) that (A)
the Proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the
venue of such Proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject
matter of this Agreement, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

(c)  EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY
WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
(I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (III)
IT MAKES THE FOREGOING WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS  _Section 8.08(_ _c)_.

  



  

Section 8.09   _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by
facsimile or by electronic delivery in .pdf format shall be sufficient to
bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  



  

   

69

 



    



  

Section 8.10   _Specific Performance_.

  



  

(a)  The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed, or
were threatened to be not performed, in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. In the event that any action is brought in
equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no party shall allege, and
each party hereby waives the defense or counterclaim, that there is an
adequate remedy at law. If on the Outside Date, there is a pending Proceeding
that has been brought by a party hereto seeking the remedies provided for in
this _Section 8.10_, then, without further action, the Outside Date shall be
automatically extended until the date that is five (5) Business Days after the
dismissal, settlement or entry of a final order with respect to such
Proceeding.

  



  

(b)  Each of the parties agrees that, (i) the seeking of
remedies pursuant to this _Section 8.10_ shall not in any way constitute a
waiver by any party seeking such remedies of its right to seek any other form
of relief that may be available to it under this Agreement, including under
_Section 7.02_, in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in
the event that the remedies provided for in this _Section 8.10_ are not
available or otherwise are not granted, (ii) nothing set forth in this
Agreement shall require a party to institute any Proceeding for (or limit a
party's right to institute any Proceeding for) specific performance under
this _Section 8.10_ prior, or as a condition, to exercising any termination
right under _Article VII_ (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor
shall the commencement of any Proceeding seeking remedies pursuant to this
_Section 8.10_ or anything set forth in this _Section 8.10_ restrict or
limit a party's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms
of _Article VII_ or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may
be available then or thereafter and (iii) no party shall require the other to
post any bond or other security as a condition to institute any Proceeding for

of the word "material" in the term "Company Material Contract"), shall not
have been true and correct, except for any failure of such representations
and warranties to be true and correct that would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect; (ii) the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in _Section 3.01(a)_, _Section 3.01(c)_ (only with
respect to Material Subsidiaries), _Section 3.02(a)_, _Section 3.02(b)_ ,

first sentence of _Section 3.01(b)_ (only with respect to Material
Subsidiaries), _Section 3.02(d)_ (other than clause (i) thereof), _Section
3.03(b)_ (other than clause (i) thereof and only with respect to Material
Subsidiaries) and _Section 3.27_ shall not have been true and correct in all
material respects; and (iv) the representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in _Section 3.10(c)_ shall not have been true and correct in all
respects; in the case of each of _clause (i)_ , _(ii)_ , _(iii)_ and _(iv)_

states provides that consents, authorizations or approvals will not be
delivered or issued until consummation of the Closing, Parent shall not have
received assurances, reasonably satisfactory to Parent, from the applicable
governmental entity in each such state that such consents, authorizations or
approvals will be delivered or otherwise issued promptly after the Closing;
_provided_ , that the condition set forth in this clause _(vi)(A)_
shall not be deemed to have not been satisfied if the sole reason for
Parent's failure to receive any such consent, authorization or approval (or
such assurances that such consent, authorization or approval will be issued
promptly after the Closing) is the failure by Parent to have provided
information satisfactory to the applicable governmental entity that (i) solely
relates to Parent or its operations or (ii) is within the sole control of
Parent and that relates to the post-Closing operations of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary; _provided_ , _further_ that Parent shall have received
advance notice of such failure and a reasonable period of time (not to exceed

1.1(d)(C)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter shall have failed to have been
initially made within the timeframes set forth on _Section 1.1(d)(C)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of,
the rights of Parent and Sub to extend, terminate or modify the Offer
pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  



  

The foregoing conditions (other than the Minimum Tender Condition) are for
the sole benefit of Parent and Sub and, subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and applicable Law, may be waived by Parent and Sub, in
whole or in part, at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion
(other than the Minimum Tender Condition) at or prior to the expiration of the
Offer. The failure by Parent or Sub at any time to exercise any of the
foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, and each such
right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and
from time to time.

similar governing documents) of Parent or Sub; (b) require any consent,
approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any

or provisions of any Contract or Permit to which Parent or Sub is a party or
by which Parent or Sub or any of their respective assets or properties are
bound; or (d) violate any order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or

respective obligations hereunder or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby on a timely basis.

certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or other similar governing documents)
of such Shareholder; (b) require any consent, approval, authorization
or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any supranational, national,
foreign, federal, state or local government or subdivision thereof, or

give rise to any such right) under any of the terms, conditions or provisions
of any Contract or Permit to which such Shareholder is a party or by which
such Shareholder's Subject Shares are bound; (d) result (or, with the giving
of notice, the passage of time or otherwise, would result) in the creation or

violate any order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or
regulation applicable to such Shareholder or by which any of such

material adverse effect on the ability of such Shareholder to perform his or
its obligations hereunder or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby on a timely basis.

  



  

Section 2.03   _Subject Shares_. Such Shareholder is the record and
beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of the
Subject Shares listed on _Schedule A_ opposite such Shareholder's name, and,

constitute all of the shares of Company Common Stock or other securities of
the Company of which such Shareholder is the record or beneficial owner (as
defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act). Other than as set forth on
_Schedule A_ , such Shareholder does not own any options to purchase or
otherwise acquire any securities of the Company, and has no interest in or
voting rights with respect to any securities of the Company. Such Shareholder
has good and marketable title to all such Subject Shares free and clear

any such Encumbrance that may be imposed pursuant to (a) this Agreement and
(b) any applicable restrictions on transfer under the Securities Act or any
state securities law (collectively, " _Permitted Encumbrances_ "). Except

voting of such Subject Shares that would prevent such Shareholder from
complying with his or its obligations under this Agreement, except as
provided hereunder.

Section 3.02   _Other Obligations_. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement (including _Section 5.01_ ), each Shareholder hereby agrees that,
during the time this Agreement is in effect, to the extent that any of such
Shareholder's Subject Shares have not been purchased in the Offer, at any
annual or special meeting of the shareholders of the Company, however called,
including any adjournment or postponement thereof, such Shareholder shall, in
each case to the fullest extent that such Shareholder's Subject Shares are
entitled to vote thereon: (a) appear at each such meeting or otherwise cause

determining a quorum; and (b) be present (in person or by proxy) and vote, or
cause to be voted, all of his or its Subject Shares, (i) against any action,
proposal, transaction or agreement that would reasonably be expected to (A)
result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other
obligation or agreement of the Company contained in the Merger Agreement, or
of any Shareholder contained in this Agreement or (B) result in any of
the conditions set forth in Article VI or Annex II of the Merger Agreement
not being satisfied on or before the Outside Date; (ii) against any agreement

transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, sale, consolidation or other
business combination involving the Company (other than the Merger); (y) a
sale, lease, license or transfer of a material amount of assets of the
Company or any reorganization, recapitalization, extraordinary dividend or
liquidation of the Company; or (z) any change in the present capitalization
of the Company or any amendment or other change to the Company Organizational
Documents (in the case of each of clauses (x), (y) and (z), solely to the
extent the Company is prohibited from taking such action pursuant to the
Merger Agreement); and (iv) in favor of (A) the approval of the adoption of
the Merger Agreement and the Transactions contemplated thereunder and (B) any
other matter necessary for consummation of the Transactions, which is
considered at any such meeting of shareholders, and in connection therewith to

appropriate in order to effectuate the foregoing.

  



  

Section 3.03   _Proxy_. Each Shareholder, revoking (or causing to be
revoked) any proxies that it has heretofore granted, hereby
irrevocably appoints Parent, and any other person designated by Parent, with
full power of substitution, as attorney-in-fact and proxy for and on behalf
of such Shareholder, for and in the name, place and stead of such Shareholder,
to (a) attend any and all shareholder meetings of the Company with respect to
the matters set forth in _Section 3.02_ ; and (b) vote, express consent or
dissent with respect to the Subject Shares in accordance with the provisions

coupled with an interest, is irrevocable and shall not be terminated by
operation of law or upon the occurrence of any other event other than the
valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 5.01_. Each
Shareholder hereby affirms that the irrevocable proxy set forth in this
_Section 3.03_ is given in connection with and granted in consideration of
and as an inducement to Parent and Sub entering into the Merger Agreement and
that such irrevocable proxy is given to secure the obligations of such
Shareholder under _Section 3.02_ hereof. The irrevocable proxy set forth in
this _Section 3.03_  is executed and intended to be irrevocable, subject,
however, to automatic termination, upon the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 5.01_. Each Shareholder agrees to take such
further action or execute such other instruments as may be necessary to
effectuate the intent of this proxy. Parent agrees not to exercise the proxy

Article IV 
 ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

  



  

Each Shareholder hereby covenants and agrees that until the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with _Section 5.01_ :

  



  

Section 4.01   _No Transfer; No Inconsistent Arrangements_. Except as
provided hereunder, from and after the date hereof and until this Agreement
is terminated in accordance with _Section 5.01_ , such Shareholder shall not,
directly or indirectly, (a) create or permit to exist any Lien, other than
Permitted Liens, on any of such Shareholder's Subject Shares, (b)
transfer, sell, assign, gift, hedge, pledge or otherwise dispose of (whether
by sale, liquidation, dissolution, dividend or distribution), or enter into
any derivative arrangement with respect to (collectively, " _Transfer_ "), any
of such Shareholder's Subject Shares, or any right or interest therein (or
consent to any of the foregoing), (c) enter into any Contract, option or
other agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to any Transfer of
such Shareholder's Subject Shares or any right or interest therein, (d) grant
or permit the grant of any proxy, power-of-attorney or other authorization or
consent in or with respect to any of such Shareholder's Subject Shares, (e)
deposit or permit the deposit of any of such Shareholder's Subject Shares
into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or arrangement with
respect to any of such Shareholder's Subject Shares or (f) take or permit any
other action that would in any way restrict, limit or interfere with the
performance of such Shareholder's obligations hereunder or the transactions
contemplated hereby or otherwise make any representation or warranty of such
Shareholder herein untrue or incorrect in any material respect. Any action
taken in violation of the foregoing sentence shall be null and void _ab
initio_ and such Shareholder agrees that any such prohibited action shall and
will be enjoined. In furtherance of this Agreement, concurrently herewith,
such Shareholder shall, and hereby authorizes Parent, Sub, the Company and
their respective counsel to, notify the Company's transfer agent that there is
a stop transfer order with respect to all of such Shareholder's Subject
Shares and that this Agreement places limits on the voting and transfer of
such Subject Shares. If any involuntary Transfer of any or all of such
Shareholder's Subject Shares shall occur (including, if applicable, a sale by
such Shareholder's trustee in any bankruptcy, or a sale to a purchaser at any
creditor's or court sale), the transferee (which term, as used herein, shall
include any and all transferees and subsequent transferees or the initial
transferee) shall take and hold such Subject Shares subject to all of the
restrictions, liabilities and rights under this Agreement, which shall
continue in full force and effect until valid termination of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Shareholder may Transfer Subject Shares to
one or more partners or members of such Shareholder or to an affiliated entity
under common control with such Shareholder or to any trustee or beneficiary
of the trust, _provided_ , that such a Transfer shall be permitted only if,
as a precondition, the transferee of such Subject Shares agrees in writing, to
accept such Subject Shares subject to the terms of this Agreement and to be
bound by the terms of this Agreement and to agree and acknowledge that such
person shall be deemed to constitute a Shareholder for all purposes of this
Agreement. If so requested by Parent, such Shareholder agrees that the
Subject Shares shall bear a legend stating that the respective Subject Shares
are subject to this Agreement, provided such legend shall be removed if the
Offer is terminated or withdrawn or the Merger Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms or if this Agreement is otherwise terminated in
accordance with the terms hereof.

Section 4.02   _Appraisal Rights_. Such Shareholder acknowledges that
he or it shall not have any dissenters' rights provided for in the MBCA in
connection with the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such
Shareholder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (a) agrees not to make a
written demand or file a petition for appraisal, and waives and agrees not to
exercise any appraisal, dissenters' or similar rights pursuant to Section 762
of the MBCA or otherwise in respect of such Shareholder's Subject Shares that
may arise in connection with the Offer or the Merger, and (b) agrees not to
commence or participate in, and to take all actions necessary to opt out of
any class in any class action with respect to, any claim, derivative or
otherwise, against the Company, Parent, Sub or any of their respective
successors or affiliates relating to the negotiation, execution or
delivery of this Agreement or the Merger Agreement, including any claim (x)
challenging the validity of or seeking to enjoin the operation of any
provision of this Agreement, other than claims or actions arising out of any
breach of this Agreement by Parent or Sub, or (y) alleging any breach of any
fiduciary duty of the Company's board of directors in connection with the
negotiation, execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger.

  



  

Section 4.03   _Documentation and Information_. Such Shareholder
consents to and hereby authorizes Parent, Sub and the Company to publish and
disclose in all documents and schedules filed with the SEC or any other
Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions, and any press
release or other disclosure document that Parent or Sub reasonably determines
to be necessary in connection with the Offer, the Merger and any other
Transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, such Shareholder's identity
and ownership of the Subject Shares, the existence of this Agreement and the
nature of such Shareholder's commitments and obligations under this
Agreement, and such Shareholder acknowledges that Parent and Sub may file this
Agreement or a form hereof with the SEC or with any other Governmental
Entity. Such Shareholder agrees to promptly give Parent any information it may
reasonably require for the preparation of any such disclosure documents, and
such Shareholder agrees to promptly notify Parent of any required
corrections with respect to any written information supplied by such
Shareholder specifically for use in any such disclosure document, if and to
the extent that any such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect.

  



  

Section 4.04   _Adjustments_. In the event of any stock split
(including a reverse stock split), stock dividend, distribution,
merger, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or the like of the
capital stock of the Company affecting the Subject Shares, the term "Subject
Shares" shall be deemed to refer to and include such shares, as well as all
such stock dividends and distributions and any securities into which or for
which any or all of such shares may be changed or exchanged or which
are received in the transaction.

Section 4.05 _No Solicitation_. Unless the Agreement has been
terminated, such Stockholder shall not take, or fail to take, any action
that would be a breach of Section 5.03(a) of the Merger Agreement if taken,
or not taken, by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement, such Shareholder and its Representatives and
affiliates may participate in discussions and negotiations with any person
(or its Representatives) from whom the Company has received a _bona fide_
written Competing Proposal that did not result from a breach of Section 5.03
of the Merger Agreement if and to the extent that (a) the Company is entitled
to, and is, engaging in discussions or negotiations with such person in
accordance with Section 5.03 of the Merger Agreement and (b) such
Shareholder's and its Representatives' negotiations and discussions are in
conjunction with the Company's discussions and negotiations and otherwise
comply with Section 5.03(a) of the Merger Agreement as if such Shareholder
and its Representatives were bound thereby. Each Shareholder shall not, and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its affiliates not to, make
any Competing Proposal.

  



  

Section 4.06   _Notice of Acquisitions_. Each Shareholder hereby agrees
to notify Parent as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours
after receipt) of the number of any additional shares of Company Common Stock
or other securities of the Company of which Shareholder acquires beneficial
ownership on or after the date hereof.

other action by any person, upon the first to occur of (a) the termination of
the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, (b) the Effective Time,
(c) the entry into any material amendment or modification to the Merger

Consideration (except as otherwise permitted under the Merger Agreement), (d)
the date the Offer shall have terminated or expired with no further
extensions or re-extensions of the Offer being permitted or required pursuant
to the Merger Agreement, in each case without acceptance for payment of the
Subject Shares pursuant to the Offer or (e) the mutual written consent of
Parent and such Shareholder. Upon termination of this Agreement, no party
shall have any further obligations or liabilities under this Agreement;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that (x) the provisions of this _Article V_ shall
survive any termination of this Agreement and (y) nothing set forth in this
_Section 5.01_ shall relieve any party from liability for any breach of this
Agreement prior to termination hereof.

_Schedule A_ , constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the

Section 5.04   _Amendments and Waivers_. Any provision of this
Agreement may be amended or waived, but only if such amendment or waiver is

exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall

of any other right hereunder.

  



  

Section 5.05   _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in
whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties
without the prior written consent of the other parties; _provided_ , that (a)

the case may be, of its obligations hereunder and (b) each Shareholder may
assign his or its rights and obligations to any person to whom the Subject
Shares are transferred in accordance with _Section 4.01_. This Agreement shall
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported
assignment not permitted under this _Section 5.05_ shall be null and void.

including monetary damages, each of the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this

and each party irrevocably waives any objection to the imposition of
such relief or any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or
posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

agrees that any Proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and
obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising

or its property, generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive personal
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any
Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby

his or its property, is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court
or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service
of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, any claim that (i) the Proceeding in such court
is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such Proceeding is

Section 5.10   _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or
causes of action (whether at Law, in contract or in tort or otherwise) that
may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the
negotiation, execution or performance hereof, shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware, except to
the extent the Laws of the State of Michigan are mandatorily applicable.

  



  

Section 5.11   _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Each of the parties
agrees that his or its respective representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other parties
hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and,

warranties set forth herein. The representations and warranties in

original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were
upon the same instrument, and shall become effective when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered (by
telecopy, electronic delivery or otherwise) to the other parties. Signatures
to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in
"portable document format" (".pdf") form, or by any other electronic means

Section 5.13 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement
which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction (a) shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining
terms and provisions of this Agreement and (b) shall not, solely by virtue
thereof, be invalid or unenforceable in any other jurisdiction. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, the parties shall negotiate in
good faith to determine a suitable and equitable provision to be substituted
therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the

substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever.

  



  

   

11

 



    



  

Section 5.16 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to an Article or Section, such reference shall be to an Article or
Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall
be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The words
"hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in
this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement, unless the context otherwise
requires. The word "since" when used in this Agreement in reference to a date
shall be deemed to be inclusive of such date. All terms defined in this
Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or
other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined
therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the
singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine
as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. References in
this Agreement to specific laws or to specific provisions of laws shall
include all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and any statute
defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument referred to
herein shall mean such statute as from time to time amended, modified
or supplemented, including by succession of comparable successor statutes.
Each of the parties has participated in the drafting and negotiation of this
Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises,
this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by all the parties, and
no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any
party by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Any
agreement or instrument referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument
that is referred to herein means such agreement or instrument as from time to
time amended, modified or supplemented, including by waiver or consent and

means calendar days unless Business Days are expressly specified. References
to "written" or "in writing" include in electronic form.

  



  

Section 5.17   _Capacity as a Shareholder_. Shareholder signs this
Agreement solely in Shareholder's capacity as a shareholder of the Company,
and not in Shareholder's capacity as a director, officer or employee of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary. Nothing herein shall in any way restrict
any Shareholder who is a director or officer of the Company in the exercise of
his or her fiduciary duties solely as a director or officer of the Company or
prevent or be construed to create any obligation on the part of any such
Shareholder from taking any action solely in his or her capacity as a director
or officer of the Company.

  



  

Section 5.18 _Further Assurances_. From time to time and without
additional consideration, each Shareholder shall execute and deliver, or cause
to be executed and delivered, such additional instruments, and shall take
such further actions, as Parent or Sub may reasonably request for the purpose
of carrying out and furthering the intent of this Agreement or as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable to effect the actions and consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
