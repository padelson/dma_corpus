paid and nonassessable share of common stock, no par value per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

  

### 

  

### (d) (i) Immediately following the Effective Time, each outstanding option
to purchase Shares (a " _Company Stock Option_ ") under the Company Option
Plans and the UK Option Plan, vested or unvested, shall be terminated in
exchange for the right to receive (A) the Initial Option Payment, and (B) the
Option Holdback Payments, if any. Any reference to Vested Options and
Unvested Options in this Agreement also refers to the right to receive the
Initial Option Payment and Option Holdback Payment into which such Options
were converted. Parent shall deliver (or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to deliver) to the holder of each Vested Option immediately
following the Effective Date, no later than ten (10) Business Days after the
Effective Time, a check for the Initial Option Payment, less applicable Taxes
required to be withheld with respect to such payment. The parties hereto
agree that to the extent that an Initial Option Payment and/or Option
Holdback Payment becomes due after the Closing Date with respect to Unvested
Options that become vested after the Closing Date as provided in this Section
3.1(d)(i), such payments in respect thereof shall be held by the Parent until
the Unvested Option Payment Date (as defined below) following expiration of
the applicable vesting periods. Following the end of each vesting period for
each such Unvested Option in which vesting of the underlying shares of such
Unvested Option would have occurred, the Company will pay, quarterly
in arrears on the fifth Business Day of the first month following the
applicable calendar quarter, and commencing on the first Business Day of the
first month following the calendar quarter that includes the Closing Date,
(each such quarterly date, an " _Unvested Option Payment Date_ ") the Initial
Option Payment and the Option Holdback Payments (in the case of the Option
Holdback Payments, to the extent and in the proportion that Option Holdback
Payments are eligible to be distributed to the holder of the Unvested Option
pursuant to Section 3.4) with respect to those Unvested Options that vested
during such calendar quarter, to the holder of such now Vested Option, less
applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. In the
event the employment of a holder of an Unvested Option terminates prior to
the vesting of such Unvested Option (or a portion thereof), the Parent shall
have no further obligations to make payments to such holder for any unvested
amounts, but the holder shall still be entitled to receive the Initial Option
Payment and the Option Holdback Payments (in the case of the Option Holdback
Payments, to the extent and in the

  

### 

  

### 17   

     
   

  

### 

  

### proportion that Option Holdback Payments are eligible to be distributed
to the holder of the Unvested Option pursuant to Section 3.4) with respect to
those Options, if any, that vested prior to or upon such termination of
employment during such calendar quarter on the applicable Unvested Option
Payment Date. Except as specifically provided above, following the Effective
Time, the foregoing rights shall be subject to the same terms and conditions
(including without limitation, exercise price, continued employment or other
services, vesting schedule and acceleration of vesting) that applied to the
related Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

### 

  

#### (ii) The Per Share Merger Consideration paid in respect of any share of
restricted stock set forth on Schedule 3.1(d)(ii) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule or issued pursuant to the early exercise of a Company Stock Option
(the " _Company Restricted Stock_ ") shall be paid (if, as and when the
components thereof are paid) into an escrow account held by the Company
governed by the same terms and conditions (including without limitation,
vesting, transfer restrictions and repurchase rights) as were applicable to
such share of Company Restricted Stock immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

  

### 

  

#### (iii) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the board of
directors and the compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions that are necessary (including, without
limitation, amending the Company Option Plans) to effectuate Section
3.1(d)(i) and 3.1(d)(ii). In addition, at least ten (10) Business Days prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide to Parent a copy of a
written acknowledgment and waiver (in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent) from holders of Company Stock Options to purchase at
least 90% of the Shares purchasable upon the exercise of all Company Stock
Options (other than Company Stock Options granted under the UK Option Plan)
and from each holder of shares of Company Restricted Stock (a) confirming the
number of Company Stock Options and/or shares of Company Restricted Stock
held, (b) confirming the termination of such Company Stock Options and the
treatment of shares of Company Restricted Stock pursuant to this Agreement,
(c) confirming that the consideration to be paid in respect of such Company
Stock Options and shares of Company Restricted Stock is correct, (d)
authorizing the withholding of all applicable taxes, and (e) containing such
other matters as Parent may reasonably require (an " _Acknowledgment and
Waiver_ ").

  

###

directors and/or the compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions that are necessary in relation to Company
Stock Options granted under the UK Option Plan (including, without
limitation, amending the UK Option Plan) to effectuate Section 3.1(d)(i) and
3.1(d)(ii). In addition, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall provide to Parent copies of a written
consent and waiver agreement (executed as a deed for English law purposes and
in form and substance

  

#### 

  

#### 18   

     
   

  

#### 

  

#### reasonably satisfactory to Parent) from holders of Company Stock Options
granted under the UK Option Plan to purchase at least 90% of the Shares
purchasable upon the exercise of all Company Stock Options granted under the
UK Option Plan (a) confirming the number of Company Stock Options granted
under the UK Option Plan, (b) agreeing to the termination of such Company
Stock Options immediately following the Effective Time on the basis set out
in Section 3.1(d)(i) and their waiver of any right to exercise such Company
Stock Options, whether vested or not, at or after the Effective Time, (c)
confirming that the consideration to be paid in respect of such Company Stock
Options, (d) authorizing the withholding of all applicable Taxes and
social security contributions including employees National Insurance
Contributions, and (e) containing such other matters as Parent may reasonably

### 

  

#### (v) The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that from and
after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be
required to deliver Shares or other capital stock of the Company to any
Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company Stock Options or Shares of
Company Restricted Stock after the Effective Time.

  

### 

  

#### (vi) All payments required to be made pursuant to this Section 3.1(d)
shall be made as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, commencing
on the first Business Day following the Effective Time. The parties
acknowledge and agree that Parent and its Affiliates shall be entitled to
receive any and all income tax deductions in respect of the cash payments
made in respect of the Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock
pursuant to Section 3.1(d)(i) and (ii).

  

### 

  

### (e) _Warrants and other Rights_. The Company shall take all action
necessary to ensure that (i) any rights, options, warrants or other rights or
agreements of any kind that obligate the Company to issue or sell any shares
of capital stock or other securities of the Company (other than Company Stock
Options) (" _Company Equity Rights_ "), that are outstanding and exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that have not been exercised or
cancelled prior thereto, shall terminate and be cancelled as of the Effective
Time and thereafter be of no further force or effect, and (ii) no Company
Equity Rights are granted after the date of this Agreement.

  

### 

  

## 3.2 _Payment for Shares_. (a) At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
or shall cause to be deposited with Computershare Shareholder Services, or a
bank or trust company designated by Parent with the Companys consent (the "
_Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares, an amount in
cash sufficient in the aggregate to provide all funds necessary for the
Paying Agent to make the Initial Per Share Payments pursuant to Section
3.1(a) in accordance with this Section 3.2 (such cash, as so deposited, the "
_Exchange Fund_ ").

  

### 

  

### 19   

      
  

  



  

### (b) _Paying Agent_. From and after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent
shall act as paying agent in effecting the exchange of the applicable Initial
Per Share Payment for Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding Shares of the Company and were converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration therefor pursuant to
Section 3.1(a). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no
event later than five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares
(other than holders of Excluded Shares) (A) a letter of transmittal
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent, such letter of
transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and
the Company may reasonably agree, and (B) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the applicable Initial Per
Share Payments. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to
the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax
withholdings) to which such holder is entitled, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall be cancelled forthwith. If payment is to be made to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, it
shall be a condition of such payment that the Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent that such tax was paid or is not
applicable. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon
due surrender of the Certificates.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Stock Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights_. Commencing at
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed,
and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares thereafter
on the records of the Company other than as required to comply with the terms
of this Agreement. At and after the Effective Time, each holder of a
Certificate shall cease to have rights as a Shareholder, except for the right
to surrender his or her Certificate in exchange for the applicable Per Share
Merger Consideration and no transfer of Shares shall be made on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, they shall
be cancelled and exchanged for the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration
as provided for herein.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Upon the 90th day following the
Closing Date, the Paying Agents duties shall terminate, and any cash
deposited in the account of the Paying Agent shall be transferred to an
account of Parent managed and held for the benefit of the holders of Shares.
Thereafter, any Shareholder who has not

  



  

20   

     
   

  



  

### theretofore exchanged its Shares in accordance with this Article III
shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the applicable Initial
Per Share Payment upon due surrender of their Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) and to Parent for the applicable Per Share Holdback
Payments, if any, in each case, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the
Shareholders Representative, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be
liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.

  

### 

  

### (f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and the execution by such Person of an indemnification
agreement for the benefit of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and their
respective agents, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Initial Per Share Payment to
be paid in respect of the Share represented thereby upon due surrender of and
deliverable in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificate pursuant
to this Agreement.

  

### 

  

## 3.3 _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, Shares that are owned by holders (" _Dissenting
Shareholders_ ") who have properly demanded and perfected dissenters rights
pursuant to the CGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), will not be exchangeable
for the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Dissenting Shareholders will
be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting
Shares in accordance with the CGCL, unless and until such holders fail to
perfect or effectively withdraw or lose their rights to appraisal and payment
under the CGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to
perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such rights, such holders
Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted
into and become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger
Consideration without any interest thereon. The Company will promptly give
Parent notice of any demands received by the Company for dissenters rights,
attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to applicable Law received by the Company with respect to its
Shareholders dissenters rights. Parent shall have the opportunity to direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demand for appraisal under
the CGCL. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to
any demands regarding appraisals of or payments for Dissenting Shares, offer

demands. The Company shall comply with its obligations pursuant to Section

to have a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) that, without the Knowledge of the
Company, have been caused by a party other than the Company or its

constitute a default under the provisions of any Material Contract, except in
each case for those violations and defaults

Customer intends to terminate or fail to renew a Major Customer Contract. The

2004 represents more than 60% of the Companys total revenue for such period.

material weaknesses in internal controls and (B) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Companys internal controls. The Company has made available to
Parent (i) a summary of all disclosure referenced by (A) and (B) above, made
by management to the Companys auditors and audit committee and (ii) any
other material communication made by management or the Companys auditors to
the audit committee required or contemplated by the audit committees
charter. No material complaints from any source regarding accounting,
internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and no concerns from
Company employees regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters, have
been received by the Company. The Company has made available to Parent a
summary of all material complaints or concerns relating to other matters
through the Companys whistleblower hot-line or equivalent system for receipt
of employee concerns regarding possible violations of Laws (as hereinafter
defined). No attorney representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether or not employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has

or similar violation by the Company or any of its officers, directors,
employees or agents to the Company Board or any committee thereof or to any
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

Schedule. Complete and accurate copies of all Company Benefit Plans listed on

instruments, insurance contracts and, with respect to any employee stock
ownership plan, loan agreements, forming a part of any Company Benefit Plans,
and all amendments thereto have been provided or made available to Parent.
Section 4.11(a)(2) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each
employee or other service provider covered by any change in control or

the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA (each, a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") and
Company NonU.S. Benefit Plans (collectively, " _Company U.S. Benefit Plans_
"), are in substantial compliance with ERISA, the Code and other applicable
Laws. Each Company U.S. Benefit Plan that is subject to ERISA (the " _Company
ERISA Plans_ ") that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning
of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a " _Company Pension Plan_ ") and that is intended
to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ")

Reconciliation Act of 2001 or has applied to the IRS for such favorable
determination letter within the applicable remedial amendment period under
Section 401(b) of the Code, and the Company is not aware of any circumstances
likely to result in the loss of the qualification of such Plan under Section
401(a) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has

imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an
amount which would be material. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred or reasonably expects to incur a material tax or
penalty imposed by Section 4980F of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA or any
material liability under Section 4071 of ERISA.

  

## 

  

### (c) None of the Company Pension Plans is (i) subject to Section 302 of
ERISA, Section 412 of the Code, or Title IV of ERISA, or (ii) a Multiemployer
Plan, nor does the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have any liability,
contingent or otherwise, in respect of any employee pension benefit plan
described in clauses (i) or (ii) of this Section 4.11(c).

  

## 

  

### (d) All contributions required to be made under each Company Benefit
Plan, as of the date hereof, have been timely made and all obligations in
respect of each Company Benefit Plan have been properly accrued and reflected
in the Financial Statements. Neither any Company Pension Plan nor any single-
employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated funding deficiency"
(whether or not waived) within

### 

  

### the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no
Company ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding funding waiver. It is not
reasonably anticipated that required minimum contributions to any Company
Pension Plan under Section 412 of the Code will be materially increased by
application of Section 412(l) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries has provided, or is required to provide, security to any Company
Pension Plan or to any single-employer plan of a Company ERISA Affiliate
pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.

  

## 

  

### (e) As of the date hereof, there is no material pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened litigation relating to the Company
Benefit Plans. Except for the health benefits that are required to be
provided in accordance with Section 4980B of the Code (commonly referred to
as " _COBRA_ "), neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
obligations for retiree health and life benefits under any Company ERISA Plan
or collective bargaining agreement. The Company or its Subsidiaries may amend
or terminate any such Company Benefit Plan at any time without incurring any
liability thereunder other than in respect of claims incurred prior to such
amendment or termination.

  

## 

  

### (f) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, any Company Benefit Plan which would increase materially the expense
of maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for
the most recent fiscal year. Section 4.11(f) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list of all contracts, plans or
arrangements obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay
severance to any current or former directors, employees, independent
contractors or consultants of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except
for obligations pursuant to, required by or arising under applicable Law.
Except pursuant to retention or other agreements set forth on Section 4.11(f)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution of this Agreement,
shareholder approval of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (w) entitle any employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in
severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date hereof, (x)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under,
increase the amount payable or result in any other material obligation
pursuant to, any of the Company Benefit Plans, (y) limit or restrict the
right of the Company or, after the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, Parent to merge, amend or terminate any of the Company
Benefit Plans or (z) result in payments under any of the Company Benefit
Plans that would not be deductible under Section 162(m) of the Code.

  

## 

  

### (g) Each Company Benefit Plan that is a non-qualified deferred
compensation plan subject to Section 409A of the Code has been operated and

appearance date in a litigated matter). Each Claim Notice shall contain a
reasonable estimate of the Losses (each such estimate, a " _Loss Estimate_ ")

that such an estimate can be made. The failure to so notify the Indemnifying
Person shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of any liability that it may
have to the Indemnified Person, except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Person is actually prejudiced thereby.

  



  

### 10.6 _Third-Party Claims_. With respect to each Third-Party Claim that

obligated to, employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of

reimburse the Indemnified Person for the reasonable fees and disbursements of
such separate counsel as incurred, except to the extent that (A) the actual
or potential defendants in, or targets of, such Third-Party Claim include
both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person, and the Indemnified
Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses
available to it that are different from or additional to those available to
the Indemnifying Person; or (B) the Indemnifying Person authorizes the
Indemnified Person in writing to employ separate counsel at the Indemnifying
Persons expense.

  



  

#### (ii) The Indemnifying Person shall not settle, compromise, admit
liability or consent to the entry of judgment in connection with such Third-
Party Claim, nor shall it offer to do so, in any such case without the
Indemnified Persons written consent, unless (A) no finding or admission of
any violation of Law or any violation of the rights of any Person can be made
as the result of such action, and (B) the sole relief (if any) provided is
monetary damages that are reimbursed in full by the Indemnifying Person.

  



  

#### (iii) The Indemnifying Person shall have no Liability with respect to
any compromise, settlement or discharge of the Third-Party Claim effected
without its written consent (which consent may not unreasonably be withheld,
delayed or conditioned).

### (c) If the Indemnifying Person has not duly assumed the defense of such
Third-Party Claim within thirty (30) calendar days following its receipt of
the Claim Notice, then (i) the Indemnifying Person shall be bound by any
action taken, or any compromise or settlement effected by the Indemnified
Person prior to the assumption of such defense by the Indemnifying Person,
and (ii) to the extent that such Third-Party Claim is subject to
indemnification or reimbursement under Section 10.2 or 10.3, all costs and
expenses incurred by the Indemnified Person in defending the Third-Party
Claim (including reasonable legal, accounting and other professional fees and
disbursements and expenses of investigation, preparation and defense) shall
be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Person as incurred. If the Indemnifying
Person has not duly assumed the defense of the Third-Party Claim within
thirty (30) calendar days following its receipt of the Claim Notice, the
Indemnifying Person shall thereafter have no right to assume or control such
defense.

  



  

### (d) The Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person shall keep each
other fully informed concerning the status of such Third-Party Claim and any
related proceedings at all stages thereof, and shall render to each other
such assistance as they may reasonably require of each other and shall
cooperate with each other in good faith in order to ensure the proper and
adequate defense of such Third-Party Claim. All reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection therewith shall
be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Person as incurred.

  



  

### (e) The Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to avoid production of confidential
information (consistent with applicable Law and rules of procedure), and to
cause all communications among employees, counsel and other representatives
of the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person to be made so as to
preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges.

  



  

### (f) Each party hereby consents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any
court in which a Third-Party Claim is brought for purposes of any claim for
indemnification or reimbursement with respect to such Third-Party Claim or
the matters alleged therein, and agrees that process may be served on such
Party with respect to any such claim anywhere in the world.

  



  

### 10.7 _Resolution of Claims_. (a) In the event that any Indemnifying
Person objects to the amount of any Loss claimed in any Claim Notice or
disputes the Indemnifying Persons liability therefor, the Indemnifying
Person shall, prior to twenty (20) calendar days following the Indemnifying
Persons receipt of such Claim Notice (the " _Response Date_ "), deliver to
the Indemnified Person a written notice (a " _Response Notice_ ") specifying
in reasonable detail each amount set forth in such Claim Notice to which the
Indemnifying Person objects and the nature and basis for each such objection.
If the Indemnified Person shall not have received a Response Notice prior to
the Response Date, the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person shall
be deemed to have agreed to the Claim Notice and to have acknowledged the
correctness of the

  



  

66   

     
   

  



  

### amounts claimed therein and the Indemnifying Partys liability therefor.
If the Indemnified Person shall have received a Response Notice prior to the
Response Date, the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall
negotiate in good faith concerning the related Claim Notice and the amounts
claimed and other matters set forth therein until such Claim Notice, amounts
and matters shall have been finally determined. A Claim Notice, any amounts
claimed therein and any other matters set forth therein shall be deemed to be
"finally determined" for purposes of this Agreement when such Claim Notice,
amounts and matters have been resolved (i) by a written agreement of the
Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person, or (ii) by order of a court
having jurisdiction.

  



  

### (b) To the extent permitted by Law, any reduction to the First Holdback
Payment and/or Final Holdback Payment, as the case may be, shall be treated
on the parties Tax Returns as an adjustment to the Aggregate Purchase Price
for all Tax purposes.

  



  

### 10.8 _Sole Remedy_. Following the Closing, the indemnification rights
provided in this Article X shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy and
the sole basis for and means of recourse among the Parent Indemnified Persons
and the Company Indemnified Persons with respect to any Losses of any kind or
nature (other than Losses caused by fraud, it being understood that the
rights and remedies of the Parent Indemnified Parties with respect to fraud
shall not be limited by this Agreement) arising out of or in connection with
any breach or alleged breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in any Company Document. The sole and exclusive means that

the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule, the

## 11.7 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 3.2
and Section 7.8 (Indemnification of Officers and Directors), this Agreement

the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause
such Subsidiary to take such action.

  



  

## 11.9 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability or the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or

of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

  



  

## 11.10 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of
Law or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Parent may assign this
Agreement to any of its direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries,
provided that no such assignment shall relieve Parent of its liabilities
hereunder, and (ii) Parent may designate, by written notice to the Company,
another direct or indirect Subsidiary to be a party to the Merger in lieu of
MergerSub, in which event all references herein to MergerSub shall be deemed
references to such other Subsidiary, except that all representations and
warranties made herein with respect to MergerSub as of the date of
this Agreement shall be deemed

  



  

71   

     
   

  



  

## representations and warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary
as of the date of such designation.

  



  

## 11.11 _Further Assurances_. Each of the parties hereto shall use its

taken, such further actions as may be necessary or desirable for effecting
the consummation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

## 11.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto acknowledge that, in
view of the uniqueness of the subject matter hereof, the parties hereto would
not have an adequate remedy at law for money damages if this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with its terms, and therefore agree that the
parties hereto shall be entitled to specific enforcement of the terms hereof
in addition to any other remedy to which the parties hereto may be entitled
at law or in equity.
