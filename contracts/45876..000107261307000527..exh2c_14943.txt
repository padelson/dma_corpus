            2.6 PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT.

            (a) Within 90 calendar days after the Closing Date, Buyer will
prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to the Sellers Representative
(along with relevant supporting documentation) a statement containing a
calculation of the Net Debt (the "NET DEBT STATEMENT"), which shall be prepared
in accordance with the definition of Net Debt. Within 90 calendar days after the
Closing Date, Buyer will prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to
Sellers Representative (along with relevant supporting documentation) a
statement of Net Working Capital (the "NET WORKING CAPITAL STATEMENT"), which
shall be prepared in accordance with the definition of Net Working Capital. Also
within 90 calendar days after the Closing Date, Buyer will prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and deliver to Sellers Representative (along with relevant
supporting documentation), a statement of Authorized Capital Expenditures (the
"AUTHORIZED CAPITAL EXPENDITURE STATEMENT").

            (b) The Sellers Representative shall, within 60 calendar days after
the delivery by the Buyer of the Net Debt Statement, the Net Working Capital
Statement and the Authorized Capital Expenditure Statement, complete its review
of the Net Debt Statement, the Net Working Capital Statement and the Authorized
Capital Expenditure Statement. In the event that the Sellers Representative
determines that any of the Net Debt Statement, the Net Working Capital Statement
or the Authorized Capital Expenditure Statement has not been prepared on a basis
consistent with the requirements of SECTION 2.6(A), the Sellers Representative
shall, on or before the last day of such 60-day period, inform the Buyer in
writing (the "SELLERS OBJECTION"), setting forth a specific description of the
basis of the Sellers Objection, the adjustments to the Net Debt Statement, the
Net Working Capital Statement and/ or the Authorized Capital Expenditure
Statement which the Sellers Representative believes should be made, and the
Sellers Representative's calculation of the Net Debt, Net Working Capital or
Authorized Capital Expenditures, as the case may be, and the Sellers
Representative shall be deemed to have accepted any items not specifically
disputed in the Sellers Objection. Failure to so notify the Buyer on or before
the last day of such 60-day period shall constitute acceptance and approval of
the Buyer's calculation of the Net Debt, Net Working Capital and the Authorized
Capital Expenditures, which shall be conclusive and binding upon the Sellers and
Buyer.

            (c) Subject to SECTION 2.6(D)(IV):

The Buyer shall have 30 calendar days following the date it receives the Sellers
Objection to review and respond to the Sellers Objection. If the Sellers
Representative and the Buyer are unable to resolve all of their disagreements
with respect to the determination of the foregoing items by the 30th day
following the Buyer's response thereto, after having used their good faith
efforts to reach a resolution, they shall refer their remaining differences to
the CPA Firm, which shall determine on a basis consistent with the requirements
of SECTION 2.6(A), and only with respect to the specific remaining accounting
related differences so submitted, whether and to what extent, if any, the
Authorized Capital Expenditure Statement, the Net Working Capital Statement
and/or the Net Debt Statement, as applicable, requires adjustment. The Sellers
Representative and the Buyer shall request the CPA Firm to use its best efforts
to render its determination within 45 calendar days. The CPA Firm's
determination shall be conclusive and

                                       14
<PAGE>
binding upon the Sellers and the Buyer. The Sellers Representative and the Buyer
shall make reasonably available to the CPA Firm all relevant books and records,
any work papers (including those of the parties' respective accountants) and

as adjusted pursuant to the agreement of the Buyer and the Sellers
Representative or as adjusted by the CPA Firm together with any other

Representative and the Buyer. The "FINAL STATEMENT OF AUTHORIZED CAPITAL
EXPENDITURES" shall be (i) the Authorized Capital Expenditure Statement in the
event that (x) no Sellers Objection is delivered to the Buyer during the initial
60-day period specified above or (y) the Sellers Representative and the Buyer so
agree, (ii) the Authorized Capital Expenditure Statement, adjusted in accordance
with the Sellers Objection, in the event that (x) Buyer does not respond to the

            (i) Since October 29, 2003, neither the Company nor any of the
Company Subsidiaries has been a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled
corporation" in a distribution that was purported or intended to be governed by
Section 355(a) of the Code.

            (k) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to or
bound by any Tax allocation or Tax sharing agreement or arrangement.

            (l) Since October 29, 2003, no Tax Return filed with respect to the

            (m) Since October 29, 2003, none of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries has been a party to any understanding or arrangement described in
Section 6111(b)(2) of the Code, nor has any of the Company or the Subsidiaries
participated in a reportable transaction as defined in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.6011-4(b) and (c)(3), or any analogous provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law.

            (n) There are no outstanding rulings of, or requests for rulings

agreement contemplated by section 191.3 of the Income Tax Act (Canada).

            (p) No Person (other than the Buyer) has ever acquired or had the
right to acquire control of the Canadian Company Subsidiaries for the purposes
of Section 111 of the Income Tax Act (Canada).

            (q) There is no, and prior to the Closing there will not be, any
transaction, election, or failure to take any action or make any election prior

year ending after the Closing, other than any limits or restrictions caused by
any act, omission or failure of the Buyer under applicable Laws, including
Section 111 of the Income Tax Act (Canada).

            (r) None of sections 78, 80, 80.01, 80.02, 80.03 and 80.04 of the

            (s) No Canadian Company Subsidiary has acquired property from a
non-arm's length Person, within the meaning of the Income Tax Act (Canada), for
consideration, the value of which is less than the fair market value of the
property, including, but not limited to, in circumstances which could subject it
to a liability under section 160 of the Income Tax Act (Canada). The value of
the consideration paid or received by the Canadian Company Subsidiaries for the
acquisition, sale or transfer of property (including intangibles) or the
provision of services (including financial transactions) from or to any non
arm's length Person is equal to the estimated fair market value of such property
acquired, transferred or sold or services purchased or provided. The Canadian

of the Income Tax Act (Canada) which remains unsatisfied in any respect.

            (t) No circumstances exist and no transaction or event or series of

transactions between a Canadian Company Subsidiary and any Person that is a
non-resident of Canada for purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) with whom it
was not dealing at arm's

                                       23
<PAGE>
length during a taxation year commencing after 1998 and ending on or before the
Closing Date and to which subsection 247(3) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) could
apply, the Canadian Company Subsidiary has made or obtained records or documents
that meet the requirements of paragraphs 247(4)(a) to (c) of the Income Tax Act

conservatorship, liquidation or similar proceeding and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, no such proceedings with respect to any such insurer are imminent.

            (f) Except as set forth in SCHEDULE 4.10(G), neither the Company, a
Company Subsidiary nor any ERISA Affiliate currently has, and at no time in the

       applicable Law have been timely made, or if not yet due, have been
       properly reflected in the Financial Statements; (E) where applicable, all
       contributions or premiums required to be made by any of the Company or

       documents required to be filed with a Governmental Authority in respect
       of the Foreign Benefit Plans have been duly and timely filed; (H) no
       event has occurred that would cause the termination in whole or in part
       of a Foreign Benefit Plan in Canada and there have been no improper
       withdrawals, applications or transfers of assets from a Foreign Benefit
       Plan in Canada or the trusts and funding media thereto and neither the
       Company or Company Subsidiaries nor any of their agents have been in
       breach of any fiduciary obligation with respect to the administration of

            4.20 AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS. SCHEDULE 4.20 lists all existing
Contracts or other arrangements or transactions between any of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of (a) the Sellers and its
Affiliates (other than the Company and the Company

and the Company Subsidiaries) (except those of a type available to employees
generally), on the other hand (collectively, the "AFFILIATE CONTRACTS"). All
Affiliate Contracts are at least as favorable to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as would be available with independent third parties dealing at
arm's length. Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.20, as of the Closing, all
Affiliate Contracts shall be terminated and Buyer, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries shall not have any obligations thereunder.

            4.21 ACCOUNTS. All accounts and notes receivable of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries are valid and genuine and have arisen solely out of
bona fide sales and deliveries of goods, performances of services and other
business transactions in the ordinary course of business, and the accounts
receivable reserve reflected in the Balance Sheet is, as of the date thereof,
adequate and established in accordance with GAAP, subject to year-end
adjustments and accruals in the ordinary course of business and not material in

occurrence that, when considered individually or together with all such other
events or occurrences, would cause such accounts receivable reserves to be
inadequate. Since the date of the Balance Sheet none of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries has, (a) with respect to any non-de minimis portion of its
trade accounts payable, (i) failed to pay its trade accounts payable in the
ordinary course or (ii) extended the terms of payment, whether by contract,
amendment, act, deed, or course of dealing, of any trade account payable, and
(b) with respect to any non-de minimis portion of its accounts receivable,
accelerated or delayed collection of such accounts receivable.

            4.22 INVENTORY. The inventories set forth in the Balance Sheet were
properly stated therein at the lower of cost or market value determined in
accordance with GAAP consistently maintained and applied by the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries. Inventory costs have been determined by the methods set
forth on SCHEDULE 4.22. Since the date of the Balance Sheet such inventories
have been maintained in the ordinary course of business. All such inventories
are owned free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens. All of the
inventories recorded on the Balance Sheet consist of, and such inventories on
the Closing Date will consist of, items of a quality usable or saleable in the
ordinary course of business subject to appropriate and adequate allowances, if
any, reflected on the books and records of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries for obsolete, excess, slow-moving and other irregular items.

            4.23 BANK ACCOUNTS. SCHEDULE 4.23 sets forth a true and complete
list and description of the bank accounts, lock box accounts and other accounts
maintained by or for the benefit of each of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries.

            4.24 NO BROKERS' OR OTHER FEES. No Person has been employed by or on
behalf of the Sellers as a broker, finder, investment banker or financial
advisor in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and no Person
with which the Sellers have had any dealings or communications of any kind is
entitled or will become entitled to any fee or commission, brokerage, finder's
fee or like payment based in any way on any agreement, arrangement or

Subsidiaries) will have any obligation or responsibility in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

            4.25 BOOKS AND RECORDS. All books, records and accounts of the

respects and are maintained in accordance with all applicable Laws. The
corporate minute books and stock record books of the Company and the Company

All stock transfer taxes levied, if any, or payable with respect to all

            4.26 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. SCHEDULE 4.26 sets forth a true and
complete list of the directors and officers of the Company and the Company

            6.2 ACCESS TO BOOKS AND RECORDS; CONFIDENTIALITY.

            (a) During the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on
the Closing Date or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms, the Company shall give the Buyer and its counsel, accountants,
employees, agents, and other authorized representatives full access, during
normal business hours, upon reasonable advance notice, to the officers,
directors, premises, properties, books, records, financial statements, Tax
Returns of the Company and any Company Subsidiary. Any information provided to
or obtained by the Buyer and/or its counsel, accountants, employees, agents and
other authorized representatives pursuant to this SECTION 6.2(A) will be subject
to the Confidentiality Agreement and must be held by the Buyer in accordance
with and be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. The Buyer
agrees to be bound by and comply with the provisions set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement as if such provisions were set forth herein, and such
provisions are hereby incorporated herein by reference.

            (b) From and after the date hereof, except as (i) required by Law or
(ii) as necessary for the preparation of any Tax Returns, the Sellers shall, and
shall cause their Affiliates and respective officers, directors, employees,
counsel, accountants, agents and other representatives to hold in strict
confidence all information relating to the Company and Company Subsidiaries as
conducted before the Closing; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to
information that is or becomes generally available to the public through no
action of the Sellers. If any Seller or its Affiliates or their respective
officers, directors, employees, counsel, accountants, agents and other
representatives are legally compelled or required to disclose any such
information, it is agreed that Sellers will promptly notify Buyer to permit
Buyer to seek a protective order or take other appropriate action. Sellers will
cooperate in Buyer's efforts to obtain a protective order or other reasonable
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such information. If,
in the absence of a protective order, Sellers or any of their Affiliates and
respective officers, directors, employees, counsel, accountants, agents and
other representatives are, in the opinion of counsel, compelled as a matter of
Law to disclose such information to a third party, Sellers may disclose to the
third party compelling disclosure only the part of such information as is
required by Law to be disclosed (in which case, prior to disclosure, Sellers
will use reasonable efforts to advise and consult with Buyer and its counsel as
to such disclosure and the nature and wording of such disclosure), and Sellers
will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment of any
such information so disclosed. Sellers acknowledge and agree that other remedies
cannot fully compensate Buyer for a violation by Sellers of the terms of this
SECTION 6.2(B) and that Buyer shall be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent
any such violation or continuing violation by any Seller. At the Closing, the
Sellers shall assign their respective rights under any confidentiality agreement
relating to the Company and Company Subsidiaries with a third party to Buyer or
its Affiliates.

            6.3 TAX RETURNS, CONTESTS AND COOPERATION. (a) The Buyer and the
Sellers agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request,
as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance (including powers of
attorney and, at the expense of the requesting party, reasonable access to the
other party's Tax Return preparer, provided that such other party may limit such
access as it reasonably deems necessary to protect confidential information)
relating to any of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries (including access to
books and records, employees, contractors and representatives) as is reasonably
necessary for the

                                       44
<PAGE>
filing of all Tax Returns, the making of any election related to Taxes, the
preparation for any audit by any Taxing Authority, and the prosecution or
defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax or Tax Return. The
Buyer and the Sellers shall retain all books and records that pertain to the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries until the expiration of all relevant
statutes of limitations (and, to the extent notified by the Buyer and the
Sellers, any extensions thereof). At the end of such period, each party shall
provide the other with at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice before
destroying any such books and records, during which period the party receiving
such notice can elect to take possession, at its own expense, of such books and
records. Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates will revoke, amend or otherwise
modify any existing powers of attorney effective for or with respect to any
Current Tax Matter without the prior written consent of Sellers Representative,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

            (b) Sellers shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared
and timely filed, all Tax Returns that are due to be filed on or prior to the
Closing Date for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, in respect of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries, and shall timely pay all Taxes shown on such Tax
Returns (the "SELLER FILED TAX RETURNS"). All such Seller Filed Tax Returns
shall be prepared in accordance with prior practices unless otherwise required
by Law. For all such Seller Filed Tax Returns filed following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall provide Buyer with a copy of each proposed Seller
Filed Tax Return (and such additional information regarding such Seller Filed
Tax Return as may reasonably be requested by Buyer) (i) at least fifteen (15)
calendar days prior to the filing of such Seller Filed Tax Return or (ii) in the
case of a Seller Filed Tax Return that is required to be filed within twenty
(20) calendar days of the Closing Date, at least ten (10) calendar days prior to
the date such Seller Filed Tax Return is required to be filed; provided, that
with respect to all Seller Filed Tax Returns related to corporate income taxes,
Buyer shall have the right to approve such filing, which approval must not be
unnecessarily withheld or delayed; provided, further, that in the case of a Tax
Return that is required to be filed within ten (10) calendar days of the Closing
Date, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to afford Buyer
a reasonable opportunity to review and approve if related to corporate income
taxes, such Seller Filed Tax Return prior to filing such Tax Return. Except as
required by Law, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall amend, refile,
revoke or otherwise modify any Tax Return or Tax election of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in respect of a Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent that
such amendment, refiling, revocation or other modification would have an adverse
effect on any of the Sellers or their Affiliates, without the prior written
consent of Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
The Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all other Tax Returns in respect of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries with respect to all Tax periods, including any Pre-Closing Tax
Period and any Straddle Period.

            (c) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration and other
such Taxes (including all applicable real estate transfer Taxes, but excluding
any Taxes based on or attributable to income or gains) and related fees
(including any penalties, interest and additions to Tax) ("TRANSFER TAXES")
arising out of or incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be borne by
the party incurring such cost. The party (or parties) that is legally required
to file a Tax Return relating to Transfer Taxes shall be responsible for
preparing and timely filing such Tax Return.

                                       45
<PAGE>
            (d) All Tax sharing agreements between any of the Company or Company
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of Sellers or their Affiliates (other
than the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries), on the other hand, shall
be terminated as of the Closing Date and shall have no further effect on or
after the Closing Date.

            6.4 SECTION 338. Neither the Buyer nor the Company shall make any
election under Section 338 of the Code with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

            6.5 REFUNDS AND TAX BENEFITS. All Tax refunds or credits
attributable to any Tax period shall be for the sole benefit of the Buyer.

            6.6 EMPLOYEES; BENEFIT PLANS.

            (a) Except as set forth in SCHEDULE 6.6, all persons who were
employed by the Company or Company Subsidiaries immediately preceding the
Closing Date, including those on vacation, leave of absence or disability (the
"ACTIVE COMPANY EMPLOYEES"), will remain employed in a comparable position on
and immediately after the Closing Date; provided, however, subject to the
requirements of applicable Law, nothing in this Agreement shall require the
Company or Company Subsidiaries to retain any Active Company Employees for any
period of time after the Closing Date.

            (b) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing Date
(the "TRANSITION PERIOD"), the Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to, either maintain the Benefit Plans (other than any stock
option or equity-based plans) or provide the Active Company Employees
eligibility to participate in employee benefit plans of the Buyer which in the
aggregate are substantially equivalent to those provided to similarly-situated
employees of the Buyer. The Buyer may, or may cause the Company or Company
Subsidiaries to, amend, modify or terminate any of the Benefit Plans or merge
any of the Benefit Plans with the Buyer's employee benefit plans as the Buyer
deems appropriate. To the extent not otherwise required by or resulting from the
operation of Law, the Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company and Company
Subsidiaries to, recognize each Active Company Employee's service for purposes
of eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for any other purpose, such
as benefit accrual or level of benefits) with the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date as service with the Buyer, to the extent
that such service was credited under the corresponding Benefit Plans, under the
Buyer's employee welfare benefit plans, employee pension plans, vacation,
disability, severance and other employee benefit plans or policies and any other
such plans or policies in which the Active Company Employees become or may
become eligible to participate on or after the Closing Date.

            (c) Nothing herein expressed or implied shall confer upon any of the
employees of the Buyer, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
Affiliates, any rights or remedies, including any right to benefits or
employment, or continued benefits or employment, for any specified period, of
any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

            6.7 LABOR MATTERS. (a) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date
or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the
Company and the

                                       46
<PAGE>
Company Subsidiaries shall not effect or permit a "plant closing" or "mass
layoff" as these terms are defined in the WARN Act with respect to any member of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries without notifying the Buyer in advance
and without complying with the notice requirements and all other provisions of
the WARN Act. The Company will also notify the Buyer of, and obtain its consent
to, prior to the Closing, all layoffs and terminations at any "single site of
employment" or "facility or operating unit within a single site of employment"
that occur within ninety (90) days of the Closing and that, in the aggregate,
exceed twenty percent (20%) of the workforce or 25 or more employees at either
the "single site of employment" or a "facility or operating unit", which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld.

            (b) The Company and the Buyer shall reasonably cooperate in
connection with any required notification to, or any required consultation with,
or the provision of documents and information to, the employees, employee
representatives, work councils, unions, labor boards and relevant government
agencies and governmental officials concerning the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement with respect to non-U.S. Employees of any of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries so that such Persons may render advice as required in
accordance with Law.

            6.8 CONSENTS AND COMPETITION. (a) The Buyer and the Sellers shall,
(i) as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than five (5) Business
Days following the date of this Agreement, within the applicable filing
deadlines, submit all initial filings required by the HSR Act and (ii) as
promptly as practicable, within the applicable filing deadlines, submit all
initial filings required by or any other applicable Competition/Investment Law,
and thereafter provide any supplemental information requested in connection
therewith. The Buyer and the Sellers shall furnish to the other such necessary

with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR
Act or any other applicable Competition/Investment Law. The Buyer and the
Sellers shall request early termination of the applicable waiting period under
the HSR Act or any other applicable Competition/Investment Law. The Buyer and
the Sellers will promptly inform the other party of any material communication
received by such party from any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing
under the HSR Act or any other applicable Competition/Investment Law. Each of
the parties will (a) use its respective commercially reasonable efforts to
comply as expeditiously as possible with all requests of any Governmental
Authority for additional information and documents, including, without
limitation, information or documents requested under the HSR Act or any other
applicable Competition/Investment Law; (b) not (i) extend any waiting period
under the HSR Act or any other applicable Competition/Investment Law or (ii)
enter into any agreement with any Governmental Authority not to consummate the

the other parties; and (c) cooperate with the other parties and use commercially
reasonable efforts to contest and resist any action, including legislative,
administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any Governmental Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent)
that restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

            (b) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things

obtain all third-party Consents in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including securing Consents listed in SCHEDULE 2.4(A)(VII).

            6.9 INSURANCE. From the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date,
the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain its
Insurance Policies in full force and effect (subject to any renewals thereof)
and in any event will not materially reduce the level of its insurance coverage
from the level of coverage as of the date hereof.

            6.10 NOTICE OF EVENTS. (a) During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Closing Date or the earlier termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, the Buyer shall give prompt written notice to the
Sellers of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event that has caused, or
could reasonably be expected to cause, any representation or warranty made by it
to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time after the date of
this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date; and (ii) any material failure on
its part to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder.

            (b) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing

Company which has caused, or could reasonably be expected to cause, any
representation or warranty made by the Company or any Seller to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect at any time after the date of this Agreement
and prior to the Closing Date; and (ii) any material failure on the Company's or
Sellers' part to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder. If any such event requires any
change to the schedules to this Agreement with respect to ARTICLE III or ARTICLE
IV, the Company shall promptly deliver to the Buyer a supplement to the
schedules specifying such change; provided that any such supplement shall not be
taken into account for purposes of determining whether the conditions precedent
in ARTICLE VII are satisfied or for purposes of indemnification as set forth in
ARTICLE IX. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this SECTION 6.10(B) shall
not limit or otherwise affect the rights or remedies available hereunder
(including, without limitation, the indemnification provisions hereof).

            6.11 COOPERATION. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, each party hereto shall use its commercially reasonable

and to assist and cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated hereby, and to
satisfy, or cause to be satisfied all of the conditions precedent that are set
forth in ARTICLE VII, as applicable to each of them.

            6.12 ANTI-SANDBAG. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement (including without limitation the Company's or
Sellers' failure to disclose any matter required to be disclosed on any Exhibit
or Schedule hereto), Buyer agrees that no representation or warranty of the
Sellers or the Company in this Agreement or in any agreement or instrument
executed in connection herewith shall be deemed to be untrue or incorrect, and
Sellers and the Company shall not be deemed to be in breach thereof, if the
following officers or
                                       48

employees of Buyer had actual knowledge on the date of this Agreement of any
undisclosed matter that would constitute a breach of such representation or
warranty or that any such representation or warranty was untrue or incorrect:
Michael H. Kolinsky, Mark E. Kimmel, Michael L. Evelhoch, Salvatore D.
Fazzolari, Gene Iannazo (but only with respect to matters uncovered in Buyer's
due diligence review of the Company in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and not with respect to any other matters,
including matters known to or discovered by Gene Iannazo as a result of his
day-to-day duties and/or activities) and Stephen J. Schnoor. For purposes of
determining whether any such persons had such actual knowledge, all such persons
shall be deemed to have actual knowledge of all due diligence reports prepared
and delivered to the Buyer by the outside advisors set forth on SCHEDULE 6.12.

to the Closing Date:

            (a) by the mutual written consent of Sellers Representative, on
behalf of the Sellers, and the Buyer;

            (b) by Sellers Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, or the
Buyer, upon written notice to the other party, if the Closing has not occurred
on or before March 1, 2007 (the "OUTSIDE DATE"), provided, however, that if the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been consummated
solely due to the waiting period (or any extension thereof) or approvals under
the HSR Act or any other Competition/Investment Law not having expired or been
terminated or received, then such date shall be extended to April 15, 2007; and
provided, further, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this SECTION
8.1(B) shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any material
obligations under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the
failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to have been
consummated on or before such date.

                                       50
<PAGE>
            (c) by Sellers Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, or the
Buyer, upon written notice to the other party, if any Restraint is in effect and
has become final and nonappealable, provided that the party seeking to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this SECTION 8.1(C) has used its commercially
reasonable efforts to remove such Restraint;

            (d) by the Buyer, if the Company or any Seller materially breaches
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this
Agreement and such breach is not capable of being cured or if curable is not
cured within twenty (20) calendar days after written notice to the Sellers
Representative by the Buyer; or

            (e) by Sellers Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, if the
Buyer materially breaches any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements under this Agreement and such breach is not capable of being cured or
if curable is not cured within twenty (20) calendar days after written notice to
the Buyer by Sellers Representative.

            8.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of termination of this
Agreement pursuant to SECTION 8.1, this Agreement will become void and have no
effect, and no party will have any liability or any further obligation to any
other party, except as provided in this SECTION 8.2 and except that nothing
herein releases, or may be construed as releasing, any party hereto from any
liability or damage to any other party hereto arising out of the breaching
party's willful breach of its representations and warranties or breach in the
performance of any of its covenants or agreements arising under this Agreement.
The obligations of the parties to this Agreement under SECTION 6.2 (as such
Section relates to confidentiality), SECTION 8.2 and ARTICLE X will survive any
termination of this Agreement.

                          ARTICLE IX   INDEMNIFICATION

            9.1 INDEMNIFICATION BY THE SELLERS. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this ARTICLE IX, from and after the Closing, the Sellers
shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer, its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries) and their respective officers, directors, shareholders, employees,
agents and representatives (collectively, the "BUYER INDEMNIFIED PERSONS") from
and against any and all Losses incurred or suffered by any Buyer Indemnified
Person arising out of or related to (i) any breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty by the Sellers or the Company contained in this
Agreement whether made upon execution of this Agreement or at Closing as
contemplated by SECTION 7.3(A), (ii) any non-fulfillment or breach by the
Company or any Seller of any covenant or agreement hereunder, or (iii) payments
to Company Employees, including former employees, triggered in whole or in part
by the transactions contemplated hereby (whether alone or in connection with
other events), excluding those payments made to Company Employees included in
the definition of Debt Obligations and any payments resulting from Buyer's
termination of such Company Employee following the Closing.

            (b) None of the Buyer Indemnified Persons will be entitled to
recover from the Sellers for any Losses indemnifiable pursuant to SECTION
9.1(A)(I) AND (A)(II), unless and until the total of all Losses indemnifiable
under SECTION 9.1(A)(I) AND (II) exceeds $1,500,000, in which case the Sellers
will be liable in the manner set forth in this ARTICLE IX for all such Losses
(including such first $1,500,000 of Losses) without regard to such amount. The
Buyer

                                       51
<PAGE>
Indemnified Persons will not be entitled to recover more than an aggregate of
$20,000,000 (the "MAXIMUM AMOUNT"), from the Sellers with respect to all Losses
indemnifiable pursuant to SECTION 9.1(A)(I) AND (A)(II); provided that, subject
to the limitations in the following sentence, the foregoing limitations shall
not apply to any obligation or Liability under SECTION 9.1(A)(I) arising out of
or related to a breach or inaccuracy of any of the representations or warranties
set forth in SECTIONS 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.24. Notwithstanding the
above, any breach of a representation or warranty set forth in SECTIONS 3.1 or
3.2, shall be made only against such Seller breaching such representation or
warranty and no other Seller shall have any liability to Buyer with respect to
such breach.

            9.2 INDEMNIFICATION BY THE BUYER. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this ARTICLE IX, from and after the Closing, the Buyer
shall indemnify and hold harmless each of the Sellers, their respective
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, shareholders, employees,
agents, and representatives (collectively, the "SELLER INDEMNIFIED PERSONS")
from and against any and all Losses incurred or suffered by any Seller
Indemnified Person arising out of or related to (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty by Buyer contained in this Agreement whether made
upon execution of this Agreement or at Closing as contemplated by SECTION
7.2(A), and (ii) any non-fulfillment or breach by Buyer of any covenant or
agreement hereunder.

            9.3 INDEMNIFICATION AS EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. Except as otherwise
provided below, the indemnification provided for in this ARTICLE IX, subject to
the limitations set forth herein, shall be the exclusive post-Closing remedy
available to any party in connection with any Losses arising out of the matters
set forth in this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder;
provided, however, that nothing herein will limit in any way any such party's
remedies in respect of fraud by a party in connection herewith or with any
Transaction Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby;
provided that liability for such claims of fraud with respect to each Seller who
was not a party perpetrating such fraud shall be limited to the product of: (x)
the aggregate Losses of Buyer resulting from such fraud times (y) (a) the
Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to SECTION 2.6) received by such Seller
divided by (b) the aggregate Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to SECTION
2.6); provided further, that in no instance shall any Seller be liable, after
taking into consideration all amounts paid by such Seller pursuant to this
ARTICLE IX, for any amount in excess of such Seller's portion of the Purchase
Price (as adjusted pursuant to SECTION 2.6).

            9.4 SURVIVAL. Except as set forth below, all claims for
indemnification under SECTION 9.1(A) must be asserted on or prior to the date of
the termination of the respective survival periods set forth in this SECTION
9.4, except such claims may be pursued thereafter if written notice thereof
(specifying in reasonable detail the basis for such claim) was duly given within
such period. Claims for fraud may be asserted at any time prior to the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. The representations and
warranties, covenants and other agreements contained in this Agreement will
survive the Closing Date until the second anniversary of the Closing Date,
except that the representations and warranties (a) set forth in SECTIONS 3.1,
3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.24 and 5.5 shall survive indefinitely, (b) set forth in
SECTIONS 4.3, 4.9, 4.10, 5.1 and 5.2 shall survive the Closing until sixty days
after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (and in the case
of SECTION 4.9 any extensions thereof), and

                                       52
<PAGE>
(c) set forth in SECTION 4.14 shall survive the Closing until the third
anniversary of the Closing Date.

            9.5 LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFICATION. (a) The amount of any Losses for
which indemnification is provided under SECTION 9.1(A) or 9.2 shall be computed
net of any third party insurance proceeds received by, or payable to, an
Indemnified Party in connection with such Losses (net of any expenses incurred
by the Indemnified Party in obtaining such insurance proceeds including the cost
of maintaining any insurance policy). The parties agree that any indemnification
payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated for tax purposes as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by Law.

            (b) Sellers shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain and to assign to Buyer any third-party indemnities, settlements or cost
sharing agreements available or potentially available to Buyer.

            (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
ARTICLE IX, any indemnification obligations of the Sellers to the Buyer
Indemnified Persons that are subject to the Maximum Amount shall be first drawn
from the funds subject to the Escrow Agreement. Thereafter, the Sellers will be
severally, and not jointly, liable for all indemnification obligations to the
Buyer Indemnified Persons pursuant to this Agreement, subject to the limitations
contained herein. Any indemnification obligations of the Sellers to the Buyer
Indemnified Persons not subject to the Maximum Amount may be drawn from the
funds subject to the Escrow Agreement or may be sought from the Sellers in the
sole discretion of Buyer. In each case, the Buyer may offset the indemnification
obligations of such Seller under this ARTICLE IX against any amounts due or to
become due to such Seller under this Agreement. The parties agree that no Seller
Indemnified Persons shall have any rights of contribution or indemnity, or any
other right, remedy or recourse, as against the Company in connection with any
indemnification obligation or other Liability arising under or in connection
with, or related to, this Agreement or any Transaction Agreement, or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Each Seller's liability for
indemnification shall be limited to the product of: (x) the aggregate Losses of
Buyer resulting from such claims times (y) (a) the Purchase Price (as adjusted
pursuant to SECTION 2.6) received by such Seller divided by (b) the aggregate
Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to SECTION 2.6); provided further, that in
no instance shall any Seller be liable, after taking into consideration all
amounts paid by such Seller pursuant to this ARTICLE IX, for any amount in
excess of such Seller's portion of the Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to
SECTION 2.6); provided further, that with respect to claims subject to the
Maximum Amount, no Seller's liability for indemnification under this ARTICLE IX
shall exceed the product of the following: (x) (i) $20,000,000 minus (ii) the
total amount paid to Buyer from the funds subject to the Escrow Agreement times
(y) (a) the Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to SECTION 2.6) received by
such Seller divided by (b) the aggregate Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to
SECTION 2.6).

            (d) PROCEDURES.

            (i) Notice of Losses. As soon as is reasonably practicable after the
       Sellers or the Buyer has actual knowledge of any Losses for which
       indemnification is available under SECTION 9.1(A) or SECTION 9.2 (a
       "CLAIM"), such party shall give written notice

                                       53
<PAGE>
       thereof (a "CLAIM NOTICE") to the other party. A Claim Notice must
       describe the Claim in reasonable detail, and must indicate the amount
       (estimated to the extent feasible) of the Loss that has been or will be
       suffered by the Indemnified Party. No delay in or failure to give a Claim
       Notice by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party will adversely
       affect any other rights or remedies that the Indemnified Party has under
       this Agreement, or alter or relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
       obligations to indemnify the Indemnified Party to the extent that such
       delay or failure has not materially prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.
       Each Indemnifying Party to whom a Claim Notice is given shall respond to
       any Indemnified Party that has given a Claim Notice (a "CLAIM RESPONSE")
       within thirty (30) calendar days (the "RESPONSE PERIOD") after the date
       the Claim Notice is given. Any Claim Response must specify whether or not
       the Indemnifying Party disputes the Claim described in the Claim Notice.
       If any Indemnifying Party fails to give a Claim Response within the
       Response Period, such Indemnifying Party will be deemed not to dispute
       the Claim described in the related Claim Notice. If any Indemnifying
       Party elects not to dispute a Claim described in a Claim Notice, whether
       by failing to give a timely Claim Response or otherwise, then the amount
       of such Claim will be conclusively deemed to be an obligation of such
       Indemnifying Party and such Indemnifying Party shall pay to the
       Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after the last day of the
       applicable Response Period the amount to which such Indemnified Party is
       entitled. If a Claim is disputed, the parties may pursue any remedies
       available in Law or equity.

            (ii) Third Party Claims. (A) If any Claim Notice identifies any
       Claim brought by a third Person (a "THIRD PARTY CLAIM"), the Indemnifying
       Party will have the right, exercisable by written notice to the
       Indemnified Party within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of such
       Claim Notice, to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, with
       counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party that is reasonably
       satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes
       the defense of, and the full responsibility for paying or otherwise
       discharging such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be
       liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other counsel
       or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in
       connection with the defense thereof and the Indemnified Party will have
       the right to participate at its own expense in the defense of such Third
       Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of
       such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may defend such Third Party
       Claim at the sole cost of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying
       Party may still participate in, but not control, the defense of such
       Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's sole cost and expense.

            (B) The party responsible for the defense of any Third Party Claim
       (a "RESPONSIBLE PARTY") shall, to the extent reasonably requested by the
       other party, keep such other party informed as to the status of such
       Third Party Claim, including, without limitation, all settlement
       negotiations and offers. With respect to a Third Party Claim for which a
       Seller is the Responsible Party, the Buyer shall use all reasonable
       efforts to make available to such Seller all books and records of the
       Buyer relating to such Third Party Claim and shall cooperate with such
       Seller in the defense of the Third Party Claim. No settlement or
       compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment that does not relate
       solely to monetary damages arising from any such Third Party Claim may be
       effected (1) by the Indemnifying Party without the written consent of the
       Indemnified Party

                                       54
<PAGE>
       (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless all
       relief provided is paid or satisfied in full by the Indemnifying Party
       and the Indemnified Party receives a full release in respect of the Third
       Party Claim or (2) by the Indemnified Party without the consent of the
       Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
       delayed). In no event shall an Indemnifying Party be liable for any
       settlement effected without its prior written consent.

            (e)(i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the election of Buyer,
Buyer shall have the sole right to control the defense, compromise and
resolution of any claim, suit, action, audit, litigation or proceeding relating
to any breach of the representations and warranties contained in SECTION 4.9 or
of the covenants contained in SECTION 6.3 (a "TAX CLAIM"). In the event that
Buyer assumes the defense of a Tax Claim and compromises or otherwise reaches a
resolution then Buyer's right to indemnification is subject to clause (ii)
below.

            (ii) Buyer shall permit the Sellers Representative to participate in
       the Tax Claim, at Sellers sole cost and expense, and keep the Sellers
       Representative informed as to the status of all compromise and settlement
       negotiations and offers. The Buyer shall make available to Sellers
       Representative all books and records of the Buyer and the Company
       relating to such Tax Claim in order for Sellers Representative to
       evaluate any proposed compromise or other resolution. If the Sellers
       Representative consents to the compromise or other resolution of the Tax
       Claim, then Buyer shall be entitled to indemnification under SECTION 9.1
       for the amount of such compromise or resolution, subject to the
       limitations set forth in this ARTICLE IX. If the Sellers Representative
       does not agree with a proposed resolution, then Buyer and Sellers
       Representative shall consult with the CPA Firm to determine the best
       resolution possible (the "CPA RESOLUTION"). In determining the CPA
       Resolution, the CPA Firm will attempt to minimize the amount of the Tax
       Claim for the Tax year at issue without moving income or loss for any Tax
       year to another Tax year, whether from a pre-Closing period to
       post-Closing period or from post-Closing period to a pre-Closing period,
       except as otherwise required by applicable law. If Buyer agrees to use
       the CPA Resolution to resolve the Tax Claim, then Buyer shall be entitled
       to indemnification under SECTION 9.1 for the amount of such resolution,
       including any legal and/or accounting costs incurred in connection with
       such Tax Claim, subject to the limitations set forth in this ARTICLE IX.
       If Buyer does not use the CPA Resolution to resolve the Tax Claim, then
       Buyer shall be entitled to indemnification under SECTION 9.1 (subject to
       the limitations set forth in this ARTICLE IX) only for an amount equal to
       but not exceeding the amount reflected in the CPA Resolution.

            9.6 SELLERS REPRESENTATIVE.

            (a) Sellers Representative; Power and Authority. Each Seller hereby
appoints the Sellers Representative as agent and attorney-in-fact for each such
Seller, for and on behalf of each such Seller, with full power and authority to
represent each Seller and such Seller's successors and assigns with respect to
all matters arising under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and all
actions taken by the Sellers Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement will be binding upon each such Seller and such Seller's successors and
assigns as if expressly ratified and confirmed in writing by each of them.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Sellers Representative has
full power and authority, on behalf of

                                       55
<PAGE>
each Seller and such Seller's successors and assigns, to interpret the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, to dispute or fail to
dispute any Claim under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, to negotiate and
compromise any dispute that may arise under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement and to sign any releases or other documents with respect to any such
dispute. A Seller will be deemed a party or a signatory to any agreement,
document, instrument or certificate for which the Sellers Representative signs
on behalf of such Seller. The Sellers Representative hereby accepts such
designation.

            (b) Liability. In performing any of its duties under this Agreement
or upon the claimed failure to perform its duties under this Agreement, the
Sellers Representative will not be liable to the Sellers for any Losses that the
Sellers may incur as a result of any act, or failure to act, by the Sellers
Representative under this Agreement, and the Sellers Representative shall be
indemnified and held harmless by the Sellers for all Losses; provided, however,
that the Sellers Representative will not be entitled to indemnification for
Losses to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction has finally
determined that the actions or omissions of the Sellers Representative both (i)
were taken or omitted not in good faith and (ii) constituted willful breach
under this Agreement. Accordingly, the Sellers Representative will not incur any
such liability with respect to (x) any action taken or omitted to be taken in
good faith upon advice of counsel given with respect to any questions relating
to the duties and responsibilities of the Sellers Representative under this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or (y) any action taken or omitted to be taken
in reliance upon any document, including any written notice or instructions
provided for in this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, not only as to its due
execution and to the validity and effectiveness of such document's provisions,
but also as to the truth and accuracy of any information contained in such
document, which the Sellers Representative does in good faith believe to be
genuine, to have been signed or presented by the purported proper Person or
Persons and to conform with the provisions of this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement. The limitation of liability provisions of this SECTION 9.6(B) will
survive the termination of this Agreement and the resignation of the Sellers
Representative.

            (c) Successor Sellers Representative. In the event that the Sellers
Representative dies, becomes incapacitated, resigns or otherwise fails to
perform his or her obligations hereunder on behalf of the Sellers for any
reason, then Brian Soeldner, or if he is unwilling or unable to act, another
Person selected by a vote of Sellers owning in the aggregate at least a majority
of the issued and outstanding Common Stock immediately prior to Closing shall be
appointed and as the substituting representative to act on behalf of the Sellers
with respect to the matters set forth in this Agreement and the Transaction
Agreements.

            (d) Reliance on Sellers Representative. The Sellers Representative
is authorized to act on behalf of the Sellers in accordance with the terms of
this SECTION 9.6, notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among the Sellers.
Buyer shall be entitled to rely on any and all actions taken by the Sellers
Representative without any liability to, or obligation to inquire of, any of the
Sellers even if Buyer is aware of any actual or potential dispute or
disagreement among the Sellers. Buyer, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and
any third party is and shall be fully protected in acting or refraining from
acting upon and relying upon any notice, instruction, direction, request,
waiver, consent, receipt or other paper or document in writing that Buyer, the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or such other third party in good faith
reasonably believes after due inquiry has been signed by the Sellers
Representative.

will constitute a waiver of such provision or right and no waiver of any of the

any other provision hereof (whether or not similar) nor will such waiver
