who has properly demanded appraisal for such Company Shares in accordance with
Sections 623 and 910 of the NYBCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Company
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the
consideration in respect of such Company Shares allocated to such Company
Shareholder pursuant to _Section 2.07_ (but shall, for avoidance of doubt, be
entitled to receive the portion of the Post-Closing Distribution (if any)
payable pursuant to _Section 6.06_ and allocated to such Company Shareholder
pursuant to _Section 2.07)_. Any such Company Shareholder instead shall be
entitled to receive payment from the Company Surviving Corporation of the
appraised value of such Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Sections 623 and 910 of the NYBCL. The Company shall give Buyer (i) prompt
notice and a copy of any notice of a Company Shareholders demand for
appraisal, of any request to withdraw a demand for appraisal and of any other
instrument delivered to the Company pursuant to Sections 623 and 910 of the
NYBCL and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands and requests. Prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Buyer, make any payment or settlement offer with respect to any
such demand for appraisal of Dissenting Company Shares. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Holdings hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert any
dissenters rights, appraisal rights or similar rights in connection with the
Company Merger, including pursuant to Sections 623 and 910 of the NYBCL.

(a) _Section 4.18(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth an
accurate and complete list of each material Employee Plan. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Employee Plan_ " means any benefit or compensation plan,
program, policy, practice, agreement, contract or arrangement, whether or not
in writing and whether or not funded, in each case, which is sponsored or
maintained by, or required to be contributed to, or with respect to which any
potential liability is borne by any Sandler Entity with respect to current or
former employees of the Sandler Entities or any beneficiaries or dependents
thereof, including "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3)
of ERISA (" _ERISA Plans_ "), employment, consulting, retirement, severance,
termination or change in control agreements, deferred compensation, equity-
based, incentive, bonus, supplemental retirement, profit sharing, insurance,
medical, welfare, fringe or other benefits or remuneration of any kind.

 



 

(b) With respect to each material Employee Plan, the Company has made

written description of such Employee Plan if such plan is not set forth in a
written document, (iii) the most recently prepared actuarial report, and (iv)
all material correspondence to or from any Governmental Authority received in
the last two years with respect to any Employee Plan.

qualification or tax exemption of any such Employee Plan. With respect to any
ERISA Plan, no Sandler Entity has engaged in a transaction in connection with

material tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code.

life insurance or other welfare benefits to any Person.

 



 

(h) Each Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
(within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) is in material documentary
compliance with, or is exempt from, and has been operated and administered in
all material respects in compliance with, Section 409A of the Code and the
guidance issued by the IRS provided thereunder.

Sandler Entities or under the applicable policies and procedures of the
Sandler Entities (or, in the case of non-employees, the applicable policies

knowledge of the Company, have not been breached in any material respect.

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization and has all corporate, limited liability or

duly qualified to do business as a foreign company or other entity, as

any Sandler Party, or their respective businesses, operations, assets,
liabilities, conditions (financial or otherwise) or prospects, and the Buyer
Parties hereby disclaim any such other representations or warranties.

made, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) grant any waiver or release under any
standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity securities
of any Sandler Entity or (iv) enter into any agreement in principle, letter of
intent, term sheet, merger agreement, purchase agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
other similar instrument constituting or relating to an Acquisition Proposal.
Holdings and the Company shall, and the Company shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries and shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause
their respective Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be
terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if
any, with any Person other than Buyer conducted prior to the date of this
Agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and shall withdraw and
terminate access that was granted to any Person (other than the parties to
this Agreement and their respective Affiliates and Representatives) to any
"data room" (virtual or physical) that was established in connection with any
other Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and in any event
within five (5) business days following the public announcement of this
Agreement) request each Person that has executed a confidentiality or similar
agreement in connection with its consideration of an Acquisition Proposal
within the one (1)-year period prior to the date hereof to return to the
Sandler Entities or destroy all non-public information heretofore furnished to
such Person by or on behalf of the Sandler Entities in accordance with the
terms of such confidentiality or similar agreement. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary, this _Section 6.03_ shall not prohibit Holdings, the Company
or their Representatives from informing any Person of the restrictions
contained in this _Section 6.03_.

 



 

Section 6.04 _Access to Information; Financial Information Cooperation;

reasonable judgment of Holdings or the Company, (x) violates any of its
obligations with respect to confidentiality, (y) is subject to any attorney-
client, work-product or other legal privilege, or (z) the disclosure of which
would violate Applicable Law or legal duty (provided that the withholding
party will use reasonable efforts to allow such access or disclosure in a
manner that does not result in loss or waiver of such privilege, including
entering into appropriate common interest or similar agreements). Any
investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.04_ shall be conducted in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Buyer, agrees that it will not, and
will cause its Representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant

23, 2017, as amended on March 15, 2019, between Buyer and Sandler Broker-
Dealer (as may be further amended, supplemented or modified from time to time
in accordance with its terms, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). No
information or knowledge obtained by Buyer in any investigation pursuant to
this _Section 6.04_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by Holdings or the Company hereunder.

 



 

Section 6.05 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Tax Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, Buyer will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to
be deducted and withheld under the Code or any other Applicable Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and timely remitted to the appropriate
Taxing Authority, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

(b) _Tax Returns and Pre-Closing Tax Period Taxes_.

 



 

(i) The Tax Return Representative shall prepare and file, or cause to be
prepared and filed, (A) all Tax Returns of the Sandler Entities for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period other than a Pre-Closing Tax Period consisting of a portion
of a Straddle Period except as provided in clause (B), and (B) with respect to
Holdings and the Company Subsidiaries, any IRS Form 1065, any Schedule K-1 and
any similar state, local or other Tax Return for reporting "pass through"
income, in each case, for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (together with (A), "
_Pre-Closing Tax Returns_ "). Unless otherwise required by Applicable Law, the
Pre-Closing Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with prior
Tax Returns. The Tax Return Representative shall deliver (or cause to be
delivered) the Pre-Closing Tax Returns to Buyer for review and comment not
later

 



     

 

 



 

than thirty (30) days prior to the due date of such Pre-Closing Tax Returns.
The Tax Return Representative will discuss with Buyer all reasonable changes
requested by Buyer at least five (5) days prior to the due date of the Pre-
Closing Tax Returns. The Tax Return Representative shall cause such Pre-
Closing Tax Returns to be filed on a timely basis, and the Sellers shall
timely pay (or cause to be paid) all Taxes reflected on such Pre-Closing Tax
Returns. All costs, fees and expenses paid or incurred in preparing and filing
any Pre-Closing Tax Returns shall be borne by the Sellers.

 



 

(ii) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 6.05(b)(i)_, Buyer shall
prepare (or cause to be prepared) all Tax Returns of the Sandler Entities
required to be filed after the Closing Date for any Straddle Period (the "
_Straddle Period Tax Returns_ ").

 



 

(c) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

 



 

(i) Prior to Closing, each of Buyer, on the one hand, and Holdings and the
Company, on the other hand, shall promptly notify the other of: (a) subject to
Applicable Law, any notice or other communication from any Taxing Authority in
connection with the Transactions, including notices and communications related
to Tax matters to the extent such Tax matters could materially affect the
Sellers, or (b) any Actions or claims commenced or, to its knowledge,
threatened against, including as to Tax matters, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting any Sandler Entity or Buyer and any of its Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, (x) that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would
have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to any Section of this
Agreement or (y) that relate to the consummation of the Transactions.

 



 

(ii) Each of Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers and the Tax Return
Representative, on the other hand, shall cooperate, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by such other party, in connection with preparing and
filing any Tax Return and any inquiry, investigation, claim assessment, audit,
litigation or other proceeding regarding Taxes with respect to Holdings, the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries. Such cooperation shall include, upon such
other partys request, the provision of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to any such inquiry, investigation, claim assessment,
audit, litigation or other proceeding. The Buyer and the Sellers agree to
retain for seven (7) years all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Company and Company Subsidiaries relating to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with
any Governmental Authority.

 



 

(d) _Tax Proceedings_. Buyer shall notify the Tax Return Representative in
writing within ten (10) days after learning of any governmental inquiry,
examination, or proceeding with respect to any Sandler Entity that could
result in a determination with respect to Taxes due or payable by the Sellers
and for which the Sellers would be liable (" _Tax Proceeding_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure or delay in providing such notice shall not
reduce or affect the _obligations_ of the Sellers under this Agreement except
to the extent the Sellers are actually prejudiced by such failure or delay. In
the case of a Tax Proceeding that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, the Tax
Return Representative shall have the right, at its election and expense, to
control the conduct of the Tax Proceeding; _provided_ ,

 



     

 

 



 

 _however_ , that (i) Buyer shall have the right at its own expense, directly
or through its designated representatives, to participate fully in such Tax
Proceeding, including to review in advance and reasonably comment upon
submissions made in the course of such Tax Proceeding and to attend any in-
person or telephonic meetings, and (ii) Buyers prior consent shall be
required for any settlement by the Tax Return Representative (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to the extent that such settlement
could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on Buyer in the post-
Closing period. To the extent the Tax Return Representative elects to control
the Tax Proceeding, the Tax Return Representative shall promptly notify Buyer
of its intent to do so, and in any event within twenty (20) days of receipt of
notice of the Tax Proceeding. If the Tax Return Representative does not elect
to control the Tax Proceeding pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence,
Buyer shall have the sole responsibility for, and shall control, such Tax
Proceeding, including the disposition thereof. The Sellers agree if the IRS
(or applicable state taxing authority) issues a notice of final partnership
adjustment assessing an "imputed underpayment" against any Sandler Entity with
respect to a Tax period ending prior to or including the Closing Date, to
cause such entity to make the election described in Section 6226(a) of the
Code.

 



 

(e) _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Taxes set forth in Section 6.05(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule) and
fees, including any penalties and interest incurred in connection with the
Transactions (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne equally by Buyer, on the
one hand, and by the Sellers, on the other hand. Any Tax Returns that must be
filed in connection with Transfer Taxes shall be prepared by the party
required by Applicable Law to file such Tax Returns, and the filing party
shall provide such Tax Returns to the non-filing party at least thirty (30)
business days prior to the date such Tax Returns are due to be filed. The
Buyer and the Representative shall cooperate in the timely completion and
filing of all such Tax Returns.

 



 

(f) _Holdings Units_. The parties intend for the Buyers acquisition of
Holdings Units to be treated for Tax purposes (i) in the same manner as the
transaction described in Revenue Ruling 99-6, Situation 2, (ii) as a sale or
disposition of property to which Section 1001 of the Code applies and (iii) as
"closed," including with respect to the Equity Consideration, which shall not
be subject to withholding or reportable as taxable income upon any future
vesting event, and Buyer and the Holdings Members shall file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with such treatment and shall not
make any inconsistent statement or adjustment on any Tax Return or during the
course of any Tax-related matter, or otherwise take any Tax position
inconsistent with such treatment unless otherwise required by Applicable Law.

 



 

Section 6.06 _Pre-Closing Distribution and Post-Closing Distribution_.

 



 

(a) _Calculation Schedule_. The parties have agreed upon an illustrative
calculation of the Tangible Book Value, determined on a pro forma basis as of
May 31, 2019. Such illustrative calculation is set forth on the calculation
schedule agreed to by the parties in connection with the execution of this
Agreement (the " _Calculation Schedule_ "). The illustrative calculation of
Tangible Book Value set forth in the Calculation Schedule is, and each of the
Estimated TBV, the Closing TBV and the Final TBV shall be, determined in
accordance with the

 



     

 

 



 

following principles: (v) it shall be determined in accordance with GAAP and
consistent with Holdings past accounting principles and judgments as
reflected in the Holdings Financial Statements, (w) it shall give effect to
the repayment at or prior to the Closing of any Funded Indebtedness of the
Sandler Entities pursuant to _Section 6.07_, (x) any transaction entered into
by Buyer or the Sandler Entities after the Closing or any other event
occurring after the Closing shall be entirely disregarded; (y) it shall be
assumed that the Sandler Entities and their business shall be continued as a
going concern, and (z) there shall not be taken into account any of the plans,
transactions or changes that Buyer intends to initiate on or after the Closing
Date with respect to the Sandler Entities, or any facts or circumstances that
are unique or particular to Buyer, or Buyers obligation for any payments
hereunder.

 



 

(b) _Pre-Closing Distribution_.

 



 

(i) At least two (2) business days prior to the Pre-Closing Distribution
Declaration Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to Buyer for Buyers
review the Companys good faith estimate and calculation of the Tangible Book
Value as of the Estimated TBV Measurement Date, taking into account the most
recent FOCUS Report filed by the Sandler Broker Dealer (the " _Estimated TBV_
"). The Estimated TBV shall be calculated in accordance with _Section
6.06(a)_ and the Calculation Schedule, together with reasonable supporting
calculations and other documentation reasonably requested by Buyer. The
Company shall consult with Buyer in preparing the calculation of the Estimated
TBV and shall consider in good faith any comments from Buyer with respect to
such calculation. Buyer and the Company agree to work in good faith to
promptly resolve any disagreements with respect to the calculation of the
Estimated TBV. To the extent Buyer and the Company are unable to resolve any
disagreement with respect to the Estimated TBV within one (1) business day
prior to the Pre-Closing Distribution Declaration Date, then the Estimated TBV
shall be as calculated and delivered by the Company.

 



 

(ii) On a date determined by the Distributing Entities that is (a) if the
Closing Date is on or before the fifteenth (15th) calendar day of a month,
then in the month preceding the expected Closing Date or (b) if the Closing
Date is after the fifteenth (15th) calendar day of a month, then in the month
of the expected Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Distribution Declaration
Date_ "), Holdings, the Company, Sandler Mortgage Finance, Sandler Broker-
Dealer and Sandler Advisors (collectively, including their respective
successors and assigns, the " _Distributing Entities_ ") shall each declare a
cash distribution (the " _Pre-Closing Distribution_ "), in an aggregate amount
equal to the Estimated TBV _minus_ $100,000,000 _minus_ the TBV Holdback
Amount (the " _Pre-Closing Distribution Amount_ "), to the Sellers (in their
capacity as holders of record of issued and outstanding Holdings Units,
Company Shares, limited partnership interests of Sandler Mortgage Finance,
limited partnership interests of Sandler Advisors and limited partnership
interest of Sandler Mortgage Finance as of the record date for the Pre-Closing
Distribution determined by the Distributing Entities (the " _Pre-Closing
Distribution Record Date_ ")). The Distributing Entities shall cause the Pre-
Closing Distribution to be paid to the Sellers on a date determined by the
Distributing Entities that is in the month preceding the expected Closing Date
(the " _Pre-Closing Distribution Payment Date_ "). Each Seller shall be
allocated the portion of the Pre-Closing Distribution Amount set

 



      

 

 



 

forth next to such Sellers name in _Schedule B_ (which shall be updated by
the Company for this purpose and delivered to the Buyer no later than five (5)
business days prior to the Pre-Closing Distribution Date if necessary to
reflect any repurchases or reallocations of Class A Units or Class C Units
made after the date hereof and prior to the Pre-Closing Distribution Record
Date in accordance with the terms of the LLC Agreement), in each case, which
such Seller shall be entitled to receive pursuant to the Organizational
Documents of the Distributing Entities. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, if the Pre-Closing Distribution Amount
is negative, then (a) no Pre-Closing Distribution shall be declared or
payable, (b) the Purchase Price and Cash Consideration shall each be reduced
by an amount equal to the absolute value of the Pre-Closing Distribution
Amount (without duplication) and (c) the amount in _clause (b)_ of the
definition of TBV Adjustment Amount shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
absolute value of the Pre-Closing Distribution Amount. For the avoidance of
doubt, neither the Pre-Closing Distribution Amount nor the Post-Closing
Distribution Amount shall be changed as a result of any updates to Schedule B
made pursuant to this _Section 6.06(b)(ii)_.

 



 

(c) _Specified Actions After Pre-Closing Distribution_.

 



 

(i) From the date of filing by the Sandler Broker-Dealer of the most recent
FOCUS Report used to calculate the Estimated TBV until the Closing, the
Company shall promptly notify Buyer before taking any Specified Action (other
than any Specified Action that is reimbursed by the Sellers or their
Affiliates to the Sandler Entities prior to the Closing). Any such notice
shall (1) specify the amount of the Specified Action, (2) specify the impact
that such Specified Action would have had on Estimated TBV had such Specified
Action been taken into account in the calculation of Estimated TBV and (3)
certify to Buyer that the Estimated TBV _minus_ $100,000,000 _minus_ the Pre-
Closing Distribution Amount would have been no less than $7,500,000 had such
Specified Action been taken into account in the calculation of Estimated TBV
but the Pre-Closing Distribution Amount had remained the same; _provided_ that
no Specified Action may be taken if such certification cannot be made. In
addition, the Company shall provide to Buyer such other information relating
to any Specified Action as Buyer may reasonably request. For the avoidance of
doubt, the net impact to the Company of any Specified Action (x) shall be
taken into account in the determination of Estimated TBV only if such
Specified Action had been anticipated prior to the delivery of the Estimated
TBV in accordance with _Section 6.06(b)(i)_ and (y) shall be taken into
account in the determination of the Final TBV.

 



 

(ii) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Specified Action_ " means any of the
following actions (to the extent not taken into account in the determination
of Estimated TBV) taken by Holdings, the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries from the date of the most recent FOCUS Report filed by the
Sandler Broker Dealer used to calculate the Estimated TBV until the Closing:

 



 

(1) declare, set aside or pay any dividend or make any other distribution,
except for declaring and paying the Pre-Closing Distribution and declaring the
Post-Closing Distribution;

 



     

 

 



 

(2) make any payments to any Seller or any of his, her or its Affiliates in
respect of any Equity Interests of the Ranger Entities being redeemed,
purchased or repaid, or any other return of capital;

 



 

(3) except for (A) amounts due as salaries and commissions, under Employee
Plans, or for reimbursement of expenses, in each case, in the ordinary course,
and (B) the 2019 Bonuses (to the extent accrued in the Estimated TBV) and
accruals of the 2020 bonuses in the ordinary course, make any payments, or
incur any payment obligation to any Seller or any of his, her or its
Affiliates;

 



 

(4) make any payment, or incur any payment obligation with respect to any
transaction expenses, costs and fees to third party advisors for pre-Closing
services in connection with the consummation of the Transactions to the extent
such expenses, costs and fees exceed the amount accrued in the Estimated TBV;

 



 

(5) waive any amount owed to any Ranger Entity by any Seller or any of his,
her or its Affiliates;

 



 

(6) assume any liability of any Seller or any of his, her or its Affiliates,
or agree to assume, indemnify, guarantee or secure any such liability;

 



 

(7) accept receipt of any assets from any Seller or any of his, her or its
Affiliates to the extent that the transfer of such assets is for more than
fair market value, or transfer any assets of any Ranger Entity to Seller or
any of his, her or its Affiliates to the extent that such transfer is for less
than fair market value;

 



 

(8) extend, make or receive any loan with any Seller or any of his, her or its
Affiliates to the extent such loan is not fully repaid (with interest, as
applicable) prior to the Closing; or

 



 

(9) agree, resolve or commit to do any of the foregoing;

 



 

 _provided_ , _however,_ that in the case of each of the foregoing, any
reallocation of Class A Units and/or Class C Units made in accordance with the
terms of the LLC Agreement shall not constitute a Specified Action.

 



 

(d) _Post-Closing Distribution and TBV Adjustment_.

 



 

(i) Prior to the Closing, the Distributing Entities shall each declare a cash
distribution (the " _Post-Closing Distribution_ ") to the Sellers (in their
capacity as holders of record of issued and outstanding Holdings Units,
Company Shares, limited partnership interests of Sandler Mortgage Finance,
limited partnership interests of Sandler Advisors and limited partnership
interest of Sandler Mortgage Finance as of the record date of the Post-Closing
Distribution (which shall be prior to the Closing)) in an

 



     

 

 



 

aggregate amount equal to the amount, if any, that is determined to be payable
to the Sellers pursuant to _Section 6.06(e)_ (the " _Post-Closing
Distribution Amount_ "). Buyer shall cause the Distributing Entities to pay
the Post-Closing Distribution Amount to the Sellers following the Closing
pursuant to _Section 6.06(e)_.

 



 

(ii) No later than forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date, the
Representative shall deliver to Buyer the Representatives good faith
calculation of the Tangible Book Value on the Closing Date (the " _Closing
TBV_ "), which shall be calculated in accordance with _Section 6.06(a)_ and
the Calculation Schedule, together with reasonable supporting calculations and
other documentation reasonably requested by Buyer. The Representatives
calculation of Closing TBV shall be prepared in consultation with Buyer during
the period from and after the Closing Date until the delivery thereof. Without
limiting the foregoing, in connection with calculating Closing TBV, from and
after the Closing until the Final TBV is determined pursuant to _Section
6.06(d)(iv)_ , the Representative shall, from time to time at the request of
Buyer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, prior to the delivery of the
Closing TBV pursuant to this _Section 6.06 (d) (ii)_), and subject to the
execution of customary work paper access letters if requested by accountants
of the Company, (1) provide Buyer and its agents with reasonable access during
normal business hours to the drafts of the calculation of Closing TBV and
supporting materials prepared in connection therewith and (2) cooperate with
and assist Buyer and its agents in connection with the review of such
materials. From and after delivery of the Closing TBV by the Representative
until the Final TBV is determined pursuant to _Section 6.06(d)(iv)_, Buyer
shall, upon reasonable prior notice from the Representative, and subject to
the execution of customary work paper access letters if requested by
accountants of the Company, (A) provide the Representative and his agents with
reasonable access during normal business hours to the facilities, books and
records and work papers of the Company and (B) cooperate with and assist the
Representative and his agents in connection with the review of such materials,
including by making reasonably available its employees, accountants and other
personnel involved in the preparation of such calculation as well as employees
of the Company, in each case, to the extent reasonably necessary for the
Representative to complete such calculation.

 



 

(iii) Promptly following the delivery by the Representative of the estimated
calculation of Closing TBV pursuant to _Section 6.06(d)(ii)_, and in any
event within two (2) business days thereafter, Buyer shall deposit in an
escrow account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") established by JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. or another nationally recognized banking institution mutually agreed by
Buyer and the Representative prior to the Closing, acting as escrow agent (the
" _Escrow Agent_ "), to be held pursuant to an escrow agreement to be entered
into at the Closing by and among the Escrow Agent, Buyer and the
Representative (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), an amount in cash equal to the
sum of (A) the Post-Closing Distribution Amount, if any, would result from the
Representatives calculation of Closing TBV delivered pursuant to _Section
6.06(d)(ii)_ _ plus _(B) interest on such amount from the Closing Date until
the date that Buyer estimates will be the Post-Closing Distribution Date
(which estimated date shall not for this purpose be any earlier than the date
that is twenty (20) business days after the date that Representative delivered
the calculation of the Closing TBV pursuant to _Section 6.06(d)(ii)_ ) at a
rate of 2% calculated on the basis of a 365-day year for the actual number

 



     

 

 



 

of days elapsed (compounded annually) (the " _Interest Rate_ ") (such amount,
the " _Escrow Amount_ ").

 



 

(iv) Buyer shall have fifteen (15) business days following the delivery by the
Representative of the calculation of the Closing TBV to review such
calculation. If Buyer has any objections to such calculation, then Buyer shall
deliver to the Representative a written statement setting forth its objections
thereto (a " _Notice of Objection_ "), which shall identify in reasonable
detail those items and amounts to which Buyer objects (the " _Disputed Items_
"). If a Notice of Objection is not delivered by Buyer during such fifteen
(15)-business day period, then the calculation of the Closing TBV as prepared
by the Representative shall be deemed accepted and agreed to by Buyer and
shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto. If Buyer
delivers a Notice of Objection to the Representative, Buyer and the
Representative shall attempt to resolve the Disputed Items within thirty (30)
days after delivery of the Notice of Objection. If Buyer and the
Representative are unable to resolve any Disputed Items within such thirty
(30) day period, then Buyer and the Representative shall mutually engage and
submit such Disputed Items to, and the same shall be finally resolved in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement by, PricewaterhouseCoopers ("
_Independent Accountant_ ") or if such firm is unable or unwilling to serve in
such capacity, an independent, reputable firm of accountants mutually selected
by Buyer and the Representative. In the event the parties fail to agree on the
selection of the Independent Accountant within ten (10) business days of a
request by either party to select such Independent Accountant, then the head
of the New York office of the American Arbitration Association at such time
shall, on behalf of and without any further action by the parties, select such
Independent Accountant by no later than five (5) business days following the
expiration of such ten (10) business day period. Buyer and the Representative
shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Independent Accountant to resolve the Disputed Items as soon as practicable,
but in any event within thirty (30) days (or such other period of time as
Buyer and the Representative shall agree) after engagement by Buyer and the
Representative, and to set forth in a written statement its final
determination of the calculation of the Tangible Book Value on the Closing
Date. In resolving any Disputed Item, the Independent Accountant may not
assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either party or less than the least value for such item claimed by
either party. The Independent Accountant shall make its determination (i)
based solely on the documentation submitted by, and presentations made by, the
parties (any such documentation or presentation must be provided to the other
parties prior to its submission or presentation to the Independent Accountant)
and (ii) in a manner consistent with the definition of Tangible Book Value
(and each of the defined terms used in each of those terms or in which those
terms are used and the related provisions of this Agreement) and in accordance
with _Section 6.06(a)_ and the Calculation Schedule. The decision of the
Independent Accountant shall be deemed final and binding upon the parties and
enforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its
own costs and expenses in connection with the resolution of such Disputed
Items by the Independent Accountant. The fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountant shall be allocated between Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers,
on the other hand, based upon the percentage which the portion of the
contested amount not awarded to each party bears to

 



     

 

 



 

the amount actually contested by such party, and any such amounts allocated to
the Sellers shall be deducted from the amount to be distributed, if any,
pursuant to _Section 6.06(e)(i)_ below as the sole source of recovery. The
final calculation of the Tangible Book Value on the Closing Date agreed, or
deemed agreed, by the parties or finally determined by the Independent
Accountant pursuant to this _Section 6.06(d)(iv)_ is referred to herein as
the " _Final TBV_."

 



 

(e) _Payment of Post-Closing Distribution_. Within five (5) business days of
the final determination of the Final TBV pursuant to _Section 6.06(d)(iv)_
(such date, the " _Post-Closing Distribution Date_ "):

 



 

(i) If the TBV Adjustment Amount is positive, then Buyer shall cause the
Distributing Entities to pay to the Sellers, (A) from the Escrow Account
pursuant to a written instruction to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement and (B) to the extent that the Post-Closing Distribution Amount
exceeds the Escrow Amount, from cash held by Buyer and its Subsidiaries
(including the Distributing Entities), in each case by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in accordance with the wire instructions set forth
in the Wire Schedule, the Post-Closing Distribution allocated in accordance
with the allocations set forth in _Schedule B_ (which shall be updated by the
Representative for this purpose and delivered to the Buyer no later than five
(5) business days prior to the Post-Closing Distribution Date if necessary to
reflect any repurchases or reallocations of Class A Units or Class C Units
made after the date hereof and prior to the Closing in accordance with the
terms of the LLC Agreement), which shall be an aggregate amount in cash equal
to the sum of (x) the TBV Adjustment Amount and (y) interest on the amount of
such payment from the Closing Date until the Post-Closing Distribution Date at
the Interest Rate in effect on the Post-Closing Distribution Date; and

 



 

(ii) If the TBV Adjustment Amount is zero or negative, then there shall be no
Post-Closing Distribution;

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that if (A) a Notice of Objection is timely
delivered by Buyer and the Post-Closing Distribution Date would have been
required to occur on or before April 13, 2020 had a Notice of Objection not
been timely delivered by Buyer and (B) the Final TBV has not been agreed, or
deemed agreed, by the parties or finally determined by the Independent
Accountant pursuant to _Section 6.06(d)(iv)_ by April 13, 2020, then (x) on
or before April 13, 2020, Buyer shall cause the Distributing Entities to pay
to the Sellers, (A) from the Escrow Account pursuant to a written instruction
to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and (B) to the extent
that the Post-Closing Distribution Amount that would result from Buyers
calculation of Closing TBV set forth in the Notice of Objection exceeds the
Escrow Amount, from cash held by Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the
Distributing Entities), in each case by wire transfer of immediately available
funds in accordance with the wire instructions set forth in the Wire Schedule
and allocated in accordance with the allocations set forth in _Schedule B_ (as
updated pursuant to _Section 6.06(e)(i)_), as a first installment of the
Post-Closing Distribution in an amount equal to the Post-Closing Distribution
Amount that would result from Buyers calculation of Closing TBV set forth in
the Notice of Objection and (y) if applicable, within five (5) business days
of the final determination of the Final TBV pursuant to _Section

the Post-Closing Distribution an amount in cash equal to the excess, if any,
of (I) the aggregate amount of the Post-Closing Distribution (as finally
determined pursuant to _Section 6.06(d)(iv)_) _minus_ (II) the amount, if
any, distributed pursuant to the preceding clause (x).

 



 

(f) If the Escrow Amount is greater than the Post-Closing Distribution Amount
(as finally determined pursuant to _Section 6.06(d)(iv)_), then on the date
that the Post-Closing Distribution (or final installment thereof) is made to
the Sellers pursuant to _Section 6.06(d)_, Buyer and the Representative shall
cause the Escrow Agent to release to Buyer the amount of such excess remaining
in the Escrow Account pursuant to a joint written instruction delivered to the

prepayment (as the case may be) as of the Closing of all amounts of such
Indebtedness and for the termination of any guarantees provided by any Sandler

amount of Funded Indebtedness to such lender that will be outstanding as of
the Closing Date, shall release any and all Liens secured by such Funded
Indebtedness upon the payment of the amount set forth in such Debt Pay-Off

otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such Takeover
Statute on such transactions.

Shareholder Approval, the Company shall deliver to IBOC any notice required in
accordance with Applicable Law, the Company Certificate of Incorporation or
the Company Bylaws; _provided_ that the Company shall consult with Buyer prior
to delivering any such notice and shall provide a copy of any such notice to
Buyer promptly after delivery thereof.

Buyer agrees that:

 



 

Section 7.01 _Conduct of Buyer_. From the date of this Agreement until the
Closing, except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, as required by

permit any of its Subsidiaries to:

 



 

(a) adjust, split, combine or reclassify the Buyer Common Stock;

 



 

(b) amend their respective Organizational Documents (whether by merger,
consolidation or otherwise) in a manner that would adversely affect the Buyer
Common Stock or that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay Buyers ability to consummate the Transactions as promptly as
practicable;

 



 

(c) except as may be required by Applicable Law, knowingly take any action,
that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Transactions; or

 



 

(d) except as may be required by Applicable Law, knowingly take any action
that is intended to or would reasonably be likely to prevent, materially
impede or materially delay the ability of Buyer or its Subsidiaries to obtain
any necessary approvals of any Governmental Authority required for the
Transactions or to perform its covenants and agreements under this Agreement
or to consummate the Transactions as promptly as practicable; or

 



 

(e) agree, resolve or commit to do any of the foregoing with an effective date

Company Subsidiaries (each, a " _D andO Indemnified Person_") for any Losses
arising out of or relating to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Closing to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, except that no DandO
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to be indemnified in respect of any Loss
incurred by such DandO Indemnified Person by reason of bad faith, fraud or
willful misconduct with respect to such acts or omissions as determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction upon entry of a final judgment and (ii) shall
assume all obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the DandO
Indemnified Persons and any other persons in respect of indemnification and
exculpation from Losses for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Closing provided under the Companys or the relevant Company Subsidiarys
Organizational Documents in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_
that Buyer or the Company shall also advance expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable
Law; _provided further_ that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides
an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Person is not entitled to indemnification.

 



 

(b) For six (6) years after the Closing, Buyer or the Company shall provide
fiduciary liability and director and officer insurance in respect of acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Closing covering each such DandO Indemnified
Person covered as of the date of this Agreement by the Companys fiduciary
liability and director and officer insurance policies set forth on _Section
7.02(b)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, in each case, on terms with
respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in
effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , in satisfying its
obligation to provide such insurance coverage, neither Buyer nor the Company
shall be obligated to pay an annual premium in excess of the applicable amount
set forth on _Section 7.02(b)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule;
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, Buyer or the Company shall be obligated to obtain
a policy or policies with the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding such amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company, in
consultation with Buyer may (and at the request of Buyer, the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to), in lieu of obtaining or providing the
fiduciary liability and/or director and officer insurance coverage
contemplated above, may subsequent to the Closing purchase non-cancelable
"tail" coverage insurance policies under the Companys fiduciary liability
and/or director and officer insurance policies set forth on _Section
7.02(b)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (providing coverage not less
favorable than provided by such insurance in effect on the date hereof), which
tail policies shall be effective for a period from the Closing through and
including the date six (6) years from the Closing Date, covering each DandO
Indemnified Person covered as of the date of this Agreement by such fiduciary
liability and/or director and officer insurance policies in respect of acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Closing; _provided_ the amount paid by the
Company for such tail insurance prior to the Closing shall not exceed the
applicable amount set forth on _Section 7.02(b)(ii)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the cost of such
insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Company may obtain a policy or
policies with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount.

assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or the surviving company or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent
necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 7.02_.

 



 

(d) The rights of each DandO Indemnified Person under this _Section 7.02_ shall
survive consummation of the Mergers and are intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified Person and his or her heirs and
representatives and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights to indemnification or contribution that any DandO Indemnified Person may
have.

Section 8.01 _Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer, Holdings and
the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under Applicable Law to consummate the Transactions as

_however_ , that none of Holdings, the Company or their respective
Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to make any payment or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise) in connection with seeking any such
actions, consents, approvals or waivers from any such other third party),
(iii) taking all commercially reasonable acts necessary to cause the
conditions precedent set forth in _Article IX_ to be satisfied and (iv)
cooperating to the extent reasonable with the other parties hereto in their
efforts to comply with their obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of _Section 8.01(a)_, each of Buyer
and the Company shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
practicable and in any

 



     

 

 



 

event within ten (10) business days of the date of this Agreement and to
supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to use their
reasonable best efforts to (i) take all other actions necessary to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
as soon as practicable; (ii) resolve any objections which may be asserted by
any Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions; and (iii) take,
or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to obtain each consent, approval
or waiver (if any) required to be obtained (pursuant to any Applicable Law or
contract, or otherwise) by Buyer, Holdings or the Company in connection with
the Transactions and to make effective such transactions.

 



 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of _Section 8.01(a)_, as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall
cause Sandler Advisors to, in accordance with Applicable Law and any
applicable Contracts, solicit the consents set forth in _Section 4.04(b)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule through a letter, to be delivered not later
than fifteen (15) business days following the date hereof, agreeable in form
and substance to Buyer. In connection with the foregoing consent
solicitations, the Company (i) shall provide to Buyer, upon Buyers reasonable
request, an opportunity to review and comment on such any solicitation prior
to its distribution and (ii) shall provide Buyer, upon Buyers reasonable
request, with updates and material information relating to the status of such
solicitations.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
neither this _Section 8.01_ nor the "reasonable best efforts" standard shall
require, or be construed to require Buyer, Holdings or the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates, in order to obtain any
consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or
advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental
Authority in order to consummate the Mergers or any of the other Transactions
or otherwise, to agree to, and no Sandler Entity nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall agree to without Buyers prior written consent, any
conditions, remedies or requirements that, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Buyer
measured on a scale relative to the Sandler Entities, taken as a whole (a "
_Burdensome Condition_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer can compel the
Company to take any of the actions referred to above (or agree to take such
actions) if such actions are only effective after, and subject to, the
Closing.

 



 

(e) Each of Buyer, on the one hand, and Holdings and the Company, on the other
hand, agree to provide such assistance, information and cooperation to one
another as is reasonably required to obtain the approvals from Governmental
Authorities and third parties and any notices and, subject to Applicable Law,
will provide one another with the reasonable opportunity to review in advance
any applications, notices or other filings proposed to be made with respect to
the Transactions (and will give due consideration to any comments and
suggestions made with respect thereto by the other party). In connection
therewith, each party will notify the other promptly following the receipt of
any comments from any Governmental Authority or third party in connection with
such approvals and of any request by any Governmental Authority or third party
for amendments, supplements or additional information in respect of such
approvals and will supply the other party with copies of all correspondence
between such party or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and any
Governmental

 



      

 

 



 

Authority in connection with obtaining such approvals, on the other hand;
_provided_ that such disclosure is permitted under Applicable Law. Any such
provision of information by one party to the other may be made on a counsel-
only basis to the extent required under Applicable Law (including any
Applicable Law relating to gun-jumping), and any such materials may be
redacted (i) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, (ii) as
necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or
confidentiality concerns or (iii) as otherwise necessary to comply with
Applicable Law. Each of Buyer, on the one hand, and Holdings and the Company,
on the other hand, shall consult with the other in advance of any meeting or
conference with any Governmental Authority regarding the approvals from
Governmental Authorities that are required for Closing in connection with the
Transactions, and to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, give
the other party and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate
in such meetings and conferences.

 



 

(f) Buyer, on the one hand, and Holdings and the Company, on the other hand,
shall keep one another apprised of the status of matters relating to
completion of the Transactions, including promptly furnishing the other with
copies of any notices or other communications received by it or, to its
knowledge, its Representatives from any Governmental Authority, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law.

 



 

Section 8.02 _Certain Filings_. Buyer, Holdings and the Company shall
cooperate with one another (i) in determining whether any action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required, or any
actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from
parties to any material Contracts, in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions and (ii) in taking such actions or making any such filings,
furnishing information required in connection therewith and seeking timely to
obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that none of Holdings, the Company or their respective
Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to make any payment or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise) in connection with seeking any such
actions, consents, approvals or waivers in respect of any material Contracts.

 



 

Section 8.03 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) Buyer agrees that the employees of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries at the Closing who remain employed with the Company or its
Subsidiaries (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") shall, following the Closing, be
provided with employee benefits, in each case, that are substantially similar
to those provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer and its
Subsidiaries as in effect from time to time.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) cause any pre-existing
conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any group
health plans of Buyer or its Affiliates to be waived with respect to the
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents, (ii) give each Continuing
Employee credit for the plan year in which the Closing occurs towards
applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses
incurred prior to the Closing for which payment has been made and (iii) give
each Continuing Employee service credit for such Continuing Employees
employment with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for purposes of
vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to participate under each applicable
Buyer employee benefit plan, as if such service had been performed with Buyer,

 



     

 

 



 

except for benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans, for purposes
of qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits or to the extent it
would result in a duplication of benefits.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Closing, if requested by Buyer in writing at least ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law
and the terms of the applicable plan or arrangement, the Company shall cause
the Companys tax-qualified defined contribution plan (the " _Company 401(k)
Plan_") to be terminated effective immediately prior to the Closing,
contingent on the occurrence of the Closing. In the event that Buyer requests
that the Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, the Company shall provide Buyer
with evidence that such Company 401(k) Plan has been terminated (the form and
substance of which shall be subject to review and approval by Buyer) not later
than the day immediately preceding the Closing.

 



 

(d) In the event that Buyer requests that the Company 401(k) Plan be
terminated, prior to the Closing and thereafter (as applicable), (i) the
Company and Buyer shall take any and all actions as may be required, including
amendments to the Company 401(k) Plan and/or the tax-qualified defined
contribution retirement plan designated by Buyer (the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_")
to permit each Continuing Employee to make rollover contributions of "eligible
rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code)
in an amount equal to the full account balance distributed to such Continuing
Employee (including the in-kind rollover of notes evidencing loans) from the
Company 401(k) Plan to the Buyer 401(k) Plan and (ii) each Continuing Employee
shall become a participant in the Buyer 401(k) Plan on the Closing Date
(giving effect to the service crediting provisions of _Section 8.03(a)_); it
being agreed that there shall be no gap in participation in a tax-qualified
defined contribution plan.

 



 

(e) Prior to the Company or Buyer making any written or material oral
communications to the managers, officers or employees of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are
affected by the Transactions, the Company or Buyer, as applicable, shall
provide the other party with a copy of the intended communication, and the
receiving party shall have a reasonable period of time to review and comment
on the communication, and the party initiating the communication shall
consider any such comments in good faith.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 8.03_ or _Section 8.04_ is intended
to (i) be treated as an amendment of any particular Employee Plan, (ii)
prevent Buyer or, following the Closing, the Company or any of their
Affiliates from amending or terminating any of their benefit plans or, after
the Closing, any Employee Plan, in accordance their terms, (iii) prevent
Buyer, the Company or any of their Affiliates, after the Closing, from
terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee, or (iv) create any
third-party beneficiary rights in any employee of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any collective bargaining
representative thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions
of employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any Continuing Employee
by Buyer, (following the Closing) the Company or any of their Affiliates or
under any benefit plan which Buyer, (following the Closing) the Company or any
of their Affiliates may maintain.

 



     

 

 



 

Section 8.04 _Certain Employee and Compensation Commitments_.

 



 

(a) With respect to bonuses and other incentive compensation payable in
respect of the Companys performance during the 2019 calendar year (the "
_2019 Bonuses_ "), if such bonuses have not been paid prior to the Closing
Date, Buyer shall (or shall cause the Company to) pay each such employee (or
if applicable, former employee) his or her 2019 Bonus in the amounts
determined by the Manager and Senior Managing Principal prior to the Closing
(and in an aggregate amount not to exceed the amount of the 2019 Bonuses
accrued by the Company in the Estimated TBV) in February 2020 and no later
than the time that the Company paid bonuses in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice.

 



 

(b) Buyer, in consultation with the Manager, shall implement a retention
program with a retention pool in the aggregate amount of $115 million (the "
_Retention Pool_ ") to be allocated to the employees of and other service
providers to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries identified, and in the
amounts set forth, in the schedule previously provided to Buyer by Seller (the
" _Retention Pool Schedule_ "). Awards under the Retention Pool will be in the
form of restricted shares of Buyer Common Stock and will vest as set forth in
the Retention Pool Schedule, subject to the recipients continued employment
or service, except in the event of specified terminations of employment or
service as set forth in the applicable award documentation between Buyer and
the award recipient; _provided_ , _however_ , that Senior Managing Principal
and Manager shall consult with the chief executive officer of Buyer prior to
any termination of any recipient of an award from the Retention Pool. To the
extent such restricted shares of Buyer Common Stock, together with the
restricted shares of Buyer Common Stock awarded as Equity Consideration, would
exceed 19.9% of the total shares of Buyer Common Stock outstanding as of the
date of this Agreement (calculated pursuant to the rules of the New York Stock
Exchange), such excess portion of the Retention Pool awards will be in the
form of cash payable on the applicable vesting dates, subject to the same
vesting terms as applied to the restricted shares of Buyer Common Stock, which
cash awards will be credited with interest at a rate of 2% calculated on the
basis of a 365-day year for the actual number of days elapsed (compounded
annually), accrued from and excluding the award date until and including the
applicable payment date. If any portion of the Retention Pool is required to
be in the form of cash awards, Senior Managing Principal will determine, in
consultation with Buyer, the award recipients who will receive a cash award,
as opposed to an award of restricted shares of Buyer Common Stock.

 



 

(c) Buyer and the Company agree that, following the Closing, for each of the
calendar years 2020 and 2021, (i) the Continuing Employees who are exclusively
dedicated to the Financial Services Group will be eligible to receive an
annual bonus from an annual compensation pool determined as set forth in
_Section 8.04(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (ii) the Financial
Services Group will be operated in accordance with the operating principles
set forth in _Section 8.04(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. During
calendar year 2022, Buyer shall consult in good faith with the Senior Managing
Principal with respect to the operation of the Financial Services Group (it
being understood that Buyer shall have final authority with respect to the
operation of the Financial Services Group in calendar year 2022 and
thereafter).

 



 

Section 8.05 _[Reserved]_.

 



     

 

 



 

Section 8.06 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release regarding the
Transactions shall be a joint press release and thereafter the Company and
Buyer each shall consult with each other prior to making any filings with any
third party and/or any Governmental Authority (including any national
securities exchange or interdealer quotation service) with respect thereto, in
each case to the extent permitted by Applicable Law and by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any national securities
exchange or interdealer quotation service or by the request of any
Governmental Authority. No party shall issue or cause the publication of any
press releases or other public announcements or disclosures with respect to
the Transactions without the other parties prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), other
than as required by Applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with or rules of any national securities exchange or interdealer
quotation service or by the request of any Governmental Authority (in which
case each party, to the extent reasonably practicable, shall consult with the
other parties prior to such publication, release or announcement to the extent
permitted by such Applicable Law, obligations and rules). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, no party shall disclose any information
regarding the Transactions, except as provided in this _Section 8.06_ or
_Section 6.04_.

 



 

Section 8.07 _Further Assurances_. If at any time following the Closing any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, each of the Buyer Parties, on the one hand, and the Sandler
Parties, on the other hand, will take such further action (including the
execution and delivery of such further instruments and documents) as the other
party may reasonably request, at the sole cost and expense of the requesting
party.

 



 

Section 8.08 _Notices of Certain Events_. Each of Buyer (on behalf of the
Buyer Parties), on the one hand, and the Company (on behalf of the Sandler
Parties), on the other hand, shall promptly notify the other of:

 



 

(a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions;

 



 

(b) subject to Applicable Law, any notice or other communication from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions;

 



 

(c) any Actions commenced or, to its knowledge, threatened against, relating
to or involving or otherwise affecting any Sandler Entity or Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that relate to the consummation of the
Transactions; _it being understood_ that the parties shall reasonably
cooperate and consult with one another regarding the defense of any such
Action and that no settlement thereof shall be agreed without Buyers prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed);

 



 

(d) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement at any time during the term of this Agreement that would reasonably
be expected to cause the conditions set forth in _Section 9.02(a)_, _Section
9.02(b)_ or _Section 9.03(a)_ not to be satisfied; and

 



     

 

 



 

(e) any failure of that party to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder that
would reasonably be expected to cause the conditions set forth in _Section
9.02(a)(i)_ or _Section 9.03(a)(i)_ not to be satisfied or any event,
occurrence, fact or change that would reasonably be expected to cause the
condition set forth in _Section 9.02(c)_ not to be satisfied;

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 8.08_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice; _provided_ , _further_ , that
the failure to timely deliver any notices under this _Section 8.08_ shall not
constitute a breach of any provision of this Agreement or be a basis for a
party not to consummate the Transactions unless the underlying event giving
rise to such obligation to provide notice, in and of itself, constitutes a
breach of this Agreement or provides a basis for a party not to consummate the
Transactions, as applicable.

 



 

Section 8.09 _Name Change and Governance Matters_.

 



 

(a) Effective upon and following the Closing:

 



 

(i) Buyer shall change its name to "Piper Sandler Companies";

 



 

(ii) Buyer shall appoint Senior Managing Principal to: (1) the Buyer Board;

withheld, conditioned or delayed) shall be appointed to the Buyer Board in the
first quarter of 2021.

 



 

Section 8.10 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain on or prior to the Closing Date debt
financing from one or more sources in an aggregate amount of at least
$125,000,000 or such lesser amount as determined by the Buyer in good faith
(the " _Debt Financing_ ") to be used to pay a portion of the Cash

SECURITIES LAWS AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD, TRANSFERRED, OR ASSIGNED EXCEPT

party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any
right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication).

 



 

Section 12.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules,
any Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter thereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
oral and written, among the parties with respect to the subject matter
thereof.

 



 

Section 12.11 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing expressed or referred to in
this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than the parties to
this Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with
respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement, other than (i)
_Section 7.02_, which shall be enforceable by each of the current and former
directors, officers and managers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
and his or her heirs and representatives, (ii) _Section 6.06_ and _Section
8.09_, which shall be enforceable by the Representative, (iii) _Section
8.04_, including _Section 8.04(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, which
shall be enforceable by such Persons described in _Section 8.04(c)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, and (iv) _Section 12.16_, which shall be
enforceable by each of the Non-Party Affiliates and their heirs and
representatives; _provided_ , _however_ , that from and after the Closing each
of the Sellers shall be express third-party beneficiaries of _Article II_,
_Section 6.05(f)_, and _Section 6.06(e)_ which shall be enforceable solely
on their behalf by the Representative.

 



 

Section 12.12 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is
not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a
determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated
as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

Section 12.13 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent

 



     

 

 



 

breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof in any court specified in _Section 12.07_, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

 



 

Section 12.14 _No Recourse to Debt Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement, Holdings, the Company and the Representative
agree, in each case, on their own behalf and on behalf of their respective
Affiliates (and in case of the Representative, on behalf of the Sellers), that
none of the lenders or other the sources of the Debt Financing shall have any
liability or obligation to Holdings, the Company or their respective
Affiliates or to the Sellers arising from this Agreement. This _Section
12.14_ is intended to benefit and may be enforced by such lenders or other
sources of the Debt Financing and shall be binding on all successors and
assigns of Buyer, and is not intended to limit any liability or obligation
arising from another Contract to which Holdings or the Company may be a party.

 



 

Section 12.15 _Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement (or in
any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement) shall survive the
Closing, except for those covenants and agreements contained herein which by
their terms apply in whole or in part after the Closing; _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not limit liability for Fraud by any party.

 



 

Section 12.16 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claim or cause of action (whether in contract or tort, in law or in
equity) based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or the negotiation, execution, performance or
non-performance of this Agreement (including any representation or warranty
made in or in connection with this Agreement) may only be brought against, the
entities that are expressly named as parties hereto or thereto, as applicable,
and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein and
therein with respect to such party, and subject to the limitations contained
herein and therein (as applicable). No Person, including any past, present or
future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
shareholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative of any
named party to this Agreement (" _Non-Party Affiliates_ "), shall have any
liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise, or based upon any
theory that seeks to impose liability of an entity party against its owners or
Affiliates) for any one or more of the representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements or other obligations or liabilities of any one or more of parties
under this Agreement or any (whether for indemnification or otherwise) of or
for any claim based on, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby except to the extent expressly set forth
in this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 12.16_ shall limit liability for
Fraud by any Non-Party Affiliate. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the
Non-Party Affiliates are intended third-party beneficiaries of this _Section
12.16_.
