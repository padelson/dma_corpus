iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of March 24, 2015 (this " _Agreement_
"), among H.J. HEINZ HOLDING CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (" _Heinz_
"), KITE MERGER SUB CORP., a Virginia corporation and direct wholly owned
subsidiary of Heinz (" _Merger Sub I_ "), KITE MERGER SUB LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company and direct wholly owned subsidiary of Heinz ("
_Merger Sub II_ "), and KRAFT FOODS GROUP, INC., a Virginia corporation ("
_Kraft_ ").

 

WHEREAS the respective boards of directors of Heinz (the " _Heinz Board_ "),
Merger Sub I and Kraft (the " _Kraft Board_ ") and the executive managers of
Merger Sub II have unanimously adopted this Agreement, and such respective
boards of directors and such executive managers, as applicable, have
determined that the terms of this Agreement are in the respective best
interests of Heinz, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II and Kraft, as applicable, and
their respective shareholders or, in the case of Merger Sub II, its sole
member;

 

WHEREAS the Kraft Board, the board of directors of Merger Sub I and the
executive managers of Merger Sub II have recommended that their shareholders
and, in the case of Merger Sub II, sole member, respectively, approve this
Agreement;

WHEREAS for U.S. Federal income Tax purposes, it is intended that (i) the
Merger and the Subsequent Merger be treated as a single integrated transaction
that will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ "), (ii) Heinz and Kraft
each be a party to the reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of
the Code (clauses _(i)_ and _(ii)_ , the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ ")
and (iii) this Agreement be, and is hereby, adopted as a "plan of
reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

 

WHEREAS Heinz, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II and Kraft desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the parties hereto agree
as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _The Merger_

SECTION 1.01.  _The Merger._ (a) On the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Virginia Stock
Corporation Act (the " _VSCA_ "), on the Closing Date, Merger Sub I shall be
merged with and into Kraft (the " _Merger_ "). At the Effective Time, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub I shall cease and Kraft shall
continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Initial Surviving
Company_ "). As a result of the Merger, Kraft shall become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Heinz.

(b) Immediately following the Merger, in accordance with the VSCA and the
Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the " _DLLCA_ "), Heinz shall cause
the Initial Surviving Company to be merged with and into Merger Sub II (the "
_Subsequent Merger_ "). Upon the effectiveness of the Subsequent Merger, the
separate corporate existence of the Initial  Surviving Company shall cease and Merger Sub II shall continue as the
surviving limited liability company in the Subsequent Merger (the " _Surviving
Company_ ") as a wholly owned subsidiary of Heinz.

(c) Heinz shall cause the following actions to occur: (i) immediately
following the Subsequent Merger, Heinz shall make a capital contribution to
Hawk Acquisition Intermediate Corporation I, a Delaware corporation (" _Heinz
Intermediate I_ "), of 100% of the limited liability company interests of the
Surviving Company (the " _Surviving Company Interests_ "), in exchange for
one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Heinz Intermediate I
(" _Heinz Intermediate I Common Stock_ "), (ii) immediately following the
contribution contemplated by clause (i), Heinz Intermediate I shall make a
capital contribution to H.J. Heinz Corporation II, a Delaware corporation ("
_Heinz Corporation II_ "), of 100% of the Surviving Company Interests in
exchange for one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Heinz
Corporation II (" _Heinz Corporation II Common Stock_ "), (iii) immediately
following the contribution contemplated by clause (ii), Heinz Corporation II
shall make a capital contribution to H.J. Heinz Company, a Pennsylvania
corporation (" _Heinz Company_ "), of 100% of the Surviving Company Interests
in exchange for one share of common stock, no par value, of Heinz Company and
(iv) immediately following the contribution contemplated by clause (iii), the
Surviving Company shall be merged with and into Heinz Company, with Heinz
Company continuing as the surviving corporation in such merger.

 

SECTION 1.02. _Closing._ The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger shall
take place at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, Worldwide Plaza,
825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10019 at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on a
date to be specified by Heinz and Kraft, which shall be no later than the
second Business Day following the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by
Law) waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions),
or at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing between
Heinz and Kraft; _provided_ that, if any of the conditions set forth in
_Article VII_ are not satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Law) waived on
such second Business Day, then the Closing shall take place on the first
Business Day on which all such conditions shall have been satisfied or (to
the extent permitted by Law) waived. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

 

SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time._ Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by filing with the State Corporation Commission of
the Commonwealth of Virginia (the " _SCC_ ") articles of merger (the "
_Articles of Merger_ ") setting forth the plan of merger contained herein and
otherwise meeting the requirements of Section 13.1-720 of the VSCA and, as
soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make all other filings
required under the VSCA or by the SCC in connection with the Merger. The
Merger shall become effective at such time (the " _Effective Time_ ") on the
Closing Date as the parties shall agree and specify in the Articles of Merger.
Immediately following the Effective Time, Heinz shall cause the
Subsequent Merger to be consummated by filing with the SCC articles of merger
(the " _Articles of Subsequent Merger_ ") meeting the requirements of Section
13.1-720 of the VSCA and by filing with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Subsequent Merger_
")

 



2  executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DLLCA and, as
soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make all other filings
required under the VSCA or the DLLCA or by the SCC or the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware in connection with the Subsequent Merger. The
Subsequent Merger shall become effective immediately following the Effective
Time (the " _Subsequent Effective Time_ ") on the Closing Date.

SECTION 1.04. _Effects._ The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
Section 13.1-721 of the VSCA. The Subsequent Merger shall have the effects
set forth in Section 13.1-721 of the VSCA and Section 18-209 of the DLLCA.

SECTION 1.05. _Certificates of Incorporation and By-laws._ (a) The Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Heinz (the " _Heinz Charter_ ")
and the Amended and Restated By-laws of Heinz (the " _Heinz By-laws_ ") shall
each be amended and restated immediately prior to the Effective Time to read
in the form of _Exhibit A_ (the " _New Heinz Charter_ ") and _Exhibit B_ (the
" _New Heinz By-laws_ "), respectively, and the New Heinz Charter and the New
Heinz By-laws shall be the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of Heinz
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.
Heinz shall file the New Heinz Charter with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL. As a
result of the amendment to the Heinz Charter pursuant to this _Section
1.05(a)_, each share of common stock of Heinz, par value $0.01 per share (the
" _Heinz Common Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (including shares of Heinz Common Stock to be issued
immediately prior to such amendment pursuant to the Equity Investment) shall
be converted (the " _Pre-Closing Heinz Share Conversion_ ") into 0.443332 of a
share (the " _Heinz Share Conversion Ratio_ ") of Heinz Common Stock. No
fractional shares of Heinz Common Stock shall be issued in connection with
the Pre-Closing Heinz Share Conversion, and each holder of shares of Heinz
Common Stock converted pursuant to the Pre-Closing Heinz Share Conversion who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Heinz
Common Stock shall receive cash in lieu thereof in accordance with the New
Heinz Charter. In connection with the Pre-Closing Heinz Share Conversion, the
number of shares of Heinz Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Heinz
Warrants shall automatically be adjusted in accordance with the terms of the
Heinz Warrants.

(b) The articles of incorporation and by-laws of Kraft shall, by virtue of
the Merger, be amended and restated to be identical to the articles of
incorporation and by-laws of Merger Sub I, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, other than with respect to the name of Kraft, and
shall remain in effect from and after the Effective Time as the articles of
incorporation and by-laws of the Initial Surviving Company, until the
consummation of the Subsequent Merger at which time the certificate of
formation and limited liability company agreement of Merger Sub II shall each
remain in effect as the certificate of formation and limited liability company
agreement of the Surviving Company in such merger.

 

(c) The certificate of formation and limited liability company agreement of
the Surviving Company shall remain in effect from and after the Subsequent
Effective Time until the merger of the Surviving Company with and into Heinz
Company immediately following the Subsequent Effective Time pursuant to
_Section 1.01(c)_ (at which time the certificate of incorporation and by-
laws of Heinz Company shall each remain in effect as the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of the surviving corporation in such merger).

 



3 ARTICLE II

 

 _Effect on Capital Stock; Exchange of Certificates_

 

SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock of Kraft._ (a) At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Heinz, Merger
Sub I, Merger Sub II or Kraft, or the holders of any shares of common stock,
without par value, of Kraft (the " _Kraft Common Stock_ "), each share of
Kraft Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than any Kraft Deferred Shares and Kraft Restricted Shares subject
to _Section 6.04_) shall be converted into the right to receive one fully
paid and nonassessable share of Heinz Common Stock (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). All shares of Kraft Common Stock converted
pursuant to this _Section 2.01(a)_, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a physical certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") or uncertificated
book-entry share (a " _Book-Entry_ ") that, in each case, immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented any such shares of Kraft Common Stock shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, the Special Dividend Per Share Amount and any other
dividends or other distributions to which holders become entitled upon the
surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entries in accordance with _Section
2.02(c)_, in each case without interest.

(b) _Certain Adjustments._ If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time (and as permitted by _Article V_), the outstanding shares of
Heinz Common Stock or Kraft Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class of shares (except in
connection with the Pre-Closing Heinz Share Conversion) by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, or any
similar event shall have occurred, then the Merger Consideration, the Heinz
Share Conversion Ratio and the Special Dividend Per Share Amount shall be
appropriately and proportionately adjusted to provide to the holders of Heinz
Common Stock and the holders of Kraft Common Stock the same economic effect
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

(c) _Appraisal Rights._ No appraisal rights shall be available to the holders
of Kraft Common Stock in connection with the Merger.

(d) _Merger Sub I_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, each
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub I issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one share of common stock, without par value, of the Initial Surviving
Company.

(e) Subsequent Merger. At the Subsequent Effective Time (i) each outstanding
share of capital stock of the Initial Surviving Company shall be cancelled
and cease to exist and no consideration shall be paid or payable in respect
thereof, and (ii) each limited liability company interest of Merger Sub II
shall be unaffected by the Subsequent Merger and shall remain outstanding as
a limited liability company interest in the Surviving Company.

SECTION 2.02.  _Exchange of Certificates._ (a) _Exchange Agent._ Prior to
the Effective Time, Heinz and Kraft shall appoint a commercial bank, trust
company or nationally

 



4  recognized shareholder service provider to be mutually agreed upon to act as
exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the delivery of the Merger
Consideration and the Special Dividend to holders of Kraft Common Stock
(together with any cash in respect of any other dividends or distributions
that such holders have the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.02(c)_).
At or prior to the Effective Time, Heinz shall deposit with the Exchange
Agent, for the benefit of holders of Certificates and Book-Entries, for
exchange in accordance with this _Article II_ through the Exchange Agent,
shares of Heinz Common Stock (in certificated or book-entry form) to
be delivered as the Merger Consideration, cash in an amount equal to the
aggregate amount of the Special Dividend and, from time to time as needed,
cash in amounts sufficient to pay any other dividends or distributions which
holders of Certificates and Book-Entries have the right to receive pursuant
to _Section 2.02(c)_ (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Heinz shall instruct the
Exchange Agent to timely pay the Merger Consideration, the Special Dividend
and such other amounts in accordance with this Agreement.

(b) _Exchange Procedures._

 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Heinz shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate
whose shares were converted pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_ into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form
as reasonably agreed by the parties which (A) shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and (B) shall
have such other provisions as Heinz and Kraft may reasonably specify and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
the Merger Consideration. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate to the
Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
physical certificate or uncertificated book-entry representing that number of
whole shares of Heinz Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive
in respect of the aggregate number of shares of Kraft Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificate pursuant to _Section 2.01_ and a check
representing cash in respect of the Special Dividend and any other dividends
or distributions that the holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section
2.02(c)_ in respect of such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall immediately be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Kraft Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of Kraft, a
physical certificate or uncertificated book-entry representing the proper
number of shares of Heinz Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.01_ and a check
representing cash in respect of the Special Dividend and any other dividends
or distributions that the holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 2.02(c)_ may be delivered to a transferee if the Certificate
representing such Kraft Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by evidence that any applicable transfer Taxes have been paid.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.02_, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration that the holder
of such Certificate has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate
pursuant to _Section 2.01_ (together with the Special Dividend and any
other

of such Certificate or Book-Entry would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, any Merger Consideration or the cash to
be paid in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such time become the
property of Heinz, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or
in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category
granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of investment. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part
of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under
this  _Article II_ , including _Section 2.02(c)_, shall be promptly returned
to Heinz. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any such
investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level
required for the Exchange Agent to make prompt cash payment pursuant to this
_Article II_ , including _Section 2.02(c)_, Heinz shall, or shall cause Heinz
Company to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to
ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level
sufficient for the Exchange Agent to make such payments under this _Article
II_ , including _Section 2.02(c)_.

 



7 (h) _Withholding Rights._ Each of Heinz, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II and the
Exchange Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any amount otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to
the making of such payment under applicable Tax Law. Any amounts so deducted,
withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. 

(i) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably
required by Heinz, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Heinz may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or, if
subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject to _Section
2.02(f)_, Heinz) shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration and any cash in respect of the Special
Dividend and any other dividends or distributions that the holder has the
right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.02(c)_.

Corporation II (a) has designed and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange
Act) to ensure that all information required to be disclosed by Heinz
Corporation II in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act

evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting prior to the date of this Agreement, to Heinz Corporation

18  Heinz Corporation IIs ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Heinz
Corporation IIs internal control over financial reporting. Since December 28,
2014, none of Heinz, Heinz Corporation IIs auditors, the board of directors

petition, objection or other pleading with any Governmental Entity
that challenges or questions the validity of or any rights of the holder
under any Heinz License, in each case, except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Heinz.

to invest, subject to the terms and conditions therein, cash in the aggregate
amount set forth therein (the " _Equity Investment_ "). As of the date hereof,
none of the Equity Investment Letters has been amended or modified, no such
amendment or modification is contemplated, and the respective obligations and
commitments contained in such letters have not been withdrawn, terminated,
rescinded, amended or modified in any respect. The Equity Investment Letters
are in full force and effect as of the date hereof and each Equity Investment
Letter constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Heinz and each other
party thereto, enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms
(except as may be limited by 

 



24  bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting
the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies).
No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would or would reasonably be expected (a) to constitute a default or breach on
the part of Heinz or any other party to the Equity Investment Letters, (b) to
Heinzs knowledge, to result in a failure of any of the conditions to the
Equity Investment or (c) to Heinzs knowledge, to otherwise result in any
portion of the Equity Investment being unavailable on the Closing Date. There
are no conditions precedent or contingencies to the obligations of the
parties under the Equity Investment Letters to make the full amount of the
Equity Investment available to Heinz on the terms therein except as expressly
set forth in the Equity Investment Letters.

 

SECTION 3.23. _No Other Representations or Warranties._ Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, none of Heinz,
any of its Subsidiaries, Heinzs Affiliates nor any other Person makes any
express or implied representation or warranty on behalf of Heinz, its
Subsidiaries or Heinzs Affiliates or any other Person, and each of Heinz,
its Subsidiaries and Heinzs Affiliates hereby disclaims any such
representation or warranty whether by Heinz, its Subsidiaries or its
Affiliates.

 

ARTICLE IV

_Representations and Warranties of Kraft_

Except as disclosed in the disclosure letter (the " _Kraft Disclosure Letter_
") delivered by Kraft to Heinz prior to the execution of this Agreement
(which letter sets forth items of disclosure with specific reference to the
particular Section or subsection of this Agreement to which the information in
the Kraft Disclosure Letter relates) or in the Kraft SEC Reports filed and

each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes

licensed or qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Kraft.

(b) True and complete copies of the Amended and Restated Articles of
Incorporation of Kraft (the " _Kraft Charter_ ") and the Amended and Restated

it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased
by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary and (iii) has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as now conducted, except for such
variances from the matters set forth in any of _clauses (i)_ , _(ii)_ or
_(iii)_ as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Kraft. 

SECTION 4.02. _Capitalization._ (a) _Authorized and Issued Shares_. (i) As of
the date of this Agreement, the authorized Kraft capital stock consists of
(A) 5,000,000,000 shares of Kraft Common Stock and (B) 500,000,000 shares of

the date of this Agreement, Kraft has not issued any Equity Interests other

or pursuant to, Kraft Equity Awards outstanding as of the Measurement Date
and in accordance with their respective terms in effect at such time.

 



26 (ii) As of the date of this Agreement, except for Kraft Stock Options,
Kraft SARs, rights under Kraft Equity Awards and the ESPP and this Agreement,
there are not issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding, and there are not

(" _Kraft Voting Debt_ ") are issued or outstanding.

 

(c) All of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests of each "significant
subsidiary" (as such term is defined under Regulation S-X of the SEC) of Kraft
are owned by Kraft, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Liens, other
than Liens for Taxes that are not yet due and immaterial Liens, and free of
any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such
Equity Interests (other than restrictions under applicable securities Laws),
and all of such Equity Interests are duly authorized and validly issued and
are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. Except for the
Equity Interests of the Kraft Subsidiaries, as of the date of this Agreement,
Kraft does not beneficially own directly or indirectly any capital stock,
membership interest, partnership interest, joint venture interest or other
Equity Interest in any Person that constitutes a Substantial Investment.

SECTION 4.03. _Authority; No Violation._  (a) Kraft has full corporate power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to consummate the Merger
and the other Transactions and to perform its obligations hereunder. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger
and the other Transactions have been duly and validly approved by the Kraft
Board. The Kraft Board has determined that this Agreement and the Merger and
the other Transactions are in the best interests of Kraft and
its shareholders, has adopted this Agreement and recommended that its
shareholders vote in favor of the approval of this Agreement and has directed
that this Agreement be submitted to Krafts shareholders for approval at a
duly held meeting of such shareholders for such purpose (the " _Kraft
Shareholders Meeting_ "). Except for the approval of this Agreement by the
affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Kraft
Common Stock entitled to vote at the Kraft

 



27  Shareholders Meeting (the " _Kraft Shareholder Approval_ ") (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, corporate proceedings of the Initial Surviving Company in
connection with the Subsequent Merger), no other corporate proceedings on the
part of Kraft or any other vote by the holders of any class or series of Kraft
Capital Stock are necessary to approve or adopt this Agreement or to
consummate the Merger and the other Transactions (except for the filing of
the appropriate merger documents as required by the VSCA). This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by Kraft and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties
hereto) constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Kraft, enforceable
against Kraft in accordance with its terms (except as may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting
the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable
remedies).

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Kraft nor the
consummation by Kraft of the Merger or the other Transactions, nor compliance
by Kraft with any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, will (i)
violate any provision of the Kraft Charter or the Kraft By-laws or (ii)
assuming that the consents, approvals and filings referred to in _Section
4.04_ are duly obtained and/or made, (A) violate any Injunction or any
statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ or decree
applicable to Kraft, any of the Kraft Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or assets or (B) violate, conflict with, result in a breach of any
provision of or the loss of any benefit under, constitute a default (or an
event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
default) under, result in the termination of or a right of termination or
cancelation under, accelerate the performance required by, or result in the
creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or assets of Kraft
or any of the Kraft Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any contract, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust,
Kraft License, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which
Kraft or any of the Kraft Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of
their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected, except, (1) in
the case of _clause (ii)(A)_ , for such violations that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Kraft and (2) in the case of _clause (ii)(B)_ , for any such
violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations, rights of termination
or cancelations, accelerations or Liens that would not, individually and not
in the aggregate with any such other violations, conflicts, breaches,
defaults, terminations, rights of termination or cancelations, accelerations
or Liens, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Kraft.

SECTION 4.04. _Consents and Approvals._ Except for (a) the filing with the SEC
of a proxy statement in definitive form relating to the Kraft Shareholders
Meeting (the " _Proxy Statement_ ") and the Form S-4 in which the Proxy
Statement will be included as a prospectus, and declaration of effectiveness
of the Form S-4, and the filing with the SEC of such other reports required in
connection with the Merger under, and such other compliance with, the Exchange
Act and the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, (b) the
filing of the Articles of Merger with the SCC pursuant to the VSCA, (c)
compliance with notices and filings under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust

required to be made or obtained under the securities or "Blue Sky" laws of
various states in connection with the issuance of Heinz Common Stock
constituting the Merger Consideration, (e) any filings required under
the rules and regulations of NASDAQ or the NYSE, as applicable and (f) such
other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,

 



28  registrations, declarations, transfers, waivers, disclaimers, and filings
the failure of which to be obtained or made would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Kraft,
no consents, approvals of, filings or registrations with, or orders,
authorizations or authority of any Governmental Entity are necessary in
connection with (i) the execution and delivery by Kraft of this Agreement and
(ii) the consummation by Kraft of the Transactions.

SECTION 4.05. _Reports._ Kraft and each of the Kraft Subsidiaries have timely
filed all submissions, reports, registrations, schedules, forms, statements
and other documents, together with any amendments required to be made with
respect thereto, that they were required to file since December 28, 2013,
with the Regulatory Agencies, and have paid all fees and assessments due and
payable in connection therewith, except in each case where the failure to file
such report, registration, schedule, form, statement or other document, or to
pay such fees and assessments, would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Kraft. No publicly
available final registration statement, prospectus, report, form, schedule or
definitive proxy statement filed since December 28, 2013, by Kraft or any of
the Kraft Subsidiaries with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act (collectively, the " _Kraft SEC Reports_ "), as of the date of
such Kraft SEC Report, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in
which they were made, not misleading, except that information as of a later
date (but before the date of this Agreement) will be deemed to modify
information as of an earlier date. Since December 28, 2013, as of their
respective dates, all Kraft SEC Reports complied in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect
thereto.

 

SECTION 4.06. _Financial Statements._ (a) Prior to the date hereof, Kraft has
filed with the SEC the consolidated balance sheet of Kraft and the Kraft
Subsidiaries as of December 28, 2013, and December 27, 2014, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, cash flows and
equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 27, 2014, as

December 27, 2014, including any amendments thereto filed with the SEC prior
to the Measurement Date, filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act,
accompanied by the audit report of PwC, the independent registered public

applicable) included in the Kraft SEC Reports filed after the date of this
Agreement will fairly present, in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of Kraft and the Kraft Subsidiaries as of the dates
thereof, and the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings,
cash flows and equity included in the Kraft Financial Statements (including
the related notes, where applicable) fairly present, and the consolidated
statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, cash flows and equity

(including the related notes, where applicable) will fairly present, in all
material respects the results of the consolidated operations and changes in

the respective fiscal periods therein set forth (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to notes and normal year-end audit 

 



29  adjustments that will not be material in amount or effect); each of such
statements (including the related notes, where applicable) complies in all
material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto; and each of such statements (including the related notes,
where applicable) has been prepared, or will be prepared, as applicable, in
all material respects in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the
periods involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in
the notes thereto.

(b) Except (i) for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against
on the most recent audited consolidated balance sheet of Kraft or the notes
thereto included in the Kraft SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this
Agreement, (ii) for liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since the date of such
balance sheet and (iii) for liabilities and obligations incurred in connection
with this Agreement, Kraft and the Kraft Subsidiaries do not have any
liabilities of any nature that would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Kraft.

 

SECTION 4.07. _Advisors  Fees._ None of Kraft, any Kraft Subsidiary or any of
their respective officers or directors has employed any Advisor, or incurred
any liability for any brokers fees, commissions, finders fees or other
Advisor fees, in connection with the Merger or other Transactions, other than
Centerview Partners LLC (" _Centerview_ "). Kraft retained Centerview
pursuant to an engagement letter and has delivered to Heinz a true and
complete copy of such engagement letter. Section 4.07 of the Kraft Disclosure
Letter sets forth, as of the date of this Agreement, Krafts good faith
estimate of the out-of-pocket fees payable by it or any Kraft Subsidiary to
Centerview in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other
Transactions.

the Transactions, from December 27, 2014, through the date of this Agreement,
Kraft and the Kraft Subsidiaries have carried on their respective businesses
in all material respects in the ordinary course.

 

SECTION 4.09. _Legal Proceedings._ (a) None of Kraft or any of the Kraft
Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to Krafts
knowledge, threatened, legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings,
claims, actions or governmental or regulatory investigations or reviews of any
nature against Kraft or any of the Kraft Subsidiaries, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Kraft.

(b) There is no Injunction, judgment or regulatory restriction imposed upon
Kraft, any of the Kraft Subsidiaries or the assets of Kraft or any of the
Kraft Subsidiaries that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Kraft.

 



30 SECTION 4.10. _Taxes and Tax Returns._ (a) Except as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Kraft: (i) Kraft and the Kraft Subsidiaries have timely filed, taking into
account any extensions, all Tax Returns required to be filed by them (all such
Tax Returns being accurate and complete) and have paid all Taxes required to
be paid by them other than Taxes that are not yet due or that are being
contested in good faith in appropriate proceedings; (ii) there are no Liens
for Taxes on any assets of Kraft or the Kraft Subsidiaries; (iii) no
deficiency for any Tax has been asserted or assessed by a taxing authority
against Kraft or any of the Kraft Subsidiaries which deficiency has not been

Kraft and the Kraft Subsidiaries have provided adequate reserves in their
financial statements for any Taxes that have not been paid; and (v) neither
Kraft nor any of the Kraft Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any Tax

such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between or among Kraft and the
Kraft Subsidiaries).

 

(b) Within the past five years, neither Kraft nor any of the Kraft
Subsidiaries has been a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled
corporation" in a distribution intended to qualify for tax-free treatment
under Section 355 of the Code, other than the distribution of Kraft by
Mondelez International, Inc. on October 1, 2012.

 

(c) Kraft is not aware of any fact or circumstance that would reasonably be
expected to prevent the Merger and the Subsequent Merger from qualifying for
the Intended Tax Treatment.

(d) Neither Kraft nor any of the Kraft Subsidiaries has been a party to a
transaction that, as of the date of this Agreement, constitutes a "listed
transaction" for purposes of Section 6011 of the Code and applicable U.S.
Treasury Regulations thereunder (or a similar provision of state Law).

 

SECTION 4.11. _Employee Benefit Plans._ (a) For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Kraft Benefit Plan_ " shall mean each material benefit or compensation plan,
program, fund, or Contract, including any material bonus, incentive, deferred
compensation, vacation, stock purchase, stock option, severance, employment,
golden parachute, retention, salary continuation, change of control,
retirement, pension, profit sharing or fringe benefit plan, program, fund, or
Contract of any kind (whether written or oral, tax-qualified or non-tax
qualified, funded or unfunded, foreign or domestic, active, frozen
or terminated) and any related trust, insurance Contract, escrow account or
similar funding arrangement, that is sponsored, maintained or contributed to
by Kraft or any Kraft Subsidiary (or required to be maintained or contributed
to by Kraft or any Kraft Subsidiary) for the benefit of current or former
directors, officers or employees of, or consultants to, Kraft or any of the
Kraft Subsidiaries or with respect to which Kraft or any of the Kraft
Subsidiaries may, directly or indirectly, have any liability. __

(b) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Kraft, each Kraft Benefit Plan
is in compliance with all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code. The
Internal Revenue Service has determined that each Kraft Benefit Plan that is
intended to be a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code is so
qualified and Kraft is aware of no event occurring after the date

 



31  of such determination that would adversely affect such determination, except
for any such events that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Kraft. No
condition exists that is reasonably likely to subject Kraft or any Kraft ERISA
Affiliate to any direct or indirect liability under Title IV of ERISA or to a
civil penalty under Section 502(j) of ERISA or liability under Section 4069
of ERISA or Section 4975, 4976, or 4980B of the Code or other liability with
respect to the Kraft Benefit Plans, in each case that would, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Kraft. There are no pending or to Krafts knowledge, threatened, claims (other
than routine claims for benefits or immaterial claims) by, on behalf of or
against any of the Kraft Benefit Plans or any trusts related thereto except
where such claims would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Kraft.

 

(c) Except for such matters that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Kraft, there is
no (i) unfair labor practice, labor dispute or labor arbitration proceeding
pending or, to Krafts knowledge, threatened against or affecting Kraft or any
Kraft Subsidiary, or (ii) lockout, strike, slowdown, work stoppage or, to
Krafts knowledge, threat thereof by or with respect to any employees of Kraft
or any Kraft Subsidiary.

(d) Except as provided by this Agreement, neither the execution and delivery
of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions
(either alone or in conjunction with any other event) will (i) result in any
payment (including severance, unemployment compensation, "excess parachute
payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code), forgiveness of
Indebtedness or otherwise) becoming due to any current or former director or
any employee of Kraft or any Kraft Subsidiary, (ii) increase any benefits
otherwise payable under any Kraft Benefit Plan or (iii) result in any
acceleration of the time of payment, funding or vesting of any such benefits.

 

(e) No Person is entitled to receive any additional payment (including any tax
gross-up or other payment) from Kraft or any Kraft Subsidiary as a result of
the imposition of any excise or additional Taxes, interest or penalties
incurred pursuant to Section 409A or Section 4999 of the Code.

 

(f) Kraft has made available to Heinz a complete and correct list of all Kraft
Equity Awards outstanding as of the Measurement Date, which includes, with
respect to each such Kraft Equity Award, the (A) grant date, (B) vesting
schedule and (C) expiration date (if applicable) thereof.

 

(g) As of the date of this Agreement, Kraft reasonably believes that the
aggregate fair market value of shares to be purchased under the ESPP with
respect to the offering period ending on March 31, 2015 will not exceed
$10,000,000.

SECTION 4.12. _Internal Control._  Kraft has designed and maintains a system
of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting. Kraft (a) has designed and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in

 



32  Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that all
information required to be disclosed by Kraft in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and is
accumulated and communicated to Krafts management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and (b) has disclosed, based
on its most recent evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting prior to the date of this Agreement,
to Kraft auditors and the Kraft Board (i) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any
material respect Krafts ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Krafts internal control over financial reporting. Since December 27, 2014,
none of Kraft, Krafts auditors, the Kraft Board or the audit committee of
the Kraft Board has received any oral or written notification of any matter
set forth in the preceding _clause (i)_ or _(ii)_.

 

SECTION 4.13. _Compliance with Laws; Licenses._ (a) The businesses of each of
Kraft and the Kraft Subsidiaries have been conducted in compliance with all
Laws, except where the failure to so comply would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Kraft.
No investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to Kraft
or any of the Kraft Subsidiaries is pending or, to Krafts knowledge,
threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct
the same, except for any such investigations or reviews that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Kraft. Each of Kraft and the Kraft Subsidiaries has all
Licenses necessary to conduct its business as presently conducted, except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Kraft.

(b) Each of Kraft and each of the Kraft Subsidiaries are in compliance with
(i) their respective obligations under each of the Kraft Licenses and (ii) the
rules and regulations of the Governmental Entity issuing such Kraft Licenses,
except, in either case, for such failures to be in compliance as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Kraft. There is not pending or, to Krafts knowledge,
threatened by or before any Governmental Entity any material proceeding,
notice of violation, order of forfeiture or complaint or investigation
against Kraft or any of the Kraft Subsidiaries relating to any of the Kraft
Licenses, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Kraft. The actions of the
applicable Governmental Entities granting all Kraft Licenses have not been
reversed, stayed, enjoined, annulled or suspended, and there is not pending
or, to Krafts knowledge, threatened, any material application, petition,
objection or other pleading with any Governmental Entity that challenges or
questions the validity of or any rights of the holder under any Kraft License,
in each case, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,

respect;

(l) enter into or amend any Contract or take any other action if
such Contract, amendment or action would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the
Merger or any of the other Transactions, other than in accordance with the
terms of  _Section 5.05_;

 



43 (m) implement or adopt any material change in its Tax accounting or financial
accounting policies, practices or methods, other than as may be required by
applicable Law, GAAP or regulatory guidelines;

(n) enter into or amend any material Contract to the extent the consummation

Agreement would reasonably be expected to violate, conflict with, result in a
breach of any provision of or the loss of any material benefit under,

both, would constitute a default) under, result in the termination or
cancelation under, accelerate the performance required by, or result in
the creation of any Lien upon any of the material properties or assets of
Kraft or any of the Kraft Subsidiaries under, any provision of such Contract
(in the case of entry into a new Contract) or amendment;

 

(o) except pursuant to the exercise of the fiduciary duties of the Kraft Board
or as consented to by Heinz, retain any Advisors in connection with the
Merger or the other Transactions; or

(p) agree, commit, resolve or propose to take any of the actions prohibited by
this  _Section 5.03_.

SECTION 5.04. _Control of Other Party s Business._ Nothing contained in this
Agreement will give Heinz, directly or indirectly, the right to control Kraft
or any of the Kraft Subsidiaries or direct the business or operations of Kraft
or any of the Kraft Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Nothing
contained in this Agreement will give Kraft, directly or indirectly, the
right to control Heinz or any of the Heinz Subsidiaries or direct the business
or operations of Heinz or any of the Heinz Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Heinz and Kraft will exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its respective operations and the operations of its
respective Subsidiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, including any of
the actions, rights or restrictions set forth herein, will be interpreted in
such a way as to place Kraft or Heinz in violation of any rule, regulation or
policy of any Regulatory Agency or applicable Law.

 

SECTION 5.05. _No Solicitation._ (a) Kraft will not, will cause the Kraft
Subsidiaries not to, will cause each Kraft Transaction Representative not to,
and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause each External Kraft
Transaction Representative not to, and on becoming aware of it will use its
best efforts to stop any such Person from continuing to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate any inquiries,
proposals or offers that constitute, or that would reasonably be expected to
lead to, a Takeover Proposal, (ii) engage or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-
public information in connection with, or for the purpose of facilitating, any
inquiries, proposals or offers that constitute, or that would reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal or (iii) execute or enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option or other similar agreement
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) regarding, or that is
intended to result in, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Takeover Proposal (an " _Acquisition Agreement_ "). Kraft will, will cause the
Kraft Subsidiaries to, will cause each Kraft Transaction Representative
to, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause each External Kraft

 



44  Transaction Representative, to immediately cease any solicitation,
discussions or negotiations with any Persons that may be ongoing with respect
to a Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry, proposal or offer that would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, request the prompt
return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished to
any Person in connection with a Takeover Proposal and immediately
terminate all physical and electronic dataroom access previously granted to
any such Person, its Subsidiaries or its Representatives.

(b) As used in this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any proposal or
offer from any Person or group with respect to, in a single transaction or
series of related transactions, any (i) direct or indirect acquisition of 20%
or more of the consolidated assets of Kraft and the Kraft Subsidiaries (based
on the fair market value thereof), or assets comprising 20% or more of the
consolidated revenues, net income or EBITDA of Kraft and the Kraft
Subsidiaries, including in any such case through the acquisition of one or
more Kraft Subsidiaries owning such assets, (ii) direct or indirect
acquisition of 20% or more of the outstanding Kraft Common Stock or the
outstanding voting power of Kraft (or options, rights or warrants
to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such Kraft
Common Stock or other securities representing such voting power), (iii) tender
offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result, directly or
indirectly, in any Person or group (or the shareholders of any Person or
group) beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding Kraft Common Stock
or the outstanding voting power of Kraft or (iv) merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
other similar transaction involving Kraft or any Kraft Subsidiary which would
result in any Person or group (or the shareholders of any Person or group)
beneficially owning, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the outstanding
voting power of Kraft or of the surviving entity in a merger involving Kraft
or the resulting direct or indirect parent of Kraft or such surviving entity
(or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into
or exchangeable for, securities representing such voting power). For the
avoidance of doubt, the Merger and the other Transactions shall not be deemed
a Takeover Proposal. Wherever the term "group" is used in this Agreement, it
used as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act.

(c) Kraft will promptly (but in any event within 24 hours) (i) notify Heinz
in writing in the event that Kraft or any of its Subsidiaries or Kraft
Transaction Representatives receives a Takeover Proposal and (ii) provide to
Heinz (x) an unredacted copy of any such Takeover Proposal made in writing
(including any financing commitments or other agreements related thereto) and
unredacted copies of all other material written materials constituting or
containing terms or conditions with respect to such Takeover Proposal
exchanged between Kraft (or any of its Subsidiaries or any Kraft Transaction
Representatives) and such Person (or any of its Affiliates or its or their
Representatives) or otherwise received by Kraft (or any of its Subsidiaries or
any Kraft Transaction Representatives), in each case in connection with such
Takeover Proposal (except for redactions of proprietary information of such
Person that does not relate to the material terms or conditions of such
Takeover Proposal) and (y) a written summary of all material terms and
conditions of any such Takeover Proposal to the extent not made in writing
(and in each case including the identity of the Person or group making such
Takeover Proposal). From and after such notification, Kraft will keep Heinz
informed on a prompt basis of any material developments with respect to any
such Takeover Proposal (including any changes to the material terms or
conditions thereof) or any material substantive discussions or negotiations
relating thereto. Kraft will not, and will cause the Kraft Subsidiaries

 



45  not to, enter into any confidentiality or similar agreement with any Person
that prohibits Kraft from providing to Heinz any of the information required
to be provided to Heinz under this  _Section 5.05_ within the time periods
contemplated hereby.

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this  _Section 5.05_ to the
contrary, if at any time prior to obtaining the Kraft Shareholder Approval,
Kraft or any of its Subsidiaries or Kraft Transaction Representatives receives
a bona fide written Takeover Proposal, which Takeover Proposal did not result
in any material respect from a breach of this _Section 5.05_, and the Kraft
Board or any committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside counsel, that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and the
failure to take the actions in (x) or (y) below regarding such Takeover
Proposal would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, then Kraft, its Subsidiaries and the Kraft
Transaction Representatives may, following written notice to Heinz, (x) enter
into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the Person or group making
the Takeover Proposal and thereafter furnish pursuant to such Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement information (including non-public information) with
respect to Kraft and the Kraft Subsidiaries to the Person or group making such
Takeover Proposal; _provided_ that Kraft shall promptly (but in any event
within 24 hours) provide to Heinz any information that is provided to any
Person or group given such access which was not previously provided to Heinz
and (y) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations
with the Person or group making such Takeover Proposal.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Superior Proposal_ " means
any bona fide written Takeover Proposal, which Takeover Proposal did not
result in any material respect from a breach of this _Section 5.05_, made by
a third party and which, if consummated, would result in such third party (or
in the case of a direct merger between such third party and Kraft, the
shareholders of such third party) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than
50% of the voting power of the Kraft Common Stock or more than 50% of the
consolidated assets of Kraft and the Kraft Subsidiaries (based on the fair
market value thereof), including in any such case through the acquisition of
one or more Kraft Subsidiaries owning such assets, for consideration
consisting of cash and/or securities that the Kraft Board or any committee
thereof determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside counsel) is more favorable to Krafts shareholders from a
financial point of view than the Transactions, taking into account any
changes to the terms of the Transactions irrevocably proposed by Heinz in
response to such offer or otherwise and all legal, regulatory, financial and
other aspects of such proposal and of this Agreement deemed relevant by the
Kraft Board or any such committee in good faith.

(f) Neither the Kraft Board nor any committee thereof will (i) withhold,
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Heinz the recommendation to
shareholders of Kraft that they give the Kraft Shareholder Approval, (ii)
recommend or approve the approval of, or publicly propose to recommend or
approve the approval of, any Takeover Proposal, (iii) refrain from
recommending against any Takeover Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange
offer within ten Business Days after the commencement thereof (each such
action set forth in clauses  _(i)_ , _(ii)_ and _(iii)_ being referred to
herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (iv) enter into or
propose publicly to execute or enter into (or cause or permit Kraft or any
Kraft Subsidiary to execute or enter into or propose publicly to execute or
enter into) an Acquisition Agreement

 



46  (other than any Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in
accordance with this _Section 5.05_). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 5.05_, prior to the time the Kraft Shareholder
Approval is obtained, but not after, the Kraft Board or any committee thereof
may (I) make an Adverse Recommendation Change or (II) cause Kraft to enter
into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Takeover Proposal, which
Takeover Proposal did not result in any material respect from a breach of this
_Section 5.05_ and terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(h)_,
in either case if the Kraft Board or any committee thereof determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel, that
(A) to do otherwise would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (B) in the case of clause (I) where
the Adverse Recommendation Change is made in response to a Takeover Proposal
or in the case of clause (II), that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal; _provided_ that the Kraft Board (or any committee thereof)
shall not, and shall cause Kraft not to, take any action set forth in clause
(I) or clause (II) unless (1) Kraft has provided written notice to Heinz (a "
_Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") advising Heinz that the Kraft
Board (or such committee) intends to take such action and the reasons
therefor, (2) in the case of any Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change
provided in connection with a Takeover Proposal, such Notice of Adverse
Recommendation Change specifies the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal, identifying the Person or Persons making such Superior
Proposal and including a copy of the most current version of the agreement or
proposal and all material related documentation with respect to such Superior
Proposal, (3) a period of at least four Business Days has elapsed following
Heinzs receipt of such Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change (it being
understood that any amendment or modification (other than an immaterial
amendment or modification) to any of the terms of a Takeover Proposal that is
the basis for such proposed action shall require a new Notice of Adverse
Recommendation Change and an additional three calendar day period), (4) if
requested by Heinz, Kraft has negotiated, and has caused its Subsidiaries and
Kraft Transaction Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Heinz
during such four Business Day period (as extended pursuant to _clause
(3)_) with respect to any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Heinz during such period and (5) taking into account any changes to the terms
of this Agreement irrevocably proposed by Heinz, the Kraft Board or any
committee thereof has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside counsel, that the failure to take such action
would continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law and that, in the case of any Notice of Adverse
Recommendation Change provided in connection with a Takeover Proposal, the
Takeover Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such
changes irrevocably offered by Heinz were to be given effect; and  _provided_
, _further_ that any purported termination of this Agreement pursuant to this
sentence shall be void and of no force and effect unless the termination is in
accordance with _Section 8.01(h)_ and Kraft pays Heinz the Termination Fee
in accordance with _Section 6.08_ prior to or substantially concurrently with
such termination.

(g) (i) Nothing contained in this Agreement (including this _Section 5.05_)
will prohibit Kraft or the Kraft Subsidiaries or the Kraft Board or any
committee thereof from (a) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (b) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to
the shareholders of Kraft pursuant to Rule 14d-9(b) promulgated under the
Exchange Act and (ii) no disclosure that the Kraft Board or any committee
thereof may determine (after consultation with its outside counsel) that Kraft
is required to make under applicable Law will

 



47  constitute a violation of this Agreement; _provided_ that neither the Kraft
Board nor any committee thereof shall make an Adverse Recommendation Change
except in accordance with  _Section 5.05(f)_.

(h) It is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this
_Section 5.05_ by any Kraft Transaction Representative or by an Kraft
Subsidiary will be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 5.05_ by Kraft.

response all comments reasonably proposed by the other. Heinz shall advise
Kraft, promptly after receipt of notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness
of the Form S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the

any Kraft Subsidiary, or any change occurs with respect to other information
supplied by Kraft

 



48  for inclusion in the Proxy Statement or Form S-4, which is required to be
described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement or the
Form S-4, Kraft shall promptly notify Heinz of such event, and Kraft and
Heinz shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement and the Form S-4 and, as
required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment
or supplement to Krafts shareholders. Nothing in this _Section 6.01(b)_
shall limit the obligations of any party under _Section 6.01(a)_.

 

(c) If, prior to the Effective Time, any event occurs with respect to Heinz or
any Heinz Subsidiary or Affiliate of Heinz, or any change occurs with respect
to other information supplied by Heinz for inclusion in the Proxy Statement or
the Form S-4, which is required to be described in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4, Heinz shall

of any party under _Section 6.01(a)_.

 

(d) Promptly following the execution of this Agreement (but in no event later
than one day after the date of this Agreement), Heinz, as the sole
shareholder of Merger Sub I and the sole member of Merger Sub II, shall
execute and deliver written consents approving this Agreement in accordance
with the VSCA and the DLLCA, as applicable, and provide copies of such written
consents to Kraft.

(e) Kraft shall (i) as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event within
five Business Days) following the date on which the Form S-4 is declared

Proxy Statement, duly call and give notice of, and commence mailing of the
Proxy Statement to the holders of Kraft Common Stock as of the record date
established for, the Kraft Shareholders Meeting and (ii) as soon as reasonably
practicable (but in any event within 35 days) following the commencement of
the mailing of the Proxy Statement pursuant to clause (i) above, convene and
hold the Kraft Shareholders Meeting; _provided_ that Kraft may adjourn or
postpone the Kraft Shareholders Meeting to a later date to the extent Kraft
believes in good faith that such adjournment or postponement is reasonably
necessary (i) to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement is provided to the holders of Kraft Common Stock within a
reasonable amount of time in advance of the Kraft Shareholders Meeting, (ii)
to allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies necessary to
obtain the Kraft Shareholder Approval, (iii) to ensure that there are
sufficient shares of Kraft Common Stock represented (either in person or by
proxy) and voting to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of
the Kraft Shareholders Meeting or (iv) otherwise to comply with applicable
Law. Kraft shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit the Kraft
Shareholder Approval and shall, through the Kraft Board, recommend to its
shareholders that they give the Kraft Shareholder Approval and shall include
such recommendation in the Proxy Statement, except to the extent that the
Kraft Board shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by
_Section 5.05(f)_.

 



49 SECTION 6.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality._ Upon reasonable notice
and subject to applicable Law, each of Kraft and Heinz shall, and shall cause
each of their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the other party and such
other partys Subsidiaries and their Representatives reasonable access during
the period prior to the Effective Time to all their respective properties,
books, Contracts, personnel and records and, during such period, each of Kraft
and Heinz shall, and shall cause each of its respective Subsidiaries to,
furnish promptly to the other party all information concerning its business,
finances, properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably request;
_provided_ that either party may withhold any document or information (a) that
is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement (or entered into after the
date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of business) and in accordance
with _Section 5.05_ ( _provided_ that the withholding party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent of such third party to
such access or disclosure), (b) the disclosure of which would violate any Law
or fiduciary duty ( _provided_ that the withholding party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit
reasonable disclosure not in violation of any Law or fiduciary duty) or (c)
that is subject to any attorney-client privilege ( _provided_ that
the withholding party shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such
access or disclosure to the maximum extent that does not result in a loss of
attorney-client privilege). If any material is withheld by such party pursuant
to the proviso to the preceding sentence, such party shall inform the other
party as to the general nature of what is being withheld. All information
exchanged pursuant to this _Section 6.02_ shall be subject to the
confidentiality agreement dated January 29, 2015, between Kraft and Heinz
Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

SECTION 6.03. _Required Actions._ (a) Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties shall (and shall
cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to) take, or cause to be taken,

other parties in doing, all things necessary to consummate and make effective,
as promptly as practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions in
accordance with the terms hereof.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.03(a)_, each of Heinz and
Kraft shall (i) take all action necessary to ensure that no Takeover Statute

regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement or any Transaction, take all
action necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.03(a)_, each of Heinz and
Kraft shall, and, to the extent any of Heinzs Affiliates are required to
under applicable Laws, Heinz shall cause such Affiliates to, (i) provide all
necessary notices, reports, registrations, submissions of information,
applications and other filings, and obtain as promptly as practicable all
consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, clearances and authorizations
orders of, or nonactions by (collectively, " _Consents_ "), any Governmental
Entity and any other Person that are required to be effected or obtained
by Heinz, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II or Kraft, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, in connection with the consummation of the Transactions, and
take all necessary actions to obtain any such Consents from any Governmental
Entity that are required to be so effected or obtained, (ii) prosecute all
such filings and Consents with all appropriate diligence,

 



50  (iii) furnish all information required to be furnished in connection with

all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the
other in doing, all things necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every
legal impediment that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity so as to
enable the parties hereto to consummate and make effective, as promptly as
practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions in accordance with the
terms hereof, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting
any terms, conditions, obligations, commitments or liabilities or the entry
into any other arrangements, as are necessary or reasonably advisable in order
to obtain the Consents, avoid the entry of, and the commencement of
litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
Injunction (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would otherwise
have the effect of materially delaying or preventing the consummation of the
Merger and the other Transactions (subject, in the case of this clause (vii),
to the proviso set forth in _Section 6.03(d)_ below), in the case of each of
clauses _(i)_ through _(vii)_ , other than with respect to notices, reports,
registrations, submissions, applications and other filings, Consents,
lawsuits or other legal proceedings relating to or under the HSR Act or any
other Antitrust Law, which are dealt with in _Section 6.03(d)_ below.

 

(d) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.03(a)_ or _Section
6.03(c)_, each of Heinz and Kraft shall, and, to the extent any of Heinzs
Affiliates are required to under applicable Laws, Heinz shall cause such
Affiliates to, (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in no event
later than ten Business Days after the date of this Agreement) make
an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR

documentary material under the HSR Act, take all necessary actions to be in
substantial compliance with the requirements thereof as promptly as
practicable after the receipt thereof) and (iv) subject to the proviso in the
second following sentence and to the last sentence of this _Section 6.03(d)_,
take all necessary actions to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or to obtain any Consents
required under any other Antitrust Laws as soon as practicable after the date
hereof. Both of Heinz and Kraft shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause any such filings to be in substantial compliance with the requirements
of the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Law. Each of Heinz and Kraft
shall (and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to) take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and assist and
cooperate with the other in doing, all things

 



51  necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every legal impediment (including
by defending through litigation on the merits) under any applicable Antitrust
Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity or any other Person so as
to enable the parties hereto to consummate and make effective, as promptly as
practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions in accordance with the
terms hereof, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting,
by consent decree, hold separate orders or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of their assets, properties or businesses, and the entrance into
such other arrangements (all of the foregoing being referred to as " _Remedy
Actions_ "), as are necessary or reasonably advisable in order to avoid the
entry of, and the commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any Injunction (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that would otherwise have the effect of materially delaying or
preventing the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions (it being
understood that Heinz, in full consultation with Kraft, will coordinate and
direct activities, if any, with Governmental Entities and third parties
relating to such Remedy Actions in each case in accordance with the
requirements of, and subject to the limitations set forth in, this _Section
6.03(d)_); _provided_  that, notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall require or obligate Heinz, Kraft or any of their Subsidiaries
to agree to or otherwise be required to commit to, execute or consummate any
such sale, divestiture, disposition or arrangement or other Remedy Action, if
doing so would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, results of operations
or financial condition of Heinz, Kraft and their respective Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. Nothing in this _Section 6.03_ shall require any party to
take or agree to take any such action with respect to its business
or operations pursuant to this _Section 6.03_ unless the effectiveness of
such agreement or action is conditioned upon the Closing (and Kraft shall not
take or agree to take any action with respect to its business or operations
pursuant to this _Section 6.03_ without the prior written consent of Heinz
(such consent not to be withheld, conditioned or delayed if doing so would be
inconsistent with Heinzs obligations hereunder)). For the avoidance of doubt
and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.03 or
elsewhere in this Agreement, none of 3G Capital Ltd., Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
or any of their respective Affiliates (in each case other than Heinz and its
Subsidiaries) shall be required (and none of Heinz, Merger Sub I or Merger
Sub II will have any obligation to cause them) to sell, divest or dispose of,
or enter into any other arrangements or take any other Remedy Action with
respect to, their assets, properties or businesses pursuant to this _Section
6.03_ or any other provision of this Agreement.

(e) Subject to applicable Law and the instructions of any Governmental
Entity, Heinz and Kraft shall each advise the other promptly, but in any event
within two Business Days, of (and shall promptly furnish the other with copies
of) any notice or other communication received by such party or any of its
Affiliates from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the Transactions, and
of any understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or written) such party
proposes to make or enter into with any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Transactions, and each party shall generally keep the other apprised
of the status of matters relating to completion of the Transactions. Subject
to applicable Law, neither Heinz nor Kraft shall permit any of its
respective Subsidiaries or Representatives to participate in any substantive
or material meeting or telephone conversation with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry with respect to the
Transactions unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental

 



52  Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in
such meeting or conversation. Each of Heinz and Kraft shall (i) cooperate in
the filing of any substantive memoranda, white papers, filings,
correspondence or other written communications explaining or defending this
Agreement or any of the Transactions, articulating any regulatory or
competitive argument or responding to requests or objections made by any
Governmental Entity and (ii) subject to applicable Law, furnish the other
party with copies of all filings, submissions, correspondence and
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it
and their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives, on the one hand, and
any Governmental Entity or members of any Governmental Entitys staff, on the
other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions.

 

(f) Heinz shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Heinz
Common Stock to be issued as Merger Consideration and any shares of Heinz
Common Stock issuable following the Effective Time in respect of the awards
described in _Section 6.04_ and _Section 6.11_ to be approved for listing on
NASDAQ or the NYSE, as selected by Heinz in consultation with Kraft, subject
to official notice of issuance prior to the Closing Date.

(g) Kraft shall give Heinz the opportunity to participate in the defense or
settlement of any shareholder litigation against Kraft or its directors
relating to the Merger and the other Transactions, and no such settlement
shall be agreed to by Kraft without the prior written consent of Heinz (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

SECTION 6.04. _Kraft Stock Plan._ (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the
Kraft Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the
Kraft Stock Plan) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as
may be required to effect the following:

 

(i) Each Kraft Restricted Share that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into (A) a share of
restricted Heinz Common Stock, subject to the same terms and conditions as
were applicable to such Kraft Restricted Share immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (B) the right to receive the Special Dividend Per Share
Amount in accordance with _Section 6.15_.

 

(ii) Each Kraft RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, be converted into (A) a restricted stock unit,
subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Kraft RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time, with respect to a number of shares
of Heinz Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Kraft Common Stock
underlying such award and (B) the right to receive a cash payment equal to the
Special Dividend Per Share Amount no later than 30 days following
the Effective Time.

(iii) Each Kraft DCU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, be converted into (A) a deferred compensation
unit, subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such
Kraft DCU immediately prior to the Effective Time, with respect to a number
of shares of Heinz Common Stock equal to

 



53  the number of shares of Kraft Common Stock underlying such award and (B) the
right to receive a cash payment equal to the Special Dividend Per Share Amount
no later than 30 days following the Effective Time.

(iv) Each Kraft Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
adjusted into an option to purchase, subject to the same terms and conditions
as were applicable to such Kraft Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time (including applicable vesting conditions but excluding the
number of shares subject to such Kraft Stock Option and the exercise price of
such Kraft Stock Option), (A) that number of shares of Kraft Common Stock,
rounded down to the nearest whole share, equal to the quotient determined by
dividing (1) the total number of shares of Kraft Common Stock subject to such
Kraft Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (2) the
Option Adjustment Ratio and (B) at a per-share exercise price, rounded up to
the nearest whole cent, equal to the product determined by multiplying (1) the
exercise price per share of Kraft Common Stock at which such Kraft Stock
Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by (2) the
Option Adjustment Ratio (each Kraft Stock Option so adjusted, an " _Adjusted
Kraft Stock Option_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, all Adjusted Kraft Stock
Options that will vest upon the consummation of the Merger pursuant to their
terms as of the date of this Agreement will be converted into vested options
to purchase shares of Heinz Common Stock as provided in the preceding
sentence. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Option Adjustment Ratio_ "
shall mean the quotient determined by dividing (A) the closing price of Heinz
Common Stock on the first trading day following the Closing (as reported in
_The Wall Street Journal_  (Northeast edition) or, if not reported therein,
in another authoritative source mutually selected by Heinz and Kraft) by (B)
the closing price of Kraft Common Stock on the trading day immediately prior
to the trading day on which the Kraft Common Stock trades ex-dividend with
respect to the Special Dividend, or if the Kraft Common Stock does not ever
trade ex-dividend, on the trading day immediately prior to the Closing (as
reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ (Northeast edition) or, if not reported
therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by Heinz and Kraft)
(the " _Final Kraft Pre-Dividend Price_ "). Notwithstanding the forgoing, the
exercise price and the number of shares of Heinz Common Stock purchasable
pursuant to the Kraft Stock Options shall be determined in a manner consistent
with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and, in the case of any
Kraft Stock Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise
price and the number of shares of Heinz Common Stock purchasable pursuant to
such option shall be determined subject to such adjustments as are necessary
in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code.

 

(v) Each Kraft SAR, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
adjusted into a stock appreciation right with respect to, subject to the same
terms and conditions as were applicable to such Kraft SAR immediately prior
to the Effective Time (including applicable vesting conditions but excluding
the number of shares subject to such stock appreciation right and the
reference price of such Kraft SAR), (A) that number of shares of Kraft
Common 

 



54  Stock, rounded down to the nearest whole share, equal to the quotient
determined by dividing (1) the total number of shares of Kraft Common Stock
subject to such Kraft SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time by (2) the
Option Adjustment Ratio and (B) at a per-share reference price, rounded up to
the nearest whole cent, equal to the product determined by multiplying (1) the
reference price per share of Kraft SAR at which such Kraft SAR was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by (2) the Option
Adjustment Ratio. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the reference price and the
number of shares of Heinz Common Stock subject to the Kraft SARs shall be
determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the
Code, and, in the case of any Kraft SAR to which Section 422 of the Code
applies, the reference price and the number of shares of Heinz Common Stock
subject to such stock appreciation right shall be determined subject to such
adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section
424(a) of the Code.

 

(vi) Each Kraft Deferred Share that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, (A) be converted into a deferred
share subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such
award immediately prior to the Effective Time, with respect to a number of
shares of Heinz Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Kraft Common
Stock underlying such award and (B) accrue additional deferred shares in
respect of the Special Dividend in accordance with the terms of the Kraft
Stock Plan, the applicable award agreement thereunder or past practice with
respect to such accruals as discussed in the Kraft SEC Reports.

 

(vii) Each award of Kraft Performance Shares that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into
the right to receive a cash payment equal to the target number of Kraft
Performance Shares subject to such award multiplied by the Final Kraft Pre-
Dividend Price (the " _Performance Share Amount_ "), paid as follows: (A) a
pro-rata payment equal to the Performance Share Amount multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full or partial months
that have elapsed since the beginning of the applicable performance period to
the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the total number of months
in such performance period, will be paid no later than 30 days following the
Effective Time and (B) the remaining portion of the Performance Share Amount
will be paid on the earlier of (1) the first anniversary of the Closing Date,
subject to the holders continued employment with Heinz, the Heinz Company or
either of their respective Subsidiaries, or (2) the holders termination of
employment without "Cause" (as defined in the Kraft Stock Plan) or, in the
case of a holder who is a participant in the Kraft Change in Control Severance
Plan for Key Executives (the " _Kraft CIC Plan_ "), resignation for "Good
Reason" (as defined in the Kraft CIC Plan) (each such type of termination, a "
_Qualifying Termination_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that
a holders employment with Heinz, the Heinz Company or either of their
respective Subsidiaries terminates following the Closing Date for reasons
other than a Qualifying Termination, such holders right to receive the
payment specified in clause (B) above shall terminate.

 



55 (b) For the avoidance of doubt, each outstanding unvested award under the
Kraft Stock Plan that converts into an unvested award with respect to Heinz
Common Stock pursuant to _Section 6.04(a)_ above shall remain eligible for
accelerated vesting in connection with certain terminations of service on or
following the Closing Date as provided by Section 6(a)(iv) of the Kraft Stock
Plan, subject to all applicable terms and conditions thereof.

(c) The Kraft Board (or, if appropriate, any committee of the Kraft Board
administering the ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other
actions as may be required to provide that with respect to the ESPP (i) no
offering period shall be commenced after the offering period that will
commence on April 1, 2015, and no participant shall be entitled to begin
participating in the ESPP after the date of this Agreement, (ii) each
participants outstanding right to purchase Kraft Common Stock under the ESPP
shall terminate on the earlier of (A) September 30, 2015 or (B) any "New
Purchase Date" (as defined in the ESPP) occurring prior to the Effective Time
as may be determined by Kraft under the terms of the ESPP; _provided_ that
(1) all amounts allocated to each participants account under the ESPP as of
such date shall thereupon be used to purchase whole shares at the applicable
price determined under the terms of the ESPP for such offering period using
such date as the final purchase date for each such offering period and (2) all
such shares delivered in respect of such purchases shall be purchased by Kraft
on the open market prior to the distribution of the Proxy Statement and (iii)
the ESPP shall terminate prior to the Effective Time.

(d) At the Effective Time, Heinz shall assume the Kraft Stock Plan and MSPP
and all obligations of Kraft under the Kraft Stock Plan and MSPP; _provided,_
however, that Kraft shall not permit any deferral elections to be made under
the MSPP after the date of this Agreement. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, Heinz shall deliver appropriate notices setting forth such
holders rights pursuant to this _Section 6.04_, and the agreements
evidencing awards held by such holders shall continue in effect on the same
terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this _Section
6.04_ after giving effect to the Merger).

(e) Heinz shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Heinz Common Stock for delivery upon exercise
or settlement of the awards described in _Section 6.04_ and _Section 6.11_.
As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, to the extent
necessary, Heinz shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Heinz
Common Stock underlying the awards described in _Section 6.04_ and _Section
6.11_ and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness
of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so
long as such awards remain outstanding.

SECTION 6.05. _Employee Matters_. (a) Heinz agrees that each employee of
Kraft and its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time who continues to be employed
with Heinz, Heinz Company or either of their respective Subsidiaries (a "
_Continuing Employee_ ") shall, during the period commencing at the Effective
Time and ending on December 31, 2015, be provided with (i) base salary or base
wage that is no less favorable than the base salary or base wage provided by
Kraft and its Subsidiaries to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior
to the Effective Time, (ii) target annual cash bonus and long-term incentive
opportunities that are no less favorable than the target annual cash bonus and
long-term incentive opportunities provided 

 



56  by Kraft and its Subsidiaries to each such Continuing Employee immediately

and welfare benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those
provided by Kraft and its Subsidiaries to each such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iv) severance benefits that are
no less favorable than the severance benefits provided by Kraft and its
Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Heinz further agrees that each Continuing Employee shall (A) during
calendar year 2016, be provided with (1) base salary or base wage that is no
less favorable than the base salary or base wage provided by Kraft and its
Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective

than the target annual cash bonus opportunity provided by Kraft and its
Subsidiaries to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (3) employee benefits that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than either (x) those provided by Kraft immediately prior to the
Effective Time or (y) if such Continuing Employee becomes eligible to
participate in Heinz Benefit Plans, those provided to similarly-situated
employees of Heinz and (B) during the period commencing on January 1, 2016,
and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, severance benefits

Section 6.05(a) shall not apply to Continuing Employees who are covered by a
collective bargaining agreement.

 

(b) Heinz shall, or shall cause the Heinz Company or another of Heinzs
Affiliates to, pay annual cash performance bonuses for 2015 (" _2015 Bonuses_
") to each Kraft employee who, as of the date of this Agreement, was granted
an opportunity to receive such a bonus (a " _Bonus Eligible Employee_ ") in
such amount and at such time as determined in accordance with this Section
6.05(b).

(i) Except as set forth in Section 6.05(b)(ii) or Section 6.05(b)(iii), 2015

paid at such time as Kraft generally paid such bonuses in the ordinary course
(after December 31, 2015, but no later than March 15, 2016).

 

(ii) For any Bonus Eligible Employee who experiences a Qualifying Termination
on or prior to December 31, 2015, 2015 Bonuses shall be based on Best
Performance, pro-rated for the number of full or partial months elapsed in
2015 prior to the Qualifying Termination and paid upon the Qualifying
Termination.

 

(iii) For any Bonus Eligible Employee who experiences a termination of
employment (other than a Qualifying Termination) on or prior to December 31,
2015, 2015 Bonuses shall be based on the Bonus Eligible Employees target

in 2015 prior to the Closing Date and paid at such time as Kraft generally
paid such bonuses in the ordinary course (after December 31, 2015, but no
later than March 15, 2016).

 



57 (c) Heinz shall, or shall cause Heinz Company or another of Heinzs Affiliates
to, (1) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility
waiting periods under any group health plans of Heinz or its Affiliates to be
waived with respect to the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents,

payment has been made and (3) give each Continuing Employee service credit
for such Continuing Employees employment with Heinz and its Subsidiaries for
purposes of vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to participate under each
applicable Heinz Benefit Plan, as if such service had been performed with
Heinz and its Subsidiaries, except for benefit accrual under defined benefit
pension plans or to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits.

 

(d) Heinz acknowledges that the consummation of the Merger shall be a "change
in control" for purposes of the Kraft Benefit Plans and shall, or shall cause
Heinz Company or another of Heinzs Affiliates to, honor all employee benefit
obligations to current and former employees under the Kraft Benefit Plans in
accordance with their terms.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to (1) be treated as an
amendment of any particular Kraft Benefit Plan, (2) prevent Heinz, Heinz
Company or any of their Affiliates from amending or terminating any of their
benefit plans in accordance with their terms, (3) prevent Heinz, Heinz Company
or any of their Affiliates, after the Effective Time, from terminating the
employment of any Continuing Employee, or (4) create any third-party
beneficiary rights in any employee of Kraft or Heinz or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any
collective bargaining representative thereof, with respect to the
compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be
provided to any employee of Kraft and its Subsidiaries by Kraft or any
Continuing Employee by Heinz, Heinz Company or any of their Affiliates or
under any benefit plan which Heinz, Heinz Company or any of their Affiliates
may maintain.

SECTION 6.06.  _Debt Matters._ (a) Each of Heinz and Kraft shall, shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause their respective Representatives to, provide reasonable cooperation with
the other party in connection with the refinancing of the Specified Notes on
the Closing Date (if not refinanced before by Kraft) and the Kraft Credit
Facility on the Closing Date (the " _Kraft Debt Refinancing_ ").

 

(b) Kraft shall, shall cause the Kraft Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, provide
reasonable cooperation with Heinz in arranging, consummating and funding any
other financing deemed reasonably necessary or advisable by Heinz in
connection with the Transactions, including, in each case, making Krafts
officers available to the arrangers and potential lenders of any such
financings for a reasonable number of meetings at reasonable times, and
providing all information reasonably requested by the arrangers and potential
lenders of any such financings.

 

(c) Kraft shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the administrative
agent under the Kraft Credit Facility, by no later than the third Business
Day prior to the Closing Date, to deliver to Kraft a customary payoff letter
or similar document specifying the aggregate amount of obligations (including
principal, interest, fees, expenses and other amounts payable under the Kraft
Credit Facility) that will be outstanding as of the Closing Date.

 



58 (d) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section 6.06 (but subject to
the following sentence), (i) neither Kraft nor any Kraft Subsidiary shall be
required to incur any monetary liability in connection with any financing or
other arrangements contemplated under this Section 6.06 prior to the Closing
or to cause any such arrangements to become effective or be funded prior to
the Closing, (ii) nothing in this Section 6.06 shall require action to the
extent that it would (A) cause any condition to Closing set forth herein to
not be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement, (B) require
Kraft or any Kraft Subsidiary to take any action that would conflict with or
violate any organizational documents or would be reasonably expected to
violate any Law or result in a breach of, or default under, any Contract or
(C) unreasonably interfere in the operations of Kraft and the Kraft
Subsidiaries, (iii) no Representative of Kraft or the Kraft Subsidiaries shall
be required to take any corporate actions or provide approvals in connection
with any financing or refinancing, (iv) neither Kraft nor any of the Kraft
Subsidiaries shall be required to execute prior to the Closing any definitive
financing documents and (v) Heinz, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II shall
jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless Kraft and its
Representatives, from and against any liability or obligation to any Person in
connection with any action required or requested under this Section 6.06.
The provisions of this _Section 6.06(d)_ shall not apply to any refinancing
of the Specified Notes undertaken by Kraft prior to the Closing Date.

 

SECTION 6.07. _Indemnification and Directors and Officers Insurance._ (a) From
and after the Effective Time, Heinz and Heinz Company (as successor to the
Surviving Company and the Initial Surviving Company) shall indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent that would have been permitted under the Laws
applicable to Kraft prior to the Effective Time (and shall also
advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under such
applicable Law; _provided_ the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides
an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Person is not entitled to indemnification), each current or former director
or officer of Kraft or any Kraft Subsidiary (in each case, when acting in such
capacity) (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, settlements, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the
Transactions.

(b) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section 6.07_ shall be
in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the articles
of incorporation or by-laws or comparable organizational documents of Kraft or
any Kraft Subsidiary, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws. All
obligations in respect of all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party
shall be assumed, at the Effective Time, by the Initial Surviving Company and,
at the Subsequent Effective Time, by the Surviving Company, and shall survive
the Merger and the Subsequent Merger and continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms. Heinz shall cause (i) the Initial Surviving
Company, (ii) following the Subsequent Merger, the Surviving Company and (iii)
following the merger of the Surviving Company with and into Heinz
Company, Heinz Company, to assume and perform all such obligations.

 



59 (c) For the benefit of Krafts current and former directors and officers,
Kraft shall be permitted, prior to the Effective Time, and if Kraft fails to
do so, Heinz shall cause Heinz Company (as successor to the Surviving Company
and the Initial Surviving Company), to obtain and fully pay the premium,
subject to the maximum annual premium referred to in the first proviso to
this _Section 6.07(c)_, for the extension of (i) the directors and officers
liability coverage of Krafts existing directors and officers insurance
policies and (ii) Krafts existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in
each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of six years from and
after the Effective Time that shall be from an insurance carrier with the same
or better credit rating as Krafts insurance carrier as of the date hereof
with respect to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable
as Krafts existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement,
the Merger or the other Transactions). If Kraft and Heinz Company for any
reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time,
Heinz Company shall, and Heinz shall cause Heinz Company to, continue to
maintain in effect for a period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time the DandO insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement
with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in
Krafts existing policies as of the date of this Agreement, or Heinz Company
shall, and Heinz shall cause Heinz Company to, use reasonable best efforts to
purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with benefits and
levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in Krafts existing
policies as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall Heinz or Heinz Company be required to expend for such policies an
annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid
by Kraft for such insurance; and, _provided_ , _further_ that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Heinz Company shall
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding
such amount. Heinz shall cause the DandO Insurance to be maintained in full
force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to
be honored by Heinz Company (as successor to the Surviving Company and the
Initial Surviving Company).

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.07_ will survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs. After the Effective Time, Heinz
Company (as successor to the Surviving Company and the Initial Surviving
Company) will pay or cause to be paid (as incurred) all expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, that an Indemnified Party may incur
in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this _Section
6.07_ (subject to reimbursement to the extent the Indemnified Party is
subsequently determined not to be entitled to indemnification under _Section
6.07(a)_).

(e) If Heinz Company (as successor to the Surviving Company and the Initial
Surviving Company), Heinz or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper
provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of Heinz Company
will assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.07_.

 



60 SECTION 6.08. _Fees and Expenses._ (a) Except as provided in this  _Section
6.08_, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the
Merger and the other Transactions will be paid by the party incurring such
costs and expenses; _provided_ that Heinz and Kraft shall share equally all
fees and expenses in relation to the printing and filing of the Form S-4 and
the printing, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement, other than
attorneys and accountants fees and expenses.

 

(b) In the event that:

 

(i) (A) a bona fide Takeover Proposal shall have been made directly to Krafts
shareholders or any Person shall have publicly announced a Takeover Proposal
or any Takeover Proposal otherwise becomes publicly known after the date
hereof and prior to the Kraft Shareholders Meeting and thereafter, (B) (1)
this Agreement is terminated by either Heinz or Kraft pursuant to _Section
8.01(c)_ or _8.01(d)_ or (2) this Agreement is terminated by Heinz pursuant to
_Section 8.01(e)_ and (C) Kraft (1) enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to a transaction contemplated by a Takeover Proposal or (2)
consummates such a transaction (whether or not the same Takeover Proposal that
is referenced in clause (A)), in each case, within 12 months of the date this
Agreement is terminated (for purposes of this _Section 6.08(b)(i)(C)_ only,
each reference in the definition of "Takeover Proposal" to "20% or more" being
deemed to be "more than 35%", in the event the definitive agreement or
transaction in respect of such Takeover Proposal is entered into or
consummated, as applicable, with the same Person (or any of its Affiliates)
that made or announced the Takeover Proposal that is referenced in clause (A)
or "more than 50%", if otherwise); 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Kraft pursuant to _Section 8.01(h)_; or

 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Heinz pursuant to _Section 8.01(g)_,
other than in circumstances where (1) the Adverse Recommendation Change was
made as a result of a Material Adverse Effect on Heinz and (2) prior to the
date of the Adverse Recommendation Change, no Takeover Proposal had been
received by Kraft of any of its Subsidiaries; 

then Kraft will pay Heinz a fee equal to $1,200,000,000 (the " _Termination
Fee_ "), _less_ the amount of the Expense Fee (if any) previously paid by
Kraft to Heinz pursuant to the following paragraph, by wire transfer of same
day funds to an account designated by Heinz, in the case of a termination
referred to in _Section 6.08(b)(i)_, substantially concurrently with or
prior to the earlier of the entering into of the definitive agreement or the
consummation of the transaction referred to therein, in the case of a
termination referred to in _Section 6.08(b)(ii)_, substantially concurrently
with or prior to, such termination and, in the case of a termination by Heinz
referred to in _Section 6.08(b)(iii)_, within two Business Days after such
termination.

 

In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Heinz pursuant to _Section
8.01(c)_, then Kraft will pay to Heinz the Expense Fee, by wire transfer of
same day funds to an

 



61  account designated by Heinz, within two Business Days after such
termination, and thereafter Kraft shall be obligated to pay to Heinz the
Termination Fee ( _less_ the amount of the Expense Fee previously actually
paid to Heinz pursuant to this sentence) in the event such Termination Fee is
payable pursuant to this Section 6.07. As used in this Agreement, the "
_Expense Fee_ " means an amount equal to the lesser of (x) $15,000,000 and
(y) the aggregate of all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and
expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, financial
advisors and investment bankers to Heinz and its Affiliates), incurred by
Heinz, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II or on their behalf in connection with or
related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and
performance of this Agreement, any filings or submissions under applicable
Antitrust Laws or other Laws in connection with the Transactions or any other
matters related to the Merger and the other Transactions.

(c) Kraft acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 6.08_
are an integral part of the Merger and the other Transactions and that,
without these agreements, Heinz would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if Kraft fails promptly to pay the amounts due pursuant to this
_Section 6.08_ and, in order to obtain such payment, Heinz commences a suit
that results in a judgment against Kraft for the amounts set forth in this

quotation is available) _plus_ 250 basis points. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the parties hereby acknowledge and agree that
(i) in the event that the Termination Fee becomes payable and is paid by

representations included in the certificates described in this _Section
6.09_. The parties right to take any action disclosed in Section 5.01, 5.02

obligations under this _Section 6.09_.

(a) Each Heinz Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Pre-Closing Heinz Share Conversion shall, as of the
Pre-Closing Heinz Share Conversion, automatically and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, be adjusted such that following the Pre-
Closing Heinz Share Conversion it represents an option to purchase, subject
to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Heinz Stock Option
immediately prior to the Pre-Closing Heinz Share Conversion (including
applicable vesting conditions but excluding the number of shares subject to
such stock option and the exercise price of such Heinz Stock Option) (i) that
number of shares of Heinz Common Stock, rounded down to the nearest whole
share, equal to the product determined by multiplying (A) the total number of
shares of Heinz Common Stock subject to such Heinz Stock Option immediately
prior to the Pre-Closing Heinz Share Conversion by (B) the Heinz Share
Conversion Ratio and (ii) at a per-share exercise price, rounded up to the
nearest whole cent, equal to the quotient determined by dividing (A) the
exercise price per share of Heinz Common Stock at which such Heinz Stock
Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the
Heinz Share Conversion Ratio, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the exercise
price and the number of shares of Heinz Common Stock purchasable pursuant to
the Heinz Stock Options shall be determined in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code;  _provided_ , _further_ , that in
the case of any Heinz Stock Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies,
the exercise price and the number of shares of Heinz Common Stock purchasable
pursuant to such option shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing,
subject to such adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the
requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code.

 

(b) Each Heinz RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Pre-Closing
Heinz Share Conversion shall, as of the Pre-Closing Heinz Share Conversion,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
adjusted such that following the Pre-Closing Heinz Share Conversion it
represents a restricted stock unit, subject to the same terms and conditions
as were applicable to such Heinz RSU immediately prior to the Pre-Closing
Heinz Share Conversion, with respect to a number of shares of Heinz Common
Stock, rounded to the nearest whole share, equal to the product determined by
multiplying (i) the total number of shares of Heinz Common Stock subject to
such Heinz RSU immediately prior to the Pre-Closing Heinz Share Conversion by
(ii) the Heinz Share Conversion Ratio.

SECTION 9.04. _Interpretation._ When a reference is made in this Agreement to
an Article or Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, index of
defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Any capitalized term used in any Annex or Exhibit but not
otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning assigned to such term in
this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. The words "date hereof" when used in this Agreement shall refer to
the date of this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The word "extent"
in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject
or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if." The
definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well
as the plural forms of such terms. Any agreement, instrument or Law defined or
referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or Law as from time to
time amended, modified or supplemented, unless otherwise specifically
indicated. References to a Person are also to its permitted successors and
assigns. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all references to "dollars"
and "$" will be deemed references to the lawful money of the United States of
America. The term "made available" and words of similar import mean that the
relevant documents, instruments or materials were (a) posted and made
available to the other party on the R.R. Donnelley due diligence data site,
with respect to Heinz, or on the Intralinks due diligence data site, with
respect to Kraft, as applicable, maintained by either company for the purpose
of the Merger and the other Transactions, in each case prior to the date
hereof, (b) provided via electronic mail or in person or (c) publicly
available by virtue of the relevant partys (or, in the case of Heinz, Heinz
Corporation IIs) filing of a publicly available final registration statement,
prospectus, report, form, schedule or definitive proxy statement filed with
the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act prior to the date
of this Agreement. No provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in favor
of, or against, any of the parties to this Agreement by reason of the extent
to which any such party or its legal counsel participated in the drafting
thereof or by reason of the extent to which any such provision is
inconsistent with any prior draft of this Agreement, and no rule of strict
construction will be applied against any party hereto. The Heinz Disclosure
Letter and the Kraft Disclosure Letter set forth items of disclosure with
specific reference to the particular Section or subsection of this Agreement
to which the information in the Heinz Disclosure Letter or Kraft Disclosure
Letter, as the case may be, relates; _provided_ that any fact or item that is
disclosed in any section of the Heinz Disclosure Letter or the Kraft
Disclosure Letter so as to make its relevance (i) to other representations
made elsewhere in the Agreement, (ii) to the information called for by other
sections of the Heinz Disclosure Letter or the Kraft

 



76  Disclosure Letter or (iii) to the annexes or exhibits to this Agreement
reasonably apparent shall be deemed to qualify such representations or to be
disclosed in such other sections of the Heinz Disclosure Letter, the Kraft
Disclosure Letter or the annexes or exhibits to this Agreement, as the case
may be, notwithstanding the omission of any appropriate cross-reference
thereto; _provided_ , _further_ that, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the inclusion of an item in either such disclosure
schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty will not be deemed an
admission that such item represents a material exception or material
fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Heinz or Kraft, as the case may
be. Except where the context otherwise requires, references to the "other
party" or "either party" will be deemed to refer to Heinz, Merger Sub I and
Merger Sub II, collectively, on the one hand, and Kraft, on the other hand.
All electronic communications from a Person shall be deemed to be "written"
for purposes of this Agreement.

SECTION 9.05. _Severability._ If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the economic or
legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner adverse in
any material respect to any party or such party waives its rights under this
_Section 9.05_ with respect thereto.

 

SECTION 9.06. _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

 

SECTION 9.07. _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries._ This
Agreement, taken together with the Kraft Disclosure Letter, the Heinz
Disclosure Letter, the Equity Investment Letters, the Confidentiality
Agreement and the other agreements entered into in connection with preserving
the confidentiality of information, (a) constitutes the entire agreement, and
supersedes all prior agreements (other than the Confidentiality Agreement and
the other agreements entered into in connection with preserving the
confidentiality of information) and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the Merger and the other Transactions and
(b) is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the
parties any rights or remedies other than as specifically provided in _Section
6.07_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, following the
Effective Time, the provisions of _Article II_ relating to the payment of the
Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions (including the
Special Dividend) payable pursuant to  _Section 2.02(c)_ and cash in lieu of
any fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 1.05_, shall be
enforceable by holders of Kraft Common Stock at, or immediately prior to, the
Effective Time as provided therein.

 

SECTION 9.08. _GOVERNING LAW._ EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THE LAWS OF THE
COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA ARE MANDATORILY APPLICABLE TO THE MERGER, THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF
THE STATE OF DELAWARE, REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN
UNDER ANY APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICT OF LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE.

 



77 SECTION 9.09. _Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties. Any purported assignment without
such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

SECTION 9.10. _Specific Enforcement._ The parties acknowledge and agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would
not be an adequate remedy therefor and therefore fully intend for
specific performance to be an available remedy for breaches of this
Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_, the parties shall be entitled to an
Injunction or Injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement
in any court referred to in _Section 9.11(a)_, without proof of actual
damages, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Law or in equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a
remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or
inequitable for any reason, nor to object to a remedy of specific performance
on the basis that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate
remedy for any such breach. Each party further acknowledges and agrees that
the agreements contained in this _Section 9.10_ are an integral part of
the Merger and the other Transactions and that, without these agreements, the
other party (in the case of Kraft) or parties (in the case of Heinz, Merger
Sub I and Merger Sub II) would not enter into this Agreement. Each party
further agrees that no other party hereto or any other Person shall be
required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
_Section 9.10_, and each party hereto irrevocably waives any right it may
have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or
similar instrument. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge and
agree that the right of Kraft to seek an Injunction or specific performance
in connection with enforcing Heinzs obligation to enforce its rights under or
with respect to the Equity Investment Letters shall be subject to the
requirements that (a) all conditions in _Sections 7.01_ and  _7.02_ are
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied
by actions taken at Closing) at the time when the Closing is required to occur
pursuant to _Section 1.02_ and (b) Kraft has irrevocably confirmed that if
the Equity Investment is funded, then it would take such actions that are
within its control to cause the Closing to occur substantially concurrently
with such funding.

 

SECTION 9.11. _Jurisdiction._ Each of the parties hereto hereby (a) agrees
that any claim, suit, action or other proceeding, directly or indirectly,
arising out of, under or relating to this Agreement, its negotiation or the
Merger and the other Transactions, will be heard and determined in the
Chancery Court of the State of Delaware (and each agrees that no such
claim, action, suit or other proceeding relating to this Agreement will be
brought by it or any of its Affiliates except in such court), subject to any
appeal, _provided_ that if jurisdiction is not then available in the Chancery
Court of the State of Delaware, then any such claim, suit, action or other
proceeding may be brought in any Delaware state court or any federal court
located in the State of Delaware and (b) irrevocably and unconditionally
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any such court in any such claim,
suit, action or other proceeding and irrevocably and

 



78  unconditionally waives the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any such claim, suit, action or other proceeding. Each of the
parties hereto further agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S.
registered mail to such Persons respective address set forth in _Section
9.02_ will be effective service of process for any claim, action, suit or
other proceeding in Delaware with respect to any matters to which it has
submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above in the immediately preceding
sentence. The parties hereto hereby agree that a final judgment in any such
claim, suit, action or other proceeding will be conclusive, subject to any
appeal, and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or
in any other manner provided by applicable Law.

 

SECTION 9.12. _Waiver of Jury Trial._ EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING, DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY, ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ITS
NEGOTIATION, THE MERGER OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY
HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT
OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND
(B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.12_.

 

SECTION 9.13. _Publicity._ The parties agree that the initial press release to
be issued with respect to the Merger and the other Transactions shall be a
joint press release to be reasonably agreed upon by Heinz and Kraft. Except
(a) with respect to any Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and (b) with respect to disclosures that are
consistent with prior disclosures made in compliance with this _Section 9.13_
or any communications plan or strategy previously agreed on by the parties,
Heinz and Kraft shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each
other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other
public statements with respect to the Merger or the other Transactions, and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior
to such consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude may be
required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange.

 

SECTION 9.14. _Compliance with Deadlines._ Failure by either Heinz or Kraft to
comply with the timing deadlines set forth in (a) the first sentence of
_Section 6.01(a)_, (b) the parenthetical in _clause (i)_ of _Section
6.01(e)_, and (c) the parenthetical in _clause (i)_ of _Section 6.03(d)_,
after, in each case, using reasonable best efforts to so comply, shall not be
deemed a breach of this Agreement by such party for so long as such party
continues to use reasonable best efforts to cure such failure as promptly as
practicable.

 

SECTION 9.15. _Consideration of Alternative Transaction Structures_. The
parties shall work together in good faith following the date of this
Agreement and prior to the initial filing with the SEC of the Form S-4 (a) to
explore alternative structures for the Merger and

 



79  the other Transactions whereby Kraft would be the surviving corporation in
any merger to which it is a party and which each of Heinz and Kraft believe,
taking into account all relevant considerations, would be more favorable than
the currently contemplated structure of the Merger and the other Transactions
and (b) if each party to this Agreement in its sole discretion agrees that it
desires to pursue such an alternative structure, the parties shall enter into
an appropriate amendment to this Agreement to reflect such alternative
structure and provide for such other changes necessitated thereby; provided,
however, that any actions taken pursuant to this Section 9.15 shall not (i)
alter or change the aggregate percentage ownership of the holders of shares of
Kraft Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time or holders of
shares of Heinz Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time of the
outstanding shares of capital stock in the ultimate parent company resulting
from the Transactions immediately following the Effective Time, the Special
Dividend to be paid to holders of record of shares of Kraft Common
Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time or any of the other economic
terms of this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the tax consequences of the
Transactions to the holders of Heinz Preferred Stock, Heinz Warrants or the
common stock of either party, or (iii) cause any closing condition not to be
capable of being fulfilled or otherwise substantively affect the rights and
obligations of the parties hereunder, the rights of their respective holders
of common stock hereunder or the rights of the holders of the Heinz Preferred
Stock or the Heinz Warrants.

Exhibit A-1 _EXHIBIT A_

 

FORM OF SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED

 

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

 

OF

H.J. HEINZ HOLDING CORPORATION

H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation, a corporation organized and existing under the
laws of the State of Delaware, DOES HEREBY CERTIFY AS FOLLOWS:

The corporation was originally incorporated on February 8, 2013 under the name
Hawk Acquisition Holding Corporation. The Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation as in effect as of this date
was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on June 7, 2013
(as in effect immediately prior to the adoption and effectiveness hereof, the
"Existing Certificate of Incorporation").

This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Second
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation") has been duly adopted in
accordance with Sections 228, 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware and shall be effective as of [] Eastern time on [],
2015 (the "Effective Time").

 

The Existing Certificate of Incorporation is hereby amended and restated to
read in its entirety as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

The name of the corporation (the "Corporation") is "The Kraft Heinz Company".

ARTICLE II

 

The Corporations purpose is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which
corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware (as it may be amended from time to time, the "DGCL").

ARTICLE III

 

At the Effective Time, each share of the Corporations common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, either issued and outstanding or held by the Corporation as
treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Old Common Shares")
shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
be reclassified and changed into 0.443332 of a share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share ("Common Stock"), of the Corporation (such
reclassification and change, the "Reverse Stock Split"). All fractional shares
that would otherwise be held by any holder of Common Stock as a result of the
Reverse Stock Split shall be aggregated into the total number of whole shares
of Common Stock represented by all of the fractional shares of Common Stock
held by such holder as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. If any fractional
share would remain after such aggregation, the Corporation shall, in lieu of
issuing any such fractional share, pay cash in an amount equal to the fair
value of such fractional share (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation (the "Board of Directors")). All references to
numbers of shares of Common Stock, including all amounts stated on a per share
or percentage ownership basis, contained in this Second Amended and   Restated Certificate of Incorporation or any Certificate of Designation
relating to any class or series of Preferred Stock (this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, together with any Certificate of
Designation relating to any class or series of Preferred Stock, and any
amendments thereto from time to time, the "Charter") are stated after giving
effect to the Reverse Stock Split and no further adjustment shall be made as
a consequence of the Reverse Stock Split. Each certificate previously
representing Old Common Shares shall, from and after the Effective Time,
automatically and without the necessity of presenting the same for exchange,
represent that number of whole shares of Common Stock into which the Old
Common Shares represented by such certificate shall have been reclassified and
changed; _provided_ , _however_ , that each holder of record of a certificate
that represented Old Common Shares shall receive, upon surrender of such
certificate, a new certificate representing the number of whole shares of
Common Stock into which the Old Common Shares represented by such certificate
have been reclassified and changed as a result of the Reverse Stock Split.

The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock which the
Corporation shall have the authority to issue is 5,001,000,000 shares,
consisting of 1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share
("Preferred Stock"), and 5,000,000,000 shares of Common Stock.

 

Subject to the rights of the holders of any outstanding class or series of
Preferred Stock, the number of authorized shares of either the Preferred
Stock or the Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the
number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority in voting power of the capital stock of the Corporation
entitled to vote thereon irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2)
of the DGCL (or any successor provision thereto), and no vote of the holders
of either the Preferred Stock or the Common Stock voting separately as a class
shall be required therefor.

The powers, preferences and rights and the qualifications, limitations and
restrictions of the authorized capital stock shall be as follows:



   (A) | Voting Powers 
---|--- 

1\. Each holder of Common Stock, as such, shall be entitled to one vote
in person or by proxy for each share of Common Stock held of record by such
holder on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, except as otherwise required by law, holders of
Common Stock, as such, shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this
Charter that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding class or
series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected class or series are
entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other
such class or series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Charter or pursuant to
the DGCL.

2. Except as otherwise required by law, holders of a class or series of
Preferred Stock, as such, shall be entitled only to such voting rights, if
any, as shall expressly be granted to such holders by this Charter.

 

3\. Except as otherwise set forth in this Charter, the By-Laws of the
Corporation (the "By-Laws") shall set forth the vote required to authorize
all actions with respect to which holders of capital stock in the Corporation
are entitled to vote or, if not otherwise set forth in the Charter or in the
By-Laws, the vote required shall be that set forth in the DGCL.

 



2 ---|--- 



   1. | _Dividends_ 
---|--- 

Subject to the rights of the holders of any outstanding class or series
of Preferred Stock, holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive such
dividends and other distributions in cash, stock or property of the
Corporation as the Board of Directors may declare thereon from time to time
and shall share equally on a per share basis in all such dividends and other
distributions.



   2. | _Dissolution_ 
---|--- 

In the event of the Corporations dissolution, whether voluntary
or involuntary, after payment in full of the amounts required to be paid to
the holders of any outstanding class or series of Preferred Stock, the
remaining assets and funds of the Corporation shall be distributed to the
holders of Common Stock in proportion to the number of shares held by them
and to the holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock entitled thereto.
For purposes of this Article III(B)2 (and, for the avoidance of doubt, except
with respect to any class or series of Preferred Stock if provided for in the
Charter with respect to such class or series of Preferred Stock), the
voluntary sale, conveyance, lease, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of
stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Corporation or a merger involving the Corporation and one or
more other entities (whether or not the Corporation is the entity surviving
such merger) shall not be deemed to be a dissolution of the Corporation. 



   (C) | Preferred Stock 
---|--- 

In addition to the Series A Preferred Stock established pursuant to Article
IV, and subject to the rights of the holders of any outstanding class or
series of Preferred Stock, including the Series A Preferred Stock established
pursuant to Article IV, the Board of Directors is hereby expressly authorized,
by resolution or resolutions, to provide, out of the unissued shares of
Preferred Stock, for classes and series of Preferred Stock. The Board of
Directors may fix the number of shares constituting such class or series and
the designation of such class or series and the powers (including voting, if
any), preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special
rights, if any, and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof,
of the shares of such class or series. Each class or series shall be
appropriately designated by a distinguishing designation prior to the issuance
of any shares thereof.

The powers (including voting, if any), preferences and relative,
participating, optional and other special rights of each class or series of
Preferred Stock, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof,
if any, may differ from those of any and all other classes and series at any
time outstanding.

 



3 ---|--- 

Any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting
of the stockholders of the Corporation may be taken without a meeting, without
prior notice and without a vote if a consent or consents in writing, setting
forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of
outstanding capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon having
not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize
or take such action at a meeting at which all shares of capital stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.

ARTICLE IV



   (A) | Designation 
---|--- 

The distinctive designation of the series of Preferred Stock of
the Corporation established pursuant to this Article IV is 9.00% Cumulative
Compounding Preferred Stock, Series A (" _Series A Preferred Stock_ "). The
authorized number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be 80,000. Each
share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be identical in all respects to every
other share of Series A Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A Preferred
Stock that is redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation
shall be cancelled and shall be automatically retired upon such redemption,
purchase or other acquisition and may not be reissued by the Corporation and,
following such redemption, purchase or other acquisition, the Corporation
shall file a certificate of retirement with respect to such shares so as to
reduce accordingly the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock of the
Corporation.



   (B) | Number of Common Shares 
---|--- 

For so long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, the
Corporation shall not, without the consent of holders of not less than a
majority of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding, issue
shares of Common Stock in an amount such that after giving effect to such
issuance, the Corporation would have less than 2,000,000,000 shares of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, unless such issuance is made
for the purpose of (a) a sale of such shares, the proceeds of which are used
solely to redeem shares of Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with this
Article IV or (b) a Net Proceeds Redemption. For the avoidance of doubt, this
Article IV shall not prohibit the Corporation from authorizing additional
shares of Common Stock in excess of the 5,000,000,000 shares authorized as of
the Effective Time by amendment of this Charter or from issuing any such
additional shares.

   (D) | Dividends 
---|--- 



   1. | _Rate, Accrual and Payment_ __ 
---|--- 

Holders of Series A Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of shares
of Common Stock and other Junior Stock of the Corporation shall be entitled to
receive, on each share of Series A Preferred Stock, cumulative cash dividends
payable quarterly in arrears on each March 7, June 7, September 7 and
December 7, (each, a "Regular Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on September
7, 2013; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any Regular Dividend Payment
Date occurs on a day that is not a Business Day, then any dividend otherwise
payable on such Regular Dividend Payment Date will instead be payable on the
immediately succeeding Business Day, without any adjustment to the amount
payable (and each such succeeding Business Day, when applicable and, in every
other case, each Regular Dividend Payment Date is referred to herein as a
"Dividend Payment Date"). Dividends on each share of Series A Preferred Stock
shall accrue daily on a cumulative basis at a per annum rate of 9.00% on the
amount of $100,000 per share of Series A Preferred Stock, whether or not
declared by the Board of Directors, and will be payable quarterly in arrears
in cash on each Dividend Payment Date (such quarterly amount for a full
Dividend Period, the "Regular Quarterly Dividend"), when, as and if

 



6  declared by the Board of Directors. If a Regular Quarterly Dividend is not
declared in full by the Board of Directors or is not paid in full on a
Dividend Payment Date to the holders of all shares of Series A Preferred
Stock, from and after such Dividend Payment Date such unpaid amount shall be a
"Past Due Dividend". In addition to the Regular Quarterly Dividends, dividends
("Additional Dividends") on each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall
accrue daily on a cumulative basis at a per annum rate of 9.00% on the amount
of all Past Due Dividends with respect to such share of Series A Preferred
Stock, compounded quarterly on each Dividend Payment Date, whether or not
declared by the Board of Directors (and upon such compounding, such Additional
Dividends shall be added to and shall constitute Past Due Dividends
hereunder), until the date the same are declared by the Board of Directors
and paid in cash to the holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock.

Dividends accrued and/or payable on the Series A Preferred Stock in respect
of any Dividend Period shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
consisting of twelve 30-day months. The amount of dividends accrued and/or
payable with respect to the shares of Series A Preferred Stock on any
date prior to the end of a Dividend Period shall be computed on the basis of
a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, and actual days elapsed
over a 30-day month.

 

Dividends paid in cash on Series A Preferred Stock on any Dividend Payment
Date will be payable to holders of record of Series A Preferred Stock as they
appear on the stock ledger of the Corporation on the applicable record date,
which record date shall be the 15th calendar day before such Regular Dividend
Payment Date or such other record date fixed by the Board of Directors that
does not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted, and is not more than 60 days prior to such Regular Dividend Payment
Date (each, a "Dividend Record Date"). A Dividend Record Date shall not
be required to be on a Business Day.



   2. | _Priority of Dividends_ __ 
---|--- 

So long as any share of Series A Preferred Stock remains outstanding, no
dividend shall be declared or paid on the Common Stock, any other share of
Junior Stock or any Parity Stock, and no Common Stock, other Junior Stock or
Parity Stock shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for
consideration by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, directly or
indirectly, unless on the date of such declaration, payment, purchase,
redemption or other acquisition for consideration (i) all Past Due Dividends,
and accrued and unpaid Additional Dividends thereon to the date of payment of
such Past Due Dividends, for all prior Dividend Periods, on all outstanding
shares of Series A Preferred Stock, shall have been declared and paid in full
and (ii) an amount equal to the full Regular Quarterly Dividend for all
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock for the then-current Dividend
Period shall have been declared and paid in full (or declared and such amount
shall have been deposited by the Corporation in trust for the  _pro rata_
benefit of the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock on the applicable
record date therefor with an Eligible Institution). The foregoing sentence
shall not prohibit purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of Common
Stock in connection with cashless exercises of options and similar actions
under any equity incentive plan (including any stock option plan) of the
Corporation adopted by the Board of Directors, in each case, in the ordinary
course of business.

 



7 ---|--- 



   1. | _Voluntary or Involuntary Liquidation_ __ 
---|--- 

In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of
the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, holders of Series A
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive for each share of Series A
Preferred Stock, out of the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof
(whether capital or surplus) available for distribution to stockholders of the
Corporation, and after satisfaction of all liabilities and obligations to
creditors of the Corporation, before any distribution of such assets
or proceeds is made to or set aside for the holders of Common Stock, other
Junior Stock or any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the
Series A Preferred Stock as to such distribution, payment in full in cash in
an amount equal to the sum of (i) $100,000 per share, plus (ii) the accrued
and unpaid dividends per share, including any and all Past Due Dividends and
Additional Dividends on such Past Due Dividends, in each case, whether or not
declared, to the date of payment (such sum, the "Series A Liquidation
Preference").



   2. | _Partial Payment_ __ 
---|--- 

If in any distribution described in this Article IV(E) the assets of the
Corporation or proceeds thereof are not sufficient to pay in full the
aggregate Series A Liquidation Preference and the aggregate Liquidation
Preferences (as defined below) of all Parity Stock, the amounts paid to the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock and to the holders of Parity Stock shall
be paid _pro rata_ in accordance with the respective aggregate Series A
Liquidation Preference and the aggregate Liquidation Preference of such Parity
Stock. The "Liquidation Preference" of Parity Stock means the amount
otherwise payable to the holders of such Parity Stock with respect to any
distribution described in this Article IV(E) (assuming no limitation on the
assets of the Corporation available for such distribution), including the
amount of declared but unpaid dividends to the extent provided in the Charter
with respect to such Parity Stock.



   3. | _Residual Distributions_ 
---|--- 

If the Series A Liquidation Preference has been paid in full on all shares of
Series A Preferred Stock to each respective holder thereof, the holders of
other stock of the Corporation shall be entitled to receive all remaining
assets of the Corporation (or proceeds thereof) according to their respective
rights and preferences.



   4. | _Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation_ 
---|--- 

For purposes of this Article IV(E), the merger or consolidation of the
Corporation with any other corporation or other entity, including a merger or
consolidation in which the holders of Series A Preferred Stock receive cash,
securities or other property for their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange
(for cash, securities or other property) of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Corporation, shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation.

 



8 ---|--- 



   1. | _Optional Redemption_ __ 
---|--- 

The Corporation may not redeem the Series A Preferred Stock for the first
three years following the Original Issue Date. On or after the third
anniversary of the Original Issue Date, the Corporation may, at its option,
redeem, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, shares of Series A
Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, upon notice given as provided in
Article IV(F)3, at a redemption price paid in cash for each share of Series A
Preferred Stock redeemed equal to the sum of (i) the Base Amount per share,
plus (ii) the accrued and unpaid dividends on each share, including any and
all Past Due Dividends and Additional Dividends on such Past Due Dividends,
whether or not declared, to the date of payment (such sum, the
"Redemption Price", and such date of payment, the "Optional Redemption
Date"). Any redemption of less than all of the shares of Series A Preferred
Stock at the time outstanding pursuant to an optional redemption shall be in
an amount of not less than 8,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock.



   2. | _Net Proceeds Redemption_ __ 
---|--- 

If any shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding after the eighth
anniversary of the Original Issue Date and the holders of a majority of the
shares of Series A Preferred Stock deliver to the Secretary of the Corporation
a notice of request for redemption pursuant to this Article IV(F)2, the
Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law (i) take any action
necessary or appropriate to cause the occurrence of one or more Redemption
Offerings, and (ii) redeem on each Net Proceeds Redemption Date (as defined
below) from the Net Proceeds of a Redemption Offering the maximum number of
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock that it is able to redeem in
cash from such Net Proceeds, at a price equal to the Redemption Price for each
share of Series A Preferred Stock, upon notice given to all holders of Series
A Preferred Stock as provided in Article IV(F)3. The "Net Proceeds Redemption
Date" shall mean, with respect to any Redemption Offering, the date of receipt
by the Corporation of any Offering Proceeds from such Redemption Offering.
For the avoidance of doubt, if Net Proceeds from a Redemption Offering are
insufficient to redeem all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the
Net Proceeds of each successive Redemption Offering shall be applied to
redeem shares of Series A Preferred Stock, at the Redemption Price, until all
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock have been redeemed. For the
purpose of determining whether redemption is permitted by law, the
Corporation shall value its assets at the highest amount permissible under
applicable law.



   3. | _Notice of Redemption_ 
---|--- 

Notice of every redemption of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be
given by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record
of the shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on
the books of the Corporation. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not
more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption, in the event of an
optional redemption pursuant to Article IV(F)1, or on the date of receipt of
Offering Proceeds in the event of a Net Proceeds Redemption. Any notice mailed
as provided in this Article IV(F)3

 



9  shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the
holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or
any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares
of Series A Preferred Stock called for redemption shall not affect the
validity of the redemption of any other shares of Series A Preferred Stock,
nor shall it excuse the Corporation from its obligation to redeem shares of
Series A Preferred Stock to the extent required hereunder. Each notice of
redemption given to a holder shall state: (1) the Redemption Date; (2) the
number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if less than
all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such
shares to be redeemed from such holder; (3) the Redemption Price; and (4) the
place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered
against payment of the Redemption Price.



   4. | _Redemption Generally_ 
---|--- 

The Redemption Price for any share of Series A Preferred Stock called for
redemption shall be payable in cash on the Redemption Date to the holder of
such share against surrender of the certificate(s) evidencing such share to
the Corporation (or, if such holder alleges that such certificate has or
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon delivery of a lost
certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation
to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the
Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such
certificate). Any declared but unpaid dividends payable on a Redemption Date
that occurs subsequent to the Dividend Record Date for a Dividend Period
("Additional Regular Dividends") shall not be paid to the holder entitled to
receive the Redemption Price on the Redemption Date, but rather shall be paid
to the holder of record of the redeemed shares on such Dividend Record Date
relating to the Dividend Payment Date as provided in Article IV(D).



   5. | _Partial Redemption_ __ 
---|--- 

In case of any redemption of fewer than all of the shares of Series A
Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, and if there is more than one Holder,
the shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be redeemed on a _pro rata_
basis. If fewer than all the shares of Series A Preferred Stock represented by
any certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing
the unredeemed shares without charge to the holder thereof promptly following
the Redemption Date.



   6. | _Effectiveness of Redemption_ __ 
---|--- 

If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the
Redemption Date specified in such notice all funds necessary for the payment
of the aggregate Redemption Price (plus Additional Regular Dividends, if any)
have been deposited by the Corporation, in trust for the _pro rata_  benefit
of the holders of the shares called for redemption, with an Eligible
Institution, so as to be and continue to be available solely therefor, then,
notwithstanding that any certificate for any share of Series A Preferred Stock
so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and
after the Redemption Date, dividends shall cease to accrue on all shares so
called for redemption, all shares so called for redemption shall no longer be
deemed outstanding and all rights of the respective holders with respect to
such shares shall forthwith on such

 



10  Redemption Date cease and terminate, except only the right of the respective
holders thereof to receive the Redemption Price from such Eligible
Institution, without interest, and the respective holders on the Dividend
Record Date to receive the Additional Regular Dividend, if any. Any funds
unclaimed at the end of three years from the Redemption Date shall, to the
extent permitted by law, be released by such Eligible Institution (or
its successor, which must also be an Eligible Institution) to the
Corporation, after which time the holders of the shares so called for
redemption shall look only to the Corporation for payment of the Redemption
Price of such shares or the Additional Regular Dividend, if any, with respect
to such shares.

7\. _Authorization and Issuance of Shares of Common Stock after Eighth
Anniversary of Original Issue Date; Effecting Net Proceeds Redemption_ __

The provisions of this Article IV(F)7 have been adopted pursuant to the
final clause of the first sentence, and the second sentence, of Section
141(a) of the DGCL. If, at any time after the 180th day after the eighth

Preferred Stock (the "Electing Holders"), stating that such Electing Holders

of a majority of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, then the business and
affairs of the Corporation, solely with respect to Redemption Offering
Matters (as defined below), shall be managed by or under the direction of the
Person or Persons (which, for the avoidance of doubt, may include an entity to
the fullest extent permitted by law) listed in the Electing Notice (the
"Redemption Offering Board"), and the Redemption Offering Board shall have the
full power and authority of the Board of Directors with respect to Redemption
Offering Matters. Except as otherwise provided in the Charter, the provisions
of the DGCL that otherwise apply to directors or a board of directors shall
apply to the Redemption Offering Board. The term "Redemption Offering Matters"
means any matter determined in good faith by the Redemption Offering Board to
be necessary or convenient to effecting a Redemption Offering (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the approval of the issuance of, and determination of
consideration for, shares of Common Stock in a Redemption Offering) and
effecting a related Net Proceeds Redemption.

---|---

suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor;
and

5. "proceeding" means any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, or
proceeding whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other
than any action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a
judgment in its favor), _provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_ that, except with
respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification and advancement
permitted by paragraph H of this Article VII, no action, suit or proceeding
initiated by an eligible person shall be a "proceeding" for purposes of this
Article VII unless such action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) was
authorized by the Board of Directors.

 



   (B) | Limitation of Liability 
---|--- 

To the full extent the DGCL, as it exists at the Effective Time, permits the
limitation or elimination of the liability of directors, no director made
party to any proceeding shall be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders
for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If the
DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting
the personal liability of directors, officers or other eligible persons, then

also be deemed to refer to a member of the Redemption Offering Board.

 



15 ---|--- 

To the full extent permitted by the DGCL, as it exists at the Effective Time
or as hereafter amended (but, in the case of such amendment, only to the
extent such amendment permits broader indemnification), the Corporation shall
indemnify any eligible person:

 

1\. against expenses and other liabilities actually and reasonably incurred by
such person in connection with any proceeding by reason of the fact that such
person is or was an eligible person and, with respect to any criminal
proceeding, if such person had no reasonable cause to believe such persons
conduct was unlawful; and

 

2\. against expenses in connection with the defense or settlement of any suit
or action by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its
favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was an eligible person;

if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation.



   (D) | Termination of Proceeding 
---|--- 

The termination of any proceeding or action or suit by or in the right of the
Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not of
itself create a presumption that the eligible person did not meet

entitlement to indemnification under Article VII(C).

 



   (E) | Determination of Availability

favor. Any other indemnification under Article VII(C) (unless ordered by
a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific

VII(C). With respect to a person who is a director or officer of the
Corporation at the time of such determination, such determination shall be
made:

directors, even though less than a quorum; or

 

3\. If there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by
independent legal counsel in a written opinion; or

 

4\. By the stockholders.

 



16 ---|--- 

The Corporation shall advance expenses incurred by an eligible person who is
a party to or otherwise involved in a proceeding or action or suit by or in
the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor in advance of
the final disposition of such proceeding, action or suit upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such eligible person to repay such amount if
it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified
by the Corporation under Article VII(C).



    (G) | Indemnification of Others 
---|--- 

The Corporation is empowered to indemnify or contract to indemnify any person
not specified in Article VII(C) who was, is or may become a party to or
otherwise involved in any proceeding or suit or action by or in the right of
the Corporation, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was an employee
or agent of the Corporation, to the same or a lesser extent as if such person
were specified as one to whom indemnification is granted in Article VII(C).



   (H) | Application; Amendment 
---|--- 

The provisions of this Article VII shall be applicable to all proceedings and
suits and actions by or in the right of the Corporation arising from any act
or omission, whether occurring before or after the Effective Time. No
amendment or repeal of this Article VII shall impair or otherwise diminish the
rights provided under this Article VII (including those created by contract)
with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such amendment or
repeal. The Corporation shall promptly take all such actions and make all such
determinations and authorizations as shall be necessary or appropriate to
comply with its obligation to make any indemnity against liability, or to
advance any expenses, under this Article VII. If a claim under Paragraph C, E
or F of this Article VII is not paid in full by the Corporation within 60
days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the
case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable
period shall be 20 days, the eligible person may at any time thereafter bring
suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, if successful in whole or in part in any such
suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of
expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the eligible person shall be
entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit.



   (I) | Insurance 
---|--- 

The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any
eligible person against any liability asserted against such person and
incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such persons
status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to
indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this
Article VII.

 



17 ---|--- 

Nothing herein shall prevent or restrict the power of the Corporation to make
or provide for any further indemnity and advancement, or provisions for
determining entitlement to indemnity, pursuant to one or more indemnification
agreements, By-Laws, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or other
arrangements (including, without limitation, creation of trust funds or
security interests funded by letters of credit or other means) approved by the
Board of Directors (whether or not any of the directors of the Corporation
shall be a party to or beneficiary of any such agreements, By-Laws or other
arrangements).



   (K) | Severability 
---|--- 

Each provision of this Article VII shall be severable, and an
adverse determination as to any such provision shall in no way affect the
validity of any other provision.

ARTICLE VIII

 

The Corporation hereby expressly elects that Section 203 of the DGCL shall not
govern the Corporation.

 

ARTICLE IX

The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter or repeal any provision
contained in this Charter, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by
statute, and all rights conferred upon stockholders in the Charter are subject
to this reservation.

 

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law,
but subject to Article IV(I)2, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized
to adopt, repeal, alter or amend the By-Laws of the Corporation by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors. In addition
to any requirements of applicable law and any other provision of this
Charter and notwithstanding the fact that a lesser percentage may be
specified by law, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
combined voting power of the then outstanding shares of all classes and series
of capital stock of the Corporation entitled generally to vote in the
election of directors of the Corporation, voting together as a single class,
shall be required for stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal any
provision of the By-Laws of the Corporation.

 

ARTICLE X

forum, the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including a
beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on
behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a
fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the
Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporations stockholders, (iii) any
action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, or
(iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine
shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware except as to each of
(i) through (iv) above, for any claim as to which the Court of Chancery
determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not
consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days
following such determination), which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction
of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or for which the Court
of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction.

Corporation pursuant to this By-Law, if necessary, so that the information
provided or required to be provided shall be true and complete (1) as of the
voting record date for the special meeting and (2) as of the date that is 10
days prior to the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof,
and such update and supplement shall be delivered to the Secretary at the
Corporations principal executive offices. Any stockholder who submitted
a written request for a special meeting of stockholders may revoke that
written request at any time by delivering a written revocation to the
Secretary at the Corporations principal executive offices. In addition, any
Requesting Holders failure to appear at the special meeting of stockholders
or to send the Requesting Holders qualified representative to the special
meeting of stockholders to present such matter(s) to be voted on at the
special meeting of stockholders also constitutes a revocation of such
request.

The Corporation is not required to call a special meeting of stockholders
pursuant to this Section 2(b) with respect to any matter if (i) an identical
or substantially similar matter was included on the agenda of any annual or
special meeting of stockholders held within 60 days prior to the Delivery Date
or will be included on the agenda at an annual or special meeting to be held
within 90 days after the Delivery Date (for purposes of this clause (i), the
election or removal of directors shall be considered an identical or
substantially similar matter with respect to all matters involving election
or removal of directors), or (ii) the purpose of the special meeting of
stockholders is not a proper matter for stockholder action or is otherwise
unlawful, or (iii) the written request for a special meeting of stockholders
itself violated applicable law(s) or was not made in accordance with these
By-Laws.

The business conducted at the special meeting of stockholders called
in accordance with this Section 2(b) shall be limited to the business set
forth in the notice of the special meeting; _provided_ that the Board of
Directors may submit additional matters to the stockholders at the special
meeting by including those matters in the notice of the special meeting of
stockholders.

Section 3\. _Place of Meetings_. All meetings of the stockholders shall
be held at such places as from time to time may be fixed by the Board of
Directors, either within or without the State of Delaware. In addition to or
instead of holding a meeting at a physical location, the Board of Directors
may, in its sole discretion, determine that any meeting of stockholders shall
be held by remote communications in any manner permitted by the DGCL.

Section 4.  _Notice of Meetings_. (a) Notice, stating the place, day and time
and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the
meeting is called, shall be given not less than 10 nor more than 60 days
before the date of the meeting (except as a different time is specified in
the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the
Corporation (as amended and together with any Certificate of Designation
relating to any class or series of Preferred Stock, the "Certificate of
Incorporation"), herein or by law), to each stockholder of record in respect
of the business to be transacted thereat. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
notice may be given to stockholders sharing an address in the manner and to
the extent permitted by the DGCL. Notice may be given in any manner permitted
by the DGCL.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a written waiver of notice signed by the
person or persons entitled to such notice, either before or after the time
stated therein, shall be equivalent to the giving of such notice. A
stockholder who attends a meeting shall be deemed to have (a)
waived objection to lack of notice or defective notice of the meeting, unless
at the beginning of the meeting he or she objects to holding the meeting or
transacting business at the meeting, and (b) waived objection to consideration
of a particular matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose or
purposes described in the meeting notice, unless he or she objects to
considering the matter when it is presented. No notice shall be required for
actions taken by written consent.

 

(b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at any meeting of the stockholders or any adjournment
thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution
or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of
any change, conversion or exchange of capital stock or for the purposes of
any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record
date, which shall not be less than 10 days nor more than 60 days before the
date of such meeting, nor more than 60 days prior to any other action.

 



2 Section 5\. _Quorum and Adjournment_. At all meetings of the stockholders,
unless a greater number or voting by classes or series is required by law, by
the Certificate of Incorporation or by the rules of any stock exchange upon
which shares of the Corporations capital stock are listed, a majority of the
shares entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute
a quorum. Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, it is
deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for
any adjournment of that meeting, unless a new voting record date is set for
that meeting. The chairman of the meeting of stockholders shall have the right
and authority to adjourn or recess the meeting. The stockholders, even though
less than a quorum, may adjourn the meeting.

 

Section 6\. _Organization and Order of Business_.

 

(a) The Chairman, the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors (the "Vice
Chairman"), the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation (the "Chief
Executive Officer") or any such other person as the Chairman, Vice Chairman or
Chief Executive Officer may appoint, shall act as chairman of all meetings of
the stockholders. The Secretary, or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation
(an "Assistant Secretary"), in the Secretarys absence, shall act as secretary
at all meetings of the stockholders. In the absence of the Secretary or an
Assistant Secretary, the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to
act as secretary of the meeting.

(b) The Board of Directors may adopt such rules, regulations and procedures
for the conduct of any meeting of stockholders that it deems appropriate.
Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules, regulations and procedures
adopted by the Board of Directors, the chairman of the meeting shall have the
right and authority to prescribe and enforce such rules, regulations and
procedures and to do all such acts and things as are necessary or desirable
for the proper conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, the
establishment of an agenda or order of business, the dismissal of business
not properly presented, the maintenance of order and safety, limitations on
the time allotted to questions or comments on the affairs of the Corporation,
restrictions on entry to such meeting after the time prescribed for the
commencement thereof and the opening and closing of the voting polls.

(c) At each annual meeting of stockholders, only such business shall be
conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting (i) by or at
the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by any stockholder of the
Corporation who shall be entitled to vote at such meeting and who complies
with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 6; _provided_ , that
notice procedures in connection with the election of directors shall be
determined in accordance with Article III, Section 4\. In addition to any
other applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before an
annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice
thereof in writing to the Secretary. To be timely, a stockholders notice must
be given, either by personal delivery or by United States certified mail,
postage prepaid, and received at the principal executive offices of the
Corporation (i) not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days before the first
anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting or (ii) if the date of the
annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after the
first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting, not more than 150
days prior to the date of such annual meeting and not less than 120 days
prior to the date of such annual meeting or, if the first public announcement
of the date of such annual meeting is less than 120 days prior to the date of
such annual meeting, the 10th day following the day on which public
announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Corporation. A
stockholders notice to the Secretary, whether pursuant to this Section 6 or
Section 2 of this Article II (other than with respect to Solicited
Stockholders), shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to
bring before the meeting (i) a brief description of the business desired to be
brought before the meeting, including the complete text of any resolutions to
be presented at the meeting, and the reasons for conducting such business at
the meeting; (ii) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporations
stock transfer books, of such stockholder proposing such business, and the
name and address of any beneficial owner on whose behalf the proposal is being
made; (iii) a representation that such stockholder is a stockholder of record
and intends to appear in person or by proxy at such meeting to bring the
business before the meeting specified in the notice; (iv) the class, series
and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation owned, directly or
indirectly, beneficially and of record by the stockholder and any beneficial
owner on whose behalf the proposal is made, and any of their respective
affiliates or associates or other parties with whom they are acting in
concert, as well as any derivative instrument or similar contract or agreement
the value of or return on which is based on or linked to the value of or
return of any of the Corporations securities; (v) any proxy (other than a
revocable proxy given in response to a solicitation statement filed pursuant
to, and in accordance with, Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act), voting trust,
voting agreement or similar contract, arrangement, agreement or understanding
pursuant to which the stockholder and any beneficial owner on whose behalf the
proposal is being 

 



3  made, or any of their respective affiliates or associates or other parties
with whom they are acting in concert, has a right to vote or direct the voting
of any of the Corporations securities; and (vi) any material interest of the
stockholder, and any beneficial owner on whose behalf the proposal is made and
their respective affiliates or associates or other parties with whom they are
acting in concert, in such business. The stockholder shall (A) notify the
Corporation of any inaccuracy or change (within two business days of becoming
aware of such inaccuracy or change) in any information previously provided to
the Corporation pursuant to this By-Law and (B) promptly update and
supplement information previously provided to the Corporation pursuant to this
By-Law, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be
provided shall be true and complete (1) as of the voting record date for the
meeting and (2) as of the date that is 10 days prior to the meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof, and such update and supplement shall be
delivered to the Secretary at the Corporations principal executive offices.
The Secretary shall deliver each such stockholders notice that has been
timely received to the Board of Directors or a committee designated by the
Board of Directors for review. Unless otherwise required by law, if the
stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not
appear at the meeting of stockholders to present such business, such proposal
shall be disregarded and such business shall not be transacted,
notwithstanding that the Corporation may have received proxies in respect of
such vote.

Notwithstanding anything in these By-Laws to the contrary, no business shall
be conducted at an annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures
set forth in this Section 6\. The chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts
warrant, determine that the business was not brought before the meeting in
accordance with the procedures prescribed by this Section 6\. If the chairman
of the meeting should so determine, he or she shall so declare to the meeting
and the business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be
transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6, a
stockholder seeking to have a proposal included in the Corporations proxy
statement shall comply with the requirements of Regulation 14A under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").

Section 7\. _Voting_. A stockholder may vote his, her or its shares in person
or by proxy. Any proxy shall be delivered to the secretary of the meeting or
to the inspectors of election appointed in accordance with Section 9, at or
prior to the time designated by the chairman of the meeting or in the order of
business for so delivering such proxies. No proxy shall be valid after 11
months from its date, unless otherwise provided in the proxy. Each holder of
record of capital stock of any class or series shall, as to all matters in
respect of which capital stock of such class or series has voting power,
be entitled to such vote as is provided in the Certificate of Incorporation
for each share of capital stock of such class or series standing in the
holders name on the books of the Corporation as of the voting record date for
the meeting of stockholders. Unless required by statute or determined by the
chairman of the meeting to be advisable, the vote on any question need not be
by ballot. On a vote by ballot, each ballot shall be signed by the stockholder
voting or by such stockholders proxy, if there be such proxy; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if authorized by the Board of Directors, any stockholder vote
to be taken by written ballot may be satisfied by a ballot submitted by
electronic transmission by the stockholder or the stockholders proxy,
_provided_ , _further_ that any such electronic transmission shall either set
forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that
the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder or the
stockholders proxy.

Except as otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation, these
By-Laws or by the rules of any stock exchange upon which shares of the
Corporations capital stock are listed, at each meeting of the stockholders,
all corporate actions to be taken by vote of the stockholders shall be
authorized by a majority of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to
vote thereon who are present in person or represented by proxy, and where a
separate vote by class or series is required, a majority of the votes cast by
the stockholders of such class or series who are present in person or
represented by proxy shall be the act of such class or series; _provided_ ,
that the election of directors shall be determined in accordance with Article
III, Section 4(b), and _provided_ _further_ that if a different or minimum
vote is required or provided for such matter by law, the Certificate of
Incorporation, these By-laws or by the rules of any stock exchange upon which
shares of the Corporations capital stock are listed, such different
or minimum vote shall be the required vote on such matter. For purposes of
this Section 7, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares
voted "for" a proposal must exceed the number of shares voted "against" that
proposal, with "abstentions" and "broker non-votes" not counted as a vote cast
with respect to that proposal.

Section 8.  _Proxies_. A stockholder or stockholders authorized officer or
agent may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the stockholder by
signing an appointment form or by an electronic transmission. An electronic 

 



4  transmission shall set forth or be submitted with information from which it
can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the
stockholder. For purposes of this Section 8 and the remainder of these By-
Laws, "electronic transmission" means any form of communication, not directly
involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may
be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be
directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated
process. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction
of the writing or transmission permitted by this Section 8 may be substituted
or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all
purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used,
_provided_ that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction
shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or
transmission.

Section 9\. _Inspectors_. At every meeting of the stockholders, one or more
inspectors shall receive and take in charge the proxies, receive and count all
votes, and decide questions concerning the qualifications of voters, the
validity of proxies and the acceptance or rejection of votes. The Corporation
or the chairman of the meeting shall appoint such inspectors. The inspectors
shall be sworn faithfully to perform their duties and shall in writing certify
to the returns. No candidate for election as director shall be appointed
or act as inspector.

the proxy statement as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected. The
stockholder shall (i) notify the Corporation of any inaccuracy or change
(within two business days of becoming aware of such inaccuracy or change) in
any information previously provided to the Corporation pursuant to this By-
Law and (ii) promptly update and supplement information previously provided to
the Corporation pursuant to this By-Law, if necessary, so that the information

voting record date for the meeting and (2) as of the date that is 10 days

update and supplement shall be delivered to the Secretary at the

such stockholders notice that has been timely received to the Board of
Directors or a committee designated by the Board of Directors for review. Any
person nominated for election as director by the Board of Directors or any
committee designated by the Board of Directors shall, upon the request of the
Board of Directors or such committee, furnish to the Secretary all such
information pertaining to such person that is required to be set forth in a
stockholders notice of nomination. Unless otherwise required by law, if the
stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear
at the meeting of stockholders to present such nomination, such nomination
shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that the Corporation may have received
proxies in respect of such vote.

 

Notwithstanding anything in these By-Laws to the contrary, except as otherwise
fixed by or pursuant to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation
or any Certificate of Designation relating to any class or series of
Preferred Stock, no persons may be nominated for election to the Board of
Directors except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section
4\. The chairman of the meeting of stockholders shall, if the facts warrant,
determine that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures
prescribed by this subsection (d). If the chairman should so determine, he or
she shall so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be
disregarded.

 



6 Section 5\. _Chairman; Vice Chairman_. The Board of Directors shall elect from
among its members (i) a director designated as the Chairman and (ii) a
director designated as the Vice Chairman. The Chairman shall serve as chairman
of the Board of Directors and preside at meetings of the stockholders and of
the Board of Directors. Each of the Chairman and the Vice Chairman shall have
such duties as may be assigned to him or her by the Board of Directors.

Section 6.  _Organization_. At all meetings of the Board of Directors, the
Chairman, or, in the absence of the chairman, the Vice Chairman, shall act as
chairman of the meeting. In the absence of the Chairman and the Vice Chairman,
a director chosen by a majority of the directors present shall act as
chairman of the meeting. The Secretary or, in the Secretarys absence, an
Assistant Secretary shall act as secretary of meetings of the Board of
Directors. In the absence of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary at such
meeting, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint any person to act as
secretary of the meeting.

Section 7\. _Place of Meeting and Action Without Meeting_. Meetings of the
Board of Directors, regular or special, may be held either within or without
the State of Delaware. The Board of Directors may meet in person or by
telephone, video conference or other communications equipment by means of
which all persons participating in such meeting can hear each other. Any
action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of
Directors or any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all of
the members of the Board of Directors or any such committee consent thereto in
writing, by electronic transmission or transmissions, or as otherwise
permitted by law and, if required by law, the writing or electronic
transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of the proceedings
of the Board of Directors or of such committee.

Section 8\. _Organizational Meeting_. The annual organizational meeting of
the Board of Directors shall be held immediately following the annual meeting
of stockholders and at the same place, without the requirement of any notice
other than this provision of the By-Laws, or at such other date, time and
place as the Board of Directors may determine.

Section 9\. _Regular Meetings: Notice_. Regular meetings of the Board of
Directors shall be held at such times and places as the Board of Directors or
the Chairman may from time to time determine. Notice of such meetings need not
be given if the time and place have been fixed previously.

 

Section 10\. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the Board of Directors
shall be held whenever called by (i) order of the Chief Executive Officer,
the Chairman or the majority of the directors then in office, or (ii) order of
the Vice Chairman or the chair of any committee with the support of at least
two other directors. Notice of each such meeting, which need not specify
the business to be transacted thereat, shall (i) be mailed to each director,
addressed to his or her residence or usual place of business, at least three
days before the day of the meeting, (ii) be delivered at least twenty-four
hours before the time of the meeting by a form of electronic transmission or

Section 11\. _Waiver of Notice_. Whenever any notice is required to be given
to a director of any meeting of the Board of Directors or any
committee thereof for any purpose under the provisions of law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, a waiver thereof in writing
signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, either before or
after the time stated therein, shall be equivalent to the giving of such
notice. A directors attendance at or participation in a meeting waives any
required notice to him or her of the meeting unless at the beginning of the
meeting or promptly upon the directors arrival, he or she objects to holding
the meeting or transacting business at the meeting and does not thereafter
vote for or assent to action taken at the meeting.

 

Section 12\. _Quorum and Manner of Acting_. Except where otherwise provided by
law, a majority of the number of directors fixed by resolution of the Board
of Directors at the time of any regular or special meeting shall constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business at such meeting, and the affirmative
vote of a majority of the directors present at any such meeting at which a
quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors. In the absence
of a quorum, a majority of those present may adjourn the meeting from time to
time until a quorum is present. Notice of any such adjourned meeting need not
be given.

 



7 Section 13\. _Order of Business_. At all meetings of the Board of Directors
business may be transacted in such order as from time to time the Board of
Directors may determine.

Section 14\. _Resignation of Director_. Any director may resign at any time
by giving notice in writing or by electronic transmission to the Board of
Directors, the Chairman or the Secretary. Unless the resignation is contingent
on acceptance by the Board of Directors, or as otherwise stated in the notice
of resignation, it shall take effect when delivered.

Section 15\. _Committees_. (a) In addition to the operations and strategy
committee authorized by Article IV of these By-Laws, other committees may be
designated by the Board of Directors by a resolution adopted by the number of
directors required to take action under Article III, Section 12 hereof. Any
such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of
Directors designating the committee, shall have and may exercise the powers
and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and
affairs of the Corporation, except as limited by law.

(b) The Board of Directors may appoint members to each committee meeting any
applicable qualifications set forth in that committees charter at the Board
of Directors annual organizational meeting or at such other time as the Board
of Directors may determine. The Board of Directors may designate one or more
directors as alternate members of any committee who may replace any absent or
disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or
disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members present and
not disqualified from voting, whether or not a quorum, may appoint another
member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in place of any such
absent or disqualified member. Unless the Board of Directors otherwise
prescribes by resolution, such committee member will serve until he or she
ceases to be a director, resigns or is removed. Any vacancy occurring on any
committee may be filled by the Board of Directors. Each committee may delegate
any of its responsibilities to the chair or another committee member, unless
prohibited by law, regulation or national securities exchange listing
standards (if any).

(c) A committee may meet in person or by telephone, video conference or other
communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in such
meeting can hear each other, and may act by unanimous written consent.

 

(d) Unless the Board of Directors otherwise prescribes by resolution, a
majority of a committees members constitutes a quorum for the transaction of
business at a committee meeting, and the affirmative vote of a majority of the
committee members present at a meeting at which there is a quorum present will
be the act of that committee. Each committee of the Board of Directors
may prescribe its own rules for calling and holding meetings and its method
of procedure, subject to any rules prescribed by the Board of Directors.

 

ARTICLE IV

Operations and Strategy Committee

Section 1\. _How Constituted and Powers_. The Board of Directors, by
resolution adopted pursuant to Article III, Section 15 hereof, may designate
three directors to constitute an operations and strategy committee, who shall

committee, to the extent provided in such resolution and permitted by law,
shall have and may exercise all of the authority of the Board of Directors.

Section 2\. _Meetings_. Meetings of the operations and strategy committee may
be called by the chairman of the committee or by any two members of the
committee. Notice of each such meeting, which need not specify the business to

days before the day of the meeting, (ii) be delivered at least twenty-four

underwriter(s) determine can be sold without delaying or otherwise adversely
affecting the success of the offering, the number of Shares proposed to be
included therein by any other Persons (including Shares to be sold for the
account of the Company) allocated among such other Persons in such manner
as the Company may determine. If more than one Investor is participating in
such Demand Registration, and the number of Shares which can be sold, as so
determined by the managing underwriters, is less than the number of Shares
proposed to be registered pursuant to clause (i) above by the Investor(s),
then the Registrable Shares that are included in such Demand Registration
shall be allocated pro rata among the participating Investors on the basis of
the number of Registrable Shares owned by each such Investor.

(d) _Restrictions on Demand Registrations_. Notwithstanding any contrary
provision of this Agreement, no Investor shall be entitled to request a
Demand Registration at any time when (i) a Redemption Offering has been
initiated (and not withdrawn) by Berkshire and such Redemption Offering has
not yet been consummated, or (ii) the Company is diligently pursuing a
primary or secondary underwritten offering pursuant to a Piggyback
Registration, unless, in the case of this clause (ii), the offering to be
effected pursuant to the requested Demand Registration can be effected
pursuant to an S-3 Shelf Registration and the Company, in accordance with
Section 4, effects or has effected an S-3 Shelf Registration pursuant to which
such offering can be effected.

 

(e) _Underwritten Offerings_. An Investor or group of Investors making a
Request shall only be entitled to request an underwritten offering pursuant
to a Demand Registration (subject to the same minimum proceeds test set forth
in subsection (a) above) if the request is not made within 120 days after such
Investor(s) (or the Investor from which Registrable Shares were acquired
directly or indirectly by any such Investor, or any Permitted Transferee who
acquired its Registrable Shares directly or indirectly from any such Investor)
have sold at least 90% of the Shares requested to be included in an
underwritten offering pursuant to a Demand Registration or an S-3 Shelf
Registration. The Investor(s) participating in such an underwritten Demand
Registration shall together (i) select the investment banking firm or firms to
act as the managing underwriter or underwriters in connection with such
offering, and (ii) otherwise mutually manage and direct all decisions required
for effecting such Demand Registration; _provided_ that (i) any investment
banking firm or firms selected pursuant to clause (i) above shall be selected
subject to the approval of the Company, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld and (ii) the Company shall select the investment banking
firm(s) if the Investors cannot agree on such selection.

(f) _Effective Period of Demand Registrations_. Upon the date of effectiveness
of any Demand Registration for an underwritten offering and if such offering
is priced promptly on or after such date, the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to keep such Demand Registration Statement effective for a period
equal to 120 days from such date or such shorter period which shall terminate
when all of the Registrable Shares covered by such Demand Registration have
been sold by the participating Investor(s).

 



8 (g) _Other Registration Rights_. Until the time when Berkshire and the
Berkshire Permitted Transferees no longer hold any shares of Preferred Stock
and the Investors collectively own 10% or less of the outstanding Shares, the
Company shall not grant to any Persons the right to request the Company to
register any equity securities of the Company, or any securities convertible
or exchangeable into or exercisable for such securities, without the prior
written consent of both 3G (as long as it and/or the 3G Permitted Transferees
hold Registrable Shares) and Berkshire (as long as it and/or the Berkshire
Permitted Transferees hold Registrable Shares or shares of Preferred Stock);
_provided_ that the Company may grant rights to employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries who are not Affiliates of the Investors, and not persons
eligible to acquire Shares from an Investor in a Permitted Transfer, to
participate in Piggyback Registrations so long as such rights are subordinate
to the rights of the Investors with respect to such Piggyback Registrations as
provided in Section 3 below.

Section 3\. _Piggyback Registrations_.

 

(a) Subject to Section 3(b), whenever prior to the Termination Date the
Company proposes to register any Shares under the Securities Act (other than
on a registration statement on Form S- 8, F-8, S-4 or F-4 or any successor
form thereto), whether for its own account or for the account of one or more
holders of Shares (other than the Investors), and the form of registration
statement to be used may be used for any registration of Registrable Shares
(a " _Piggyback Registration_ "), the Company shall give written notice to
each Investor of its intention to effect such a registration and, subject to
Sections 3(b) and 3(c), shall include in such registration statement and in
any offering of Shares to be made pursuant to that registration statement all
Registrable Shares with respect to which the Company has received a written
request for inclusion therein from an Investor within five (5) Business Days
after such Investors receipt of the Companys notice or, in the case of a
primary offering, such shorter time as is reasonably specified by the Company
in light of the circumstances ( _provided _ that only Registrable Shares of
the same class or classes as the Shares being registered may be included). The
provisions of this _Section 3(a)_ shall apply without regard to whether the
Company proposes to register such Shares at its own option or as set forth in
any other agreement by which the Company is bound. This Agreement alone shall
not be interpreted to impose on the Company any obligation to proceed with any
Piggyback Registration and the Company may abandon, terminate and/or withdraw
such registration for any reason at any time prior to the pricing thereof. If
the Company or any other Person other than an Investor proposes to sell Shares
in an underwritten offering pursuant to a registration statement on Form
S-3 under the Securities Act, such offering shall be treated as a primary or
secondary underwritten offering pursuant to a Piggyback Registration.

 

(b) _Priority on Primary Piggyback Registrations_. Except in the case of a
Redemption Offering, if a Piggyback Registration is initiated as a primary
underwritten offering on behalf of the Company and the managing underwriters
advise the Company that in their opinion the number of Shares proposed to be
included in such offering

 



9  exceeds the number of Shares (of any class) which can be sold in such
offering without delaying or otherwise adversely affecting the success of the
offering (including the price per share of the Shares proposed to be sold in
such offering), the Company shall include in such registration and offering
(i) first, the number of Shares that the Company proposes to sell, and (ii)
second, the number of Shares requested to be included therein by the
Investors, pro rata among such Investors on the basis of the number of
Registrable Shares owned by each such Investor up to such number, if any, that
the managing underwriters determine can be included in such offering
without delaying or otherwise adversely affecting the success of the
offering. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Piggyback Registration is a
Redemption Offering, the Investors shall only be permitted to include Shares
in such Piggyback Registration if and to the extent the managing underwriters
conclude that Shares can be sold in excess of the Shares proposed by Berkshire
to be sold in such Redemption Offering without delaying or otherwise adversely
affecting the success of the Redemption Offering (including the price per
share of the Shares proposed to be sold in such Redemption Offering). If the
managing underwriters so conclude that excess Shares can be sold by Investors
in a Redemption Offering without delaying or otherwise adversely affecting
the success of the Redemption Offering, the Company shall include in such
Redemption Offering (i) first, the number of Shares that Berkshire proposes to
include, and (ii) second, the number of Registrable Shares requested to
be included by any Investors, pro rata among such Investors on the basis of
the number of Registrable Shares owned by each such Investor up to such
number, if any, that the managing underwriters determine can be included in
such offering without delaying or otherwise adversely affecting the success
of the offering.

(c) _Priority on Secondary Piggyback Registrations_. If a Piggyback
Registration is not a Redemption Offering and is initiated as an underwritten
registration on behalf of a holder of Shares other than the Investors, and the
managing underwriters advise the Company that in their opinion the number
of Shares proposed to be included in such registration exceeds the number of
Shares (of any class) which can be sold in such offering without delaying or
otherwise adversely affecting the success of the offering (including the price
per share of the Shares to be sold in such offering), then the Company shall
include in such registration (i) first, the number of Shares requested to be
included therein by the holder(s) requesting such registration, (ii) second,
the number of Shares requested to be included therein by the Investors pro
rata among such Investors on the basis of the number of Registrable Shares
owned by each such Investor and (iii) third, the number of Shares proposed to
be included therein by any other Persons (including Shares to be sold for the
account of the Company) allocated among such other Persons in such manner as
the Company may determine.

 

(d) _Selection of Underwriters_. If any Piggyback Registration is a primary or
secondary underwritten offering, subject to Sections 5 and 6, the Company
shall have the right to select the managing underwriter or underwriters to
administer any such offering.

 

(e) _Basis of Participations_. No Investor may sell Registrable Shares in any
offering pursuant to its right to participate in a Piggyback Registration
unless it (a) agrees to sell such Shares on the same basis provided in the
underwriting or other distribution arrangements approved by the Company and
that apply to the Company or any other 

 



10  holders involved in such Piggyback Registration and (b) completes and
executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting
agreements, lockups and other documents required under the terms of such
arrangements.

Section 4\. _S-3 Shelf Registration_.

 

(a) _Right to Request Registration_. Subject to the provisions hereof and the
Companys eligibility to use Form S-3, as promptly as practicable after the
Company receives written notice of a request for an S-3 Shelf Registration
from either of 3G or Berkshire, the Company shall file with the SEC a
registration statement under the Securities Act for the S-3 Shelf Registration
(a " _S-3 Shelf Registration Statement_ "). A request for an S-3 Shelf
Registration Statement may not be made within 120 days after the requesting
Investor (or any Permitted Transferees who acquired their Registrable Shares
directly or indirectly from such original Investor) has sold at least 90% of
the Shares requested to be included in a Demand Registration or at any time
when an S-3 Shelf Registration covering Shares of the requesting Investor or
any of its direct or indirect Permitted Transferees is in effect or a
Redemption Offering has been initiated (and not withdrawn) by Berkshire and
not yet consummated. Once effective, the Company shall cause such S-3 Shelf
Registration Statement to remain continuously effective for such time period
as is specified in such request but for no time period longer than the period
ending on the earliest of (A) the date on which all Registrable Shares covered
by such S-3 Shelf Registration have been sold pursuant to the S-3 Shelf
Registration, (B) the date as of which there are no longer any Registrable
Shares covered by such S-3 Shelf Registration in existence and (C) the date on
which such S-3 Shelf Registration Statement expires, _provided_ that
the Company shall renew such S-3 Shelf Registration Statement upon such
expiration. If permitted under the Securities Act, such Registration Statement
shall be an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement. The right to request an
S-3 Shelf Registration hereunder is in addition to the rights of 3G and
Berkshire under Section 2 with respect to Demand Registrations. The right to
request an S-3 Shelf Registration hereunder may be exercised no more than once
by each of 3G and Berkshire;  _provided_ that if, 12 calendar months after
the first day of the month following the date hereof, the Company does not
meet the eligibility requirements of Form S-3 or loses its eligibility to use
Form S-3, then 3G and Berkshire shall (subject to satisfying the conditions
to a Demand Registration set forth in Section 2) each be entitled to request
up to three additional Demand Registrations in the aggregate per year, until
such time as the Company meets the eligibility requirements of Form S-3;
_provided_ , _further_ that if either 3G or Berkshire has used its right to a
S-3 Shelf Registration pursuant to this Section 4 and has (inclusive of its
direct and indirect Permitted Transferees who have become Investors under
Section 13 below) exercised fewer than three Demand Registrations, then either
3G or Berkshire, as applicable, may elect a second S-3 Shelf Registration and,
upon such election, the number of Demand Registrations available to it and
its direct and indirect Permitted Transferees who have become Investors under
Section 13 below shall be reduced by one.

(b) _Right to Effect Shelf Takedowns_. Subject to Section 7, each Investor
shall be entitled, at any time and from time to time when an S-3 Shelf
Registration Statement is effective and until the Termination Date, to sell
such Registrable Shares as are then

 



11  registered pursuant to such S-3 Shelf Registration Statement (each, a "
_Shelf Takedown_ "), but only upon not less than three Business Days prior
written notice to the Company (if such takedown is to be underwritten). Such
Investor or a group of Investors shall be entitled to request that a Shelf
Takedown be an underwritten offering; _provided_ , _however_ , that the number
of Registrable Shares included in each such underwritten Shelf Takedown (i)
would reasonably be expected to yield gross proceeds to such Investor(s) of at
least $100,000,000 (based on the then-current market prices), or (ii) consists
of all Registrable Shares then owned by 3G and all of the 3G Permitted
Transferees, or Berkshire and all of the Berkshire Permitted Transferees, as
applicable, and _provided_ , _further_ , that such Investor(s) shall not be
entitled to request any underwritten Shelf Takedown (x) within 120 days after
any such Investor (or the Investor from which Registrable Shares were acquired
directly or indirectly by such Investor, or any Permitted Transferee who
acquired its Registrable Shares directly or indirectly from such Investor)
have sold at least 90% of the Shares requested to be included in a Demand
Registration or S-3 Shelf Registration or (y) at any time when a Redemption
Offering has been initiated (and not withdrawn) by Berkshire and not
yet consummated. Such Investor(s) shall give the Company prompt written
notice of the consummation of each Shelf Takedown (whether or not
underwritten).

 

(c) _Priority on Underwritten Shelf Takedowns_. The Company may include Shares
other than Registrable Shares in an underwritten Shelf Takedown for any
accounts on the terms provided below, but only with the consent of the
managing underwriters of such offering, and whichever of the Investors has
requested such Shelf Takedown (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed). If the managing underwriters of the requested underwritten Shelf
Takedown advise the Company and the requesting Investors that in their opinion
the number of Shares proposed to be included in the underwritten Shelf
Takedown exceeds the number of Shares which can be sold in such offering
without delaying or otherwise adversely affecting the success of the offering
(including the price per share of the Shares proposed to be sold in such
offering), the Company shall include in such underwritten Shelf Takedown (i)
first, the number of Shares that the requesting Investor(s) proposes to sell,
and (ii) second, the number of Shares proposed to be included therein by any
other Persons (including Shares to be sold for the account of the Company)
allocated among such other Persons in such manner as the Company may
determine. If the number of Shares which can be sold without delaying or
otherwise adversely affecting the success of the offering is less than the
number of Registrable Shares proposed to be included in the underwritten
Shelf Takedown pursuant to clause (i) above, the amount of Shares to be so
sold shall be allocated to the Investors pro rata according to the number of
Registrable Shares owned by each such Investor. The provisions of this
paragraph (c) apply only to a Shelf Takedown that an Investor has requested be
an underwritten offering.

 

(d) _Selection of Underwriters_. If any of the Registrable Shares are to be
sold in an underwritten Shelf Takedown initiated by an Investor and the other
Investors are participating in such Shelf Takedown, the Investor requesting
the Shelf Takedown shall have the right to select the investment banking
firm(s) and manager(s) to administer the offering, subject to the
other Investors approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed); _provided_ that (i) any investment banking firm or

 



12  manager selected by the Investors shall be selected subject to the approval
of the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, and (ii)
the Company shall select the investment banker(s) and manager(s) if the
Investors cannot agree on such selection.

Section 5\. _Reserved._

 

Section 6\. _Redemption Offering_. In the event Berkshire elects to effectuate
a Redemption Offering in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of
Incorporation, Berkshire, on behalf of the Company, shall select the
investment banking firm or firms to act as the managing underwriter or
underwriters in connection with such offering and shall otherwise manage and
direct all decisions required for effecting one or more Redemption Offerings,
as required, and effecting a redemption of the Preferred Stock in accordance
with Article IV of the Certificate of Incorporation; _provided_ that any
investment banking firm or manager selected by Berkshire shall be selected
subject to the approval of the Company, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

 

Section 7\. _Holdback Agreements_. The restrictions in this Section 7 shall
apply for as long as any Investor is the beneficial owner of any Registrable
Shares. (1) In connection with a Redemption Offering, (2) if the Company sells
Shares or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for (or otherwise
representing a right to acquire) Shares in any other primary underwritten
offering pursuant to any registration statement under the Securities Act (but
only if the Investors are provided their piggyback rights, if any, in
accordance with Sections 3(a) and 3(b)), or (3) if any other Person
sells Shares in a secondary underwritten offering pursuant to a Piggyback
Registration in accordance with Sections 3(a) and 3(b), and if the managing
underwriters for such offering (under any of clauses (1), (2) or (3)) advise
the Company (in which case the Company promptly shall notify each Investor)
that a public sale or distribution of Shares outside such offering would
adversely affect such offering, then, if requested by the Company or, in the
case of a Redemption Offering, if requested by Berkshire, each Investor shall
agree, as contemplated in this Section 7, not to (and to cause its majority-
controlled Affiliates not to) sell, transfer, pledge, issue, grant or
otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly (including by means of any short
sale), or request the registration of, any Registrable Shares (or any
securities of any Person that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or
otherwise represent a right to acquire, any Registrable Shares) for a period
(each such period, a " _Holdback Period_ ") beginning on the 10th day before
the pricing date for the Redemption Offering or other applicable offering and
extending through the earlier of (i) the 120th day after such pricing date
(subject to customary automatic extension in the event of the release of
earnings results of or material news relating to the Company) and (ii) such
earlier day (if any) as may be designated for this purpose by the managing
underwriters for such offering (each such agreement of each Investor, a "
_Holdback Agreement_ "). Each Holdback Agreement shall be in writing in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the managing
underwriters and, in the case of a Redemption Offering, Berkshire.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, except for a Redemption Offering, no Investor
shall be obligated to make any Holdback Agreement unless the Company and each
selling shareholder in such offering also execute agreements substantially
similar to such Holdback Agreements. A Holdback

 



13  Agreement shall not apply to (i) the exercise of any warrants or options to
purchase shares of the Company ( _provided_ that such restrictions shall apply
with respect to the securities issuable upon such exercise) or (ii) any
Shares included in the underwritten offering giving rise to the application of
this Section 7\.

 

Section 8\. _Suspension Periods; Other_.

 

(a) The Company may delay or suspend the filing, effectiveness or use of a
Registration Statement (including by withdrawing or declining to amend any
Registration Statement that has been filed or by declining to take other
actions otherwise required hereunder with regard to any Registration
Statement; _provided,_ that, if a registration is withdrawn, such registration
shall not count against the limitation on the number of such registrations
set forth in Section 2 or Section 4), but only if the Company determines in
its sole discretion (x) that proceeding with the use or effectiveness of such
Registration Statement would require the Company to disclose material
information that would not otherwise be required to be disclosed at that time
and that the disclosure of such information at that time would not be in the
Companys best interests, or (y) that the registration or offering to be
delayed or suspended would, if not delayed or suspended, materially adversely
affect the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or delay or otherwise
materially adversely affect the success of, any pending or proposed material
transaction, including any debt or equity financing, any acquisition or
disposition, any recapitalization or reorganization or any other material
transaction, whether due to commercial reasons, a desire to avoid premature
disclosure of information or any other reason. Any period during which the
Company has delayed or suspended a filing, an effective date or an offering or
otherwise delayed or suspended use of a Registration Statement pursuant to
this Section 8 is herein called a "Suspension Period". If pursuant to this
Section 8 the Company delays or withdraws a Demand Registration or S-3 Shelf
Registration requested by an Investor, such Investor shall be entitled to
withdraw such request and, if it does so, such request shall not count
against the limitation on the number of such registrations set forth in
Section 2 or Section 4\. The Company shall provide prompt written notice to
any effected Investor of the commencement and termination of any Suspension
Period (and any withdrawal of a registration statement pursuant to this
Section 8), but shall not be obligated under this Agreement to disclose the
reasons therefor. Each Investor who becomes aware of a Suspension Period
shall keep the existence of each Suspension Period confidential and refrain
from making offers and sales of Registrable Shares (and direct any other
Persons making such offers and sales to refrain from doing so) during
each Suspension Period. In no event (i) may the Company deliver notice of a
Suspension Period to an Investor more than twice in any calendar year and (ii)
shall a Suspension Period or Suspension Periods be in effect for an aggregate
of 120 days or more in any calendar year.

(b) _Other Lockups_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
the Company shall not be obligated to take any action hereunder that would
violate any lockup or similar restriction binding on the Company and that was
approved in advance by 3G and Berkshire, or in the case of a Redemption
Offering, that was approved in advance by Berkshire, in connection with a
prior or pending registration or underwritten offering.

(c) _Certificate of Incorporation_. In the event of any conflict between the
terms of this Agreement and the Certificate of Incorporation, the Certificate
of Incorporation shall prevail.

 



14 Section 9\. _Registration Procedures_.

 

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth herein, whenever an Investor requests
that any Registrable Shares be registered pursuant to this Agreement, the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to effect, as soon as practical as
provided herein, the registration and the sale of such Registrable Shares in
accordance with the intended methods of disposition thereof, and,
pursuant thereto, the Company shall, as soon as practical as provided herein:

(i) subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, use reasonable best
efforts to prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement with respect
to such Registrable Shares and cause such Registration Statement to become
effective (unless it is automatically effective upon filing); 

(ii) use reasonable best efforts to prepare and file with the SEC such
amendments and supplements to such Registration Statement and the Prospectus
used in connection therewith as may be necessary to comply with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and to keep such Registration Statement
effective for the relevant period required hereunder, but no longer than is
necessary to complete the distribution of the Shares covered by such
Registration Statement, and to comply with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all the Shares covered by
such Registration Statement during such period in accordance with the
intended methods of disposition set forth in such Registration Statement;

 

(iii) use reasonable best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any order
suspending the effectiveness of any Registration Statement, or the lifting of
any suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any
Registrable Shares for sale in any jurisdiction in the United States;

 

(iv) deliver, without charge, such number of copies of the preliminary and
final Prospectus and any supplement thereto as each participating Investor
may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the
Registrable Shares of such Investor covered by such Registration Statement in
conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act;

 

(v) use reasonable best efforts to register or qualify such Registrable Shares
under such other securities or blue sky laws of such U.S. jurisdictions as
any participating Investor reasonably requests and continue such registration
or qualification in effect in such jurisdictions for as long as the applicable
Registration Statement may be required to be kept effective under this
Agreement ( _provided_ that the Company will not be required to (I) qualify
generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be
required to qualify but for this subparagraph (v), (II) subject itself to
taxation in any such jurisdiction or (III) consent to general service of
process in any such jurisdiction);

 



15 (vi) notify each participating Investor and each distributor of such
Registrable Shares identified by such Investor, at any time when a Prospectus
relating thereto would be required under the Securities Act to be delivered by
such distributor, of the occurrence of any event as a result of which the
Prospectus included in such Registration Statement contains an untrue
statement of a material fact or omits a material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, and, at the request of such Investor, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to prepare, as soon as practical, a supplement or
amendment to such Prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to any
prospective purchasers of such Registrable Shares, such Prospectus shall not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading;

 

(vii) in the case of an underwritten offering in which an Investor
participates pursuant to a Demand Registration, a Piggyback Registration or
an S-3 Shelf Registration, enter into a customary underwriting agreement for
offerings of that kind, containing such provisions (including provisions for
indemnification, lockups, opinions of counsel and comfort letters), and
take all such other customary and reasonable actions as the managing
underwriters of such offering may request in order to facilitate the
disposition of such Registrable Shares (including, making members of senior
management of the Company available at reasonable times and places to
participate in "road-shows" that the managing underwriter determines are
necessary to effect the offering);

 

(viii) in the case of an underwritten offering in which an Investor
participates pursuant to a Demand Registration, a Piggyback Registration or
an S-3 Shelf Registration, and to the extent not prohibited by applicable law,
(A) make reasonably available, for inspection by the managing underwriters of
such offering and one law firm and accounting firm acting for such managing
underwriters, pertinent corporate documents and financial and other records of
the Company and its subsidiaries and controlled Affiliates, (B) cause the
Companys officers and employees to supply information reasonably
requested by such managing underwriters or law firm in connection with such
offering, (C) make the Companys independent accountants available for any
such managing underwriters due diligence and have them provide customary
comfort letters to such underwriters in connection therewith, and (D) cause
the Companys counsel to furnish customary legal opinions to such underwriters
in connection therewith; _provided_ , _however_ , that such records and other
information shall be subject to such confidential treatment as is customary
for underwriters due diligence reviews;

 



16 (ix) use reasonable best efforts to cause all such Registrable Shares to
be listed on each primary securities exchange (if any) on which securities of
the same class issued by the Company are then listed;

 

(x) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all such Registrable Shares not
later than the effective date of such Registration Statement and, a
reasonable time before any proposed sale of Registrable Shares pursuant to a
Registration Statement, provide the transfer agent with printed certificates
for the Registrable Shares to be sold, subject to the provisions of _Section
13_;

(xi) make generally available to its shareholders a consolidated earnings
statement (which need not be audited) for a period of 12 months beginning
after the effective date of the Registration Statement as soon as reasonably
practicable after the end of such period, which earnings statement shall
satisfy the requirements of an earning statement under Section 11(a) of the
Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder; and

(xii) promptly notify each participating Investor, as applicable, and the
managing underwriters of any underwritten offering:

(1) when the Registration Statement, any pre-effective amendment, the
Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or any post-effective amendment to the
Registration Statement has been filed and, with respect to the Registration
Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become
effective;

(2) of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to
the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or for any additional
information regarding such Investor;

(3) of the notification to the Company by the SEC of its initiation of any
proceeding with respect to the issuance by the SEC of any stop order
suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement; and

 

(4) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the
suspension of the qualification of any Registrable Shares for sale under the
applicable securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction.

For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of clauses (vii), (viii), (xi) and
(xii) of this Section 9(a) shall apply only in respect of an underwritten
offering and only if the number of Registrable Shares to be sold in the
offering would reasonably be expected to yield gross proceeds to the
participating Investor(s) of at least $200,000,000 (based on the then-current
market prices) in a Demand Registration pursuant to Section 2 or $100,000,000
(based on the then-current market prices) in an S-3 Shelf Takedown pursuant
to Section 4\.

(b) No Registration Statement (including any amendments thereto) shall contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to

 



17  be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, and no Prospectus (including any supplements thereto) shall
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, in each case, except for any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission
or alleged omission of a material fact made in reliance on and in conformity
with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of an
Investor or any underwriter or other distributor specifically for use therein.

 

(c) Each Investor shall furnish to the Company in writing such information
regarding itself and the distribution proposed by it as the Company may
reasonably request for use in connection with any such Registration Statement
or Prospectus, including, without limitation, providing the Company with
questionnaires as are customary for similar transactions, and which the
Company may reasonably request or as may be required by applicable securities
laws and regulations, and as shall be required in connection with any
registration, qualification or compliance referred to in this Agreement. Each
Investor agrees to notify the Company as promptly as practicable of any
inaccuracy or change in information previously furnished to the Company or of
the happening of any event, in either case as a result of which any Prospectus
contains an untrue statement of a material fact regarding the Investor or the
distribution of such Registrable Securities or omits to state any material
fact regarding the Investor or the distribution of such Registrable Securities
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
and to furnish to the Company promptly any additional information required to
correct and update any previously furnished information or required such that
such Prospectus shall not contain, with respect to the Investor or the
distribution of such Registrable Securities, an untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.

(d) At all times after the Company has filed a registration statement with
the SEC pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act and until the
Termination Date, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
continuously maintain in effect the registration statement of Common Stock
under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and to use reasonable best efforts to
file all reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder, all
to the extent required to enable each applicable Investor to be eligible to
sell Registrable Shares (if any) pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities
Act.

 

(e) The Company may require each applicable Investor and each distributor of
Registrable Shares as to which any registration is being effected to furnish
to the Company information regarding such Person and the distribution of such
securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request in
connection with such registration.

 

(f) Each Investor agrees by having its Common Stock treated as Registrable
Shares hereunder that, upon being advised in writing by the Company of the
occurrence of an event pursuant to Section 9(a)(vi), such Investor will
immediately discontinue (and

 



18  direct any other Persons making offers and sales of Registrable Shares to
immediately discontinue) offers and sales of Registrable Shares pursuant to
any Registration Statement (other than those pursuant to a plan that is in
effect prior to such time and that complies with Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange
Act) until it is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the
Prospectus may be resumed and is furnished with a supplemented or amended
Prospectus as contemplated by Section 9(a)(vi), and, if so directed by the
Company, each Investor will deliver to the Company all copies, other than
permanent file copies then in such Investors possession, of the
Prospectus covering such Registrable Shares current at the time of receipt of
such notice.

(g) The Company may prepare and deliver an issuer free-writing prospectus (as
such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) in lieu of any
supplement to a prospectus, and references herein to any "supplement" to a
Prospectus shall include any such issuer free-writing prospectus. No Investor
nor any other seller of Registrable Shares may use a free-writing prospectus
to offer or sell any such shares unless it has been provided by the Company or
unless the Investor has received the Companys prior written consent.

(h) It is understood and agreed that any failure of the Company to file a
registration statement or any amendment or supplement thereto or to cause any
such document to become or remain effective or usable within or for any
particular period of time as provided in Sections 2, 4 or 9 or otherwise in
this Agreement, due to reasons that are not reasonably within its control,
or due to any refusal of the SEC to permit a registration statement or
prospectus to become or remain effective or to be used because of unresolved
SEC comments thereon (or on any documents incorporated therein by reference)
despite the Companys good faith and reasonable best efforts to resolve those
comments, shall not be a breach of this Agreement.

(i) It is further understood and agreed that the Company shall not have any
obligations under this Section 9 at any time on or after the Termination Date,
unless an underwritten offering initiated pursuant to this Agreement has been
priced but not completed prior to the Termination Date, in which event the
Companys obligations under this Section 9 shall continue with respect to such
offering until it is so completed (but not more than 120 days after the
commencement of the offering).

 

Section 10\. _Registration Expenses_.

 

(a) All expenses incident to the Companys performance of or compliance with
this Agreement, including all registration and filing fees, fees and expenses
of compliance with securities or blue sky laws, FINRA fees, listing
application fees, printing expenses, transfer agents and registrars fees,
cost of distributing Prospectuses in preliminary and final form as well
as any supplements thereto, and fees and disbursements of counsel for the
Company and one counsel for each of the participating Investors and all
independent certified public accountants and other Persons retained by the
Company (all such expenses being herein called " _Registration Expenses_ ")
(but not including any underwriting discounts or commissions attributable to
the sale of Registrable Shares or fees and expenses of counsel and any other
advisor representing 

 



19  any underwriters or other distributors), shall be borne by the Company. Each
Investor shall bear the cost of all underwriting discounts and commissions
associated with any sale of its Registrable Shares, pro rata based on the
number of Registrable Shares being sold by that Investor, and shall pay all of
its own costs and expenses.

 

(b) The obligation of the Company to bear the expenses described in Section
10(a) shall apply irrespective of whether a registration, once properly
demanded or requested becomes effective or is withdrawn or suspended,
_provided_ that the Registration Expenses for any Registration Statement
withdrawn solely at the request of one or more Investors (unless withdrawn
following commencement of a Suspension Period) shall be borne by such
Investor(s).

Section 11\. _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Each Investor will, and will cause its officers, directors, employees,
legal counsel, accountants, financial advisors and other agents
and representatives to, hold in confidence any material nonpublic information
received by them pursuant to this Agreement, including without limitation any
Request made pursuant to Section 2(a), any written notice of the Companys
intention to effect a registration provided pursuant to Section 3(a), and any
material nonpublic information included in any Registration Statement or
Prospectus proposed to be filed with the SEC (until such Registration
Statement or Prospectus has been filed) or provided pursuant to Section
9(a)(viii). This Section 11(a) shall not apply to any information which (a) is
or becomes generally available to the public, (b) was already in the
Investors possession from a non-confidential source prior to its disclosure
by the Company, (c) is or becomes available to the Investor on a non-
confidential basis from a source other than the Company, provided that such
source is not known by the Investor to be bound by confidentiality
obligations or (d) is required to be disclosed by law.

Section 12\. _Indemnification_.

 

(a) The Company shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each
Investor and each Person who controls such Investor (within the meaning of
the Securities Act) against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
judgments, costs (including reasonable costs of investigation) and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of or based upon any untrue
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration
Statement or Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or
arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission of a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, except insofar as the same are made in reliance and in
conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on
behalf of such Investor expressly for use therein. In connection with an
underwritten offering in which an Investor participates conducted pursuant to
a registration effected hereunder, the Company shall indemnify each
participating underwriter and each Person who controls such
underwriter (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as
provided above with respect to the indemnification of such Investor.

 



20 (b) In connection with any Registration Statement in which an Investor is
offering Shares, such Investor shall furnish to the Company in writing such
information as the Company reasonably requests pursuant to Section 9(a), or
amendment or supplement thereto, and shall indemnify, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, the Company, its officers and directors and each Person who
controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, costs (including reasonable
costs of investigation) and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees)
arising out of or based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of
material fact contained in the Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, or arising out of or based upon any omission
or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only to the
extent that the same are made in reliance and in conformity with information
furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such Investor
expressly for use therein.

(c) Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall (i) give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying Person of any claim with respect to which
it seeks indemnification and (ii) permit such indemnifying Person to assume
the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnified Person. Failure so to notify the indemnifying Person shall not
relieve it from any liability that it may have to an indemnified Person except
to the extent that the indemnifying Person is materially and adversely
prejudiced thereby. The indemnifying Person shall not be subject to any
liability for any settlement made by the indemnified Person without its
consent (but such consent will not be unreasonably withheld). An indemnifying
Person who is entitled to, and elects to, assume the defense of a claim shall
not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in
addition to one local counsel) for all Persons indemnified (hereunder or
otherwise) by such indemnifying Person with respect to such claim (and all
other claims arising out of the same circumstances), unless in the reasonable
judgment of any indemnified Person there may be one or more legal or equitable
defenses available to such indemnified Person which are in addition to or
may conflict with those available to another indemnified Person with respect
to such claim, in which case such maximum number of counsel for all
indemnified Persons shall be two rather than one). If an indemnifying Person
is entitled to, and elects to, assume the defense of a claim, the indemnified
Person shall continue to be entitled to participate in the defense thereof,
with counsel of its own choice, but, except as set forth above, the
indemnifying Person shall not be obligated to reimburse the indemnified
Person for the costs thereof. The indemnifying Person shall not consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into or agree to any settlement relating to a
claim or action for which any indemnified Person would be entitled
to indemnification by any indemnified Person hereunder unless such judgment
or settlement imposes no ongoing obligations on any such indemnified Person
and includes as an unconditional term the giving, by all relevant claimants
and plaintiffs to such indemnified Person, a release, reasonably satisfactory
in form and substance to such indemnified Person, from all liabilities in
respect of such claim or action for which such indemnified Person would be
entitled to such indemnification. The indemnifying Person shall not be liable
hereunder for any amount paid or payable or incurred pursuant to or in
connection with any judgment entered or settlement effected with the consent
of an indemnified Person unless the indemnifying Person has also consented to
such judgment or settlement.

 



21 (d) The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the
indemnified Person or any officer, director or controlling Person of such
indemnified Person and shall survive the transfer of securities and the
Termination Date but only with respect to offers and sales of Registrable
Shares made before the Termination Date or during the period following the
Termination Date referred to in Section 8(h).

 

(e) If the indemnification provided for in or pursuant to this Section 11 is
due in accordance with the terms hereof, but is held by a court to be
unavailable or unenforceable in respect of any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or expenses referred to herein, then each applicable indemnifying
Person, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified Person, shall contribute to
the amount paid or payable by such indemnified Person as a result of such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying Person on the
one hand and of the indemnified Person on the other in connection with the
statements or omissions which result in such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or expenses as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying Person on the one hand
and of the indemnified Person on the other shall be determined by reference
to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact
relates to information supplied by the indemnifying Person or by the
indemnified Person, and by such Persons relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
In no event shall the liability of the indemnifying Person be greater in
amount than the amount for which such indemnifying Person would have been
obligated to pay by way of indemnification if the indemnification provided for
under Section 11(a) or 11(b) hereof had been available under the
circumstances. No indemnified Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled
to contribution from any indemnifying party who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation.

Section 13\. _Securities Act Restrictions_. The Registrable Shares are
restricted securities under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold
except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an available
exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Accordingly, no Investor
shall, directly or through others, offer or sell any Registrable Shares
except pursuant to a Registration Statement as contemplated herein or pursuant
to Rule 144 or another exemption from registration under the Securities Act,
if available. Prior to any transfer of Registrable Shares other than pursuant
to an effective registration statement, the Investor desiring to transfer such
Registrable Shares shall notify the Company of such transfer and the Company
may require such Investor to provide, prior to such transfer, such
evidence that the transfer will comply with the Securities Act (including
written representations or an opinion of counsel) as the Company may
reasonably request. The Company may impose stop-transfer instructions with
respect to any Registrable Shares that are to be transferred in contravention
of this Agreement. Any certificates representing the Registrable Shares may
bear a legend (and

 



22  the Companys share registry may bear a notation) referencing the
restrictions on transfer contained in this Agreement, until such time as such
securities have ceased to be (or are to be transferred in a manner that
results in their ceasing to be) Registrable Shares. Subject to the provisions
of this Section 12, the Company will replace any such legended certificates
with unlegended certificates promptly upon surrender of the legended
certificates to the Company or its designee and cause shares that cease to be
Registrable Shares to bear a general unrestricted CUSIP number, in order to
facilitate a lawful transfer or at any time after such shares cease to be
Registrable Shares.

Section 14\. _Transfers of Rights_. If 3G or Berkshire (or any Permitted
Transferee thereof) transfers any rights to a Permitted Transferee, such
Permitted Transferee shall, together with 3G, Berkshire and all other such
Permitted Transferees, also have the rights of an Investor under this
Agreement, but only if the Permitted Transferee signs and delivers to
the Company a written acknowledgment (in form and substance satisfactory to
the Company, 3G and Berkshire) that it has joined as a party to this Agreement
and has assumed the rights and obligations of an Investor hereunder with
respect to the rights transferred to it by 3G or Berkshire, as applicable.
Each such transfer shall be effective when (but only when) the Permitted
Transferee has signed and delivered the written acknowledgment to the Company.
Upon any such effective transfer, the Permitted Transferee shall
automatically have the rights so transferred, and the obligations of an
Investor under this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no Person who acquires securities transferred in violation of this
Agreement, or who acquires securities that are not or upon acquisition cease
to be Registrable Shares, shall have any rights under this Agreement with
respect to such securities as an Investor or otherwise, and such securities
shall not have the benefits afforded hereunder to Registrable Shares.

Section 15\. _Miscellaneous_.

 

(a) _Notices_. To be effective under this Agreement, all notices, requests,
claims, demands and other communications under this Agreement shall be

(b) _No Waivers_. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right,

single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and
remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights
or remedies provided by law.

(c) _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any right, remedy, obligation
nor liability arising hereunder or by reason hereof shall be assignable by any
party hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any
attempt to assign any right, remedy, obligation or liability
hereunder without such consent shall be void, except (i) an assignment, in
the case of a merger or consolidation where such party is not the surviving
entity, or a sale of substantially all of its assets, to the entity which is
the survivor of such merger or consolidation or the purchaser in such sale or
(ii) an assignment by an Investor to a Permitted Transferee in accordance with
Section 12\. In the event of any merger or consolidation by the Company, where
the Company is not the surviving entity, or a sale of substantially all of
the assets of the Company to an entity which is the survivor of such merger or
consolidation or the purchaser in such sale, the Company shall cause the
surviving entity in such merger, consolidation or purchase to assume this
Agreement and all rights, remedies, obligations and liabilities of the Company
hereunder.

(d)  _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing contained in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any person or entity other
than the Company and the Investors any benefits, rights, or remedies (except
as specified in Section 11 hereof).

(e) _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial, Etc_.
The corporate law of the State of Delaware shall govern all issues and
questions concerning the relative rights of the Company and its stockholders.
All other issues and questions concerning the construction, validity,
interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement and the exhibits and
schedules hereto shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware,

 



25  without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules or
provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that
would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the
State of Delaware. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the
State of Delaware, or, if both the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
and the federal courts within the State of Delaware decline to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any other state court within
the State of Delaware, and, in each case, any appellate court therefrom
(together, the " _Chosen Courts_ "), for the purposes of any suit, action or
other proceeding arising out of this Agreement (and agrees that no such
action, suit or proceeding relating to this Agreement shall be brought by it
except in such courts). Each of the parties further agrees that, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, service of any process, summons,
notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such persons respective address
set forth in _Section 13(a)_ shall be effective service of process for any
action, suit or proceeding in the State of Delaware with respect to any
matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above in the
immediately preceding sentence. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and
unconditionally waives (and agrees not to plead or claim) any objection to
the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this
Agreement in the Chosen Courts, or that any such action, suit or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. To the
extent permitted by applicable law, each of the parties hereto hereby
unconditionally waives trial by jury in any legal action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(f) _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts (including by e-mail or facsimile) and by different
parties hereto in separate counterparts, with the same effect as if all
parties had signed the same document. Each such counterparts shall be deemed
an original, shall be construed together with the other such originals and
shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement shall become
effective when each party hereto shall have received counterparts hereof
signed by all of the other parties hereto.

 

(g) _Amendment and Restatement_. The parties hereto agree that the Original
Agreement shall be amended and restated in the form of this Agreement as of
the date hereof.

(h) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement contains the entire agreement among the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and
replaces all other prior agreements, written or oral, among the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 

(i) _Captions_. The headings and other captions in this Agreement are for
convenience and reference only and shall not be used in interpreting,
construing or enforcing any provision of this Agreement.

 



26 (j) _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to
be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as
the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a
determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible. 

(k) _Amendments_. The provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions
of this sentence, may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers
or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given without
the prior written consent of the Company and of 3G (as long as it and/or the
3G Permitted Transferees hold Registrable Shares) and Berkshire (as long as
it and/or the Berkshire Permitted Transferees hold Registrable Shares).

_Agreement and Plan of Merger_

 

 _Among Heinz, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II and Kraft_

 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as counsel for H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("Heinz"), in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 24, 2015 (the "Merger
Agreement"), among Heinz, Kraft Foods Group, Inc., a Virginia corporation
("Kraft"), Kite Merger Sub Corp., a Virginia corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Heinz ("Merger Sub I"), and Kite Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Heinz ("Merger Sub
II") in which Merger Sub I will merge with and into Kraft with Kraft surviving
as the Initial Surviving Company as a wholly owned subsidiary of Heinz.
Immediately following, the Initial Surviving Company will merge with and into
Merger Sub II, with Merger Sub II surviving as a limited liability company and
wholly owned subsidiary of Heinz. Capitalized terms used but not defined
herein have the meanings given to them in the Merger Agreement.

Pursuant to Sections 6.09(b) and 7.02(c) of the Merger Agreement, you have
requested that we render the opinion set forth below. In rendering our
opinion, we have examined (i) the Merger Agreement, (ii) the Equity Investment
Letters, (iii) the registration statement on Form S-4, which includes the
Proxy Statement, and any amendments thereto (the "Registration Statement"),
(iv) the representations made by Heinz, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II and Kraft
in their respective letters, dated the date hereof, delivered to us for
purposes of this opinion (the "Representation Letters"), and (v) such other
documents and corporate records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for
purposes of our opinion. In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness
of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of
all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original
documents of all documents submitted to us as duplicate or certified or
conformed copies and the authenticity of the originals of such
latter documents. We have not, however, undertaken any independent
investigation of any factual matter set forth in any of the foregoing.

In rendering this opinion, we have assumed, with your consent, that (i) the
Merger and the Subsequent Merger will be consummated in accordance with the
provisions of the Merger Agreement (without waiver or modification of any
provisions thereof), (ii) the statements concerning the Merger and the
Subsequent Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement and the Registration
Statement are, and will remain, true, complete and correct at all times up to
and including the Effective Time, (iii) the representations made by Heinz,
Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II and Kraft in the  Representation Letters are, and will remain, true, complete and correct at
all times up to and including the Effective Time and (iv) any representations
made in the Representation Letters or the Merger Agreement qualified by
belief, knowledge, materiality or any similar qualification are true, correct
and complete without such qualification. We have also assumed that the parties
have complied with and, if applicable, will continue to comply with, the
covenants contained in the Merger Agreement and the Equity Investment Letters.
If any of these assumptions are untrue for any reason, our opinion as
expressed below may be adversely affected and may not be relied upon.

 

Our opinion is based on current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"), Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder,
published pronouncements of the Internal Revenue Service and case law, any of
which may be changed at any time with retroactive effect. Any change in
applicable laws or the facts and circumstances surrounding the Merger or the
Subsequent Merger, or any inaccuracy in the statements, facts, assumptions or
representations upon which we have relied, may affect the continuing validity
of our opinion as set forth herein. We assume no responsibility to inform you
of any such change or inaccuracy that may occur or come to our attention.
Finally, our opinion is limited to the tax matters specifically covered
hereby. No opinion should be inferred as to (i) any other tax consequences of
the Merger and the Subsequent Merger or (ii) the tax consequences of the
Merger and the Subsequent Merger under any state, local or foreign law, or
with respect to other areas of U.S. Federal taxation. We are members of the
Bar of the State of New York, and we do not express any opinion herein
concerning any law other than the Federal law of the United States.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, for U.S. Federal income tax
purposes, we are of opinion that (i) the Merger and the Subsequent Merger will
be treated as a single integrated transaction that will qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii)
Heinz and Kraft each will be a party to the reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(b) of the Code.

 

Very truly yours,

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 

The undersigned, an officer of H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation, a Delaware

Heinz and Kite Merger Sub Corp., a Virginia corporation and wholly-owned
subsidiary of Heinz ("Merger Sub I") and Kite Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware

6.09(b), 7.02(c) and 7.03(c) of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger
Agreement") dated as of March 24, 2015 among Kraft Foods Group, Inc., a
Virginia corporation ("Kraft"), Heinz and Merger Sub. Pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, Merger Sub I will merge with and into Kraft with Kraft surviving as
the Initial Surviving Company as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Heinz
(the "Merger"). Immediately following the Merger, the Initial Surviving
Company will merge with and into Merger Sub II, with Merger Sub II surviving
as a limited liability company and wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Heinz
(the "Subsequent Merger"). Each capitalized term used and not otherwise
defined herein has the meaning ascribed to it in the Merger Agreement.
References to Merger Sub II herein shall also include references to the
Surviving Company after the Merger.

The undersigned, after due inquiry and investigation, hereby certifies and
represents on behalf of Heinz, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II that:

1\. The facts relating to the Transactions as described in the Form S-4, the
Proxy Statement, the Equity Investment Letters and the other documents
described therein are, insofar as those facts pertain to Heinz, true, correct
and complete in all material respects. The Transactions will be consummated in
accordance with the Merger Agreement (without waiver or modification of any
provision thereof) and the descriptions contained in the Form S-4, the Proxy
Statement, the Equity Investment Letters and the other documents described
therein. There are no other agreements, arrangements or   understandings, either written or oral, between or among any of Heinz, its
affiliates or its stockholders, on the one hand, and any of Kraft, its
affiliates or its stockholders, on the other hand, concerning the Merger,
Subsequent Merger or any transaction that is part of the same plan as the
Merger.

2\. In connection with the Merger and the Subsequent Merger, no holder of
Kraft Common Stock will receive, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or in
respect of such stock any consideration other than Heinz Common Stock and the
Special Dividend (together, the "Transaction Consideration"). The Transaction
Consideration to be received by holders of Kraft Common Stock was determined
by arms length negotiations between Heinz and Kraft. The fair market value of
the Transaction Consideration received by each holder of Kraft Common Stock
will be approximately equal to the fair market value of Kraft Common Stock
surrendered in exchange therefor (in each case, based on the respective fair
market value of Kraft Common Stock and Heinz Common Stock on the business day
before the Merger Agreement was executed).

3\. To the knowledge of Heinz, Kraft will declare the Special Dividend with a
record date as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and payment of the
Special Dividend will be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and
the Subsequent Merger. The Special Dividend will be funded with a portion
of the proceeds from the Equity Investment.

4\. At least forty percent (40%) of the value of the aggregate Transaction
Consideration received by holders of Kraft Common Stock will be comprised of
Heinz Common Stock (based on the fair market value of Heinz Common Stock on
the business day before the Merger Agreement was executed).

 

5\. (a) Neither Heinz nor any person related to Heinz (within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(e)(4)) has any plan or intention to
reacquire or redeem any Heinz Common Stock issued in the Merger, either
directly or indirectly (including through derivative transactions, such as
equity swaps, that would have the economic effect of an acquisition), except
for Share Repurchases as defined in this representation.

(b) Heinz (or a related person) may, after the Subsequent Merger, repurchase
Heinz Common Stock (i) on the open market through a broker at the prevailing
market price, (ii) through block trades with holders of a significant number
of shares of Heinz Common Stock at a price that is determined by reference to
the prevailing market price or (iii) pursuant to an accelerated share
repurchase whereby a securities brokerage or investment bank that is not
related to Heinz borrows a specified number of shares of Heinz Common Stock
from stock lenders in the market and sells that Heinz Common Stock to Heinz
at an agreed price, and then the broker/bank subsequently purchases an equal
number of shares of Heinz Common Stock in the open market at the prevailing
market price, and returns those shares to the stock lenders (any such
purchases described in (i), (ii) and (iii), "Share Repurchases"). (c) Heinz has not determined the number or value of shares, if any, to be
acquired in any Share Repurchases nor the timing of any such acquisitions.
Heinz will make those determinations in the future, based on the facts and
circumstances that arise in the future. Based on the current facts and
circumstances, Heinz has no plan or intention to repurchase in the two years
after the Subsequent Merger an amount of Heinz Common Stock for an amount of
cash such that the sum of (A) the amount of cash paid in those Share
Repurchases and (B) the amount of the Special Dividend (together, the
"Aggregate Cash") would exceed sixty percent (60%) of the sum of (x) the
Aggregate Cash and (y) the value of all shares of Heinz Common Stock issued to
holders of Kraft Common Stock other than those shares acquired in the Share
Repurchases (based on the fair market value of Heinz Common Stock as of the
Closing Date).

(d) Heinz is not obligated to undertake any Share Repurchases and there was
no understanding, arrangement or negotiations between Heinz and Kraft or the
holders of Kraft Common Stock as to whether Heinz would undertake any Share
Repurchases.

 

6\. To the knowledge of Heinz, there is no plan or intention by any holders of
Heinz Common Stock to purchase or otherwise acquire Heinz Common Stock issued
to holders of Kraft Common Stock in the transaction, either directly or
indirectly (including through derivative transactions, such as equity swaps,
that would have the economic effect of transfer). For purposes of this
representation, a person is considered to own or acquire stock owned or
acquired (as the case may be) by a partnership in which such person is a
partner in proportion such persons interest in the partnership.

 

7\. To the knowledge of Heinz, the liabilities of Kraft assumed by Merger Sub
II and the liabilities to which the transferred assets of Kraft are subject
were incurred by Kraft in the ordinary course of its business.

8\. After the Merger, no dividends or distributions will be made to the
former holders of Kraft Common Stock by Heinz other than the Special Dividend
and dividends or distributions made to all holders of Heinz Common Stock.

 

9\. Neither Heinz nor any of its subsidiaries owns or has owned within the
last five years, directly or indirectly, any stock of Kraft or any instrument
(other than the Merger Agreement) giving the holder the right to acquire such
stock.

10\. Following the Merger and the Subsequent Merger, Heinz or a member of its
qualified group of corporations (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)) will continue the "historic business" of Kraft or
use a "significant portion" of the "historic business assets" of Kraft in a
business (as such terms are defined in Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-1(d)).

 

11\. Heinz has no plan or intention (in each case following the Merger and the
Subsequent Merger) to (i) liquidate; (ii) merge with or into another
corporation; (iii) sell, exchange, distribute or otherwise dispose of any of
the equity interests of the Initial Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub II or
Heinz Company; or (iv) permit or cause the   Initial Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub II or Heinz Company to sell,
exchange or otherwise dispose of any of its assets, except for dispositions in
the ordinary course of its business, and except, in each case, for (x) the
Transactions described in Section 1.01(b) of the Merger Agreement or (y)
transfers permitted by Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(k). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the time of each Transaction
described in Section 1.01(b) of the Merger Agreement (i) Heinz Intermediate I
shall be a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Heinz, (ii) Heinz Corporation II
shall be a wholly-owned direct Subsidiary of Heinz Intermediate I and (iii)
Heinz Company shall be a wholly-owned direct Subsidiary of Heinz Corporation
II.

12\. Except as described in Section 6.07 of the Merger Agreement (i) all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement and the
Transactions will be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses and
(ii) Heinz, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II have not agreed to, nor will they,
directly or indirectly pay or assume any other expense or other liability,
whether fixed or contingent, of any holder of Kraft Common Stock, nor will any
Kraft Common Stock be acquired subject to any such liability.

13\. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Heinz (or any of
its subsidiaries) on the one hand and Kraft (or any of its subsidiaries) on
the other hand that was issued, acquired, or will be settled at a discount.

14\. None of Heinz, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II is an investment company
within the meaning of Section 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv) of the Code.

15\. The fair market value of the assets of Kraft transferred to Merger Sub
II in the Subsequent Merger will equal or exceed the sum of the liabilities
assumed by Merger Sub II plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to which the
transferred assets are subject. 

16\. None of Heinz, Merger Sub I, or Merger Sub II is under the jurisdiction
of a court in a Title 11 case or a receivership, foreclosure or similar
proceeding in a federal or state court.

17\. None of the compensation received or to be received from Heinz (or, to
the knowledge of Heinz, from Kraft) by any employee or independent contractor
of Kraft who is also a holder of Kraft Common Stock is or will be separate
consideration for, or allocable to, any of their shares of Kraft Common Stock
to be surrendered in the Merger. None of the Transaction Consideration to be
received by any employee or independent contractor of Kraft who is also a
holder of Kraft Common Stock is or will be separate consideration for, or
allocable to, any employment, consulting or similar arrangement. The
compensation paid by Kraft to any Kraft employee or independent contractor who
is also a shareholder of Kraft has been or will be for services actually
rendered (or to be rendered) and has been determined by bargaining
at arms-length.

18\. The Merger and the Subsequent Merger are being undertaken for valid
business purposes, including those set forth in the Form S-4 and Proxy
Statement. 19\. At all times since the formation of Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II Heinz
has directly owned, and at the time of the Merger and the Subsequent Merger
Heinz will directly own, all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of
Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II. Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II were newly
formed solely to effectuate the Merger and the Subsequent Merger,
respectively. Merger Sub I has not conducted, and will not conduct at any time
prior to the Merger, any business activities or other operations of any kind
other than the issuance of its stock to Heinz or other activities in
connection with the Merger. No election has ever been made to treat Merger Sub
II as a corporation for U.S. federal income Tax purposes.

 

20\. There are no warrants, options, convertible securities, or any other type
of right pursuant to which any person could acquire an interest in Merger Sub
I or Merger Sub II.

21\. The undersigned is authorized to make all the representations and
certifications set forth herein on behalf of Heinz and both of Merger Sub I
and Merger Sub II. The undersigned acknowledges that (i) your opinions will be based on the
accuracy of the representations and certifications set forth herein and on
the accuracy of the representations and warranties and the satisfaction of the
covenants and obligations contained in the Merger Agreement and the various
other documents related thereto, and (ii) your opinions will be subject to
certain limitations and qualifications, including that it may not be relied
upon if any such representations or warranties are not accurate or if any of
such covenants or obligations are not satisfied in all material respects and
will not address any tax consequences of the Transactions or any action taken
in connection therewith except as expressly set forth in such opinion. The
undersigned further represents that, for purposes of rendering your opinions,
you may consider each of the representations and certifications contained
herein to be true, correct and complete as of the Effective Time without
regard to any knowledge qualification.

[Law Firm Letterhead]

[], 2015

_Agreement and Plan of Merger_

 

 _Among H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation, Kite Merger Sub Corp., Kite Merger Sub
LLC and Kraft Foods Group, Inc._

 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as counsel for Kraft Foods Group, Inc., a Virginia corporation
("Kraft"), in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement
and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 24, 2015 (the "Merger Agreement"),
among H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Heinz"),
Kraft, Kite Merger Sub Corp., a Virginia corporation and a direct wholly owned
subsidiary of Heinz ("Merger Sub I") and Kite Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Heinz
("Merger Sub II"), in which Merger Sub I will merge with and into Kraft with
Kraft surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Heinz (such surviving company,
the "Initial Surviving Company" and such merger, the "Merger"). Immediately
following the Merger, the Initial Surviving Company will merge with and into
Merger Sub II, with Merger Sub II surviving as a limited liability company and
a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Heinz (the "Subsequent Merger" and
together with the Merger, the "Mergers"). The Mergers are described in the
proxy statement, which is included in the registration statement filed on Form
S-4 (as amended or supplemented through the date hereof) (the " _Registration
Statement_ ") in connection with the Mergers. Unless otherwise defined,
capitalized terms used in this opinion have the meanings assigned to them in
the Merger Agreement.

 

For purposes of this opinion, we have reviewed (i) the Merger Agreement, (ii)
the Equity Investment Letters, (iii) the Registration Statement, (iv) the
representations made by Heinz, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II and Kraft in their
respective letters, dated the date hereof, delivered to us for purposes of
this opinion (the "Representation Letters"), and (iv) such other documents
and matters of law and fact as we have considered necessary or appropriate. In
rendering this opinion, we have assumed that (i) the Mergers will be
consummated pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement and in the manner described in the Registration Statement (and no
transaction or condition described therein and affecting this opinion will be
waived by any party to the Merger Agreement); (ii) the statements concerning
the Mergers and the  parties thereto set forth in the Merger Agreement and Registration Statement
are true, complete and correct as of the Effective Time of the Mergers and
thereafter (where relevant); (iii) the representations made by Heinz, Merger
Sub I, Merger Sub II and Kraft in the Representation Letters are, and will
remain, true, complete and correct as of the Effective Time of the Mergers and
thereafter (where relevant); (iv) any representations made in the
Representation Letters or the Merger Agreement qualified by belief, knowledge,
materiality or any similar qualification are true, correct and complete
without such qualification; and (v) Heinz, Kraft and their respective
subsidiaries will treat the Mergers for United States federal income tax
purposes in a manner consistent with the opinion set forth below. If any of
the above described assumptions are untrue for any reason or if the Mergers
are consummated in a manner that is different from the manner described in
the Merger Agreement or Registration Statement, our opinion as expressed below
may be adversely affected.

 

Our opinion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"), Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, administrative
pronouncements and judicial precedents, all as of the date hereof. The
foregoing authorities may be repealed, revoked or modified, and any such
change may have retroactive effect.

 

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, for U.S. Federal income tax purposes,
we are of opinion that (i) the Merger and the Subsequent Merger will be
treated as a single integrated transaction that will qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii)
Heinz and Kraft each will be a party to the reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(b) of the Code.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

The undersigned, an officer of Kraft Foods Group, Inc., a Virginia
corporation ("Kraft"), is making the representations in this letter on behalf
of Kraft in connection with the opinions to be delivered pursuant to Sections
6.09(b), 7.02(c) and 7.03(c) of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger
Agreement") dated as of March 24, 2015 among Kraft, H.J. Heinz Holding
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Heinz"), Kite Merger Sub Corp., a
Virginia corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Heinz ("Merger Sub I").
and Kite Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned
subsidiary of Heinz ("Merger Sub II"). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement,
Merger Sub I will merge with and into Kraft with Kraft surviving as the
Initial Surviving Company as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Heinz (the
"Merger"). Immediately following the Merger, the Initial Surviving Company
will merge with and into Merger Sub II, with Merger Sub II surviving as a
limited liability company and wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Heinz (the
"Subsequent Merger"). Each capitalized term used and not otherwise defined
herein has the meaning ascribed to it in the Merger Agreement. References to
Merger Sub II shall also include references to the Surviving Company after the
Merger.

The undersigned, after due inquiry and investigation, hereby certifies and
represents on behalf of Kraft that:

1\. The facts relating to the Transactions as described in the Form S-4, the
Proxy Statement, the Equity Investment Letters and the other documents
described therein are, insofar as those facts pertain to Kraft, true, correct
and complete in all material respects. The Transactions will be consummated
in accordance with the Merger Agreement (without waiver or modification of
any provision thereof) and the descriptions contained in the Form S-4, the
Proxy Statement, the Equity Investment Letters and the other documents
described therein. There are no other agreements, arrangements or
understandings, either written or oral, between or among any of Heinz, its
affiliates or its stockholders, on the one hand, and any of Kraft, its
affiliates or its stockholders, on the other hand, concerning the Merger,
Subsequent Merger or any transaction that is part of the same plan as the
Merger. 2\. In connection with the Merger and the Subsequent Merger, no holder of
Kraft Common Stock will receive, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or
in respect of such stock any consideration other than Heinz Common Stock and,
the Special Dividend (together, the "Transaction Consideration"). The
Transaction Consideration to be received by holders of Kraft Common Stock was
determined by arms length negotiations between Heinz and Kraft. The fair
market value of the Transaction Consideration received by each holder of Kraft
Common Stock will be approximately equal to the fair market value of Kraft
Common Stock surrendered in exchange therefor (in each case, based on the
respective fair market value of Kraft Common Stock and Heinz Common Stock on
the business day before the Merger Agreement was executed).

 

3\. Kraft will declare the Special Dividend with a record date as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and payment of the Special Dividend
will be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and the Subsequent
Merger. To the knowledge of Kraft, the Special Dividend will be funded with a
portion of the proceeds from the Equity Investment.

 

4\. At least forty percent (40%) of the value of the aggregate Transaction
Consideration received by holders of Kraft Common Stock will be comprised of
Heinz Common Stock (based on the fair market value of Heinz Common Stock on
the business day before the Merger Agreement was executed).

 

5\. To the knowledge of Kraft, there is no plan or intention on the part of
any holder of Kraft Common Stock to sell or to otherwise transfer ownership
to Heinz, any holder of Heinz Common Stock or any person related to Heinz
within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(e)(4), of any Heinz
Common Stock received in the Merger, either directly or indirectly
(including through derivative transactions, such as equity swaps, that would
have the economic effect of a transfer). For purposes of this representation
and _representation 6_, a person is considered to own or acquire stock owned
or acquired (as the case may be) by a partnership in which that person is a
partner in proportion to that persons interest in the partnership.

6. Neither Kraft nor, to the knowledge of Kraft, any person related to Kraft
within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(e)(4) has, either
directly or indirectly (including through derivative transactions, such as
equity swaps, that would have the economic effect of an acquisition),
redeemed or acquired any Kraft Common Stock in contemplation of the Merger.

7\. Other than the Special Dividend, Kraft has not made any distributions to
holders of Kraft Common Stock in connection with the Merger or Subsequent
Merger. Kraft historically has paid a regular quarterly dividend, the amount
and timing of which were determined without regard to the Merger. 8\. Except as described in Section 6.07 of the Merger Agreement, (i) all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement and the
Transactions will be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses and
(ii) Heinz, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II have not agreed to, nor will they,
directly or indirectly pay or assume any other expense or other liability,
whether fixed or contingent, of any holder of Kraft Common Stock, nor will any
Kraft Common Stock be acquired subject to any such liability.

 

9\. The liabilities of Kraft assumed by Merger Sub II and the liabilities to
which the transferred assets of Kraft are subject were incurred by Kraft in
the ordinary course of its business.

10\. No assets of Kraft have been sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of
that would prevent Heinz from satisfying the requirement that it either
continue the "historic business" of Kraft or use a significant portion of
Krafts "historic business assets" in a business following the Merger (as such
terms are defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(d)).

11\. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Heinz (or any
of its subsidiaries) on the one hand and Kraft (or any of its subsidiaries)
on the other hand that was issued, acquired, or will be settled at a discount.

 

12\. Kraft is not an investment company within the meaning of Section
368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv) of the Code.

 

13\. The fair market value of the assets of Kraft transferred to Merger Sub II
in the Subsequent Merger will equal or exceed the sum of the liabilities
assumed by Merger Sub II plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to which the
transferred assets are subject.

14\. Kraft is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a Title 11 case or a
receivership, foreclosure or similar proceeding in a federal or state court.

 

15\. None of the compensation received or to be received from Kraft (or, to
the knowledge of the Kraft, from Heinz) by any employee or independent
contractor of Kraft who is also a holder of Kraft Common Stock is or will be
separate consideration for, or allocable to, any of their shares of Kraft
Common Stock to be surrendered in the Merger. None of the Transaction
Consideration to be received by any employee or independent contractor of
Kraft who is also a holder of Kraft Common Stock is or will be separate
consideration for, or allocable to, any employment, consulting or similar
arrangement. The compensation paid by Kraft to any Kraft employee or
independent contractor who is also a shareholder of Kraft has been or will be
for services actually rendered (or to be rendered) and has been determined by
bargaining at arms-length.

 

16\. The Merger and the Subsequent Merger are being undertaken for valid
business purposes, including those set forth in the Form S-4 and
Proxy Statement.

17\. The undersigned is authorized to make all the representations and
certifications set forth herein on behalf of Kraft. The undersigned acknowledges that (i) your opinions will be based on the
accuracy of the representations and certifications set forth herein and on
the accuracy of the representations and warranties and the satisfaction of the
covenants and obligations contained in the Merger Agreement and the various
other documents related- thereto, and (ii) your opinions will be subject to
certain limitations and qualifications, including that it may not be relied
upon if any such representations or warranties are not accurate or if any of
such covenants or obligations are not satisfied in all material respects and
will not address any tax consequences of the Transactions or any action taken
in connection therewith except as expressly set forth in such opinion. The
undersigned further represents that, for purposes of rendering your opinions,
you may consider each of the representations and certifications contained
herein to be true, correct and complete as of the Effective Time without
regard to any knowledge qualification.
