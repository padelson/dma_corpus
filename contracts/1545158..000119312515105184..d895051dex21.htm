letter on behalf of Heinz and Kite Merger Sub Corp., a Virginia corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Heinz (&#147;Merger Sub&nbsp;I&#148;) and Kite Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Heinz
(&#147;Merger Sub II&#148;) in connection with the opinions to be delivered pursuant to Sections 6.09(b), 7.02(c) and 7.03(c) of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;) dated as of March&nbsp;24, 2015 among Kraft Foods
Group, Inc., a Virginia corporation (&#147;Kraft&#148;), Heinz and Merger Sub. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub I will merge with and into Kraft with Kraft surviving as the Initial Surviving Company as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of
Heinz (the &#147;Merger&#148;). Immediately following the Merger, the Initial Surviving Company will merge with and into Merger Sub II, with Merger Sub II surviving as a limited liability company and wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Heinz (the
&#147;Subsequent Merger&#148;). Each capitalized term used and not otherwise defined herein has the meaning ascribed to it in the Merger Agreement. References to Merger Sub II herein shall also include references to the Surviving Company after the
Merger. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The undersigned, after due inquiry and investigation, hereby certifies and represents on behalf of Heinz, Merger Sub&nbsp;I and
Merger Sub II that: </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">1. The facts relating to the Transactions as described in the Form S-4, the Proxy Statement, the Equity Investment
Letters and the other documents described therein are, insofar as those facts pertain to Heinz, true, correct and complete in all material respects. The Transactions will be consummated in accordance with the Merger Agreement (without waiver or

understandings, either written or oral, between or among any of Heinz, its affiliates or its stockholders, on the one hand, and any of Kraft, its affiliates or its stockholders, on the other
hand, concerning the Merger, Subsequent Merger or any transaction that is part of the same plan as the Merger. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">2. In connection with the
Merger and the Subsequent Merger, no holder of Kraft Common Stock will receive, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or in respect of such stock any consideration other than Heinz Common Stock and the Special Dividend (together, the
&#147;Transaction Consideration&#148;). The Transaction Consideration to be received by holders of Kraft Common Stock was determined by arm&#146;s length negotiations between Heinz and Kraft. The fair market value of the Transaction Consideration
received by each holder of Kraft Common Stock will be approximately equal to the fair market value of Kraft Common Stock surrendered in exchange therefor (in each case, based on the respective fair market value of Kraft Common Stock and Heinz Common
Stock on the business day before the Merger Agreement was executed). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">3. To the knowledge of Heinz, Kraft will declare the Special
Dividend with a record date as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and payment of the Special Dividend will be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and the Subsequent Merger. The Special Dividend will be funded with a portion of
the proceeds from the Equity Investment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">4. At least forty percent (40%)&nbsp;of the value of the aggregate Transaction Consideration
received by holders of Kraft Common Stock will be comprised of Heinz Common Stock (based on the fair market value of Heinz Common Stock on the business day before the Merger Agreement was executed). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">5. (a) Neither Heinz nor any person related to Heinz (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section&nbsp;1.368-1(e)(4)) has any plan or
intention to reacquire or redeem any Heinz Common Stock issued in the Merger, either directly or indirectly (including through derivative transactions, such as equity swaps, that would have the economic effect of an acquisition), except for Share
Repurchases as defined in this representation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(b) Heinz (or a related person) may, after the Subsequent Merger, repurchase Heinz Common
Stock (i)&nbsp;on the open market through a broker at the prevailing market price, (ii)&nbsp;through block trades with holders of a significant number of shares of Heinz Common Stock at a price that is determined by reference to the prevailing
market price or (iii)&nbsp;pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase whereby a securities brokerage or investment bank that is not related to Heinz borrows a specified number of shares of Heinz Common Stock from stock lenders in the market and
sells that Heinz Common Stock to Heinz at an agreed price, and then the broker/bank subsequently purchases an equal number of shares of Heinz Common Stock in the open market at the prevailing market price, and returns those shares to the stock
lenders (any such purchases described in (i), (ii)&nbsp;and (iii), &#147;Share Repurchases&#148;). </P>

Repurchases nor the timing of any such acquisitions. Heinz will make those determinations in the future, based on the facts and circumstances that arise in the future. Based on the current facts and circumstances, Heinz has no plan or intention to
repurchase in the two years after the Subsequent Merger an amount of Heinz Common Stock for an amount of cash such that the sum of (A)&nbsp;the amount of cash paid in those Share Repurchases and (B)&nbsp;the amount of the Special Dividend (together,
the &#147;Aggregate Cash&#148;) would exceed sixty percent (60%)&nbsp;of the sum of (x)&nbsp;the Aggregate Cash and (y)&nbsp;the value of all shares of Heinz Common Stock issued to holders of Kraft Common Stock other than those shares acquired in
the Share Repurchases (based on the fair market value of Heinz Common Stock as of the Closing Date). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(d) Heinz is not obligated to
undertake any Share Repurchases and there was no understanding, arrangement or negotiations between Heinz and Kraft or the holders of Kraft Common Stock as to whether Heinz would undertake any Share Repurchases. </P>

Stock issued to holders of Kraft Common Stock in the transaction, either directly or indirectly (including through derivative transactions, such as equity swaps, that would have the economic effect of transfer). For purposes of this representation,
a person is considered to own or acquire stock owned or acquired (as the case may be) by a partnership in which such person is a partner in proportion such person&#146;s interest in the partnership. </P>

are subject were incurred by Kraft in the ordinary course of its business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">8. After the Merger, no dividends or distributions will be
made to the former holders of Kraft Common Stock by Heinz other than the Special Dividend and dividends or distributions made to all holders of Heinz Common Stock. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">9. Neither Heinz nor any of its subsidiaries owns or has owned within the last five years, directly or indirectly, any stock of Kraft or any
instrument (other than the Merger Agreement) giving the holder the right to acquire such stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">10. Following the Merger and the
Subsequent Merger, Heinz or a member of its qualified group of corporations (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section&nbsp;1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)) will continue the &#147;historic business&#148; of Kraft or use a &#147;significant portion&#148;
of the &#147;historic business assets&#148; of Kraft in a business (as such terms are defined in Treasury Regulations Section&nbsp;1.368-1(d)). </P>

time of each Transaction described in Section&nbsp;1.01(b) of the Merger Agreement (i)&nbsp;Heinz Intermediate I shall be a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Heinz, (ii)&nbsp;Heinz Corporation II shall be a wholly-owned direct Subsidiary of Heinz

knowledge of Heinz, from Kraft) by any employee or independent contractor of Kraft who is also a holder of Kraft Common Stock is or will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any of their shares of Kraft Common Stock to be surrendered in
the Merger. None of the Transaction Consideration to be received by any employee or independent contractor of Kraft who is also a holder of Kraft Common Stock is or will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any employment, consulting or

officer of Kraft Foods Group, Inc., a Virginia corporation (&#147;Kraft&#148;), is making the representations in this letter on behalf of Kraft in connection with the opinions to be delivered pursuant to Sections 6.09(b), 7.02(c) and 7.03(c) of the
Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;) dated as of March&nbsp;24, 2015 among Kraft, H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation, a Delaware corporation (&#147;Heinz&#148;), Kite Merger Sub Corp., a Virginia corporation and wholly-owned
subsidiary of Heinz (&#147;Merger Sub I&#148;). and Kite Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Heinz (&#147;Merger Sub II&#148;). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub I will merge with and into
Kraft with Kraft surviving as the Initial Surviving Company as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Heinz (the &#147;Merger&#148;). Immediately following the Merger, the Initial Surviving Company will merge with and into Merger Sub II, with Merger Sub II
surviving as a limited liability company and wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Heinz (the &#147;Subsequent Merger&#148;). Each capitalized term used and not otherwise defined herein has the meaning ascribed to it in the Merger Agreement. References
to Merger Sub II shall also include references to the Surviving Company after the Merger. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The undersigned, after due inquiry and
investigation, hereby certifies and represents on behalf of Kraft that: </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">1. The facts relating to the Transactions as described in the
Form S-4, the Proxy Statement, the Equity Investment Letters and the other documents described therein are, insofar as those facts pertain to Kraft, true, correct and complete in all material respects. The Transactions will be consummated in
accordance with the Merger Agreement (without waiver or modification of any provision thereof) and the descriptions contained in the Form S-4, the Proxy Statement, the Equity Investment Letters and the other documents described therein. There are no
other agreements, arrangements or understandings, either written or oral, between or among any of Heinz, its affiliates or its stockholders, on the one hand, and any of Kraft, its affiliates or its stockholders, on the other hand, concerning the
Merger, Subsequent Merger or any transaction that is part of the same plan as the Merger. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">2. In connection with the Merger and the Subsequent Merger, no holder of Kraft Common Stock will
receive, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or in respect of such stock any consideration other than Heinz Common Stock and, the Special Dividend (together, the &#147;Transaction Consideration&#148;). The Transaction Consideration to be
received by holders of Kraft Common Stock was determined by arm&#146;s length negotiations between Heinz and Kraft. The fair market value of the Transaction Consideration received by each holder of Kraft Common Stock will be approximately equal to
the fair market value of Kraft Common Stock surrendered in exchange therefor (in each case, based on the respective fair market value of Kraft Common Stock and Heinz Common Stock on the business day before the Merger Agreement was executed). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">3. Kraft will declare the Special Dividend with a record date as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and payment of the Special
Dividend will be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and the Subsequent Merger. To the knowledge of Kraft, the Special Dividend will be funded with a portion of the proceeds from the Equity Investment. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">4. At least forty percent (40%)&nbsp;of the value of the aggregate Transaction Consideration received by holders of Kraft Common Stock will be
comprised of Heinz Common Stock (based on the fair market value of Heinz Common Stock on the business day before the Merger Agreement was executed). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">5. To the knowledge of Kraft, there is no plan or intention on the part of any holder of Kraft Common Stock to sell or to otherwise transfer
ownership to Heinz, any holder of Heinz Common Stock or any person related to Heinz within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section&nbsp;1.368-1(e)(4), of any Heinz Common Stock received in the Merger, either directly or indirectly (including
through derivative transactions, such as equity swaps, that would have the economic effect of a transfer). For purposes of this representation and <U>representation&nbsp;6</U>, a person is considered to own or acquire stock owned or acquired (as the
case may be) by a partnership in which that person is a partner in proportion to that person&#146;s interest in the partnership. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">6.
Neither Kraft nor, to the knowledge of Kraft, any person related to Kraft within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section&nbsp;1.368-1(e)(4) has, either directly or indirectly (including through derivative transactions, such as equity swaps, that
would have the economic effect of an acquisition), redeemed or acquired any Kraft Common Stock in contemplation of the Merger. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">7. Other
than the Special Dividend, Kraft has not made any distributions to holders of Kraft Common Stock in connection with the Merger or Subsequent Merger. Kraft historically has paid a regular quarterly dividend, the amount and timing of which were
determined without regard to the Merger. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">8. Except as described in Section&nbsp;6.07 of the Merger Agreement, (i)&nbsp;all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement and the Transactions will be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses and (ii)&nbsp;Heinz, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II have not agreed to, nor will they, directly or indirectly
pay or assume any other expense or other liability, whether fixed or contingent, of any holder of Kraft Common Stock, nor will any Kraft Common Stock be acquired subject to any such liability. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">9. The liabilities of Kraft assumed by Merger Sub II and the liabilities to which the transferred assets of Kraft are subject were incurred by
Kraft in the ordinary course of its business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">10. No assets of Kraft have been sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of that would
prevent Heinz from satisfying the requirement that it either continue the &#147;historic business&#148; of Kraft or use a significant portion of Kraft&#146;s &#147;historic business assets&#148; in a business following the Merger (as such terms are
defined in Treasury Regulations Section&nbsp;1.368-1(d)). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">11. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Heinz (or any of
its subsidiaries) on the one hand and Kraft (or any of its subsidiaries) on the other hand that was issued, acquired, or will be settled at a discount. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">12. Kraft is not an investment company within the meaning of Section&nbsp;368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv)&nbsp;of the Code. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">13. The fair market value of the assets of Kraft transferred to Merger Sub II in the Subsequent Merger will equal or exceed the sum of the
liabilities assumed by Merger Sub II plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to which the transferred assets are subject. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">14. Kraft is
not under the jurisdiction of a court in a Title 11 case or a receivership, foreclosure or similar proceeding in a federal or state court. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">15. None of the compensation received or to be received from Kraft (or, to the knowledge of the Kraft, from Heinz) by any employee or
independent contractor of Kraft who is also a holder of Kraft Common Stock is or will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any of their shares of Kraft Common Stock to be surrendered in the Merger. None of the Transaction Consideration to
be received by any employee or independent contractor of Kraft who is also a holder of Kraft Common Stock is or will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any employment, consulting or similar arrangement. The compensation paid by Kraft to
any Kraft employee or independent contractor who is also a shareholder of Kraft has been or will be for services actually rendered (or to be rendered) and has been determined by bargaining at arm&#146;s-length. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">16. The Merger and the Subsequent Merger are being undertaken for valid business purposes, including those set forth in the Form S-4 and Proxy
Statement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">17. The undersigned is authorized to make all the representations and certifications set forth herein on behalf of Kraft. </P>
