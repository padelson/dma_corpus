dispute with respect to the application of this Section 3.2, the Buyer shall
cooperate with the Seller to the extent reasonably requested by the Seller to
prepare the Closing Balance Sheet and the Actual Adjusted Net Working Capital
Report or to investigate the basis for any dispute. The calculation of the

which the Buyer takes exception and the Buyers proposed adjustment. If the
Buyer fails to deliver to the Seller the Actual Adjusted Net Working Capital

Sheet, the Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted the Actual Adjusted Net
Working Capital for the purposes of any adjustment to the Purchase Price
under Section 3.3. If the Seller does not give the Buyer notice of its
objections to the Actual Adjusted Net Working Capital Report within
30 calendar days following receipt of the Actual Adjusted Net Working
Capital Report, the Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing
Balance Sheet as adjusted by the Buyer in the Actual Adjusted Net Working
Capital Report for the purposes of any adjustment to the Purchase Price under
Section 3.3. If the Seller gives the Buyer notice of its objections to the
Actual Adjusted Net Working Capital Report, and if the Seller and the Buyer
are unable, within 15 calendar days after receipt by the Buyer of the notice
from the Seller of objections, to resolve the disputed exceptions, such
disputed exceptions will be referred to Deloitte and Touche LLP or another firm
of independent certified public accountants (the " _Independent Accounting
Firm_ ") mutually acceptable to the Seller and the Buyer. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall, within 60 days following its selection, deliver to the
Seller and the Buyer a written report determining such disputed exceptions,
and its determinations will be conclusive and binding upon the parties
thereto for the purposes of any adjustment to the Purchase Price under
Section 3.3. The fees and disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm
acting under this Section 3.2 shall be apportioned between the Buyer and the
Seller based on the total dollar value of disputed exceptions resolved in
favor of each such party, with each such party bearing such percentage of the
fees and disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm as the aggregate
disputed exceptions resolved against that party bears to the total dollar
value of all disputed exceptions considered by the Independent Accounting
Firm. For the avoidance of doubt, the delivery and timing of receipt of any
document sent by the parties pursuant to this Section 3 shall be governed by

Assets and assumption of the Excluded Liabilities and release or
indemnification of the Companys and the Retained Subsidiaries obligations
thereunder (including any guarantees) are collectively referred to as the "

the Transferred Subsidiaries in and to any of the assets and rights primarily
used in the Businesses. Leucadia and the Seller shall assume full liability

generalized searches through media advertisement, employment firms or
otherwise that are not directed to such personnel nor (ii) soliciting or

### 

  

### (b) Certain current and former employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries participate in a nonqualified deferred compensation plan known

Company and its Subsidiaries to amend or revise the Deferred Compensation
Plan so that no further benefits will be accrued by their employees under
such plan on or after the Closing Date, (ii) assume the sponsorship of the
Deferred Compensation Plan and the related obligations and liabilities

Section 7.12(b) shall be of no further force and effect upon the exercise by
the Buyer of its Benefit Plan Substitution Right in accordance with Section

starting employment date, current annual salary, bonus and commissions in
2004 of each current employee of either of the Company or its Retained
Subsidiaries.

  

### 

  

### (d) No provision of this Section 7.12 shall create any third party
beneficiary or other rights in any employee or former employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company or of any of its
Subsidiaries in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) and
no provision of this Section 7.12 shall create any such rights in any such
Persons in respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or
indirectly, under any employee plan or arrangement which may be established
or maintained by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates after the Closing Date.
No provision of this Agreement shall constitute a limitation on rights to
amend, modify or terminate after the Closing Date any such plans or
arrangements of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

  

### 

  

## SECTION 7.13. _Tax Matters_.

  



  

### (a) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
such Taxes, and all recording charges (including any penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be paid by the Buyer and the parties shall cooperate in
the filing of all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect
to such Taxes and charges.

  

### 

  

### (b) (i) The Seller shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and
filed, when due all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods
to the extent that such Tax Returns are required to be filed on or prior to
the Closing Date, taking into account all valid extensions of time to file
such returns. The Seller shall also prepare and file or cause to be prepared
and filed when due all

  



  

46   

     
   

  



  

### Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to
the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods to the
extent such Tax Returns relate to Income Taxes, irrespective of when due.
(ii) The Buyer shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed when
due all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods to the extent
that such Tax Returns relate to Taxes other than Income Taxes and are
required to be filed after the Closing Date, taking into account all valid
extensions of time to file such returns. (iii) The Seller shall pay, or cause
to be paid, any Taxes due in respect of any such Tax Returns in excess of
any Taxes reflected in the determination of the Actual Adjusted Net
Working Capital, which shall be paid by the Company, but such limitation
shall have no application to Income Taxes. In the case of Tax Returns
prepared by the Buyer pursuant to clause (ii), the Buyer shall cooperate with
and shall follow the direction of the Seller in the preparation of such Tax
Returns and the Seller shall pay over to the Buyer the amount of any
Tax owing under such Tax Return to be paid by the Seller under this Section
7.13(b) within three days of receiving notice from the Buyer of such amount,
which notice shall be delivered not be less than seven days prior to the due
date of such return; _provided_ , _however_ , that there is at least
substantial authority for the positions required to be taken on such Tax
Returns. The Tax Returns prepared pursuant to the first sentence of clause
(i) and clause (ii) shall be prepared consistent with past practice unless
there shall be no reasonable basis therefor and unless the failure to prepare
such returns in such a manner would not reasonably be expected to have
a material and adverse effect on the Company, the Retained Subsidiaries
or the Buyer after the Closing.

  

### 

  

### (c) The Buyer shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed,
when due all Straddle Tax Returns and shall cause the Company to pay the
Taxes shown to be due thereon; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller shall
pay over to the Buyer within three days of receiving notice from the Buyer of
such amount, which notice shall be delivered not less than seven days prior
to the due date of such Straddle Tax Return for the portion of any such Tax
that relates to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date, but only to the extent in excess of any Taxes reflected in the
determination of the Actual Adjusted Net Working Capital, which shall be paid
by the Company. The Seller will furnish to the Buyer all information and
records reasonably requested by the Buyer for use in preparation of any
Straddle Tax Return.  The Buyer shall furnish the Seller with a completed
draft of any Straddle Tax Return for the Seller to review and comment upon no
later that 20 days before the Buyer files any such return or such shorter
period that may be practical in the circumstances, provided that reasonably
adequate time under the circumstances is provided to the Seller for such
review. The Buyer shall not file any such Straddle Tax Return without the
Sellers consent, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

  

### 

  

### (d) In the case of any Straddle Period, (i) Property Taxes of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the
amount of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle
Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is
the number of days in the Straddle Period; and (ii) the Taxes of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (other than Property Taxes) for the portion of the
Straddle Period that constitutes a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed
as if such taxable period ended as of the close of business on the Closing
Date. If necessary because the assets were reported to the tax authorities on
a combined basis ( _i.e._ , Closing occurs on or before December 31, 2005),
the

  



  

47   

     
   

  



  

### Property Taxes shall be allocated by the Buyer between the
assets acquired in this transaction and the Buyers remaining assets in
accordance with the Buyers reasonable asset allocation practice. If the
Buyers allocation is disputed by the Seller, then the Seller and the Buyer
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute.

  

### 

  

### (e) If a Tax authority commences any audit, examination, litigation or
otherwise makes any claim or proposes any adjustment that relates to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period (other than an Straddle Period) (collectively, a " _Tax
Proceeding_ "), then the Buyer shall promptly furnish written notice to the
Seller of such Tax Proceeding. Failure to give such notice shall not relieve
the Seller from any liability which it may have on account of this
indemnification or otherwise, except to the extent that the Seller
is prejudiced thereby. The Seller shall have the shorter of (i) 45 days
after receipt of such notice or (ii) 15 days less than the number of days
before a response to the relevant Tax authority is required, but in no event
shall the Seller have less than 15 days, to decide whether to undertake,
conduct and control (through counsel of its own choosing and at its own
expense) the response to such Tax Proceeding and the settlement or defense
thereof, and the Buyer shall fully cooperate with Seller in connection
therewith including, but not limited to, providing powers of attorney
authorizing Leucadia (or its designee) to control and take action
in connection with any such Taxes. The Seller shall permit the Buyer to
participate in such response, settlement or defense through counsel chosen by
the Buyer (but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid by Buyer).
If any settlement materially adversely affects any Subsidiary in a Post-
Closing Tax Period, the Seller shall not pay or settle any such claim without
the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). If within the shorter of (x) 45 days
after the receipt of the Buyers notice of a Tax Proceeding or (y) 20 days
less than the number of days before a response to the relevant Tax authority
is required (but in no event less than 20 days), the Seller does not notify
the Buyer that the Seller elects (at its cost and expense) to undertake the
defense thereof, or gives such notice and thereafter fails to contest such
claim in good faith, then the Buyer shall have the right to contest, settle
or compromise such Tax Proceeding and the Buyer shall not thereby waive any
right to indemnity for such Tax Proceeding under this Agreement and, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Buyer shall be indemnified by the Seller for the
Buyers reasonable costs, including attorneys and consultants fees in
defending and settling such proceedings; _provided_ , _however_ , the Buyer
shall not, and shall cause the Subsidiaries not to, pay or settle any such
Tax Proceedings without the prior written consent of Seller (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  

### 

  

### (f) If a Tax authority commences any audit, examination, litigation, or
otherwise makes any claim or proposes any adjustment that relates to a
Straddle Period (collectively, a " _Straddle Period Tax Proceeding_ "), then
the Buyer shall promptly furnish written notice to the Seller of such
Straddle Period Tax Proceeding. Failure to give such notice shall not
relieve the Seller from any liability which it may have on account of this
indemnification or otherwise, except to the extent that the Seller
is prejudiced thereby. The Buyer shall undertake, conduct and control
(through counsel of its own choosing and at its own expense) the response to
such Straddle Period Tax Proceeding and the settlement or defense thereof.
The Seller shall cooperate with the Buyer in connection therewith, and the
Buyer shall permit the Seller to participate in such response, settlement or
defense through counsel chosen by the Seller (but the fees and expenses of
such counsel shall be paid by Seller). To the extent any settlement adversely
affects the Seller in a Pre-Closing Tax Period, the Buyer shall not pay or
settle any

  



  

48   

     
   

  



  

### such claim without the prior written consent of the Seller (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If
within the shorter of (i) 45 days after the receipt of the Buyers notice of
a Straddle Period Tax Proceeding or (ii) 15 days less than the number of days
before a response to the relevant Tax authority is required (but in no event
less than 15 days), the Buyer fails to contest such claim in good faith or to
prevent action to foreclose a lien against or attachment of the Buyers
property, then the Seller shall have the right to contest, settle or
compromise such Straddle Period Tax Proceeding and the Seller shall not
thereby waive any right to indemnity for such Straddle Period Tax Proceeding
under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , the Seller shall not pay or
settle any such Straddle Period Tax Proceeding without the prior written
consent of the Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

  

### 

  

### (g) The Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to,
carry back any loss, credit or other Tax attribute of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to a Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior written
consent of the Seller, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

  

### 

  

### (h) All tax sharing, indemnity or allocation agreements or arrangements
among the Company and its Subsidiaries on the one hand and Seller, Leucadia
or their Affiliates on the other hand shall terminate at or prior to the
Closing and the parties thereto shall have no further obligation thereunder.

  

### 

  

### (i) Level 3 and the Buyer, on the one hand, and Leucadia and the Seller,
on the other hand, will cooperate with each other in connection with the
preparation and filing of Tax Returns required under this Agreement and will
provide to each other access, at any reasonable time and from time to time,
at the business location at which the books and records are maintained, after
the Closing Date, to such Tax data relating to the Company and the Retained
Subsidiaries as Leucadia and the Seller or Level 3 and the Buyer, as the case
may be, may from time to time reasonably request.

  

### 

  

## SECTION 7.14. _Name_.  Promptly after the Closing, Leucadia and the Seller
shall cause WilTel Aircraft Leasing, LLC, a Delaware limited liability

to otherwise cease using such name in its operations.

Tulsa, Oklahoma headquarters) or Excluded Assets (including, without
limitation, payments to acquire marketable securities).

### (b) If on the Measurement Date, the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries
have an aggregate cash balance of less than $100 million (after giving effect
to the Pre-Closing Transfers), the Seller shall make a contribution to the
capital of the Company on the Measurement Date to the extent necessary to
cause the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries to have a $100 million
aggregate cash balance immediately following the Measurement Date.

  

### 

  

### (c) The Seller shall on the Closing deliver to the Buyer a certificate

## SECTION 9.4. _Procedures for Indemnification_. Other than as set forth in

Section 9 (an " _Indemnitee_ ") asserts that a party obligated to indemnify
it under this Section 9 (an " _Indemnitor_ ") has become obligated to such
Indemnitee pursuant to Section 9.2 or 9.3, or if any suit, action,
investigation, claim or proceeding is begun, made or instituted as a result
of which the Indemnitor may become obligated to an Indemnitee hereunder, such
Indemnitee shall give written notice to the Indemnitor; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure of the Indemnitee to give prompt notice to the
Indemnitor shall not release the Indemnitor of its indemnification
obligations hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnitor shall have been
materially prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnitor agrees to defend,
contest or otherwise protect the Indemnitee against any such suit,

  



  

56   

     
   

  



  

## action, investigation, claim or proceeding at its sole cost and
expense subject to the provisions of this Section 9. The Indemnitor shall
have the sole power to direct and control the defense of any such suit,
action, investigation, claim or proceeding. The Indemnitee shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to participate at its own expense in
the defense thereof by counsel of the Indemnitees choice. The Indemnitee
shall make available all information and assistance that the Indemnitor may
reasonably request and shall fully cooperate with the Indemnitor in such
defense, including with respect to indemnification with respect to Taxes,
providing powers of attorney authorizing Leucadia or its designee to control
and take action in connection with any such Taxes. In the event of a failure
of the Indemnitee to provide cooperation as required under this Section 9.4,
the Indemnitors obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee shall be reduced to
the extent of the Losses with respect to which the Indemnitors ability to
defend against the action, investigation, claim or proceeding underlying
such indemnification obligation has been prejudiced by such failure. The
Indemnitor shall not compromise or settle any such suit, action,
investigation, claim or proceeding unless (x) such compromise or settlement
is on exclusively monetary terms and shall be paid entirely by the Indemnitor
(subject to the provisions of Section 9.2(b)(i) and (ii) and 9.3(b)(i) and
(ii), which shall be controlling) and the Indemnitee receives an
unconditional release in such compromise or settlement or (y) the Indemnitee
shall have consented in writing to the terms of such compromise or
settlement, which consent shall not unreasonably withheld; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the Indemnitee fails to consent thereto, the Indemnitors
liability with respect to such matter shall not exceed the proposed
settlement amount. If the Indemnitor fails timely to defend, contest or
otherwise protect against such suit, action, investigation, claim
or proceeding, the Indemnitee shall have the right to do so, including,
without limitation, the right to make any compromise or settlement thereof,
and the Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover the entire cost thereof from
the Indemnitor subject to the provisions of this Section 9, including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees, disbursements and amounts
paid as the result of such suit, action, investigation, claim or proceeding.
