the Merger.

1\.

    

AGREEMENT

 

The Parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

 

SECTION 1\. THE OFFER

 

1.1 The Offer.

 

(a) Commencement of the Offer. Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been terminated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8_, as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement but in no event later than
December 23, 2019, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to)
commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer.

(b) Terms and Conditions of the Offer. The obligations of Purchaser to,
and of Parent to cause Purchaser to, accept for payment, and pay for, any
Shares validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer are
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the prior
satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction or waiver of the
other conditions set forth in _Annex I_ (collectively, the " _Offer
Conditions_ "). The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the
" _Offer to Purchase_ ") that contains the terms set forth in this Agreement,
the Minimum Condition and the other Offer Conditions. Purchaser expressly
reserves the right to (i) increase the Offer Price, (ii) waive any Offer
Condition and (iii) make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the
Offer not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement; _provided, however,_
that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement, without the prior written
consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not (A) decrease the Offer Price, (B)
change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (C) decrease the
maximum number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (D) impose
conditions or requirements to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions,
(E) amend or modify any of the Offer Conditions or any other terms or
conditions of this Agreement in a manner that adversely affects, or could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect, any holder of Shares or that
could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or
delay the consummation of the Offer or prevent, delay or impair the ability of
Parent or Purchaser to consummate the Offer, the Merger or the other
Transactions, (F) change or waive the Minimum Condition, (G) extend or
otherwise change the Expiration Date in a manner other than as required or
permitted by this Agreement or (H) provide any "subsequent offering period"
within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The
Offer may not be withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date (or any
rescheduled Expiration Date) of the Offer, unless this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8_.

 

(c) Expiration and Extension of the Offer. The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at one minute following 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on the
20th business day following the Offer Commencement Date, determined as set
forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act (unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company) (the " _Initial
Expiration Date_ _,_ " such date or such subsequent date to which
the expiration of the Offer is extended in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Subject to the Parties respective
termination rights under _Section_ __ _ 8_: (i) if, as of the scheduled
Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived,
Purchaser may, in its discretion (and without the consent of the Company or
any other Person), extend the Offer on one or more occasions, for
an additional period of up to ten business days per extension,

 



2\.

    

 to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied; (ii) Purchaser shall extend
the Offer from time to time for: (A) any period required by any Legal
Requirement, any interpretation or position of the SEC, the staff thereof or
NASDAQ applicable to the Offer; and (B) periods of up to ten business days per
extension, until the Regulatory Condition has been satisfied; and (iii) if, as
of the scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and
has not been waived, at the request of the Company, Purchaser shall extend the
Offer on one or more occasions for an additional period of up to ten business
days per extension, to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied;
_provided, however,_ that in no event shall Purchaser: (1) be required to
extend the Offer beyond the earliest to occur of (the " _Extension Deadline_
") (x) the valid termination of this Agreement in compliance with _Section_
__ _ 8_ and (y) the first business day immediately following the End Date; or
(2) be permitted to extend the Offer beyond the Extension Deadline without the
prior written consent of the Company. Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer
prior to any scheduled Expiration Date without the prior written consent of
the Company except in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8_.

 

(d) Termination of Offer. In the event that this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours of such
termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall
not acquire any Shares pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or
withdrawn by Purchaser, Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause any
depository acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, in accordance with
applicable Legal Requirements, all tendered Shares to the registered holders
thereof.

(e) Offer Documents. As promptly as practicable on the date of
commencement of the Offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange
Act), Parent and Purchaser shall (i) file with the SEC a tender offer
statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all
amendments and supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule TO_ ") that will contain or incorporate by reference the Offer to
Purchase and form of the related letter of transmittal and (ii) cause the
Offer to Purchase and related documents to be disseminated to holders of
Shares. Parent and Purchaser agree that they shall cause the Schedule TO and
all exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto (which together
constitute the " _Offer Documents_ ") filed by either Parent or Purchaser
with the SEC to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder and other applicable Legal Requirements. Each
of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and to correct any material omissions therefrom, and Parent further
agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. The Company shall promptly furnish or otherwise make
available to Parent and Purchaser or Parents legal counsel all information
concerning the Company and the Companys stockholders that may be required in
connection with any action contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 1.1(e)_.
Except from and after a Company Adverse Change Recommendation, the Company and
its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on the Offer Documents prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. Parent and
Purchaser agree to provide the Company and its counsel with any comments
Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments. Each
of Parent and Purchaser shall respond

 



3\.

    

 promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents or the Offer. Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in the formulation of any
response to any such comments of the SEC or its staff and a reasonable
opportunity to participate in any discussions with the SEC or its staff
concerning such comments.

 

(f) Payment; Funds. On the terms specified herein and subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent waivable by Parent or Purchaser, waiver of the
Offer Conditions, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to,
irrevocably accept for payment at the Offer Acceptance Time and pay for, all
of the Shares validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the
Offer as promptly as practicable after the Offer Acceptance Time. Without
limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 9.10_, Parent shall cause to be
provided to Purchaser all of the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that
Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause
Purchaser to perform, on a timely basis, all of Purchasers obligations under
this Agreement. Parent and Purchaser shall, and each of Parent and Purchaser
shall ensure that all of their respective Affiliates shall, tender any Shares
held by them into the Offer.

 

(g) Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Offer
Acceptance Time, the outstanding Shares are changed into a different number
or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of
shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the
Offer Price shall be appropriately adjusted; _it being understood_ that
nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 1.1(g)_ shall be construed to permit the
Company to take any action that is expressly prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

1.2 Company Actions.

 

(a) Schedule 14D-9. As promptly as practicable on the day that the Offer
is commenced, following the filing of the Schedule TO, the Company shall file
with the SEC and disseminate to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable federal securities laws, a Tender
Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with
any exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule
14D-9_") that, subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_, shall reflect the Company
Board Recommendation. The Company agrees that it shall cause the Schedule
14D-9 to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and other
applicable Legal Requirements. Unless requested otherwise by the Company,
Parent shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be mailed or otherwise disseminated
to the holders of Shares together with the Offer Documents. Each of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company agrees to respond promptly to any comments of the
SEC or its staff and to promptly correct any information provided by it for
use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect, and to correct any
material omissions therefrom, and the Company further agrees to take all
steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with
the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to
the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Except from and
after a Company Adverse Change Recommendation, Parent and Purchaser shall
promptly furnish or otherwise make available to Company or its legal counsel
all information concerning Parent and Purchaser and their stockholders
that may be required in connection with any action contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 1.2(a)_. Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the

  



4\.

    

 Schedule 14D-9 and any amendment thereto prior to the filing thereof with
the SEC. The Company agrees to provide Parent and its counsel with any
comments the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments.
The obligations of the Company in this  _Section_ __ _ 1.2(a)_ shall not
apply if the Company Board effects a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or
has formally determined to do so. The Company shall respond promptly to any
comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9.

(b) Stockholder Lists. The Company shall promptly furnish to, or shall
cause to be promptly furnished to, Parent a list of the Companys
stockholders, mailing labels and any available listing or computer file
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and lists
of securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories, in each case
accurate and complete as of the most recent practicable date, and shall
provide to Parent such additional information (including updated lists
of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such
other assistance as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the
commencement of the Offer. Parent and Purchaser and their agents shall hold in
confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files,
shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger
and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request, deliver, and
shall use their reasonable efforts to cause their agents to deliver, to the
Company (or destroy) all copies and any extracts or summaries from such
information then in their possession or control. The information contained in
any such mailing labels, lists or files shall be subject in all respects to
the Confidentiality Agreement.

Legal

 



6\.

    

 Requirements in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.6(e)_, and shall cease to

outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares by
reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration
shall be appropriately adjusted; _it being understood_ that nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 2.5(b)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any
action that is expressly prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

2.6 Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books.

 

(a) Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall designate a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "
_Depository Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares to receive the funds to which
holders of such shares shall become entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _
1.1(b)_ and to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the holders of
Shares to receive the funds to which holders of such shares shall become
entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5_. The Paying Agent Agreement pursuant
to which Parent shall appoint the Paying Agent shall be in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company. At or promptly following the Offer
Acceptance Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
the Depository Agent cash sufficient to make payment of the cash
consideration payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.1(b)_ and with the Paying
Agent cash sufficient to make payment of the cash consideration payable
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ (together, the " _Payment Fund_ "). The
Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Payment Fund shall
be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving Corporation; 
_provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by
the United States of America in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1
or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1 billion, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest
investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time
of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no
such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three months.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than three
business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed
to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of the
Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.5_ a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in reasonable and
customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the certificates evidencing such shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
(or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the
Paying Agent of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in

 



7\.

    

 lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required
pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, and such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall then be
canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration
payable upon the surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the
benefit of the holder thereof. If the payment of any Merger Consideration is
to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificates formerly evidencing the Shares is registered on the stock
transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been
paid or are not applicable. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration
with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose
name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this _Section_ __ _ 2.6(b)_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the amount of cash, without interest, into which
the Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry have
been converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5_.

(c) At any time following 12 months after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver
to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not
disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including, all
interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds
made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look
to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and
other similar Legal Requirements) only as general creditors thereof with
respect to the Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by them. Neither the
Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration delivered in
respect of such share to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Legal Requirements. Any amounts remaining unclaimed
by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to
or become property of any Governmental Body shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the property of the Surviving
Corporation or its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company with respect to the Shares shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided
herein or by applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(e) Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, Purchaser, and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement

 



8\.

    

 to any holder of Shares, Company Options or RSUs such amounts as it is
required to deduct or withhold therefrom under applicable Tax Legal
Requirements; _provided_ , _however_ , that except for payments to current or
former employees of the Company with respect to Company Options and RSUs,
before making any such deduction or withholding, Purchaser shall provide to
the Company notice of any applicable payors intention to make such deduction
or withholding and such notice shall include the authority, basis and method
of calculation for the proposed deduction or withholding and shall be given at
least a commercially reasonable period of time before such deduction
or withholding is required in order for the Company to obtain reduction of or
relief from such deduction or withholding from the applicable Governmental
Body or execute and deliver to or file with such Governmental Body or
Purchaser such affidavits, certificates and other documents to afford to the
Company and its stockholders reduction of or relief from such deduction or
withholding. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted and withheld,
each such payor shall take all action as may be necessary to ensure that any
such amounts so withheld are timely and properly remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Body, and such amounts so remitted shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate (which shall not exceed the Merger Consideration
payable with respect to such Certificate), the Paying Agent will pay (less any
amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.6(e)_), in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2_.

 

2.7 Dissenters Rights. Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and held by holders who are entitled to demand appraisal
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and have properly exercised and perfected
their respective demands for appraisal of such shares in the time and manner
provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, have
neither effectively withdrawn nor lost their rights to such appraisal and
payment under the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted
into the right to receive Merger Consideration, but shall, by virtue of the
Merger, be entitled to only such consideration as shall be determined pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ that if any such holder shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holders
right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such holders Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or
withheld pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6(e)_), and such shares shall not be
deemed to be Dissenting Shares. Within ten days after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall provide each of the holders of Shares with the
notice contemplated by Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall give prompt
written notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal
of any Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in, and direct
all negotiations and Legal Proceedings with respect to such demands. The
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or
agree to do any of the foregoing. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent
shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Company, require the
Company to make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer
to settle or settle any such demands.

2.8 Treatment of Company Options and RSUs.

 

(a) Each Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall accelerate and become fully vested and exercisable
effective immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Effective Time. As of
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on
the part of the holders thereof, Parent, Purchaser or the Company, each
Company Option that is then outstanding and unexercised as of immediately
before the Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the total number
of Shares subject to such fully vested Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the excess of (x) the Merger
Consideration over (y) the exercise price payable per Share under such Company
Option, which amount shall be paid in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.8(c)_

(b) Each restricted stock unit award granted pursuant to any of the Company
Equity Plans or otherwise (each, an " _RSU_ " and together, the " _RSUs_ ")

vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
cash in an amount equal to (i) the total number of Shares issuable in
settlement of such RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time without regard
to vesting multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration for each Share issuable
in settlement of such RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, which
amount shall be paid in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.8(c)_ (the " _RSU
Consideration_ ").

 

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but no
later than five business days after the Effective Time), Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary of the Surviving
Corporation to, pay through the Surviving Corporations or the applicable
Subsidiarys payroll the aggregate Option Consideration and RSU Consideration

Company Option or RSU is not, and was not at any time during the vesting
period of the Company Option or RSU, an employee of the Company
for employment tax purposes, the Option Consideration or RSU Consideration
payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ with respect to such Company
Option or RSU (as applicable) shall be deposited in the Payment Fund and paid
by the Paying Agent in the manner described in _Section_ __ _ 2.6_.

2.9 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of
Purchaser and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Purchaser, in
the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of

files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to enable each of the principal executive officer of
the Company and the principal financial officer of the Company to make the
certifications required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance,
special purpose or limited purpose Entity, on the other hand, or any "off-

distributed or disseminated, as applicable, will comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. The
Company Disclosure Documents, at the time of the filing of such Company
Disclosure Documents or any supplement or amendment thereto with the SEC and
at the time such Company Disclosure Documents or any supplements or
amendments thereto are first distributed or disseminated to the Companys
stockholders, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

of all Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances and Encumbrances

allow the Company to execute or enter into any Contract (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, the Company to
abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that would otherwise
materially impede, interfere with or be inconsistent with, the Transactions.

(b) At any time prior to accepting for payment for such number of Shares
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as satisfies
the Minimum Condition (the " _Offer Acceptance Time_ "):

 

(i) if the Company has received a written Acquisition Proposal (which
Acquisition Proposal did not arise out of a material breach of _Section_ __ _
5.3_) from any Person that has not been withdrawn and after consultation with
outside legal counsel, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith,
that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer, (A) the

 



35\.

    

 Company Board may make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or (B) the
Company may terminate this Agreement to enter into a Specified Agreement with
respect to such Superior Offer, if and only if: (1) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (2) the Company shall have
given Parent prior written notice of its intention to consider making a
Company Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_ at least three business days prior to making any such
Company Adverse Change Recommendation or termination (a " _Determination
Notice_ ") (which notice shall not constitute a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation); and (3) (x) the Company shall have provided to Parent a
summary of the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_ and provided to Parent the latest
draft of any documentation being negotiated in connection with the applicable
Acquisition Proposal, (y) the Company shall have given Parent the three
business days after the Determination Notice to propose revisions to
the terms of this Agreement or make another proposal and shall have made its
Representatives reasonably available to negotiate in good faith with Parent
(to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) with respect to such proposed
revisions or other proposal, if any, and (z) after considering the results of
any such negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by Parent, if
any, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, the
Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, that such Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Offer and that the failure to make the Company Adverse
Change Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(e)_ would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board
to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements. Issuance of
any "stop, look and listen" communication by or on behalf of the Company
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) shall not be considered a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation and shall not require the giving of a Determination Notice or
compliance with the procedures set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ to the
extent that any such communication expressly reaffirms the Company Board
Recommendation. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)(i)_ shall also
apply to any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, which shall
require a new Determination Notice, except that the references to three
business days shall be deemed to be two business days, during which time the
Company and its Representatives shall continue to comply with clause (3)
above; and

(ii) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Company
Board may make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation in response to a
Change in Circumstance, if and only if: (A) the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Legal Requirements; (B) the Company shall have given Parent a
Determination Notice at least three business days prior to making any such
Company Adverse Change Recommendation; and (C) (1) the Company shall have
specified the Change in Circumstance in reasonable detail, (2) the Company
shall have given Parent the three business days after the Determination
Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or make another
proposal, and shall have made its Representatives reasonably available to
negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to do so)
with respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any, and (3)
after considering the results of any such negotiations and giving effect to
the proposals made by Parent, if any, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, that the
failure to make the Company Adverse Change

 



36\.

    

 Recommendation in response to such Change in Circumstance would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements. The provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)(ii)_ shall also apply to any material change to the
facts and circumstances relating to such Change in Circumstance, which shall
require a new Determination Notice, except that the references to three
business days shall be deemed to be two business days, during which time the
Company and its Representatives shall continue to comply with clause (3)
above.

 

6.2 Filings, Consents and Approvals.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each

resolve objections, if any, as the FTC or DOJ, or other Governmental Bodies of
any other jurisdiction for which consents, permits, authorizations, waivers,
clearances, approvals and expirations or terminations of waiting periods
are sought with respect to the Transactions, so as to obtain such consents,
permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals or termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws, and to avoid the
commencement of a lawsuit by the FTC, the DOJ, other Governmental Bodies or
any other Person under Antitrust Laws, and to avoid the entry of, or to effect

37\.

or restriction is binding on the Company only in the event the Closing occurs.
The Parties shall defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted
in court by any Person, including any Governmental Body, under Antitrust Laws
in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree,
order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that could
restrain, delay, or prevent the Closing by the End Date; _provided_ that such
litigation in no way limits the obligation of Purchaser and Parent to take all
actions and steps to eliminate each and every impediment identified herein.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Parties hereto shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates, if
applicable, to): (i) promptly, but in no event later than December 23, 2019
(unless Parent and the Company agree to a later date), make an appropriate
filing of all Notification and Report forms as required by the HSR Act with
respect to the Transactions; (ii) promptly, but in no event later than ten
business days after the date hereof, make all other filings, notifications or
other consents as may be required to be made or obtained by such Party under

any investigation or other inquiry, including allowing the other Party to have
a reasonable opportunity to review in advance and comment on drafts of filings
and submissions, (ii) give the other Parties prompt notice of the making or
commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding brought by a Governmental Body or brought by a third party before
any Governmental Body, in each case, with respect to the Transactions, (iii)
keep the other Parties informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, (iv) promptly inform the other
Parties of any communication to or from the FTC, DOJ or any other
Governmental Body in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or Legal Proceeding, (v) upon request, promptly furnish to the other
Parties, subject to an appropriate confidentiality agreement to limit
disclosure to outside counsel and consultants retained by such counsel, with
copies of documents provided to or received from any Governmental Body in

 



38\.

    

 connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding (documents provided pursuant to this provision may be redacted (1)
as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, (2) to remove
references to valuation of the Company and (3) as necessary to address
reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns) (other than Item "4(c)" and
"4(d)" "documents" as those terms are used in the rules and regulations under
the HSR Act), (vi) subject to an appropriate confidentiality agreement to
limit disclosure to counsel and outside consultants retained by such counsel,

investigation, action or Legal Proceeding and (vii) except as may be
prohibited by any Governmental Body or by any Legal Requirement, in connection
with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding in
respect of the Transactions, each Party hereto shall provide advance notice of
and permit authorized Representatives of the other Party to be present at each
meeting or conference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or Legal Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in advance
in connection with any argument, opinion or proposal to be made or submitted
to any Governmental Body in connection with such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding. Each Party shall supply as promptly
as practicable such information, documentation, other material or testimony
that may be reasonably requested by any Governmental Body, including
by complying at the earliest reasonably practicable date with any reasonable
request for additional information, documents or other materials, including
any "second request" under the HSR Act, received by any Party or any of their
respective Subsidiaries from any Governmental Body in connection with such
applications or filings for the Transactions. Purchaser shall pay all filing
fees under the HSR Act and for any filings required under foreign Antitrust
Laws, but the Company shall bear its own costs for the preparation of any
such filings. No Party shall commit to or agree with any Governmental Body to
stay, toll or extend, directly or indirectly, any applicable waiting period
under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws, or pull and refile
under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws, in each case, without
the prior written consent of the other.

 

(e) Parent agrees that it shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, acquire or agree to acquire any
assets, business or any Person, whether by merger, consolidation, purchasing a
substantial portion of the assets of or equity in any Person or by any other
manner or engage in any other transaction or take any other action, if the
entering into of an agreement relating to or the consummation of such
acquisition, merger, consolidation or purchase or other transaction or action
would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any delay in the expiration
or termination of any applicable waiting period or impose any delay in the
obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorization,
consent, clearance, approval or order of a Governmental Body necessary to
consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including any approvals and expiration of waiting periods
pursuant to the HSR Act or any other applicable Legal Requirements, (ii)
increase the risk of any Governmental Body entering, or increase the risk of
not being able to remove or successfully challenge, any permanent, preliminary
or temporary injunction or other order, decree, decision, determination or
judgment that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or (iii) otherwise delay or impede the consummation of the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
((i), (ii) and (iii) collectively, " _Regulatory Hurdles_ ").

 

6.3 Company Stock Awards.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
(including obtaining any necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the
Company Board or a committee thereof) that may be necessary (under the Company
Equity Plans and award agreements pursuant to which Company Stock Awards are
outstanding or otherwise) to (i) accelerate the vesting and exercisability
(as applicable) of each unvested Company Stock Award then outstanding so that
each such Company Stock Award shall be fully vested and exercisable (as
applicable) effective as of immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the
Effective Time in accordance with

 



39\.

    

  _Sections 2.8(a)_ , _2.8(b)_ and _2.8(c)_ , (ii) terminate each Company
Equity Plan (except as otherwise agreed by Parent and a holder thereof)
effective as of and contingent upon the Effective Time and (iii) following
the vesting acceleration described in (i) above, cause, as of the Effective
Time, each unexpired and unexercised Company Option and each unexpired RSU
then outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (and each
plan, if any, under which any Company Stock Award may be granted except, with
respect to any such plan, as otherwise agreed by Parent and a holder thereof)
to be cancelled, terminated and extinguished, subject, if applicable, to
payment pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.8_.

(b) Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all actions
that may be necessary to terminate any repurchase rights of the Company with
respect to Restricted Shares then outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Offer Acceptance Time.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary or required under the ESPP and Legal Requirements to, contingent on
the Effective Time, (i) ensure that, except for (x) the offering period under
the ESPP that commenced on December 6, 2018 and is scheduled to end on
December 14, 2020 and (y) the offering period under the ESPP that commenced
on June 15, 2019 and is scheduled to end on December 14, 2021, no offering
period or purchase period shall be authorized or commenced on or after the
date of this Agreement and (ii) if the Closing shall occur prior to the end
of the offering period in existence under the ESPP on the date of this
Agreement, cause the rights of participants in the ESPP with respect to any
such offering period (and purchase period thereunder) then underway under the
ESPP to be determined by treating the last business day prior to the Effective
Time as the last day of such offering period and purchase period and by making
such other pro rata adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the shortened
offering period and purchase period but otherwise treating such shortened
offering period and purchase period as a fully effective and completed
offering period and purchase period for all purposes under the ESPP. The
Company shall terminate the ESPP in its entirety effective as of the
Effective Time, contingent upon the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall take all actions (including, if appropriate, amending
the terms of the ESPP) that are necessary to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(c)_.

6.4 Employee Benefits. For a period of one year following the Effective
Time, Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each employee of the
Company who is employed by the Company as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and who continues to be employed by the Surviving Corporation
(or any Affiliate thereof) during such one year period (each, a " _Continuing
Employee_ ") a base salary (or base wages, as the case may be) and short-term
cash incentive compensation opportunities, each of which is no less favorable
than the base salary (or base wages, as the case may be) and short-term cash
incentive compensation opportunities provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and benefits (excluding equity and
equity-based awards and change in control plans, programs and arrangements)
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the benefits (excluding
equity and equity-based awards and change in control plans, programs
and arrangements) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Without limiting the foregoing:

 

(a) Each Continuing Employee shall be given service credit for all
purposes, including for eligibility to participate, benefit levels (including
levels of benefits under Parents and/or the Surviving Corporations vacation
policy) and eligibility for vesting under Parent and/or

 



40\.

    

 the Surviving Corporations employee benefit plans and arrangements with
respect to his or her length of service with the Company (and its
predecessors) prior to the Closing Date,  _provided_ that the foregoing shall
not result in the duplication of benefits or to benefit accrual under any
pension plan.

 

(b) With respect to any accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation time
to which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal, sick
or vacation policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to and instruct its Affiliates to, as applicable (and without duplication of
benefits), assume, as of the Effective Time, the liability for such accrued
personal, sick or vacation time and allow such Continuing Employee to use such
accrued personal, sick or vacation time in accordance with the practice and
policies of the Company.

(c) To the extent that service is relevant for eligibility, vesting
or allowances (including paid time off) under any health or welfare benefit
plan of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation, then Parent shall (i) waive
all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the
Continuing Employees, to the extent that such conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods would not apply under a similar employee benefit plan in
which such employees participated prior to the Effective Time and (ii) ensure
that such health or welfare benefit plan shall, for purposes of eligibility,
vesting, deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums and allowances
(including paid time off), credit Continuing Employees for service and amounts
paid prior to the Effective Time with the Company (and its predecessors) to
the same extent that such service and amounts paid was recognized prior to the
Effective Time under the corresponding health or welfare benefit plan of the
Company.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ are solely for the benefit
of the Parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this _Section_ __ _
6.4_ is intended to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or
an amendment to any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise
and no current or former employee or any other individual associated
therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of
this Agreement or have the right to enforce the provisions hereof. Nothing in
this Agreement shall confer upon any director, employee or service provider
of the Company any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere
with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation, Parent
or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services
of any director, employee or individual service provider of the Company at any
time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.

 

6.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

officers of the Company as of the date of this Agreement or have been
directors or officers of the Company in the past (the " _Indemnified Persons_
") for their acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, as
provided in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company (as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement) and as provided in the
indemnification agreements between the Company and said Indemnified
Persons (as set forth on Part 6.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and
in

 



41\.

    

 effect as of the date of this Agreement) in the forms made available by the
Company to Parent or Parents Representatives prior to the date of this
Agreement, shall survive the Merger and shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of such Indemnified Persons, and shall be observed by the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to the fullest extent available under
Delaware or other applicable Legal Requirements for a period of six years from
the Effective Time, and any claim made pursuant to such rights within such
six-year period shall continue to be subject to this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(a)_
and the rights provided under this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(a)_ until disposition
of such claim.

 

(b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date on
which the Effective Time occurs, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
(together with their successors and assigns, the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ")
shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements,
indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person in his or her capacity as
an officer or director of the Company against all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments or fines incurred by such Indemnified
Person as an officer or director of the Company in connection with any
pending or threatened Legal Proceeding based on or arising out of, in whole or
in part, the fact that such Indemnified Person is or was a director or officer
of the Company at or prior to the Effective Time and pertaining to any and
all matters pending, existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
including any such matter arising under any claim with respect to the
Transactions. Without limiting the foregoing, from the Effective Time until
the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the
Indemnifying Parties shall also, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Legal Requirements, advance reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys
fees) incurred by the Indemnified Persons in connection with matters
for which such Indemnified Persons are eligible to be indemnified pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_ within 15 days after receipt by Parent of a
written request for such advance, subject to the execution by such
Indemnified Persons of appropriate undertakings in favor of the Indemnifying
Parties to repay such advanced costs and expenses if it is ultimately
determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be
indemnified under this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_.

 

(c) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain, in effect, the existing policy of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by the Company as of the date of this
Agreement (an accurate and complete summary of which has been made available
by the Company to Parent or Parents Representatives prior to the date of this
Agreement) for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons who are currently
covered by such existing policy with respect to their acts and omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time in their capacities as directors and
officers of the Company (as applicable), on terms with respect to coverage,
deductibles and amounts no less favorable than the existing policy (or at or
prior to the Effective Time, Parent or the Company may (through a nationally
recognized insurance broker approved by Parent (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)) purchase a six-year "tail"
policy for the existing policy effective as of the Effective Time) and if such
"tail policy" has been obtained, it shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations
to obtain and/or maintain insurance pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
6.5(c)_; _provided, however,_ that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation
be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 300% of the
annual premium 

 



42\.

    

 currently payable by the Company with respect to such current policy, _it
being understood_ that if the annual premiums payable for such insurance
coverage exceeds such amount, Parent shall be obligated to cause the
Surviving Corporation to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available
for a cost equal to such amount.

 

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
Entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall ensure that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, or at Parents option, Parent, shall assume
the obligations set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.5_.

(e) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ shall survive the
acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of
the Merger and are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Persons and their successors, assigns
and heirs and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by
contract or otherwise. Unless required by applicable Legal Requirement, this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.5_ may not be amended, altered or repealed after the Offer
Acceptance Time in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any
Indemnified Person or any of their successors, assigns or heirs without the
prior written consent of the affected Indemnified Person.

6.6 Securityholder Litigation. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of
any litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the
Transactions. The Company shall control any Legal Proceeding brought by
stockholders of the Company against the Company and/or its directors
relating to the Transactions; _provided_ that the Company shall give Parent
the right to review and comment on all material filings or responses to be
made by the Company in connection with such litigation, and the right to
consult on the settlement with respect to such litigation, and the Company
shall in good faith take such comments into account. No such settlement shall
be agreed to without Parents prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except to the extent the
settlement is fully covered by the Companys insurance policies (other than
any applicable deductible), but only if such settlement would not result in
the imposition of any restriction on the business or operations of the
Company.

6.7 Additional Agreements. Without limitation or contravention of
the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.2_, and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to
consummate the Offer and the Merger and make effective the other
Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party to this Agreement shall (i)

and given by such Party in connection with the Offer and the Merger and the
other Transactions pursuant to any applicable Legal Requirements or Material
Contract set forth on _Schedule 6.7(a)_ , (ii) use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain each Consent (if any) required to be obtained pursuant to
any applicable Legal Requirement or Material Contract set forth on _Schedule
6.7(b)_ by such Party in connection with the Transactions and (iii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to lift any restraint, injunction or other
legal bar to the Offer or the Merger brought by any third

 



43\.

    

 Person against such Party. The Company shall promptly deliver to Parent a
copy of each such filing made, each such notice given and each such Consent
obtained by the Company during the Pre-Closing Period.

6.8 Disclosure. The initial press release relating to this Agreement shall

any announcement to Company Associates (to the extent not previously issued or
made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Offer, the Merger,
this Agreement or any of the other Transactions and shall not issue any such
press release, public statement or announcement to Company Associates without
the other Partys written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) each Party may,
without such consultation or consent, make any public statement in response
to questions from the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry

Company SEC Documents, so long as such statements are consistent with
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly
by the parties (or individually, if approved by the other Party); (b) a Party
may, without the prior consent of the other Party hereto but subject to
giving advance notice to the other Party, issue any such press release or make
any such public announcement or statement as may be required by any Legal
Requirement; and (c) the Company need not consult with Parent in connection
with such portion of any press release, public statement or filing to be
issued or made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_ or with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or Company Adverse Change Recommendation.

 

6.9 Takeover Laws; Advice of Changes.

 

(a) If any Takeover Law may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the
Transactions, each of Parent and the Company and the members of their
respective Boards of Directors shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that
the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
and conditions contemplated hereby and otherwise act to lawfully eliminate the
effect of any Takeover Law on any of the Transactions.

restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the acceptance for payment of
Shares pursuant to the Offer or the Merger or making consummation of the
Offer or the Merger illegal, which order, decree, ruling or other action shall
be final and nonappealable; _provided, however,_ that a Party shall not be
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
8.1(b)_ if the issuance of such final and nonappealable order, decree, ruling
or other action is primarily attributable to a failure on the part of such

order to accept a Superior Offer and enter into a binding written definitive

(f) by Parent at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, if a breach

by the Company by the End Date, or if capable of being cured, shall not have
been cured within 30 days of the date Parent gives the Company notice of such
breach or failure to perform; _provided, however,_ that, Parent shall not have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_

representation, warranty, covenant or obligation hereunder;

 



46\.

    

(g) by the Company at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, if a
breach of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or
failure to perform any covenant or obligation in this Agreement on the part of
Parent or Purchaser shall have occurred, in each case if such breach or
failure has had or would reasonably be expected to prevent Parent or
Purchaser from consummating the Transactions and such breach or failure cannot
be satisfied and cannot be cured by Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, by the
End Date, or if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within 30
days of the date the Company gives Parent notice of such breach or failure to
perform; _provided, however,_ that, the Company shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(g)_ if the
Company is then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or obligation hereunder; or

 

(h) by the Company if Purchaser shall have failed to commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer within the period
specified in _Section_ __ _ 1.1(a)_ (other than due to a breach by the
Company of its obligations under  _Section_ __ _ 1.2(b)_) or if Purchaser

pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall be of no
further force or effect and there shall be no liability on the part of
Parent, Purchaser or the Company or their respective directors, officers and
Affiliates following any such termination; _provided, however,_ that (a) this

survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and
effect, (b) the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of
this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with
its terms and (c) subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, the termination of this
Agreement shall not relieve any Party from any liability for common law fraud

based on the consideration payable to the equityholders of the Company
pursuant to this Agreement). Nothing shall limit or prevent any Party from
exercising any rights or remedies it may have under _Section_ __ _ 9.5(b)_
in lieu of terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_.

 

8.3 Expenses; Termination Fee.

proviso to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_), (B) any
Person shall have publicly disclosed a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal after

terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_, the date that is four business
days prior to the Expiration Date or (2) in the case of this Agreement being
subsequently terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_, the time of the
breach or failure to perform giving rise to such termination such breach and
(C) within nine months of such termination the Company shall have consummated
an Acquisition Proposal or entered into a definitive agreement with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ that for purposes of this _clause_ (C)
the references to "20%" in the definition of " _Acquisition Proposal_ "
shall be deemed to be references to "50%");

then, in any such event under _clause_ " _(i)_ ", " _(ii)_ " or " _(iii)_ "
of this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_, the Company shall pay to Parent or its
designee the Termination Fee by wire transfer of same day funds (x) in the

the case of common law fraud or Willful Breach, in the event that Parent or
its designee shall receive full payment pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
8.3(b)_, the receipt of the Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated
damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent,
Purchaser, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person in
connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the Transactions
(and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such
termination, and none of Parent, Purchaser, any of their respective Affiliates
(collectively, " _Parent Related Parties_ ") or any other Person shall be
entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the
Company or any of its Affiliates arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement, any of the Transactions or any matters forming the basis for such
termination (other than in the case of common law fraud or Willful Breach);
_provided, however,_ that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ shall limit
the rights of Parent or Purchaser under _Section_ __ _ 9.5(b)_. Any
Termination Fee paid to Parent pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ will
be offset against any award for damages given to Parent pursuant to any claim
based upon common law fraud or Willful Breach.

 

(c) Parents right to receive payment from the Company of the Termination
Fee pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ and any payments pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(d)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent
Related Parties against the Company and any of their respective former,
current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, optionholders,
managers, members or Affiliates (collectively, " _Company Related Parties_ ")
for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Offer or the Merger to

commences a Legal Proceeding which results in a judgment against the Company,
the Company shall pay Parent its reasonable and documented costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in
the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be

boards of directors of the Company and Parent at any time. This Agreement may
not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
the Parties.

 

9.2 Waiver. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of
any Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No Party shall be deemed to have waived any
claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy
under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege
or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and
delivered on behalf of such Party; and any such waiver shall not be applicable
or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given.

9.3 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. None of the
representations and warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, the
Company Disclosure Schedule or in any certificate or schedule or other
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the
Merger, except for those covenants that by their terms survive the Effective
Time, this _Section_ __ _ 9_ and the any applicable defined terms in Exhibit
A shall survive the Effective Time.

 

9.4 Entire Agreement; Counterparts. This Agreement and the other
agreements, exhibits, annexes and schedules referred to herein constitute the
entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among or between any of the Parties, with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof; _provided, however,_ that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall not be superseded and shall remain in full
force and effect; _provided, further, that,_ if the Effective Time occurs, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically terminate and be of no further
force and effect. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each
of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall constitute one and
the same instrument. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in
counterparts or otherwise) by PDF shall be sufficient to bind the Parties to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



49\.

    

9.5 Applicable Legal Requirements; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance;
Remedies.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any laws, rules
or provisions that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.5(c)_, in
any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
of the Transactions: (i) each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally
consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Chancery
Court of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom or, if
such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court
sitting in New Castle County in the State of Delaware ( _it being agreed_ that
the consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth in this _Section_ __ _
9.5(a)_ shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the
State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided
in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person
other than the Parties hereto); and (ii) each of the Parties irrevocably
consents to service of process by first class certified mail, return receipt
requested, postage prepaid, to the address at which such Party is to receive
notice in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.8_. The Parties hereto agree that
a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may
be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by applicable Legal Requirements; _provided, however,_ that
nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any Partys rights to seek any post-
judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court
judgment.

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that the Parties hereto do not perform their obligations under the provisions
of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach
such provisions. Subject to the following sentence, the Parties acknowledge
and agree that (i) the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in the courts described in _Section_ __ _ 9.5(a)_ without
proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled under this Agreement, (ii) the provisions set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 8.3_: (x) are not intended to and do not adequately
compensate for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement; and
(y) shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any
Partys right to specific enforcement and (iii) the right of specific
performance is an integral part of the Transactions and without that right,
neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Each
of the Parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
the other Parties hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
this _Section_ __ _ 9.5(b)_ shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

 

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the Parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided, however,_ that
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights hereunder may be
assigned without the prior written consent of the other Parties hereto, and
any attempted assignment of this Agreement or any of such rights without such
consent shall be void and of no effect; _provided, further, however,_ that
Parent or Purchaser may assign this Agreement to any of their Affiliates (
_provided_ that such assignment shall not impede or delay the consummation of
the Transactions or otherwise impede the rights of the stockholders of the
Company under this Agreement);  _provided_ that no such assignment or pledge
permitted pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ shall relieve Parent of its
obligations hereunder.

implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than the

by reason of this Agreement; except for: (i) if the Offer Acceptance Time
occurs (A) the right of the Companys stockholders to receive the Offer Price
or Merger Consideration, as applicable and (B) the right of the holders of
Company Stock Awards to receive the Option Consideration and/or RSU
Consideration, as applicable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.8_; (ii) the
provisions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.5_; and (iii) the limitations on
liability of the Company Related Parties set forth in _Section_ __ _
8.3(c)_.

9.9 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision
in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties hereto agree that the court
making such determination shall have the power to limit such term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so
modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in
the prior sentence, the Parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

 

9.10 Obligation of Parent. Parent shall ensure that each of its
Subsidiaries duly performs, satisfies and discharges on a timely basis each
of the covenants, obligations and liabilities applicable to its Subsidiaries

added and other similar Taxes and fees incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by Parent
and Purchaser when due.

9.12 Company Disclosure Schedule. The disclosures set forth in any
particular part or subpart of the Company Disclosure Schedule will be deemed
to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a)
the representations and warranties or covenants of the Company that are set
forth in the corresponding section or subsection of this Agreement; and (b)
any other representations and warranties or covenants of the Company that are
set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this clause (b) only if the
relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes
of) such other representations and warranties or covenants is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure. The mere inclusion of an item in the
Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty
or covenant shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a
material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item
is material or constitutes a Material Adverse Effect, and no reference to, or
disclosure of, any item or other matter in the Company Disclosure Schedule
shall necessarily imply that any other undisclosed matter or item having a
greater value or significance is material.

singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine

ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting Party shall not be
applied in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

"Sections," "Exhibits," "Annexes" and "Schedules" are intended to refer to
sections of this Agreement and Exhibits, Annexes or Schedules to this
