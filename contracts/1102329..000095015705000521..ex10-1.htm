STOCK  PURCHASE AGREEMENT

 

 

STOCK  PURCHASE AGREEMENT dated as of June 22, 2005 (this " _Agreement_ "), 
among  WEEKLY READER CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (" _Seller_ "), 
and  Pearson Education, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Purchaser_ ").

 

 

Purchaser  desires to purchase from Seller, and Seller desires to sell to
Purchaser,  all  the issued and outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock,
par value  $0.01  per share (the " _Shares_ "),  of  American Guidance
Service, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (the " _Company_ ").

 

 

Certain  terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section 10.05(b). 
Section 10.05(c) identifies other Sections of this Agreement in which 
capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined. Accordingly, the
parties  hereby agree as follows:

 

 

ARTICLE  I

 

 

_Purchase  and Sale of Shares; Closing_

 

 

SECTION  1.01. _Purchase  and Sale of the Shares._   On the  terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller  shall
sell, transfer and deliver to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase  from 
Seller, the Shares for an aggregate purchase price of $270,000,000 (the "
_Purchase  Price_ "),  payable as set forth below in Section 1.02 and
subject to adjustment  as  provided in Section 1.04. The purchase and sale
of the Shares is referred  to in this Agreement as the " _Acquisition_ ".

 

 

SECTION  1.02. _Closing  Date._   The  closing of the Acquisition (the "
_Closing_ ")  shall  take place at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore
LLP, 825 Eighth  Avenue, New York, New York 10019, at 10:00 a.m. on the 
second  business day following the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted,
the  waiver) of the conditions set forth in Section 6.01, or, if on such 
day any  condition set forth in Section 6.02 or 6.03 has not been satisfied 
(or, to  the extent permitted, waived by the party entitled to the benefit
thereof),  as  soon as practicable after all the conditions set forth in
Article VI  have  been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted, waived by the
parties entitled  to  the benefits thereof), or at such other place, time
and date as shall be  agreed  between Seller and Purchaser. The date on
which the Closing occurs is referred  to in this Agreement as the "
_Closing  Date_ ".

 

 

SECTION  1.03. _Transactions  To Be Effected at the Closing_.  At the 
Closing:

 

 

(a)  Seller  shall deliver to Purchaser certificates representing the
Shares, duly endorsed  in blank or accompanied by stock powers duly endorsed
in blank in proper  form  for transfer; and

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 
 

(b)  Purchaser  shall deliver to Seller payment, by wire transfer to a bank
account designated  in writing by Seller (such designation to be made at
least two business days  prior to the Closing Date), immediately available
funds in an amount equal  to  the Purchase Price, plus or minus an estimate,
prepared by Seller, in  consultation with Purchaser, and delivered to
Purchaser at least five business  days prior to the Closing Date, of any
adjustment to the Purchase Price under  clauses (i) or (ii) of Section
1.04(c) (the Purchase Price plus or  minus  such estimate of any adjustment
under Section 1.04 being hereinafter  called  the " _Closing  Date Amount_
").  Prior  to delivery of such estimate, Purchaser shall be permitted to
review the  working  papers relating to such estimate and Seller shall
provide Purchaser reasonable  access to the personnel, properties, books and
records of Seller relevant  for  such purpose.

 

 

SECTION  1.04. _Purchase  Price Adjustment._ (a)  (i)  Within  30 days
after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to  Purchaser an
unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the  close  of
business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date and a statement 
(the " _Seller  Statement_ ")  setting forth Tangible Net Worth as of the
close of business on the day  immediately preceding the Closing Date ("
_Closing  Tangible Net Worth_ ")  and  Accounts Receivable as of the close
of business on the day immediately preceding  the Closing Date (" _Closing 
Accounts Receivable_ "),  together with a certificate of Seller that the
Seller Statement has been  prepared in compliance with the requirements of
this Section 1.04.  Purchaser shall assist, and shall cause the Company and
the Subsidiaries  to  assist, Seller in the preparation of the Seller
Statement and shall provide  Seller reasonable access to the personnel,
properties, books and records  of the  Company and the Subsidiaries relevant
for such purpose. Purchaser and  Purchaser's independent auditors may
participate in the preparation of the  Seller Statement; _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  that  Purchaser acknowledges that Seller shall have the primary
responsibility  and  authority for preparing the Seller Statement.

 

 

(ii)   If the  Closing occurs prior to 11:59 p.m. on July 22, 2005, on or 
prior to  August 15, 2005, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Seller a
statement  (the " _Purchaser  Statement_ "  and,  together with the Seller
Statement, collectively the " _Statements_ "  and  individually a "
_Statement_ "),  setting forth Accounts Receivable as of the close of
business on July 29,  2005 (the " _July  29 A/R Amount_ "),  together with
a certificate of Purchaser that the Purchaser Statement has  been  prepared
in compliance with the requirements of this Section 1.04. The parties 
acknowledge that the July 29 A/R Amount set forth in the Purchaser Statement 
may  be based on Purchaser's assumption that the amount of the Closing
Accounts  Receivable as reflected in the Company's books and records on the
Closing Date  or in the Seller Statement, as applicable, is correct and that
in any Notice  of  Disagreement which may be delivered by the Purchaser
pursuant to  paragraph (b) below, Purchaser may revise its calculation of
the  July 29 A/R Amount to reflect the effect thereon of any disagreement 
raised  by Purchaser with respect to the Closing Accounts Receivable as set
forth  in the  Seller Statement. Seller and Seller's independent auditors
may participate in  the preparation of the Purchaser Statement; _provided_
,  _however_ ,  that  Seller acknowledges that Purchaser shall have the
primary responsibility  and  authority for preparing the Purchaser
Statement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b)  During  the 30-day period following the later of the date of
Purchaser's receipt of the  Seller Statement and the date of Seller's receipt
of the Purchaser Statement  (such later date, the " _Trigger  Date_ "), 
each  party and its independent auditors shall be permitted to review the
working  papers relating to the Statement prepared by the other party and
each party  shall provide to the other party and its independent auditors
reasonable  access  to its personnel, properties, books and records relevant
for such purpose.  Each  Statement shall become final and binding upon the
parties on the 30th day  following the Trigger Date, unless the party that
received such Statement  gives  written notice of its disagreement with such
Statement (a " _Notice  of Disagreement_ ")  to the  party that prepared
such Statement prior to such 30th day following the Trigger  Date. Any Notice
of Disagreement shall (i) specify in reasonable detail  the  nature of any
disagreement so asserted, (ii) only include disagreements  based on
mathematical errors or (A) in the case of a disagreement  by  Purchaser with
the Seller Statement, based on Closing Tangible Net Worth  or  Closing
Accounts Receivable not being calculated in accordance with this  Section
1.04 (and Purchaser may revise its calculation of the July 29  A/R Amount set
forth originally in the Purchaser Statement to reflect the  effect  thereon
of any such disagreement with respect to the calculation of Closing  Accounts
Receivable set forth in the Seller Statement), or (B) in  the case  of a
disagreement by Seller with the Purchaser Statement, based on the July  29 
A/R Amount not being calculated in accordance with this Section 1.04,  and 
(iii) be accompanied by a certificate of such party that it has complied 
with Section 1.04(e). If a Notice of Disagreement with respect to  either 
Statement is received by the party that prepared such Statement in a timely 
manner, then such Statement (as revised in accordance with this sentence) 
shall  become final and binding upon Seller and Purchaser on the earlier of 
(A) the date Seller and Purchaser resolve in writing any differences  they 
have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement 
and  (B) the date any disputed matters are finally resolved in writing  by
the  Accounting Firm. During the 30-day period following the delivery of a
Notice  of  Disagreement, Seller and Purchaser shall seek in good faith to
resolve in  writing any differences that they may have with respect to the
matters specified  in the Notice of Disagreement. During such period the
party that prepared  the  relevant Statement and its auditors shall have
access to the personnel,  properties, books and records of the party that
delivered the Notice of  Disagreement and the working papers of such party
(and, if they have  participated in such party's preparation of the Notice of
Disagreement, the  working papers of such party's auditors prepared in
connection with their review  of the Notice of Disagreement). At the end of
such 30-day period, Seller  and  Purchaser shall submit to an independent
accounting firm (the " _Accounting  Firm_ ")  for  arbitration any and all
matters that remain in dispute and were properly  included in the Notice of
Disagreement. The Accounting Firm shall be  Ernst and Young LLP or, if such
firm is unable or unwilling to act or has  at that time or at any time within
the preceding twelve months had any not  insignificant retention by either
Purchaser or Seller or their affiliates,  such  other nationally recognized
independent public accounting firm as shall be  agreed upon by the parties
hereto in writing (if the parties are unable to  agree, Seller and Purchaser
shall each select a nationally recognized  independent public accounting firm
and those two firms shall select a third  such  firm, in which event the
"Accounting Firm" shall mean the third such firm).  Seller and Purchaser
shall instruct the Accounting Firm to render its decision  by selecting
either the position of Seller or Purchaser as to each

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  submitted to the Accounting Firm, and the Accounting Firm shall not
be  permitted  to reach a decision as to any matter other than the position
of Seller  or  Purchaser. Seller and Purchaser agree to use reasonable
efforts to cause  the  Accounting Firm to render a decision resolving the
matters submitted to  the  Accounting Firm within 30 days following
submission. Judgment may be entered  upon the determination of the Accounting
Firm in any court having jurisdiction  over the party against which such
determination is to be enforced. Except  as  provided in the next sentence,
the cost of any arbitration (including the  fees  and expenses of the
Accounting Firm and reasonable attorney fees and expenses  of  the parties)
pursuant to this Section 1.04 shall be borne by Purchaser  and  Seller in
inverse proportion as they may prevail on the value of the matters 
determined by the Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocations shall 
also be  determined by the Accounting Firm at the time the determination of
the  Accounting Firm is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted to
it.  The  fees and disbursements of Seller's independent auditors incurred
in connection  with their review of the Statements and preparation, review or
resolution  of any  Notice of Disagreement shall be borne by Seller, and the
fees and disbursements  of Purchaser's independent auditors incurred in
connection with their review of  the Statements and the preparation, review
or resolution of any Notice  of  Disagreement shall be borne by Purchaser.

 

 

 

(c) The  Purchase  Price shall be (i) increased by the amount by which
Closing Tangible  Net  Worth exceeds $27,661,000 (the " _TNW Amount_ "),
_provided_ that the  Purchase Price shall not be increased by more than
$3,750,000 pursuant to  this  clause (i), (ii) decreased by the amount by
which Closing Tangible  Net  Worth is less than the TNW Amount, and (iii) if
the Closing occurs  prior to  11:59 p.m. on July 22, 2005, increased by the
Applicable Percentage  of  the amount by which the July 29 A/R Amount
exceeds Closing Accounts Receivable,  _provided_ that the Purchase Price
shall not be increased by more than  $2,500,000 pursuant to this clause (iii)
(the Purchase Price as so increased  or  decreased pursuant to clauses (i),
(ii) and (iii) shall hereinafter  be  referred to as the " _Adjusted
Purchase Price_ "). If the Closing Date  Amount is less than the Adjusted
Purchase Price, Purchaser shall, and if  the  Closing Date Amount is more
than the Adjusted Purchase Price, Seller shall,  within 10 business days
after the first date on which both Statements  have  become final and
binding on the parties, make payment by wire transfer in  immediately
available funds of the amount of such difference, together with  interest
thereon at a rate equal to the rate of interest from time to time  announced
publicly by Citibank, N.A. as its prime rate, calculated on the  basis  of
the actual number of days elapsed divided by 365, from (x) the Closing 
Date  to the date of payment, in the case of any such difference attributable
to  the  difference between Seller's estimate delivered prior to the Closing
pursuant to  Section 1.03(b) of the adjustments set forth in clauses (i) and
(ii)  of the  foregoing sentence and the final determination thereof, and
(y) from  July 29, 2005 to the date of payment, in the case of any such 
difference attributable to the adjustment set forth in clause (iii) of the 
foregoing sentence.

 

 

(d) The  term " _Tangible Net Worth_ " means Total Tangible Assets minus
Total Liabilities.  The term " _Total Tangible Assets_ " means the
consolidated total assets of  the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries
after deducting consolidated  goodwill and other intangible assets, net, of
the Company and its consolidated  subsidiaries, the term " _Total
Liabilities_ " means the consolidated total  liabilities of the Company and
its

consolidated  subsidiaries, and the term " _Accounts  Receivable_ " 
means  the consolidated accounts receivable (net of allowance for doubtful
accounts  and  sales returns) of the Company and its subsidiaries, in each
case calculated  in  the same way, using the same methodologies, practices,
accounting applications,  assumptions and method of applying estimates, as
such line items on the  Audited  Balance Sheet (whether or not doing so is
in accordance with United States  generally accepted accounting principles ("
_GAAP_ ")),  except that (i) amounts attributable to Income Taxes for the
Pre-Closing  Tax  Period, cash and cash equivalents, indebtedness and other
accounts payable  owing  to Seller or any of its affiliates, accounts
receivable owing from Seller  or any  of its affiliates and amounts
attributable to the Retention Program shall  be  excluded in determining
Total Tangible Assets and Total Liabilities and  (ii) the  reserve for Pre-
Closing Health Care Claims will equal $1,100,000 in determining  Total
Liabilities. The accrued pension liability included in the Total  Liabilities
set forth in the Statement shall be no less than the unfunded  Accumulated
Benefit Obligation, within the meaning of Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards 87, as reflected in the Audited Balance Sheet plus  any  accruals
for the net periodic benefits less any contributions made during  the 
period from January 1, 2005 to the Closing Date, and such liability shall 
not be  reduced by any unamortized or accumulated amounts. Solely for
purposes  of  determining the July 29 A/R Amount, the allowance for doubtful
accounts  and  sales returns used to calculate Closing Accounts Receivable
shall be carried  forward without change to calculate the July 29 A/R Amount.
The foregoing  principles are referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Balance  Sheet Principles_ ".  The  parties agree that the adjustments
contemplated by this Section 1.04 are  intended to be based on Tangible Net
Worth as of the close of business  on the  day immediately preceding the
Closing Date and Accounts Receivable as of  the  close of business on each
of the day immediately preceding the Closing  Date and  July 29, 2005,
measured, in the case of Tangible Net Worth, using component  items
calculated in the same way as such component items were calculated  on the 
Audited Balance Sheet and, in the case of Accounts Receivables, calculated 
in  the same way as Accounts Receivable are calculated on the Audited
Balance  Sheet  (except that in the case of the July 29 A/R Amount, the
allowance for doubtful  accounts and sales returns used to calculate Closing
Accounts Receivable  shall  be carried forward without change to calculate
the July 29 A/R Amount),  and,  accordingly, any items on or omissions from
the Audited Balance Sheet that  are  based upon errors of fact or
mathematical errors or that are not in accordance  with GAAP shall be carried
forward for purposes of calculating Closing  Tangible  Net Worth, Closing
Accounts Receivable and the July 29 A/R Amount. The  scope of  the disputes
to be resolved by the Accounting Firm shall be limited to  whether  such
calculation was done in accordance with the Balance Sheet Principles,  and 
whether there were mathematical errors in the applicable Statement, and 
the  Accounting Firm is not to make any other determination, including any 
determination as to whether GAAP was followed for the Audited Balance Sheet 
or  the applicable Statement or as to whether the TNW Amount is correct.
Schedule  1.04(d) sets forth an illustrative calculation of Tangible Net
Worth as  of  December 31, 2004.

(e)  During  the period from and after Closing through the resolution of
any adjustment  to  the Purchase Price contemplated by this Section 1.04,
Purchaser shall  not,  and from the date hereof until Closing, Seller shall
not (except (i) in  each case as required by GAAP and (ii) in the case of
Purchaser, as required  by  Purchaser accounting policies and practices at
the time, provided in the  case of  this clause (ii) that such actions do
not make impossible or impracticable  the  calculation of any adjustment to
the Purchase Price as contemplated by this  Section 1.04), take any action
with respect to the accounting books and records  of the Company on which
either Statement is to be based that are not consistent  with the Company's
past practices. Without limiting the generality of the  foregoing, during
such periods no changes shall be made in any reserve or  other  account
existing as of the date of the Audited Balance Sheet except as a  result  of
events occurring after the date of the Audited Balance Sheet and, in such 
event, only in a manner consistent with past practices and as required by 
GAAP.  Purchaser shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to cooperate in
the  preparation of the Seller Statement, including providing customary 
certifications, including management representation letters, to Seller's 
independent auditors. If the Closing occurs prior to 11:59 p.m. on July 22, 
2005, from the Closing to the close of business on July 29, 2005, Purchaser 
shall cause Accounts Receivable management and collection to be conducted  in
the  usual, regular and ordinary course in substantially the same manner as 
previously conducted.

 

 

(f)  During  the period of time from and after the Closing Date through the
resolution  of any  adjustment to the Purchase Price contemplated by this
Section 1.04,  Purchaser shall afford, and shall cause the Company to afford,
to Seller  and any  accountants, counsel or financial advisers retained by
Seller in connection  with  any adjustment to the Purchase Price
contemplated by this Section 1.04,  reasonable access during normal business
hours to all the properties, books,  contracts, personnel and records of the
Company and the Subsidiaries relevant  to  the adjustment contemplated by
this Section 1.04.

_Relating  to Seller and the Shares_

 

 

Except  as  set forth on the Disclosure Schedule attached hereto (the "
_Disclosure  Schedule_ ")  in  accordance with Section 10.05(a), Seller
hereby represents and warrants  to  Purchaser as follows:

 

 

SECTION  2.01. _Organization,  Standing and Power._   Seller  is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of  the 
State of Delaware and has full corporate power and authority and possesses 
all  governmental franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and
approvals  necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its
properties and  assets, including the Shares, and to conduct its businesses
as presently  conducted, other than such franchises, licenses, permits,
authorizations  and  approvals the lack of which have not had and would not
be reasonably likely  to  have a material adverse effect on the ability of
Seller to consummate the  Acquisition (a " _Seller  Material Adverse Effect_
").

 

 

SECTION  2.02. _Authority;  Execution and Delivery; Enforceability._  
Seller  has full corporate power and authority to execute this Agreement and
the  other  agreements and instruments to be executed and delivered in
connection with  this  Agreement (the " _Ancillary  Agreements_ ")  to 
which it is, or is specified to be, a party and to consummate the
Acquisition  and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The
execution  and  delivery by Seller of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements to which  it  is, or is specified to be, a party and the
consummation by Seller of the  Acquisition and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have  been  duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action. Seller has duly executed  and  delivered this Agreement
and at or prior to the Closing will have duly executed  and delivered each
Ancillary Agreement to which it is, or is specified to  be, a  party, and
this Agreement constitutes, and each Ancillary Agreement to which  it  is,
or is specified to be, a party will after the Closing constitute, its 
legal,  valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance
with its  terms.

 

 

SECTION  2.03. _No  Conflicts; Consents._   Except  as set forth in
Schedule 2.03, the execution and delivery by Seller  of this  Agreement do
not, the execution and delivery by Seller of each Ancillary  Agreement to
which it is, or is specified to be, a party will not, and the  consummation
of the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated hereby  and
thereby and compliance by Seller with the terms hereof and thereof will 
not  conflict with, or result in any violation of or default (with or
without  notice  or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right
of termination,  cancelation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of
a material benefit  under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of
the properties or  assets of Seller under, any provision of (i) the
certificate of  incorporation or by-laws of Seller, (ii) any contract, lease,
license,  indenture or other agreement (a " _Contract_ ")  to  which Seller
is a party or by which any of its properties or assets is bound  or  (iii)
any judgment, order or decree (" _Judgment_ ")  or  statute, law, ordinance,
rule or regulation or other pronouncement of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Governmental  Entity having the effect of law (" _Applicable  Law_ ") 
applicable to Seller or its properties or assets, other than, in the case 
of  clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any such items that have not had and
would  not be  reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Seller Material  Adverse Effect. No material consent, approval, license,
permit, order or  authorization (" _Consent_ ")  of, or  registration,
declaration or filing with, any Federal, state, local or  foreign 
government or any court of competent jurisdiction, administrative agency 
or  commission or other governmental authority or instrumentality, domestic 
or  foreign (a " _Governmental  Entity_ "),  is  required to be obtained
or made by or with respect to Seller in connection  with  the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement or any Ancillary  Agreement or the
consummation of the Acquisition or the other transactions  contemplated
hereby and thereby, other than (A) compliance with and filings  under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the " _HSR  Act_ "), 
(B)  compliance with and filings under Section 13(a) of the Securities
Exchange  Act  of 1934 (the " _Exchange  Act_ "),  (C)  filings of
termination statements and mortgage releases in connection with  the 
release by the lenders under the Credit Facilities of all Liens securing 
the  Credit Facilities upon the Shares and the assets of the Company and
the  Subsidiaries, and (D) those that may be required solely by reason of
Purchaser's  (as opposed to any other third party's) participation in the
Acquisition and the  other transactions contemplated hereby and by the
Ancillary  Agreements.

 

 

 

SECTION  2.04. _The  Shares._   Seller  has good and valid title to the
Shares, free and clear of all Liens except  as  set forth in Schedule 2.04.
Assuming Purchaser has the requisite power  and  authority to be the lawful
owner of the Shares, upon delivery to Purchaser  at  the Closing of
certificates representing the Shares, duly endorsed by Seller  for  transfer
to Purchaser, and upon Seller's receipt of the Closing Date Amount,  good and
valid title to the Shares will pass to Purchaser, free and clear  of any 
Liens, other than those arising from acts of Purchaser or its affiliates. 
Other  than this Agreement, except as set forth in Schedule 2.04, the
Shares  are  not subject to any voting trust agreement or other Contract
restricting or  otherwise relating to the voting, dividend rights or
disposition of such  Shares.

 

 

ARTICLE  III

 

 

_Representations  and Warranties_

 

_Relating  to The Company_

 

 

Except  as  set forth on the Disclosure Schedule in accordance with Section

SECTION  3.01. _Organization  and Standing; Books and Records._   (a) 
Schedule  3.01(a) sets forth a list of each subsidiary of the Company (each,
a " _Subsidiary_ ").  Each  of the Company and the Subsidiaries is a
corporation duly organized, validly  existing and in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of  incorporation, which jurisdiction is set forth
in Schedule 3.01(a).  Each of  the Company and the Subsidiaries has full
corporate power and authority and  possesses all governmental franchises,
licenses, permits, authorizations  and  approvals necessary to enable it to
own, lease or otherwise hold its properties  and assets and to carry on its

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business  as presently conducted, other than such franchises, licenses,
permits,  authorizations and approvals the lack of which has not had and
would not  be  reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Company Material  Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries
is duly qualified  and  in good standing to do business as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction  in  which the conduct or nature of its
business or the ownership, leasing or  holding  of its properties makes such
qualification necessary, except such jurisdictions  where the failure to be
so qualified or in good standing would not be reasonably  likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse  Effect. A list
of the jurisdictions in which the Company and the Subsidiaries  are so
qualified is set forth in Schedule 3.01(a).

 

 

(b)  The  Company has delivered to Purchaser true and complete copies of
(i) the  certificate of incorporation and by-laws, each as amended to date,
of the  Company and (ii) the comparable governing instruments, each as
amended  to  date, of each Subsidiary.

 

 

SECTION  3.02. _Capital  Stock of the Company and the Subsidiaries._ (a) 
The  authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 10,000,000 
shares  of Class A Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of which
2,137,591  shares, constituting the Shares, are issued and outstanding, (ii)
1,000,000  shares of Class B Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, which
are  unissued and (iii) 5,000,000 shares of Class C Common Stock,  par
value  $.01 per share, which are unissued. Except for the Shares, there are
no shares  of capital stock or other equity securities of the Company issued,
reserved  for  issuance or outstanding. Schedule 3.02(i)  sets  forth for
each Subsidiary the amount of its authorized capital stock or other  equity
interests, the amount of its outstanding capital stock or other equity 
interests and the record and beneficial owners of its outstanding capital 
stock  or other equity interests. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.02(a), 
there  are no shares of capital stock or other equity interests of any
Subsidiary  issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. The Shares are duly
authorized,  validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to
or issued  in  violation of any purchase option, call option, right of first
refusal,  preemptive right, subscription right or any similar right under any
provision  of  the Minnesota Business Corporation Act, the certificate of
incorporation  or  by-laws of the Company or any Contract to which the
Company is a party or  otherwise bound. All the outstanding shares of capital
stock or other equity  interests of each Subsidiary have been duly authorized
and validly issued,  are  fully paid and nonassessable and are not subject
to or issued in violation  of  any purchase option, call option, right of
first refusal, preemptive right,  subscription right or any similar right
under any provision of the Minnesota  Business Corporation Act, the Delaware
General Corporation Law or any other  Applicable Law, the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws (or comparable  governing instruments) of such
Subsidiary or any Contract to which such  Subsidiary is a party or otherwise
bound. The Company has good and valid  title  to all such shares and
interests, free and clear, except as set forth in  Schedule 3.02(a), of all
Liens. There are no outstanding bonds, debentures,  notes or other
indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary having the right  to  vote (or
convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right  to 
vote) on any matters on which holders of Shares or shares of capital stock 
of or  other equity interests of any Subsidiary may vote (" _Voting  Company
Debt_ ").  There  are no outstanding options,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrants,  rights, convertible or exchangeable securities, "phantom" stock
rights, stock  appreciation rights, stock-based performance units or
Contracts to which  the  Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by which
any of them is bound (i)  obligating the Company or any Subsidiary to issue,
deliver or sell, or  cause to  be issued, delivered or sold, additional
shares of capital stock or other  equity  interests in, or any security
convertible or exercisable for or exchangeable  into any capital stock of or
other equity interest in, the Company or of  any  Subsidiary or any Voting
Company Debt, (ii) obligating the Company or any  Subsidiary to issue, grant,
extend or enter into any such option, warrant,  call,  right, security or

benefit or right similar to or derived from the economic benefits  and rights
occurring to holders of Shares or any such capital stock or  other  equity
interests.

 

 

 

(b)  Except  for its interests in the Subsidiaries, the Company does not
own, directly  or  indirectly, any capital stock, membership interest,
partnership interest  or  other equity interest in any person.

 

 

SECTION  3.03. _No  Conflicts; Consents._   The  execution and delivery
by Seller of this Agreement do not, the execution  and  delivery by Seller
of each Ancillary Agreement to which it is, or is specified  to be, a party
will not, and the consummation of the Acquisition and the  other 
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and compliance by Seller with 
the  terms hereof and thereof will not conflict with, or result in any
violation  of  or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or give  rise to a right of termination, cancelation or acceleration
of any obligation  or  to loss of a material benefit under, or result in the
creation of any Lien  upon  any of the properties or assets of the Company
or any Subsidiary under, any  provision of (i) the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws (or the comparable  governing instruments) of the
Company or any Subsidiary, (ii) any Contract  to  which the Company or any
Subsidiary is a party or by which any of their  respective properties or
assets is bound or (iii) any Judgment or Applicable  Law  applicable to the
Company or any Subsidiary or their respective properties  or  assets, other
than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any  such  items that
have not had and would not reasonably be likely to have, individually  or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. No material Consent  of, 
or registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity is
required  to be obtained or made by or with respect to the Company or any
Subsidiary  in  connection with the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement  or any  Ancillary Agreement or the consummation of the
Acquisition or the other  transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, other
than (A) compliance  with and filings under the HSR Act, (B) compliance with
and filings  under  Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, (C) filings of
termination  statements and mortgage releases in connection with the release
by the lenders  under the Credit Facilities of all Liens securing the Credit
Facilities upon  the  Shares and the assets of the Company and the
Subsidiaries, and (D) those  that may be required solely by reason of
Purchaser's (as opposed to any other  third party's) participation in the
Acquisition and the other transactions  contemplated hereby and by the
Ancillary Agreements.

 

 

SECTION  3.04. _Financial  Statements._ (a)  Schedule  3.04(a) sets
forth the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company  as of  December
31, 2004 (the " _Audited  Balance Sheet_ ")  and  the audited consolidated
statements of income and cash

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

flows  of  the Company for the year ended December 31, 2004 together with
the report  thereon from Deloitte and Touche LLP (such financial statements,
the " _Audited  Financial Statements_ ").  The  Audited Financial
Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP  consistently applied
(except in each case as described in the notes thereto)  and  on that basis
fairly present the consolidated financial condition, results  of  operations
and cash flows of the Company as of and for the year ended December  31,
2004.

 

 

 

(b)  Schedule  3.04(b) sets forth the unaudited consolidated balance sheet
of the Company  as of  March 31, 2005 (the " _Unaudited  Balance Sheet_
")  and  the unaudited consolidated statements of income and cash flows of
the Company  for the three months ended March 31, 2005 (such financial
statements,  the " _Unaudited  Financial Statements_ ").  The  Unaudited
Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP  consistently
applied (except as described in the notes thereto) and on that  basis fairly
presents (subject to normal, recurring year-end audit adjustments)  the
consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company 
as  of and for the three months ended March 31, 2005.

 

 

(c)  The  Company and the Subsidiaries do not have any liabilities or
obligations of  a  nature required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated
balance sheet of  the  Company or in the notes thereto that have had or
would reasonably be likely  to  have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect,  except (i) as disclosed, reflected or
reserved against in the Audited  Balance Sheet and the notes thereto or in
the Unaudited Balance Sheet,  (ii) for items set forth in Schedule 3.04(c)
and (iii) for  liabilities  and obligations incurred in the ordinary course
of business consistent with  past  practice since the date of the Unaudited
Balance Sheet and not in violation  of  this Agreement.

 

 

(d)  The  Company and the Subsidiaries maintain accurate books and records
reflecting  their respective material assets and liabilities and maintain
proper and  adequate internal accounting controls which are intended to
provide assurance  that: (i) material transactions are executed with
management's authorization;  (ii) material transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation  of  the consolidated financial statements
of WRC Media Inc. (" _Seller  Parent_ ")  and to  maintain accountability
for Seller Parent's consolidated assets; (iii) access to  Seller Parent's
material assets is permitted only in accordance with  management's
authorization; and (iv) the reporting of Seller Parent's material  assets is
compared with existing assets at regular intervals.

 

 

SECTION  3.05. _Assets  Other than Real Property Interests, Intellectual
Property and  Contracts._ (a)  The  Company or a Subsidiary has good and
valid title to all the assets reflected  on  the Unaudited Balance Sheet or
thereafter acquired, other than those disposed  of  since the date of the
Unaudited Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business  consistent with
past practice, in each case free and clear of all mortgages,  liens, security
interests, easements, leases, subleases, rights of way, options  or
encumbrances of any kind (collectively, " _Liens_ "),  except (i) such Liens
as are set forth in Schedule 3.05(a),  (ii) mechanics', carriers', workmen's,
repairmen's or other like Liens  arising or incurred in the ordinary course
of business, Liens arising under  original purchase price conditional sales
contracts and equipment leases  with  third parties and Liens for Taxes that
are not

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

due  and  payable or that may thereafter be paid without penalty and (iii)
Liens  the  existence of which is referred to in the notes to the Audited
Balance Sheet  (the  Liens described in clauses (ii) and (iii) above,
together with the Liens  referred to in clause (ii) of Section 3.06, are
referred to collectively  as " _Permitted  Liens_ ").

 

 

 

(b)  This  Section 3.05 does not relate to real property or interests in
real  property, such items being the subject of Section 3.06, to
Intellectual  Property, such items being the subject of Section 3.07, or to
Contracts,  such items being the subject of Section 3.08.

 

 

SECTION  3.06. _Real  Property._   Neither  the Company nor any of the
Subsidiaries owns any real property or interests  in  real property in fee.
Schedule 3.06 sets forth a complete list of all real  property and interests
in real property leased by the Company or any Subsidiary  (individually, a "
_Leased  Property_ ",  and  the lease, sublease or other agreement pursuant
to which it is occupied by  the  Company or the applicable Subsidiary, and
all amendments thereto, individually,  a " _Lease_ ").  The  Company or the
applicable Subsidiary has good and valid title to the leasehold  estates in
the Leased Property created by the Leases, subject to  (i) Permitted Liens,
(ii) other imperfections of title or  encumbrances, if any, that do not
materially impair, and could not reasonably  be  expected materially to
impair, the continued use and operation of the assets  to  which they relate
in the conduct of the business of the Company and the  Subsidiaries as
presently conducted, (iii) subleases and similar agreements  also listed in
Schedule 3.06 and (iv) Liens that have been placed  by any  developer,
landlord or other third party on any Leased Property and  subordination or
similar agreements relating thereto. Neither  the Company nor any Subsidiary
has granted a Lien on its leasehold estate  in any  Leased Property, other
than any Lien granted in such Lease to the landlord  thereunder for any rent
which may become delinquent. True  and  complete copies of the Leases have
been made available to Purchaser for review.  Except as set forth in Schedule
3.06, all of the Leases are valid, binding  and  in full force and effect in
all material respects and are enforceable by  the  Company or the applicable
Subsidiary in accordance with their terms subject,  as  to enforcement, to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization  or similar
laws affecting creditors' rights generally and to general equitable 
principles. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.06 Seller, as of the date of 
this  Agreement the Company and the Subsidiaries have performed all
material  obligations required to be performed by them under the Leases and
are not  in  material default under any Lease, and to the knowledge of
Seller, no other  party  to any Lease is in material default thereunder.
Each Leased Property is in  materially good condition and repair, ordinary
wear and tear  excepted.

 

 

SECTION  3.07. _Intellectual  Property._ (a)  Schedule  3.07 sets forth a
true and complete list of all material Intellectual Property,  used by the
Company or any Subsidiary (the " _Company  Intellectual Property_ ").

the Company or such Subsidiary  (w) as a result of the Company or any

Company and/or any  Subsidiary or expressly assumed by Purchaser pursuant to
Applicable Law or  this  Agreement is referred to herein as a " _Company

there are no investigations by any Governmental  Entity, termination
proceedings or other claims (except routine claims for  benefits payable
under the Company Benefit Plans or Seller's 401(k) Plan) or  Proceedings
against or involving any Company Benefit Plan or Seller's 401(k)  Plan that
could give rise to any liability.

 

 

(c)  There  has  been no application for waiver or waiver of the minimum
funding standards  imposed by Section 412 of the Code with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan  that  is a Pension Plan (a " _Company  Pension Plan_

the  Code.

Internal Revenue  Service  as to its qualification under Section 401(a) of
the Code and to the effect  that  each such trust is exempt from taxation

revoked, and, to the knowledge of Seller  and  the Company, revocation has
not been threatened; and (ii) has at all  times  during the past two years

Plan is a multiemployer  plan, and no employee benefit plan (that would be
treated as a Benefit Plan  if  it were still in existence) has been
terminated within the six years prior  to  the date hereof, the liabilities
of which have not been satisfied in  full.

 

 

(g)  No  Company Benefit Plan that is a Welfare Plan provides benefits
after termination  of employment, except where the cost thereof is borne
entirely by the former  employee (or his eligible dependents or
beneficiaries) or as required by  Section  4980B(f) of the Code or any
similar Applicable Law.

additional  compensation, severance or other benefits or any acceleration of
the time  of  payment or vesting of any compensation, severance or other
benefits as a  result  of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(alone or in combination  with  any other event). Neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, nor  the  consummation of any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement will trigger  any  funding (through a grantor
trust or otherwise) of any compensation, severance  or  other benefits under
any Company Benefit Plan.

 

 

(i)  Except  as  disclosed on Schedule 3.12(i), no Company Benefit Plan is
described  in  Section 401(a)(1) of ERISA. The obligations under each such
Company  Benefit  Plan described in Section 401(a)(1) of ERISA are fully
funded by assets  that are held in the "rabbi" trusts that are identified
on  Schedule 3.12(i).

 

 

SECTION  3.13. _Absence  of Changes or Events._   Since  the date of the
Unaudited Balance Sheet, there has not been any Company Material  Adverse
Effect, nor has there been any event that would be reasonably likely  to 
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. 
Purchaser acknowledges that there may have been or may be disruption to the 
Company's and the Subsidiaries' business as a result of the announcement by 
Seller of its intention to sell the Company or the execution of this
Agreement  and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
Purchaser  acknowledges that such disruptions do not and shall not constitute
a breach  of  this Section 3.13 or Section 5.01. Since the date of the
Unaudited  Balance Sheet, the business of the Company and the Subsidiaries
has been  conducted in the ordinary course and in substantially the same
manner as  previously conducted. Since the date of the Unaudited Balance
Sheet to the  date  of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has taken any action  that, if taken after the date of this
Agreement, would constitute a breach  of  Section 5.01.

 

 

SECTION  3.14. _Compliance  with Applicable Laws._ (a)  The  Company and
the Subsidiaries are in compliance with all Applicable Laws,  except  for
instances of noncompliance that have not had and would not reasonably  be 
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse 
Effect. None of Seller, the Company and the Subsidiaries has received any 
written communication during the past twelve months from a Governmental
Entity  that alleges that the Company or a Subsidiary is not in compliance in
any  respect with any Applicable Law, which allegation if proven would
reasonably  be  likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse  Effect. The Company and the Subsidiaries are in material
compliance with  all  governmental qualifications, registrations, licenses,
permits, approvals,  consents or other authorizations from a Governmental
Entity (" _Permits_ ")  required for the operation of the businesses of the
Company and the Subsidiaries  as currently conducted, except for any failures
to be in compliance that  have  not had and would not be reasonably likely
to have, individually or in the  aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. This Section 3.14(a)  does not  relate to matters with respect to
Taxes, which are the subject of  Section 3.10, or to environmental matters,
which are the subject of  Section 3.14(b).

compliance  with  Environmental Laws, (ii) the Company and the Subsidiaries
hold, and  are in  compliance with, all material Permits required under
Environmental Laws for  the  Company and the Subsidiaries to conduct their
respective business operations,  (iii) the Company and the Subsidiaries have
not entered into or agreed  to  any court decree or order, are not subject
to any Judgment, and have not  received any written notices or complaints
relating to compliance with, or  liability under, any Environmental Law, (iv)
no releases of Hazardous  Materials have occurred at, from, in, to, on or
under any property currently  or,  to Seller's knowledge, formerly owned,
operated or leased by the Company or any  Subsidiary or any current or, to
Seller's knowledge, former subsidiary thereof  which releases would be
reasonably likely to result in liability to the Company  or any Subsidiary,
and (v) neither the Company or any Subsidiary,  any  current or, to Seller's
knowledge, former subsidiary thereof, nor, to Seller's  knowledge, any
predecessor of any of the foregoing has transported or arranged  for the
treatment, storage, disposal or transportation of any Hazardous  Materials to
any off-site location which would be reasonably likely to result  in 
liability to the Company or any Subsidiary. The term " _Environmental  Laws_
"  means  all Applicable Laws or Judgments relating to the environment,
preservation  or  reclamation of natural resources, the protection of human
health or worker  health and safety, or the management, use, handling,
generation, treatment,  storage, transportation, disposal, labeling, release,
threatened release  of or  exposure of any Person to Hazardous Materials.
The term " _Hazardous  Materials_ "  means  (1) any radioactive materials
or wastes, petroleum (including crude  oil or  any fraction thereof) or

SECTION  3.15. _Transactions  with Affiliates._   None of  the Contracts
set forth in Schedule 3.08(a) between the Company or  any  Subsidiary, on
the one hand, and Seller or any of its affiliates (other than  the  Company
and the Subsidiaries), on the other hand, will continue in effect  subsequent
to the Closing. After the Closing none of Seller, any affiliates  of  Seller
(other than the Company and the Subsidiaries) or PRIMEDIA Inc. will  have 
any material interest in any property (real or personal, tangible or
intangible)  or Contract of the Company or any Subsidiary or used in or
pertaining to  their  business.

 

 

SECTION  3.16. _Accounts;  Safe Deposit Boxes; Officers and Directors._  
Schedule 3.16 sets forth (i) a true and correct list of all  bank and 
savings accounts, certificates of deposit and safe deposit boxes of the
Company  and the Subsidiaries and those persons authorized to sign thereon,
and  (ii) a true and correct list of all officers and directors of the 
Company  and the Subsidiaries.

 

 

SECTION  3.17. _Interests  in Assets._   Seller  and its affiliates,
other than the Company and the Subsidiaries, do not own  any  asset used in
the conduct of the businesses of the Company and the Subsidiaries,  except
for assets used to provide corporate level services to the  Company.

ARTICLE  V

Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  with respect to workers

policies  with respect to such insurable events that occurred prior to 11:59
p.m. on  the  day immediately preceding the Closing Date, and shall remit

in the submission  of  any claim by the Company or any Subsidiary under
Seller Parent's errors and  omissions, directors and officers and umbrella
(to the extent relating to  errors  and omissions) insurance policies, to
the extent that the events giving rise  to  such claim under such policies
occurred prior to 11:59 p.m. on the  day  immediately preceding the Closing
Date (it being understood that neither  Seller  Parent nor any of its
affiliates shall be obligated to continue in effect  or  maintain policies
providing such insurance) and Seller agrees to remit any  recoveries relating
thereto promptly to Purchaser.

 

 

SECTION  5.02. _Access  to Information._   Seller  shall, and shall cause
the Company and the Subsidiaries to, afford to Purchaser  and its
accountants, counsel and other representatives reasonable access,  upon

Tax  Returns  and records of the Company and the Subsidiaries, and, during
such period  shall  furnish promptly to Purchaser any information concerning
the Company or a  Subsidiary as Purchaser may reasonably request; _provided_
,  _however_ ,  that  such access does not unreasonably disrupt the normal
operations of the Company  and the Subsidiaries. During the period commencing
on the date of this Agreement  and ending at the time of the Closing, Seller
shall inform, without  representation or warranty, Purchaser of the
commencement of any Proceeding  or  receipt of written notice of any threat
of a Proceeding which, had such  Proceeding been commenced or written notice

the consummation of the other transactions contemplated hereby  is subject to
the terms of a confidentiality agreement between Purchaser  and WRC  Media

28  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 


 

2005  (the  " _Confidentiality  Agreement_ "),  the  terms of which are
incorporated herein by reference. Effective upon, and  only  upon, the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect  to 
information relating solely to the Company and the Subsidiaries; _provided_
,  _however_ ,  that  Purchaser acknowledges that any and all other
information provided to it  by  Seller, its affiliates or their
representatives concerning Seller and its  affiliates (other than the Company
and the Subsidiaries) shall remain subject  to  the terms and conditions of
the Confidentiality Agreement after the Closing  Date.

 

 

(b)   From  and  after the Closing Date until the date that is the second
anniversary of  the  Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause its
affiliates to, keep confidential  any information relating to the Company or
any Subsidiary except for any  such  information that (i) is available to
the public on the Closing Date, (ii)  thereafter becomes available to the
public other than as a result of a  disclosure by Seller or any of its
affiliates, or (iii) is or becomes available  to Seller or any of its
affiliates on a non-confidential basis from a source  other than the Company
or any of its affiliates, provided that such source  is  not known by Seller
to bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other  obligation of secrecy
to the Company or any of its affiliates.   Should  Seller or any affiliate
thereof be required to disclose any such information  in  response to legal
or administrative process, it shall inform Purchaser  in  writing of such
request or obligation as soon as possible and, if possible,  before any
information is disclosed, so that a protective order or other  appropriate
remedy may be obtained by Purchaser. If Seller or any  affiliate thereof is
obligated to make such disclosure, it may make such  disclosure only to the
extent to which it is so obligated, but not further  or  otherwise.

 

 

 

(c)  At  the  Closing, Seller shall assign, or cause to be assigned, to
Purchaser all  confidentiality, nondisclosure or similar agreements executed
by or on behalf  of  Seller or any affiliate thereof in connection with the
possible sale of the  Company, to the extent that (A) the Company is not a
party to such  agreements and (B) such agreements are assignable to
Purchaser.

 

 

SECTION  5.04. _Commercially  Reasonable Efforts._ (a)  On  the  terms
and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each party shall use  its 
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Closing to occur, including  (i)
taking all reasonable actions necessary to comply promptly with  all  legal
requirements that may be imposed on it or any of its affiliates with  respect
to the Closing and (ii) in the case of Seller, using commercially  reasonable
efforts to cause the conditions set forth in Sections 6.01(c)  and 6.03(d) to
be satisfied.

 

 

(b)  Each  of  Seller and Purchaser shall as promptly as practicable, but
in no event later  than ten business days following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement,  file with the United States Federal Trade
Commission (the " _FTC_ ")  and  the United States Department of Justice
(the " _DOJ_ ")  the  notification and report form, if any, required for the
transactions contemplated  hereby and any supplemental information requested
in connection therewith  pursuant to the HSR Act. Any such notification and
report form and supplemental  information shall be in substantial compliance
with the requirements of the  HSR  Act. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall
furnish to the other

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such  necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may
request  in  connection with its preparation of any filing or submission
that is necessary  under the HSR Act. Seller and Purchaser shall keep each
other apprised  of the  status of any communications with, and any inquiries
or requests for additional  information from, the FTC and the DOJ and shall
comply promptly with any  such  inquiry or request and shall promptly
provide any supplemental information  requested in connection with the
filings made hereunder pursuant to the  HSR Act.  Any such supplemental
information shall be in substantial compliance with  the  requirements of
the HSR Act. Each party shall use its commercially reasonable  efforts to
obtain any clearance required under the HSR Act for the consummation  of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this  Section 
5.04, the "commercially reasonable efforts" of Purchaser shall include (i) 
opposing any motion or action for a temporary, preliminary or permanent 
injunction against the Acquisition and (ii) entering into a consent decree 
containing Purchaser's agreement to hold separate and divest (pursuant to
terms  required by any Governmental Entity) the products and assets of the
Company  and  the Subsidiaries or Purchaser and its affiliates, as the case
may be, as  required by any Governmental Entity; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that  Purchaser's obligations in such regard shall not preclude Purchaser
from seeking  in good faith to negotiate the terms of any such consent decree
so as to  minimize any adverse impact to the business of the Company or
Purchaser  or  both.

 

 

 

(c)  Purchaser  acknowledges that consents and waivers with respect to the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements may
be required  from  parties to Contracts to which the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries is a  party,  including certain of the Contracts listed on the
Disclosure Schedule or with  respect to other assets and that such consents
and waivers have not been  obtained. Purchaser agrees that Seller shall not
have any liability whatsoever  to Purchaser arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain any consents  or  waivers that may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements or because of the termination  of any  Contract as a
result thereof. Purchaser further agrees that no representation,  warranty or
covenant of Seller contained herein shall be breached or deemed  breached,
and no condition shall be deemed not satisfied, as a result of  (a) the
failure to obtain any such consent or waiver, (b) any  such  termination or
(c) any lawsuit, action, proceeding or investigation  commenced or threatened
by or on behalf of any person arising out of or relating  to the failure to
obtain any such consent or any such termination.  Notwithstanding that any
such consent is not obtained prior to the Closing,  the  Closing shall take
place on the terms set forth herein. The provisions of  this  Section 5.04
do not modify the representations and warranties contained  in  Sections
2.03 or 3.03, nor do they limit the applicability of the condition  set 
forth in Section 6.02(a).

 

 

SECTION  5.05. ___Expenses;  Transfer Taxes._ (a)  Whether  or not the
Closing takes place, and except as set forth in  Sections 5.09(b), all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with  this  Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and the transactions contemplated  hereby  and thereby shall be
paid by the party incurring such expense, including  all  costs and expenses
incurred pursuant to Sections 1.04 (except as provided  in Section 1.04(b)),
and, in the event the Closing takes place, all such  out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by the Company shall be paid or  reimbursed by Seller.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b)  All  Transfer Taxes applicable to the transfer of the Shares shall be
shared equally  by Seller and Purchaser. Each party shall use reasonable
efforts to avail  itself  of any available exemptions from any such Taxes,
and to cooperate with the  other  parties in providing any information and
documentation that may be necessary  to  obtain such exemptions.

 

 

SECTION  5.06. _Brokers  or Finders._   Each of  Purchaser and Seller
represents, as to itself and its affiliates, that no  agent,  broker,
investment banker or other firm or person is or will be entitled  to any 
broker's or finder's fee or any other commission or similar fee in
connection  with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except, as to  Seller, Goldman, Sachs and Co., whose fees and expenses will be
paid by  Seller.

 

 

SECTION  5.07. _Tax  Matters._ (a)  _Return  Filings._   For any 
taxable period of the Company or any Subsidiary that ends on or before the 
Closing Date, Seller shall be responsible for timely preparing and filing 
with  the appropriate authorities all Federal Income Tax Returns (including
amended  Returns required to be filed as a result of examination adjustments)
and  all  other Tax Returns with respect to Income Taxes for which the
Company or any  Subsidiary is a member of an Affiliated Group, each of which
shall be prepared  in a manner consistent with past practice except to the
extent required by  law,  and shall pay all Taxes due with respect to such
Tax Returns (including as  a  result of an audit or examination of any such
Tax Return). Purchaser shall  be  responsible for preparing and filing with
the appropriate authorities all  other  Tax Returns of the Company or any
Subsidiary and shall pay all Taxes due  with  respect to all other such Tax
Returns.

 

 

(b)  _Straddle  Period_.  For any  taxable period of the Company or any
Subsidiary that includes, but does not  end  on, the Closing Date (the "
_Straddle  Period_ "),  Purchaser shall timely file and prepare with the
appropriate authorities  all Tax  Returns required to be filed, with the
consultation of the Seller, and shall  pay  all Taxes due with respect to
such Tax Returns; provided, however, that Seller  shall reimburse Purchaser
for any amount owed by Seller with respect to a  Pre-Closing Tax Period
covered by such Tax Returns (as determined in accordance  with Section
9.01(d)), such reimbursement to be made by Seller to Purchaser  not  later
than five business days before the due date (including any extension 
thereof) for payment of Taxes with respect to such Tax Return (or, if later, 
five business days after receipt of a copy of such Tax Return, in final
draft  form, from Purchaser).

 

 

(c)  _Cooperation._   Seller  and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate,
and shall cause their respective  affiliates, officers, employees, agents,
auditors and representatives reasonably  to cooperate, in preparing and
filing all Tax Returns, including maintaining  and  making available to each
other all records necessary in connection with Taxes  and in resolving all
disputes and audits with respect to all taxable periods  relating to Taxes.
Seller and its affiliates, on the one hand, and Purchaser  and  its
affiliates (including the Company and the Subsidiaries), on the other 
hand,  will need access, from time to time, after the Closing Date, to
certain  accounting and Tax records and information held by the Company and
the  Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or the Seller or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

31  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  affiliates, on the other hand, to the extent such records and
information  pertain to the Company and the Subsidiaries and relate to events
occurring  prior  to the Closing Date. Therefore, each of the Seller and
Purchaser shall (or  the  Purchaser shall cause the Company and Subsidiaries
to) (i) use its reasonable  best efforts to properly retain and maintain such
records until such time  as  each party agrees that such retention and
maintenance is no longer necessary  and  (ii) allow each party and its
agents and representatives (and agents or  representatives of any of its
affiliates), at times and dates mutually  acceptable to the parties, to
inspect, review and make copies of such records  as  each party may deem
necessary or appropriate from time to time, such activities  to be conducted
during normal business hours and at the other party's expense.  Each such
party shall make its employees available on a mutually convenient  basis to
provide explanations of any documents or information provided  hereunder.

 

 

(d)  _Refunds  and Credits._   Any  refund or credit of Federal Income
Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary,  or of  any other Tax, for any
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date  shall  be for the
account of the Seller. Any other refund or credit of any other  Tax is  for
the account of the Purchaser. Following the Closing, the Company and  the 
Subsidiaries shall make an election under Section 172(b)(3) of the Code (or 
any  comparable provision under state or local laws) to forego the carryback
of  net  operating losses of the Company or the Subsidiaries to any Pre-
Closing Tax  Period.

 

 

(e)  _Tax  Sharing Agreements._   Seller  shall cause the provisions of
any Tax sharing agreement between (i) Seller  or  any of its affiliates
(other than the Company and the Subsidiaries) and (ii)  the  Company or any
Subsidiary to be terminated on or before the Closing Date.  After  the
Closing Date, no party shall have any rights or obligations under any  such 
Tax sharing agreement.

 

 

(f)  _338  Elections._   Purchaser and Seller shall not make an election
under Section 338(h)(10)  of the  Code (or any comparable election under
state or local Tax laws). Purchaser  shall  not make an election under
Section 338(g) of the Code (or any comparable  election under state or local
Tax laws).

 

 

(g)  _Closing  Date._   On the  Closing Date, and subject to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement,  Purchaser shall cause the
Company and each Subsidiary to conduct its business  in  the ordinary course
in substantially the same manner as presently conducted  and  on the Closing
Date shall not permit the Company or any Subsidiary to effect  any 
extraordinary transactions (other than any such transactions expressly
required  by Applicable Law or expressly contemplated by this Agreement) that
could  result  in Tax liability to the Company or any Subsidiary in excess
of Tax liability  associated with the conduct of its business in the ordinary
course.

 

 

SECTION  5.08. _Supplemental  Disclosure._   Seller  shall have the
continuing obligation until the Closing promptly to supplement  or  amend
the Schedules with respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered 
that, if existing or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been 
required to be set forth or described in the Schedules; _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  that  for the purpose of the rights and obligations of the
parties under this  Agreement (including satisfaction of the condition set
forth in Section 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6.02(a)),  any such supplemental or amended Schedule shall not be deemed to
have been  disclosed as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing
Date unless  so  agreed in writing by Purchaser.

 

 

SECTION  5.09. _Post-Closing  Cooperation._ (a)  After  the Closing,
upon reasonable written notice, Seller and Purchaser shall  (i) furnish or
cause to be furnished to each other and their affiliates  and  their
respective employees, counsel, auditors and representatives access,  during 
normal business hours, to such information and assistance relating to the 
Company and the Subsidiaries (to the extent within the control of such
party)  as  is reasonably necessary for financial reporting and accounting
matters, (ii)  cooperate in good faith and use commercially reasonable
efforts to effect  the  transition of customers, suppliers and owners of
Intellectual Property used  by  or licensed to the Company or any Subsidiary
(it being understood that Seller  maintains little, if any, relationship with
such customers, suppliers and  owners  of Intellectual Property), (iii)
cooperate in good faith and use commercially  reasonable efforts to provide
to Purchaser and the Company the benefits of  the  indemnity respecting
environmental matters set forth in that certain Redemption,  Stock Purchase
and Recapitalization Agreement dated as of August 13, 1999  between PRIMEDIA
Inc. and WRC Media Inc. (then known as EAC II Inc.), and  (iv) execute and
deliver to such other party such other instruments  of  sale, transfer,
conveyance, assignment and confirmation, and take such other  actions, as may
be reasonably requested by the other party in furtherance  of the 
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

(b)  Each  party shall reimburse the other for reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses  incurred in assisting the other pursuant to this Section
5.09. Neither  party shall be required by this Section 5.09 to take any
action that  would  unreasonably interfere with the conduct of its business
or unreasonably disrupt  its normal operations (or, in the case of Purchaser,
those of the Company  and  the Subsidiaries).

 

 

SECTION  5.10. _Publicity._   From the  date hereof through the Closing
Date, no public release or announcement  concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party  without the prior consent
of the other party (which consent shall not be  unreasonably withheld),
except as such release or announcement may be required  by law or the rules
or regulations of any securities exchange, in which case  the  party
required to make the release or announcement shall allow the other  party 
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of 
such  issuance; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  each of Seller and
Purchaser may make internal announcements to their  respective, and their
respective affiliates', employees that are consistent with  the parties'
prior public disclosures regarding the transactions contemplated  hereby.

 

 

SECTION  5.11. _Records._   On the  Closing Date, Seller shall deliver or
cause to be delivered to Purchaser  all  material agreements, documents,
books, records and files, including records  and  files stored on computer
disks or tapes or any other storage medium  (collectively, " _Records_ "),

affiliates (other than the Company and the Subsidiaries)  provide the Company
and the Subsidiaries with certain support services,  including cash
management, credit and accounts receivable, payroll and human  resources,
legal, tax and benefit plan administration. Purchaser acknowledges  that all
such support services will be terminated as of the Closing Date.  The

Subsidiaries) with certain support services that will continue to be
provided  following the Closing Date pursuant to the Transitional Services
Agreement  between Seller and the Company to be dated as of the Closing Date

or  person's consolidated annual revenues and (B) such acquisition is not
undertaken  for the primary purpose of evading Seller's obligations under
this Section  5.13(a), or (ii) owning less than 5% of any class of stock of a
person  engaged, directly or indirectly, in the Restricted Business in the
United  States  and (y) upon and after the consummation of any disposition
of all  or  substantially all the assets or capital stock of Seller Parent,
any of its  subsidiaries or any of their businesses to an unaffiliated third
party, this  Section 5.13(a) shall not apply to, restrict or have any
remaining  effect  with respect to Seller Parent (if disposed of pursuant to
such disposition),  such subsidiary or such business, _provided_   that 
following such disposition none of Paul Liska, Ralph D. Caulo or Charles 
L.  Laurey are employed by the acquirer of, or by, Seller Parent (if
disposed  of  pursuant to such disposition), such subsidiary or such
business.

(d)  The  parties hereto recognize that Applicable Laws and public policies
of various  jurisdictions may differ as to the validity and enforceability of
covenants  similar to those set forth in this Section 5.13. It is the
intention of the  parties hereto that the provisions of this Section 5.13 be
enforced to the  fullest extent permissible under Applicable Laws and
policies of each  jurisdiction in which enforcement may be sought, and that
the unenforceability  (or the modification to conform to such laws or
policies) of any provisions  of  this Section 5.13 shall not render
unenforceable, or impair, the remainder  of  the provisions of this Section
5.13. Accordingly, if at the time of enforcement  of any provision of this

ARTICLE  VII

 

 

_Employee  and Related Matters_

 

 

SECTION  7.01. _Continuation  of Employment; General Principles_.  There 
shall be continuity of employment for all employees of the Company or any 
Subsidiary as of the Closing (each, a " _Transferred  Employee_ "), 
including, for greater certainty, any employees then on short-term
disability  or  otherwise on a leave of absence but excluding any such
employee who is receiving  long-term disability benefits immediately prior to
the Closing (" _LTD  Employee_ ");  provided, however, that Purchaser shall
cause the Company or its Subsidiaries  to  offer to re-employ any LTD
Employee effective as of the date he or she presents  himself or herself to
Purchaser or its subsidiaries for active employment  following the Closing
Date to the same extent the Company and its Subsidiaries  would be required
in accordance with Applicable Law to re-employ such LTD  Employee prior to
the Closing. Upon an LTD Employee's commencing employment with  the Company
or its Subsidiaries following the Closing, such LTD

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Employee  shall be deemed a Transferred Employee. Except as otherwise
provided in this  Article VII, all Transferred Employees shall cease to
accrue benefits  under  and participate as active participants in all Seller
Benefit Plans as of  11:59  PM on the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date and the Company and  each  Subsidiary shall withdraw as participating
employers from each Seller Benefit  Plan as of 11:59 PM on the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date. Nothing  herein shall be construed as
a representation or guarantee by Seller that  any  individual employee of
the Company or any Subsidiary will continue in employment  with the Company,
any Subsidiary or Purchaser following the Closing. Nothing  in  this Article
VII shall be construed as requiring Purchaser to continue  the  employment
of any specific person.

 

 

SECTION  7.02. _Assumption  of Liabilities._   Except  as specifically
provided in this Agreement, effective as of the Closing,  Purchaser shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to remain solely  responsible for all
employment and employee benefit-related liabilities,  obligations and
commitments that are payable from or after the Closing,  regardless or
whether such liabilities, obligations and commitments arise  before, on or
after the Closing Date, and that relate to any current or former  employee of
the Company or any Subsidiary (or any dependent or beneficiary  thereof) (the
" _Covered  Employee Liabilities_ "),  provided that Seller shall retain,
and the Covered Employee Liabilities shall  not include, employee benefit-
related liabilities and obligations arising  under  any Plan that is not a
Company Benefit Plan, except (a) as provided  in  Sections 7.05, 7.06(b),
7.06(d), 7.06(f), 7.08 or 7.09 or (b) as  otherwise expressly provided in
this Article VII (such liabilities  and  obligations retained by Seller, the
" _Seller  Plan Liabilities_ ").

 

 

SECTION  7.03. _Credited  Service._   Purchaser shall credit or cause to
be credited, as service with Purchaser  or its  affiliates, service accrued
by Transferred Employees with, or otherwise  recognized for benefit plan
purposes by, Seller, the Company and their  subsidiaries and affiliates as of
the Closing (the " _Pre-Closing  Service_ ")  for  all purposes (other than
for benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit  pension plan of
Purchaser or its subsidiaries and affiliates) under the benefit  plans,
programs, policies and arrangements (including under any applicable  pension,
401(k), savings, medical, dental, life insurance, vacation and  insurance,
severance or separation pay plans) of Purchaser and its subsidiaries  and
affiliates, provided that Purchaser shall also give or cause to be given 
credit for Pre-Closing Service for benefit accrual purposes under any
defined  benefit pension plan that is a Company Benefit Plan or any plan to
which  accrued  benefits under any such Company Benefit Plan are transferred
(it being  understood that nothing in this Section 7.03 shall require
Purchaser  or its  affiliates to continue to maintain any such defined
benefit pension plan  or to  offer any post-employment health and insurance
plan to Transferred  Employees).

 

 

SECTION  7.04. _Continuation  of Compensation and Benefits._   Without 
limiting the generality of Section 7.01, for not less than the period
commencing  on the Closing Date and ending December 31, 2006 (the "
_Continuation  Period_ "),  Purchaser shall maintain and provide, and, where
applicable, shall cause  the  Company and the Subsidiaries to maintain and
provide: (i) a base salary  to  each Transferred Employee at a rate not less
than the rate in effect for  such  Transferred Employee immediately prior to

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Closing; (ii) subject to Section 7.08, bonus and other incentive 
compensation opportunities to each Transferred Employee that are no less 
favorable in the aggregate than those provided to similarly situated
employees  of Purchaser and its subsidiaries; (iii) employee benefits to
each  Transferred Employee that are no less favorable in the aggregate than
those  provided to such Transferred Employee immediately prior to the
Closing, without  regard to any defined benefit pension benefits provided
prior to the Closing,  and (iv) equity or equity-based rights to each
Transferred Employee  that  are no less favorable in the aggregate than
those provided to similarly situated  employees of Purchaser and its
subsidiaries. The preceding sentence shall  apply  to each Transferred
Employee only for so long as he or she remains employed  with  Purchaser or
its affiliates.

 

 

SECTION  7.05. _U.S.  Savings and Investment Plan._ (a)  Without 
limiting the generality of Section 7.04, effective as of the Closing,
Purchaser  or an affiliate thereof shall have in effect a profit-sharing plan
that includes  a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of
Section 401(k)  of  the Code (the " _Purchaser 's  401(k) Plan_") 
intended to be qualified pursuant to Section 401(a) of the Code, which will 
provide during the Continuation Period a matching contribution rate to 
Transferred Employees who immediately prior to the Closing are participants 
or  who would be permitted during the Continuation Period to become
participants  in  Seller's 401(k) Plan that, subject to Applicable Law, is
at least as favorable  as the matching contribution rate provided by Seller's
401(k) Plan immediately  prior to the Closing. Each Transferred Employee
participating in Seller's 401(k)  Plan immediately prior to the Closing shall
become a participant in the  Purchaser's 401(k) Plan as of the Closing and
each Transferred Employee who  would have become eligible during the
Continuation Period to participate  in  Seller's 401(k) Plan shall become a
participant in Purchaser's 401(k) Plan at  such time as he or she would have
become eligible to participate in Seller's  401(k) Plan.

 

 

(b)  Upon  presentation to Seller of (i) an Internal Revenue Service letter
of  determination that Purchaser's 401(k) Plan meets the requirements for 
qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code and (ii) a certificate,  in 
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller, certifying that  (A)
the aforementioned letter of determination has not been revoked  and  (B) to
the knowledge of Purchaser, no event has occurred or is reasonably  expected
to occur that would cause Purchaser's 401(k) Plan to cease to satisfy  the
requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code or cause the trust  forming a 
part thereof to cease to satisfy the requirements of Section 501(a) of the 
Code,  as soon as practicable after the Closing, Seller shall cause to be
transferred  to Purchaser's 401(k) Plan an amount equal to the account
balances of the  Transferred Employees, whether or not vested. Such transfer
shall be made  in  cash, based on the value of such account balance as of
the close of business  on  the day prior to such transfer, except that
promissory notes evidencing  outstanding loan balances under Seller's 401(k)
Plan shall be transferred in  kind. Seller shall debit the account of each
Transferred Employee under Seller's  401(k) Plan by the amount transferred to
Purchaser's 401(k) Plan, and Purchaser  shall allocate the amounts
transferred to Purchaser's 401(k) Plan to the  accounts of the Transferred
Employees by crediting such accounts in relative  proportion to the amount
debited from the Transferred Employee's accounts under  Seller's 401(k) Plan.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c)  Following  such transfer, Purchaser and/or Purchaser's 401(k) Plan
shall assume all  liabilities and obligations of Seller and its subsidiaries
and affiliates  under  Seller's 401(k) Plan with respect to Transferred
Employees and their  beneficiaries, to the extent assets equal to such
liabilities are so  transferred.

 

 

SECTION  7.06. _Welfare  Plans._ (a)  Without  limiting the generality
of Section 7.04, effective as of the Closing, Purchaser  shall enroll each of
the Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents  who  are enrolled
immediately prior to the Closing in the plans and programs  maintained or
contributed to by Seller and its affiliates that provide medical,  dental,
vision, disability, life insurance and other welfare benefits with  respect
to Transferred Employees (collectively, the " _Seller 's  Welfare Plans_") 
in  plans and programs that provide such benefits that are maintained or
contributed  to by Purchaser (collectively, the " _Purchaser 's  Welfare
Plans_").  Any  and all waiting periods and pre-existing conditions,
exclusions and  actively-at-work requirements shall be waived under
Purchaser's Welfare Plans  with respect to the Transferred Employees and
their eligible dependents (to  the  extent such conditions, exclusions and
requirements were waived or satisfied  as  of immediately prior to the
Closing under the corresponding Seller's Welfare  Plan). In addition,
Purchaser shall cause Purchaser's Welfare Plans to recognize  any out-of-
pocket medical and dental expenses incurred by each of the  Transferred
Employees and their eligible dependents prior to the Closing  and  during
the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs for purposes of 
satisfying any applicable deductibles and out-of-pockets maximums under 
Purchaser's Welfare Plans. During the Continuation Period, the participation 
cost to a Transferred Employee under Purchaser's Welfare Plans shall be not
more  than the participation cost to similarly situated employees of
Purchaser  and its  subsidiaries and affiliates.

 

 

(b)  Without  limiting the generality of Section 7.04, effective as of the
Closing, Purchaser  shall have in effect a health care and dependent care
flexible spending  reimbursement account plan (the " _Purchaser 's 
Reimbursement Plan_"),  which  gives full effect to, and continues in
effect, salary reduction elections  made  by Transferred Employees under
Seller's health and dependent care reimbursement  account plans (" _Seller
's  Reimbursement Plan_").  As  soon as practicable after the Closing, (i)
Seller shall pay to Purchaser  in  cash the amount, if any, by which
aggregate contributions made by Transferred  Employees to Seller's
Reimbursement Plan for the year in which the Closing  occurs exceeded the
aggregate benefits provided to Transferred Employees  as of  the Closing; or
(ii) Purchaser shall pay to Seller in cash the amount,  if  any, by which
aggregate benefits provided to Transferred Employees under  Seller's
Reimbursement Plan for the year in which the Closing occurs exceeded  the
aggregate contributions made by Transferred Employees as of the Closing. 
From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall assume and be solely responsible 
for  all claims made by Transferred Employees under Seller's Reimbursement
Plan,  whether incurred prior to, on or after the Closing Date, that have not
been  paid  in full prior to the Closing Date.

 

 

(c)  Effective  as of the Closing, Seller or an affiliate thereof shall
retain all  responsibilities and obligations with respect to (i) each
"qualified  beneficiary" (as defined in Section 607 of ERISA) in respect of
a  Transferred Employee who has elected or is eligible to elect
continuation  coverage as such term is defined under Section 602 of

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ERISA  in  respect of "qualifying events" (as defined in Section 603 of
ERISA)  occurring prior to the Closing and (ii) each former employee of the 
Company  and the Subsidiaries (other than Transferred Employees) and his or
her qualified  beneficiaries.

 

 

(d)  For  the  avoidance of doubt, Purchaser and its affiliates shall
remain solely liable  for  all liabilities, obligations and commitments with
respect to the provision  of  short-term disability benefits in respect of
Transferred Employees attributable  to an injury or similar event that
occurred prior to Closing; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that,  in the event
any such Transferred Employee does not return to active employment  with
Purchaser and its affiliates and would otherwise be eligible to receive 
long-term disability benefits under the terms of a Seller Benefit Plan had 
he or  she remained employed by Seller or its affiliates attributable to any
such  injury or similar event that occurred prior to Closing, Seller shall
retain  the  liability to provide such long-term disability benefits to such
Transferred  Employee from and after such time, if any, as such Transferred
Employee in  fact  becomes eligible to commence receiving such long-term
disability  benefits.

 

 

(e)  Seller  shall remain solely liable for all liabilities, obligations
and commitments  with  respect to all workers compensation claims of
Transferred Employees solely  to  the extent that any such claims are
attributable to an injury or condition  that  was incurred prior to Closing,
and Purchaser shall assume and be solely liable  for all liabilities,
obligations and commitments with respect to all workers  compensation claims
of Transferred Employees to the extent that any such  claims  are
attributable to an injury or condition that was incurred from and after 
Closing.

 

 

(f)  Seller  shall be solely responsible for claims under Seller Benefit
Plans for health  care (including dental and vision care) that are incurred
prior to the Closing  Date by Transferred Employees and/or their dependents
(" _Pre-Closing  Health Care Claims_ "),  and  Purchaser shall be solely
responsible for claims for health care (including  dental and vision care)
that are incurred on or after the Closing Date by  Transferred Employees
and/or their dependents; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  Purchaser shall,
within 15 Business Days of demand therefor by Seller  accompanied by a
statement specifying in reasonable detail the claims for  which 
reimbursement is sought, reimburse and pay to Seller the amount of Pre-
Closing  Health Care Claims paid by Seller following the Closing; _provided 
further_ ,  _however_ ,  that  Purchaser shall not be obligated to
reimburse Seller for Pre-Closing Health  Care  Claims in excess of
$1,100,000 in the aggregate. For purposes of the foregoing,  a
medical/dental/vision claim shall be considered incurred when the 
medical/dental/vision services are rendered or medical/dental/vision
supplies  or  drugs are provided, and not when the condition arose;
_provided_   that  claims relating to a hospital confinement that commences
prior to the Closing  Date and continues thereafter shall be treated as
incurred prior to the Closing  Date. From the date hereof until Closing,
Seller shall cause Pre-Closing  Health  Care Claims to be processed and paid
in the usual, regular and ordinary course  in substantially the same manner
as previously conducted.

 

 

SECTION  7.07. _Severance  Policies._   Without  limiting the generality
of Section 7.04, Purchaser shall cause the Company  and  its Subsidiaries to
retain and maintain without amendment for the benefit  of  Transferred
Employees who are

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terminated  from employment during the Continuation Period the Company's
Change of Control  Severance Plan (a correct and complete copy of which has
been provided to  Purchaser) as in effect immediately prior to the Closing.

 

 

SECTION  7.08. _Performance  Bonuses._   Purchaser shall assume
responsibility with respect to, and shall make any  and  all payments
required to be made to Transferred Employees pursuant to, the  WRC  Media
Inc. Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (the " _Seller 's  Incentive
Plan_")  (a  correct and complete copy of which has been provided to
Purchaser) that relate  to performance periods in which the Closing Date
occurs and that end on or  before December 31, 2005. Purchaser agrees to
calculate and make such  payments pursuant to the terms and conditions of
Seller's Incentive Plan and on  or before March 31, 2006. With respect to the
Seller's Incentive Plan for  the 2005 calendar year, (i) following the
Closing, any requirement that a  Transferred Employee remain employed with
Seller and its affiliates as of  December 31, 2005 in order to receive any
applicable bonus or similar payment  shall be replaced with a requirement
that the Transferred Employee remain  employed with Purchaser and its
affiliates as of December 31, 2005 in order  to  receive any applicable
bonus or similar payment and (ii) with respect to  the  2005 calendar year
any applicable performance criteria that relate to the  performance of Seller
or any subsidiary, division, business unit or other  measuring grouping other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries shall receive  a  weighting of 0% (and
thus be disregarded), and the performance criteria that  relate to the
performance of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be weighted  100%.

 

 

SECTION  7.09. _Vacation  Benefits._   Purchaser shall cause the Company
and the Subsidiaries to assume and honor,  and  permit the Transferred
Employees to fully utilize, all vacation days accrued  but  not yet taken by
Transferred Employees as of the Closing, including historical  accruals of
vacation under the policy set forth in Schedule 7.09.

 

 

SECTION  7.10. _Employment  and Other Agreements._   Effective as of the
Closing, Purchaser shall cause the Company or the  Subsidiaries to remain
solely responsible for all liabilities and obligations  with respect to all
employment agreements and supplemental benefit agreements  which have been
entered into between a Transferred Employee, on the one hand,  and the
Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates, on the other  hand.

 

 

SECTION  7.11. _Retention  Arrangements._   Purchaser shall cause the
Company and the Subsidiaries to retain sole  responsibility for and honor
without amendment the terms of the Company's  retention program (the "
_Retention  Program_ ")  (a  correct and complete copy of which has been
provided to Purchaser) as in  effect  immediately prior to the Closing.

 

 

SECTION  7.12. _No  Third-Party Beneficiaries._   This  Article VII is
for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted  assigns and
nothing in this Article VII expressed or implied shall  give or  be
construed to give to any person (including any current or former employee), 
other than the parties hereto and such assigns, any legal or equitable
rights  hereunder.

ARTICLE  VIII

 

 

_Termination,  Amendment and Waiver_

 

 

SECTION  8.01. _Termination_.  (a)  Notwithstanding  anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated  and  the
Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement 
abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:

 

 

(i)  by  mutual  written consent of Seller and Purchaser;

 

 

(ii)  by  Seller  if any of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.01 or
6.03 shall  have  become incapable of fulfillment, and shall not have been
waived by  Seller;

 

 

(iii)  by  Purchaser if any of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.01 or
6.02 shall  have  become incapable of fulfillment, and shall not have been
waived by Purchaser;  or

 

 

(iv)  by  Seller  or Purchaser, if the Closing does not occur on or prior
to July 31,  2005;

 

 

_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the party seeking termination pursuant to
clause (ii), (iii) or (iv)  is not  then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants  or  agreements contained in this
Agreement.

 

 

(b)  In  the  event of termination by Seller or Purchaser pursuant to this
Section 8.01,  written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other
and the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be terminated,
without  further  action by any party. If the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are  terminated as provided herein:

 

 

(i)  Purchaser  shall return all documents and other material received from
Seller or the  Company relating to the transactions contemplated hereby,
whether so obtained  before or after the execution hereof, to Seller; and

 

 

(ii)  all  confidential information received by Purchaser with respect to
the business  of  the Company and the Subsidiaries shall be treated in
accordance with the  Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full
force and effect  notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.

 

 

SECTION  8.02. _Effect  of Termination_.  If this  Agreement is
terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby are abandoned  as
described in Section 8.01, this Agreement shall become null and  void and 
of no further force and effect, except for the provisions of  (i) Section
5.03(a) relating to the obligation of Purchaser  to keep  confidential

certain  expenses, (iii) Section 5.06 relating to finder's fees and broker's
fees,  (iv) Section 5.10 relating to publicity and (v) Section 8.01  and
this Section 8.02. Nothing in this Section 8.02 shall be deemed  to  release
any party from any liability for any breach by such party of the  terms  and
provisions of this Agreement or to impair the right of any party to compel 
specific performance by any other party of its obligations under this 
Agreement.

 

 

SECTION  8.03. _Amendments  and Waivers._   This  Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on  behalf  of each of the
parties hereto. By an instrument in writing Purchaser, on  the one  hand, or
Seller, on the other hand, may waive compliance by the other with  any  term
or provision of this Agreement that such other party was or is obligated 
to  comply with or perform.

 

 

ARTICLE  IX

 

 

_Indemnification_

 

 

SECTION  9.01. _Tax  Indemnification._ (a)  Seller  shall indemnify the
Purchaser Indemnitees against and hold them harmless  from  any Losses
attributable to Income Taxes (i) imposed on Seller or any other  member of an
Affiliated Group, other than the Company or any Subsidiary,  for any  Tax
period, (ii) imposed on the Company or any Subsidiary under Treasury 
Regulation 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, foreign or 
other  law) by reason of the Company or any Subsidiaries being included in
any  affiliated group at any time on or before the Closing Date, (iii)
imposed  on or  payable by the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to any
Tax period or  portion thereof that ends on or before the Closing Date or
(iv) for  any  Straddle Period but only for that portion of the Straddle
Period relating  to the  Pre-Closing Tax Period as computed in accordance
with Section 9.01(d).  Payment by Seller of any amount due to a Purchaser
Indemnitee under this  Section  9.01(a) (other than payments the timing of
which is provided for under Section  5.07(b)) shall be made within twenty
days following written notice by the  Indemnified Party that payment of such
amounts to the appropriate Tax Authority  is due by the Indemnified Party;
provided, that Seller shall not be required  to  make any payment earlier
than two business days before it is due to the  appropriate Taxing Authority.
In the case of a Tax that is contested in  accordance with the provisions of
Section 9.03(c), payment of the Tax to  the  appropriate Tax Authority will
not be considered to be due earlier than the  date  that a final
determination to such effect is made by such Taxing Authority  or a  court
or liability for such Tax is otherwise conclusively settled or  compromised.

 

 

(b)  Seller  shall indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees against and hold
them harmless  from  any Losses attributable to withholding or employment
Taxes with respect to  wages  (including resulting from the erroneous
classification of an employee as  an  independent contractor) for any Tax
period or portion thereof that ends on  or  before the Closing Date,
provided that this paragraph (b) shall only apply  to  the extent that such
Taxes exceed in the aggregate $100,000 after which Seller  shall be liable
for all Losses in excess of such amount.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c)  Purchaser  shall indemnify the Seller Indemnitees against and hold
them harmless from  any  Losses attributable to: (i) all liability for Taxes
of the Company and the  Subsidiaries for any taxable period ending after the
Closing Date (except  to the  extent such taxable period began before the
Closing Date, in which case the  indemnity under this Section 9.01(c) shall
cover only that portion of any  such  Taxes that are not for the Pre-Closing
Tax Period, as computed in accordance  with Section 9.01(d)) and (ii) all
liability for Taxes attributable  to  any action taken after the Closing on
the Closing Date outside of the ordinary  course of business by Purchaser,
any of its affiliates (including the Company  or  any Subsidiary), or any
transferee of Purchaser or any of its affiliates  (other  than expressly
required by applicable law or by this Agreement).

 

 

(d)  _Straddle  Period._   In the  case of any Straddle Period, (i) real,
personal and intangible property Taxes  (" _Property  Taxes_ ")  of the 
Company and Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be allocated 
to  the Pre-Closing Tax Period on a pro rata daily basis, and (ii) the
Taxes  of the  Company and Subsidiaries (other than Property Taxes) for the
Pre-Closing  Tax  Period shall be computed as if such taxable period ended
as of the close  of  business on the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date.

 

 

SECTION  9.02. _Other  Indemnification._ (a)  Seller  shall indemnify
Purchaser and its affiliates, shareholders and subsidiaries  (including,
following the Closing, the Company and the Subsidiaries) and  their 
respective officers, directors, employees and agents (collectively the "
_Purchaser  Indemnitees_ ")  against and hold them harmless from any and all
damages, fines, fees, penalties,  deficiencies, losses and expenses,
including all interest, court costs and  reasonable fees and expenses of
attorneys, accountants and other experts  and  other expenses of litigation
or other proceedings or of any claim, default  or  assessment or pursuit of
rights to indemnification (collectively, " _Losses_ "),  suffered, incurred
or sustained by any of them or to which any of them becomes  subject, to the
extent resulting from, arising out of or relating to  (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty of Seller contained  in  this Agreement, (ii) any
breach of any covenant or agreement of Seller  contained in this Agreement,
(iii) any employee benefit obligations  retained by Seller or any of its
affiliates (other than the Company and the  Subsidiaries) pursuant to Article
VII and (iv) the failure of the  Shares to  be validly issued and
outstanding as of the Closing Date.

 

 

(b)  Purchaser  shall indemnify Seller and its affiliates, shareholders and
subsidiaries  and  their respective officers, directors, employees and
agents (collectively,  the " _Seller  Indemnitees_ ")  against and hold
them harmless from any and all Losses suffered, incurred  or  sustained by
any of them or to which any of them becomes subject, to the  extent 
resulting from, arising out of or relating to (i) any breach of any 
representation of Purchaser contained in this Agreement, (ii) any  breach
of  any covenant or agreement of Purchaser contained in this Agreement and 
(iii) any employee benefit obligations assumed or retained by Purchaser  or 
required to be assumed or retained by the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant 
to  Article VII.

 

 

SECTION  9.03. _Indemnification  Procedures._ (a)  _Procedures  Relating
to Indemnification of Third Party Claims_.  If any  party (the "
_Indemnified  Party_ ")  receives written notice of the commencement of any
action or proceeding or  the  assertion of any

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  by  a third party or the imposition of any penalty or assessment (in
each case  other  than with respect to Taxes) for which indemnity may be
sought under  Section 9.02 (a " _Third  Party Claim_ ")  or  such
Indemnified Party has a reasonable basis to believe that there are grounds 
for a Third Party Claim to be asserted against it, and such Indemnified
Party  intends to seek indemnity pursuant to this Article IX, the
Indemnified  Party shall promptly provide the other party (the "
_Indemnifying  Party_ ")  with  written notice of such Third Party Claim,
stating the nature, basis and the  amount thereof, to the extent known, along
with copies of any relevant documents  evidencing such Third Party Claim and
the basis for indemnification sought.  Failure of the Indemnified Party to
give such notice will not relieve the  Indemnifying Party from liability on
account of this indemnification, except  if  and to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby.  The Indemnifying Party
will have 60 days from receipt of any such notice  of a  Third Party Claim
to give notice to assume the defense thereof. If notice  to the  effect set
forth in the immediately preceding sentence is given by the  Indemnifying
Party, the Indemnifying Party will have the right to assume  the  defense of
the Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel  of  its
choice. At any time prior to the Indemnifying Party's delivery of any notice 
to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may file 
any  motion, answer or other pleadings or take any other action that the
Indemnified  Party reasonably believes to be necessary or appropriate to
avoid a default  judgment. So long as the Indemnifying Party has assumed the
defense of the  Third  Party Claim in accordance herewith, (i) the
Indemnified Party may  retain  separate co-counsel at its sole cost and
expense and participate in the defense  of the Third Party Claim, (ii) the
Indemnified Party will not file  any  papers or consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement  with  respect to the Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the  Indemnifying Party and (iii)
the Indemnifying Party will not (A) admit  to any wrongdoing or (B) consent
to the entry of any judgment or enter  into  any settlement with respect to
the Third Party Claim, in each case, without  the  prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be  unreasonably withheld or
delayed). The parties will use their commercially  reasonable efforts to
minimize Losses from Third Party Claims and will act  in  good faith in
responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise dealing  with such
claims. The parties will also cooperate in any such defense and  give  each
other reasonable access to all information relevant thereto. Whether  or
not  the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense, such Indemnifying Party
will  not  be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder for any
settlement  entered into or any judgment that was consented to without the
Indemnifying  Party's prior written consent.

 

 

(b)  _Procedures  for Non-Third Party Claims._   The  Indemnified Party
will notify the Indemnifying Party in writing promptly  of its  discovery of
any matter that does not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted  against
or sought to be collected from the Indemnified Party, giving rise  to the 
claim of indemnity pursuant hereto. The failure so to notify the
Indemnifying  Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability
on account  of this  indemnification, except only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is  actually prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party
will have 60 days from  receipt of any such notice to give notice of dispute
of the claim to the  Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party will reasonably
cooperate and assist  the Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of
any claim for indemnity  by  the Indemnified Party and in

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise  resolving such matters. Such assistance and cooperation will
include providing  reasonable access to and copies of information, records
and documents relating  to such matters, furnishing employees to assist in
the investigation, defense  and resolution of such matters and providing
legal and business assistance  with  respect to such matters.

 

 

(c)  _Procedures  Relating to Indemnification of Tax Claims._ (i)  If 
one  party is responsible for the payment of Taxes pursuant to Sections 9.01
or  9.02  of this Agreement (the " _Tax  Indemnifying Party_ "),  and 
the other party to this Agreement (the " _Tax  Indemnified Party_ ") 
receives a notice of deficiency, proposed adjustment, adjustment,
assessment,  audit, examination, suit, dispute or other claim (a " _Tax 
Claim_ ")  with  respect (in whole or in part) to such Taxes, the Tax
Indemnified Party shall  promptly notify the Tax Indemnifying Party in
writing of such Tax Claim.  No  failure or delay on the part of the Tax
Indemnified Party to give notice  to the  Tax Indemnifying Party shall
reduce or otherwise affect the obligations or  liabilities of the Tax
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement, except  to  the extent that
such failure or delay shall have adversely affected the Tax  Indemnifying
Party's ability to defend against any liability or claim for Taxes  that the
Tax Indemnifying Party is obligated to pay hereunder.

 

 

(ii)  The  Tax  Indemnifying Party shall assume and control the applicable
audit or examination  and the defense of a Tax Claim involving any Taxes for
which it has an  obligation to indemnify the Tax Indemnified Party pursuant
to Sections 9.01  or  9.02 of this Agreement. The preceding sentence shall
not apply to the extent  the  Tax Indemnifying Party has potential liability
of less than 50% of the total  potential liability of such Tax Claim. The
party controlling the applicable  audit or examination and the defense of the
Tax Claim shall be referred to  herein as the "Controlling Party" and the
other party shall be referred to  herein as the "Non-Controlling Party." The
Non-Controlling Party and its  affiliates agree to cooperate with the
Controlling Party in pursuing such  contest, including execution of any
powers of attorney in favor of the  Controlling Party. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary,  the Controlling Party shall keep
the Non-Controlling Party informed of all  material developments and events
relating to such Tax Claim and the  Non-Controlling Party, at its own cost
and expense and with its own counsel,  shall have the right to participate in
(but not control) the applicable audit  or  examination and defense of such
Tax Claim. The Controlling Party shall not  settle or otherwise compromise
any Tax Claim if such settlement or compromise  could reasonably be expected
to have the effect of materially increasing  the Tax  liability of the Non-
Controlling Party without the consent of the  Non-Controlling Party, such
consent not to be unreasonably  withheld.

 

 

If  Controlling Party elects not to assume and control the applicable audit
or  examination and the defense of a Tax Claim, the Non-Controlling Party
may  pursue  contest of or settle or otherwise compromise such Tax Claim, at
Controlling  Party's sole expense.

 

 

Notwithstanding  the foregoing, in no case shall any Non-Controlling Party
settle or otherwise  compromise (or extend the statute of limitations for)
any Tax Claim without  the  Controlling Party's prior written consent.
Further, in no case shall any Tax  Indemnified Party settle or otherwise
compromise (or extend the statute of  limitations

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for)  any  Tax Claim for which the Tax Indemnifying Party will have an
obligation to  indemnify without the Tax Indemnifying Party's prior written
consent. Neither  party shall settle a Tax Claim relating solely to Income
Taxes of the  Non-Controlling Party or any of its subsidiaries for a Straddle
Period without  the other party's prior written consent.

 

 

Whether  or not the Non-Controlling Party chooses to participate in the
defense of  any  Tax Claim, all of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the
defense  thereof.

 

 

SECTION  9.04. _Limitations  on Indemnification._ (a)  The  aggregate
liability of Seller pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) of  Section 9.02(a) (in
the case of clause (ii) of Section 9.02(a),  only with respect to breaches of
covenants or agreements contained in Sections  5.01, 5.02 or 5.04 that occur
prior to the Closing) and the aggregate liability  of Purchaser pursuant to
clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 9.02(b)  (in the case of clause (ii) of
Section 9.02(b), only with respect  to  breaches of covenants or agreements
contained in Sections 5.01, 5.02 or 5.04  that occur prior to Closing) (such
clauses of Sections 9.02(a) and  9.02(b)  as so qualified in the case of
clause (ii) of each such Section,  collectively, the " _Limited  Indemnity
Provisions_ ")  for  claims for indemnification asserted in a notice
delivered pursuant to Section  9.03

 

 

(i)  prior  to  the date that is six months after the Closing Date, shall
not exceed 20%  of the  Purchase Price,

 

 

(ii)  on  or  after the date that is six months after the Closing Date and
prior to the  date  that is nine months after the Closing Date, shall not
exceed, taken together  with the aggregate liability of such party pursuant
to the Limited Indemnity  Provisions for claims asserted in notices delivered
prior to the date that  is  six months after the Closing Date, 10% of the
Purchase Price, and

 

 

(iii)  on  or  after the date that is nine months after the Closing Date
and prior to the  date  that is twelve months after the Closing Date (or, in
the case of a claim  with  respect to a breach of any representation and
warranty contained in  Section 3.10, prior to the date that is 60 days
following the  expiration of the applicable statute of limitations), shall
not exceed, taken  together with the aggregate liability of such party
pursuant to the Limited  Indemnity Provisions for claims asserted in notices
delivered prior to the  date  that is nine months after the Closing Date, 5%
of the Purchase  Price;

 

 

_provided_ ,  _further_ ,  that in  no event shall the aggregate liability
of Seller or Purchaser for claims  for  indemnification pursuant to the
Limited Indemnity Provisions exceed 20% of  the  Purchase Price no matter
when the notices asserting the claims therefor are  delivered. For purposes
of determining the limitation under the foregoing  sentence applicable to any
claim for indemnification, a notice of such claim  shall not be deemed
delivered unless such notice states in reasonable detail  the  basis of such
claim.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b)  Neither  Seller nor Purchaser shall have any liability for any claim
for indemnification  pursuant to the Limited Indemnity Provisions unless such
claim is asserted  in a  notice (stating in reasonable detail the basis of
such claim) delivered pursuant  to Section 9.03 prior to the date that is
twelve months after the  Closing  Date or, in the case of a claim with
respect to a breach of any representation  and warranty contained in Section
3.10, prior to the date that is  60 days  following the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations. Seller  shall  not have any liability for
any claim for indemnification pursuant to clause  (iv)  of Section 9.02(a)
unless such claim is asserted in a notice (stating in  reasonable detail the
basis of such claim) delivered pursuant to  Section 9.03 prior to the date
that is sixty months after the Closing  Date.

 

 

(c)  Neither  Seller nor Purchaser shall be required to indemnify or hold
harmless any  person  with respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant
to the Limited Indemnity  Provisions (x) unless and until the aggregate
Losses of the Purchaser  Indemnities, in the case of Seller, or the Seller
Indemnitees, in the case  of  Purchaser, in respect of all such claims
exceed $5,000,000, after which such  party shall be liable for all Losses in
excess of such amount, and (y) for  any  individual items (or group of
substantially related items) where the loss  relating thereto is less than
$100,000 and such items (or group of substantially  related items) shall not
be aggregated for purposes of the immediately preceding  clause (x).

 

 

(d)  Except  as  otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement or in
any Ancillary Agreement,  Purchaser acknowledges that its sole and exclusive
remedy with respect to  any  and all claims relating to this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements, the  Acquisition and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, the  Company or any Subsidiary and its
assets and liabilities (other than claims  of,  or causes of action arising
from, fraud, or actions seeking specific performance  of Section 5.03(b) or
Section 5.13) shall be pursuant to the  indemnification provisions set forth
in this Article IX. In furtherance  of  the foregoing, Purchaser hereby
waives, from and after the Closing, to the  fullest extent permitted under
applicable law, any and all rights, claims  and  causes of action (other
than claims of, or causes of action arising from,  fraud,  or actions
seeking specific performance of Section 5.03(b) or  Section 5.13) it may have
against Seller arising under or based upon  this  Agreement, any Ancillary
Agreement, any document or certificate delivered  in  connection herewith,
any Applicable Law (including any relating to environmental  matters), common
law or otherwise (except pursuant to the indemnification  provisions set
forth in this Article IX).

 

 

(e)  Neither  party hereto shall be liable to the other for any special,
incidental,  consequential or punitive damages (including loss of profits,
loss of use,  damage to goodwill or loss of business) claimed by such other
party resulting  from such first party's breach of its representations,
warranties, covenants or  agreements hereunder. In no event shall Seller be
obligated to indemnify  the  Purchaser Indemnitees or any other person with
respect to any matter to the  extent that such matter was reflected in the
calculation of the adjustment  to  the Closing Date Amount, if any, pursuant
to Section 1.04(c).

SECTION  9.05. _Calculation  of Losses._   The  amount of any Losses for
which indemnification is provided under this Article  IX  shall be computed
net of any insurance proceeds received by the Indemnified  Party in
connection with such Losses. If the amount with respect to which  any  claim
is made under this Article IX (an " _Indemnity  Claim_ ")  gives  rise to
the party making the claim an actual Tax Benefit (as defined below),  the 
indemnity payment shall be reduced by the amount of the Tax Benefit
available  to  the party making the claim. To the extent such Indemnity
Claim does not give  rise to an actual Tax Benefit, if the amount with
respect to which any Indemnity  Claim is made gives rise to a Tax Benefit
that is realized within five years  of  the close of the taxable year that
includes the year of the Loss subject  to this  Section 9.05 to the party
that made the claim, such party shall refund to  the  Indemnifying Party the
amount of such Tax Benefit when, as and if realized.  For  the purposes of
this Agreement, any subsequently realized Tax Benefit shall  be  treated as
though it were a reduction in the amount of the initial Indemnity  Claim, and
the liabilities of the parties shall be redetermined as though  both 
occurred at or prior to the time of the indemnity payment. For purposes of 
this  Section 9.05, a " _Tax  Benefit_ "  means  an amount by which the
Income **** Tax  liability of the party (or group of corporations including
the party) is  reduced  (including, without limitation, by deduction,
reduction of income by virtue  of  increased tax basis or otherwise,
entitlement to refund, credit or otherwise)  plus any related interest
received from the relevant Taxing Authority. Where  a  party has other
losses, deductions, credits or items available to it, the  determination  of
any Tax Benefit shall be calculated by comparing the Income **** Tax 
liability of the Indemnified Party, computed without regard to any losses, 
deductions, credits or items relating to the Indemnity Claim, to the  Income
**** Tax  liability of the Indemnified Party, computed after taking into
account any  losses, deductions, credits or items relating to the Indemnity 
Claim.  In the  event that there should be a determination disallowing the
Tax Benefit, the  Indemnifying Party shall be liable to refund to the
Indemnified Party the  amount  of any related reduction previously allowed
or payments previously made to  the  Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Section 9.05. The amount of the refunded  reduction or payment shall be
deemed a payment under this Section 9.05 and  thus  shall be paid subject to
any applicable reductions under this Section 9.05.  Any  indemnity payment
under this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment  to the  Purchase
Price for Tax purposes, unless a final determination (which shall  include
the execution of a Form 870-AD or successor form) with respect to  the 
Indemnified Party or any of its affiliates causes any such payment not to 
be  treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for United States
Federal  income  purposes.

SECTION  10.06. _Counterparts._   This  Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, all of which shall be  considered one and the same
agreement, and shall become effective when one  or  more such counterparts
have been signed by each of the parties and delivered  to  the other
parties.

 

 

SECTION  10.07. _Entire  Agreement._   This  Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement, along  with the Schedules and
Exhibits thereto, contain the entire agreement and  understanding among the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof  and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings relating to such subject  matter. None of
the parties shall be liable or bound to any other party in  any  manner by
any representations, warranties or covenants relating to such subject  matter
except as specifically set forth herein or in the Ancillary Agreements  or 
the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  10.08. _Severability._   If any  provision of this Agreement (or
any portion thereof) or the application of  any  such provision (or any
portion thereof) to any person or circumstance shall  be  held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent 
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect  any other provision hereof (or the remaining portion thereof) or the
application  of such provision to any other persons or circumstances.

 

 

SECTION  10.09. _Consent  to Jurisdiction._   Each  party irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of (a) the Supreme  Court of the State
of New York, New York County, and (b) the United  States  District Court for
the Southern District of New York, for the purposes of any  suit, action or
other proceeding arising out of this Agreement, any Ancillary  Agreement or
any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby. Each party agrees  to
commence any such action, suit or proceeding either in the United States 
District Court for the Southern District of New York or if such suit, action 
or  other proceeding may not be brought in such court for jurisdictional
reasons,  in  the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County.
Each party further  agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or
document by U.S.  registered mail to such party's respective address set
forth above shall be  effective service of process for any action, suit or
proceeding in New York  with  respect to any matters to which it has
submitted to jurisdiction in this  Section 10.09. Each party irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any  objection to the laying of venue of any action,
suit or proceeding arising  out  of this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement
or the transactions contemplated  hereby and thereby in (i) the Supreme Court
of the State of New York,  New  York County, or (ii) the United States
District Court for the Southern  District of New York, and hereby and thereby
further irrevocably and  unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or
claim in any such court that  any such action, suit or proceeding brought in
any such court has been brought  in an inconvenient forum.

 

 

SECTION  10.10. _Governing  Law._   This  Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the internal  laws of the State of New York
applicable to agreements made and to be performed  entirely within such
State, without regard to the conflicts of law principles  of  such State,
except to the extent that the Minnesota Business Corporation Act  is 
mandatorily applicable.

 

 

SECTION  10.11. _Waiver  of Jury Trial._   Each  party hereby waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any  right it may have to a
trial by jury in respect to any litigation directly  or  indirectly arising
out of, under or in connection with this Agreement, any  Ancillary Agreement
or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby. Each  party (a) certifies
that no representative, agent or attorney of any  other  party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would  not,  in
the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and  (b)
acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced  to 
enter into this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, as applicable, by, 
among  other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this  Section
10.11.

 

 

SECTION  10.12. _Specific  Performance._   The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the  event  that any provision contained
in Section 5.03

equity.
