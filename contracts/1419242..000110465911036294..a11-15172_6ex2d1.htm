REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_**

 



 

 **3.1** ** ****Representations and Warranties of the Partnership and GP**

 



 

The Partnership and GP hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to
and in favour of the Purchaser as follows and acknowledge that the Purchaser
is relying upon such representations and warranties in connection with the
entering into of this Agreement:

 



 

(a) _Board Approval._

 



 

(i) Greenhill and Co. Canada Ltd. and CIBC World Markets Inc. have delivered
oral opinions as to the Partnership Fairness Opinions to the GP Board to the
effect that the consideration to be received under the Arrangement is fair
from a financial point of view to the Partnership Unitholders; and

 



 

(ii) the members of the GP Board entitled to vote, after consultation with
their financial and legal advisors, have determined unanimously that the
Arrangement is in the best interests of the Partnership and is fair to the
Partnership Unitholders **** and have resolved unanimously to recommend to the
Partnership Unitholders that they vote in favour of the Arrangement. The
members of the GP Board entitled to vote have unanimously approved the
Arrangement and the execution and performance of this Agreement.

the Partnership Subsidiaries has been duly incorporated, organized or formed

jurisdiction of incorporation, organization or formation, and has all
requisite partnership or corporate (as the case may be) power, capacity and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as presently owned, leased, operated and conducted. Each of the
Partnership Entities and each of the Partnership Subsidiaries is duly
registered and qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the character of its properties and assets, owned,
leased, licensed or otherwise held, or the nature of its activities makes such
registration or qualification, as applicable, necessary, except where the
failure to be so registered or qualified, as applicable, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Partnership, each

 



      
 

 



 

of such jurisdictions being listed in Schedule 3.1(b) to the Partnership
Entity Disclosure Letter. True and complete copies of the constating documents
of each of the Partnership Entities and the Partnership Subsidiaries have been

other agreements and instruments. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by each of the Partnership Entities and the performance by each of the
Partnership Entities of its obligations hereunder and the completion by the
Partnership Entities of the Arrangement have been duly authorized by the GP
Board and except for obtaining the Partnership Unitholder Approval, no other
partnership or corporate proceedings, as the case may be, on the part of
either of the Partnership Entities are necessary to authorize this Agreement
and the Arrangement. This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by each of the Partnership Entities and constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of each of the Partnership Entities, enforceable
against each of the Partnership Entities in accordance with its terms (subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws of general
application limiting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and to the
fact that specific performance is an equitable remedy available only in the
discretion of a court). Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.1(c) to the
Partnership Entity Disclosure Letter, the authorization, execution and
delivery by each of the Partnership Entities of this Agreement and the
performance by each of the Partnership Entities of its obligations hereunder
and the completion by each of the Partnership Entities of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Arrangement) will not:

suspension, acceleration, penalty or payment obligation or right to purchase
or sell under, any term or provision of:

comparable organizational documents of any of the Partnership Subsidiaries, or

any benefit payable to such director, officer or employee by the Partnership,
GP or any of the Partnership Subsidiaries, or result in the acceleration of
the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits.

conflict with, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation,
suspension, acceleration, penalty or payment obligation or right to purchase

comply with all of its obligations under the Commitment Letter and to satisfy
or cause the satisfaction of all of the conditions precedent to the funding of
the Bridge Loans on or before the Effective Date (or such earlier date
required by the Commitment Letter). The Purchaser will notify the Partnership

default by the Purchaser under the Commitment Letter or the failure or
reasonably likely failure of any condition in the Commitment Letter to be

Partnership, the Purchaser covenants and agrees to provide a subordinated
guarantee (subordinated to the Bridge Loan and any and all other existing or

 **4.13** ** ****Covenants of the Partnership Entities Regarding Non-
Solicitation**

 



 

(a) On and after the date of this Agreement and until this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or as contemplated by the Partnership Reorganization Agreements, the
Partnership Entities shall not, directly or indirectly, through any officer,

facilitate any inquiries, proposals or offers regarding any Partnership

information with respect to, or otherwise co-operate in any way with, or
assist or participate in, facilitate or knowingly encourage, any effort or

Proposal (provided that, for greater certainty, the Partnership Entities may
advise any Person making an unsolicited Partnership Acquisition Proposal that
such Partnership Acquisition Proposal does not constitute a Superior Proposal
when the GP Board has so determined);

 



 

(iii) withdraw, modify or qualify (or publicly propose to or publicly state
that it intends to withdraw, modify or qualify) in any manner adverse to the
Purchaser the approval or recommendation of the GP Board (or any committee
thereof) of this Agreement or the Arrangement;

 



 

(iv) approve, recommend or remain neutral with respect to, or propose publicly
to approve, recommend or remain neutral with respect to, any Partnership
Acquisition Proposal; or

 



 

(v) accept or enter into, or publicly propose to accept or enter into, any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, agreement, understanding,
arrangement or undertaking related to any Partnership Acquisition Proposal
(other than a confidentiality agreement permitted by and in compliance with
Section 4.13(d)).

 



 

(b) From and after the date of this Agreement and until this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms, except as contemplated by the
Partnership Reorganization Agreements, the Partnership Entities will
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing solicitation,
activity, discussion or negotiation with any Person (other than the Purchaser)
by the Partnership Entities or any of their officers, directors, employees,
representatives, agents or Subsidiaries with respect to any Partnership
Acquisition Proposal, whether or not initiated by the Partnership Entities,
and, in connection therewith, the Partnership Entities will discontinue access
to any confidential information (including, without limitation, through data
rooms (virtual or otherwise) previously provided to any such Person) and will
request (and exercise all rights it has to require) the return or destruction
of all confidential information regarding the Partnership Entities and the
Partnership Subsidiaries previously provided to any such

 



      
 

 



 

Person. The Partnership Entities shall not terminate, waive, amend or modify
any provision of any existing confidentiality agreement relating to a
Partnership Acquisition Proposal and shall not release any third party from
any confidentiality, non-solicitation or standstill agreement to which it is a
party (it being understood that the automatic termination of the standstill
provisions of any such agreements in accordance with their terms shall not be
a violation of this Section 4.13(b)). The Partnership Entities undertake to
enforce, or cause the Partnership Subsidiaries to enforce, all standstill,
non-disclosure, non-disturbance, non-solicitation and similar covenants that
they or any of their Subsidiaries have entered into prior to the date hereof
or enter into after the date hereof.

 



 

(c) From and after the date of this Agreement and until this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms, the Partnership Entities shall as
soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within 24 hours) notify the
Purchaser, at first orally and then in writing, of any proposal, inquiry,
offer, expression of interest or request relating to or constituting a
Partnership Acquisition Proposal, any request for discussions or negotiations,
and any request for non-public information relating to the Partnership
Entities or the Partnership Subsidiaries received by the Partnership Entities
directors, officers, representatives or agents, or any material amendments to
the foregoing. Such notice shall include a copy of any written proposal,
inquiry, offer, expression of interest or request and if the proposal is not
in written form, a description of the material terms and conditions of, and
the identity of the Person making, any proposal, inquiry, offer, expression of
interest or request (or any amendment to any of the foregoing). The
Partnership Entities shall keep the Purchaser promptly and fully informed of
the status of any such proposal, inquiry, offer, expression of interest or
request and shall respond promptly to all inquiries of the Purchaser with
respect thereto.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding Section 4.13(a) and any other provision of this Agreement,
if on or after the date hereof and prior to obtaining the approval of
Partnership Unitholders of the Arrangement Resolution at the Partnership
Meeting, any of the Partnership Entities receive a _bona fide_ written
Partnership Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited by the Partnership
Entities after the date hereof in contravention of Section 4.13(a) and
provided that the Partnership Entities are in compliance with Sections 4.13(a)
and 4.13(b), the Partnership Entities shall be permitted to engage in
discussions or negotiations, provide information and otherwise cooperate with
and assist the Person making such Partnership Acquisition Proposal, if:

 



 

(i) the Partnership Entities have provided the Purchaser with the notice
required by Section 4.13(c) in respect of such Partnership Acquisition
Proposal;

 



 

(ii) the GP Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal and financial advisors, that such Partnership Acquisition
Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior
Proposal and that, based on the advice of outside counsel, the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Laws and the Partnership Agreement;

 



 

(iii) prior to providing any information or data in respect of any of the
Partnership Entities or the Partnership Subsidiaries, the Partnership receives
from the

 



      
 

 



 

Person making the Partnership Acquisition Proposal an executed confidentiality
agreement that contains provisions that are not less favourable to the
Partnership than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement including a
standstill provision and the Partnership Entities promptly and in any event
not less than 24 hours after its execution send a copy of any such
confidentiality agreement to the Purchaser; and

 



 

(iv) the Purchaser is provided with a list of, or in the case of information
on or after the date hereof that was not previously made available to the
Purchaser, copies of, any information provided to the Person making the
Partnership Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(e) The Partnership Entities agree that they will not accept, approve or enter
into any agreement (a " **Proposed Agreement** "), other than a
confidentiality agreement as contemplated by Section 4.13(d), with any Person
providing for or to facilitate any Partnership Acquisition Proposal, unless:

 



 

(i) the Partnership Meeting has not occurred;

 



 

(ii) the GP Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal and financial advisors, that such Partnership Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws
and the Partnership Agreement;

 



 

(iii) the Partnership Entities have complied with Sections 4.13(a) through
4.13(d) inclusive;

 



 

(iv) the Partnership Entities have provided the Purchaser with a written
notice that there is a Superior Proposal together with all documentation
related to and detailing the Superior Proposal, including a copy of any
Proposed Agreement relating to such Superior Proposal, and a written notice
from the GP Board regarding the value in financial terms that the GP Board has
in consultation with its financial advisors determined should be ascribed to
any non-cash consideration offered under the Superior Proposal, such documents
to be so provided to the Purchaser not less than five Business Days prior to
the proposed acceptance, approval, recommendation or execution of the Proposed
Agreement by Partnership Entities;

 



 

(v) five Business Days shall have elapsed from the date the Purchaser received
the notice and documentation required by Section 4.13(e)(iv) and, if the
Purchaser has proposed to amend the terms of the Arrangement in accordance
with Section 4.13(f), the GP Board shall have determined, in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the
Partnership Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal compared
to the proposed amendment to the terms of the Arrangement by the Purchaser;

 



 

(vi) the Partnership Entities concurrently terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 6.3(d)(iii); and

 



      
 

 



 

(vii) the Partnership has previously, or concurrently will have, paid to the
Purchaser the Purchaser Termination Fee,

 



 

and the Partnership Entities further agree that they and the GP Board will not
withdraw, modify or qualify (or propose to withdraw, modify or qualify) in any
manner adverse to the Purchaser the approval or recommendation of the
Arrangement, nor accept, approve or recommend any Partnership Acquisition
Proposal unless the requirements of Sections 4.13(e)(i) through 4.13(e)(vii)
have been satisfied.

 



 

(f) The Partnership Entities acknowledge and agree that, during the five
Business Day periods referred to in Sections 4.13(e)(i) through 4.13(e)(vii)
or such longer period as the Partnership Entities may approve for such
purpose, the Purchaser shall have the opportunity, but not the obligation, to
propose to amend the terms of this Agreement and the Arrangement and the
Partnership Entities shall co-operate with the Purchaser with respect thereto,
including negotiating in good faith with the Purchaser to enable the Purchaser
to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Arrangement as the Purchaser deems appropriate and as would enable the
Purchaser to proceed with the Arrangement and any related transactions on such
adjusted terms. The GP Board will review any written definitive proposal by
the Purchaser to amend the terms of the Arrangement in order to determine, in
good faith in the exercise of its fiduciary duties and consistent with Section
4.13(a), whether the Purchasers written definitive proposal to amend the
Arrangement would result in the Partnership Acquisition Proposal not being a
Superior Proposal compared to the proposed amendment to the terms of the
Arrangement. If the GP Board determines that a Partnership Acquisition
Proposal is not a Superior Proposal as compared to the proposed written
definitive amendment to the terms of the Arrangement, it will promptly enter
into the proposed written definitive amendment to the Arrangement.

 



 

(g) The GP Board shall promptly reaffirm its recommendation of the Arrangement
by press release after: (x) any Partnership Acquisition Proposal which the GP
Board determines not to be a Superior Proposal is publicly announced or made;
or (y) the GP Board determines that a proposed amendment to the terms of the
Arrangement would result in the Partnership Acquisition Proposal which has
been publicly announced or made not being a Superior Proposal, and the
Purchaser has so amended the terms of the Arrangement. The Purchaser and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
form and content of any such press release, recognizing that whether or not
such comments are appropriate will be determined by the GP Board, acting
reasonably.

 



 

(h) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the GP Board from responding
through a directors circular or otherwise as required by applicable
Securities Laws to a Partnership Acquisition Proposal that it determines is
not a Superior Proposal. The Purchaser and its counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the form and content of any
such disclosure, recognizing that whether or not such comments are appropriate
will be determined by the GP Board, acting reasonably.

 



 

(i) Each of the Partnership Entities and the Purchaser agree that all
information that may be provided to it by the other with respect to any
Partnership Acquisition Proposal

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to this Section 4.13 shall be treated as "Evaluation Material" as
that term is defined in the Confidentiality Agreement, and shall not be
disclosed or used except in accordance with the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement or in order to enforce its rights under this
Agreement in legal proceedings.

 



 

(j) Each of the Partnership Entities shall ensure that its officers, directors
and key employees and any financial advisors or other advisors,
representatives or agents retained by it are aware of the provisions of this
Section 4.13, and shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 4.13 by
such officers, directors, key employees, financial advisors or other advisors,
representatives or agents.

 



 

(k) The Partnership Entities acknowledge and agree that each successive
modification of any Partnership Acquisition Proposal shall constitute a new
Partnership Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 4.13, and, for
greater certainty, of the requirement of Sections 4.13(e) and 4.13(f) to
initiate an additional five Business Day response period for the Purchaser.

 



 

(l) If the Partnership Entities provide the Purchaser with the notice of a
Partnership Acquisition Proposal contemplated in this Section 4.13 on a date
that is less than five Business Days prior to the Partnership Meeting, if
requested by the Purchaser, the Partnership Entities shall adjourn or postpone
the Partnership Meeting to a date that is not less than five Business Days and
not more than 10 calendar days after the date of such notice, provided,
however, that the Partnership Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed to a
date later than the fifth Business Day prior to the Outside Date and, if
requested by the Partnership Entities, the Purchaser shall adjourn or postpone
the Purchaser Meeting to the same date.

Subsidiaries, and the Corporation previously provided to any such Person. From
and after the date of this Agreement and until this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms, except as contemplated by the Partnership

or modify any provision of any existing confidentiality agreement relating to
a Partnership Acquisition Proposal or a Corporation Acquisition proposal and
shall not release any third party from any confidentiality, non-solicitation
or standstill agreement to which it is a party (it being understood that the

4.14(b)). The Corporation undertakes to enforce all standstill, non-
disclosure, non-disturbance, non-solicitation and similar covenants that it
has entered into prior to the date hereof or enter into after the date hereof.

 



 

(c) The Corporation shall ensure that its officers, directors and key
employees and any financial advisors or other advisors, representatives or
agents retained by it are aware of the provisions of this Section 4.14, and
shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 4.14 by such officers,
directors, key employees, financial advisors or other advisors,
representatives or agents.

operations of the Partnership immediately upon but not prior to the Effective
Date. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that information furnished
pursuant to this Section 4.15 shall be subject to the terms and conditions of
the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



        
 

 



 

 **4.16** ** ****Insurance and Indemnification**

 



 

(a) The Partnership Entities and the Purchaser covenant and agree that the
Partnership Entities will be entitled to secure directors and officers

of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms of any event or state of facts which occurrence or failure would, or
would be reasonably likely to:

 



 

(i) cause any of the representations or warranties of such Party contained
herein to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect on the date hereof

(ii) result in the failure to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by such Party hereunder in any
material respect prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) The Purchaser may not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement

each case unless the Party seeking to terminate the Agreement shall have
delivered a written notice to the other Parties specifying in reasonable
detail all breaches of covenants, representations and warranties or other

reasonable efforts to prepare prior to the Effective Time all documentation
necessary and do all such other acts and things as are necessary to give
effect to such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization, and any such Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization shall occur as close to the Effective Time as is practical.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation and the Partnership Entities
shall not be required to effect a Pre-Acquisition Reorganization unless they
have received an appropriate indemnity indemnifying them for all costs,

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, none of the representations,
warranties or covenants of the Partnership Entities or the Corporation shall
be deemed to apply to, or deemed breached or violated by or as a result of,

result of the event giving rise to such payment and the resultant termination
of this Agreement and is not a penalty. Each of Parties irrevocably waives any
rights they may have to raise as a defense that any such liquidated damages
are excessive or punitive. For greater certainty, the Parties agree that the

the manner provided therein is the sole remedy of the recipient as a result of
the event giving rise to such payment and the resultant termination of this
Agreement and the recipient shall have no further claim or remedy against the
other Parties. Except as specifically provided herein, there shall be no
liability of any shareholder, Unitholder or Agent of the Purchaser, the
Partnership Entities or the Corporation, or of any of their Subsidiaries or
Affiliates in connection with any liability or other obligation of the
Purchaser, the Partnership Entities or the Corporation, or of any of their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, whether hereunder or otherwise in connection with

 **7.2** ** ****Entire Agreement, Binding Effect and Assignment**

 



 

This Agreement shall be binding on and shall enure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement
(including the schedules hereto), the Partnership Entity Disclosure Letter,
the Corporation Disclosure Letter, the Purchaser Disclosure Letter and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all
other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. Neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned by any of the Parties without the prior written consent of the other
Parties. The Parties

 



      
 

 



 

hereby confirm that they remain bound by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof, notwithstanding that this
Agreement may be terminated for any reason whatsoever.

 



 

 **7.3** ** ****Severability**

 



 

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party.

 



 

Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

Except as provided in Sections 4.16 and 7.10 and except for the rights of the

respectively, following the Effective Time, and other rights and benefits,
pursuant to the Arrangement, which rights are hereby acknowledged and agreed
by the Purchaser, this Agreement is not intended to confer any rights or
remedies upon any person other than the Parties to this Agreement. This

Agreement.

Time shall be of the essence in this Agreement.

instruments and provide all such further assurances as may be reasonable
required in order to fully perform and carry out the terms and intent hereof.

 



 

 **7.7** ** ****Remedies**

 



 

Except as provided in Section 6.7, the Parties agree that irreparable harm
would occur for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy at law in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to equitable remedies,
including specific performance, a restraining order and interlocutory,
preliminary and permanent injunctive relief and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement, any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or
other equitable relief hereby being waived. Except as provided in Section 6.7,
such remedies will not be the exclusive remedies for any breach of this
Agreement but will be in additions to all other remedies available at law or
equity to each of the Parties.

 



      
 

 



 

 **7.8** ** ****Costs and Expenses**

 



 

Except as provided in Sections 4.10 and 6.6 and as otherwise agreed to in
writing between the Parties, the Parties agree that all costs and expenses of
the Parties relating to the Arrangement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including legal fees, accounting fees, financial advisory fees,
regulatory filing fees, stock exchange fees, all disbursements of advisors and
printing and mailing costs, shall be paid by the Party incurring such
expenses.

 



 

 **7.9** ** ****Governing Law**

 



 

This Agreement shall be governed, including as to validity, interpretation and
effect, by the laws of the Province of Alberta and the federal laws of Canada
applicable therein, and shall be construed and treated in all respects as an
Alberta contract. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably attorns to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts in the Province of Alberta in respect of
all matters arising under and in relation to this Agreement and the
Arrangement.

 



 

 **7.10** ** ****Notice of Limitation**

 



 

The Purchaser covenants and agrees that no Partnership Unitholder shall have
any liability for or obligation in respect of, the covenants and obligations
of the Partnership hereunder. This Section 7.10 shall survive the Effective
Time and any termination of this Agreement.

 



 

 **7.11** ** ****Filing of Agreement**

 



 

The Parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement and all other documents
required under applicable Securities Laws will be filed on the SEDAR and/or
EDGAR website, together with other documents required by Securities Law.

 



 

 **7.12** ** ****Waiver**

 



 

Any Party may, on its own behalf only, (i) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or acts of another Party, (ii) waive compliance with
another Partys agreements or the fulfillment of any conditions to its own
obligations contained herein, or (iii) waive inaccuracies in another Partys

another Party; provided, however, that any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument. The Parties shall be entitled to rely upon

paid to each Partnership Unitholder that made an election to receive the Cash
Consideration and to CPLP if it made an election to receive the Cash
Consideration shall be pro-rated (based on the

 



      
 

 



 

fraction equal to the Aggregate Cash Maximum divided by the Aggregate Cash
Elected) so that the aggregate amount of cash payable (excluding the amount
payable pursuant to Section 2.3(k)) to all such Partnership Unitholders and
CPLP shall be equal to the Aggregate Cash Maximum (the amount of the reduction
in cash payable to any Partnership Unitholder or CPLP being the " **Cash
Reduction** " in respect of such holder). In lieu of the amount of cash equal
to the Cash Reduction in respect of a Partnership Unitholder or CPLP, each
such Partnership Unitholder and CPLP shall receive a number of Purchaser
Shares equal to the product of (i) the Cash Reduction divided by the Cash
Consideration per Partnership Unit and (ii) the Exchange Ratio.

 



 

(b) With respect to the Share Consideration, the aggregate number of Purchaser
Shares available is limited to 31,330,753 _plus_ the product of the Exchange

of Purchaser Shares issued to each Partnership Unitholder that made or was
deemed to make an election to receive the Share Consideration and to CPLP if
it made or was deemed to make an election to receive the Share Consideration
shall be pro-rated (based on the fraction equal to the Aggregate Share Maximum
divided by the Aggregate Shares Elected) so that the aggregate number of
Purchaser Shares issuable to all such Partnership Unitholders and CPLP shall
be equal to the Aggregate Share Maximum (the reduction in the number of
Purchaser Shares payable to any Partnership Unitholder or CPLP being the "
**Share Reduction** " in respect of such holder). In lieu of the number of
Purchaser Shares equal to the Share Reduction in respect of a Partnership
Unitholder or CPLP, each such Partnership Unitholder and CPLP shall receive an
amount of cash equal to the product of (i) the Share Reduction divided by the
Exchange Ratio and (ii) the Cash Consideration per Partnership Unit.

(c) any deposit of a Letter of Transmittal and Election Form and accompanying
certificates may be made at any of the addresses of the Depositary specified

by CPLP, and in addition to the receipt of the Purchaser Note, either Cash
Consideration or Share Consideration, subject in either case and in all
respects to adjustment pursuant to Section 2.4;

 



 

(b) If CPLP elects to receive Cash Consideration, in addition to the amount

Letter of Transmittal and Election Form prior to the Election Deadline or

the Corporation Letter of Transmittal and Election Form in respect of its
election, it shall be deemed to have elected to receive the Share
Consideration; and

 



 

(f) any deposit of a Corporation Letter of Transmittal and Election Form and
accompanying certificates may be made at any of the addresses of the

Form.

with such additional documents and instruments as the Depositary may
reasonably require, the holder of Corporation Shares represented by such
surrendered certificate or other instrument shall be entitled to receive from
the Depositary, and the Depositary shall deliver as soon as possible to such
Corporation Shareholder, that number of the Purchaser Shares (together with

against any claim that may be made with respect to the certificate alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

sufficient to pay all cash consideration payable by the Purchaser to the
Partnership Unitholders, each in accordance with Section 2.3 and subject to
Section 2.4 of this Plan of Arrangement.

 



 

(b) The cash deposited with the Depositary shall be held in an interest
bearing account, and any interest earned upon such funds shall be for the
account of the Purchaser.

 



 

(c) Upon surrender to the Depositary for cancellation of a certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Partnership
Units that are to be or were exchanged for cash and/or Purchaser Shares under
this Plan of Arrangement, together with a duly completed and executed Letter
of Transmittal and Election Form and such other documents and instruments as
would have been required to effect the transfer of such Partnership Units
under the Partnership Agreement, together with such additional documents and
instruments as the Depositary may reasonably require, the holder of the
Partnership Units represented by such surrendered certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Depositary shall deliver as
soon as possible to such Partnership Unitholder following the Effective Time
(i) a cheque for the

 



      
 

 



 

cash consideration to which such Partnership Unitholder is entitled to receive
in accordance with Section 2.3(g), and (ii) a certificate representing that
number of the Purchaser Shares which such holder has the right to receive
under the Arrangement (together with any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto pursuant to Section 3.5), less any amounts withheld pursuant
to Section 3.6.

 



 

(d) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each certificate
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Partnership Units
shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender (i) a cheque for the cash consideration
to which such holder is entitled to receive in accordance with Section 2.3(g),
(ii) a certificate representing that number of the Purchaser Shares which the
holder has a right to receive under the Arrangement, (iii) any dividend or
distribution with respect to such Purchaser Shares as contemplated by Section
3.5, and (iv) the Final Partnership Distribution payable in respect of such
Partnership Units, less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 3.6.

 



 

(e) Any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Partnership Units that is not deposited with all other instruments
or documents required by Section 3.2(c) on or prior to the sixth anniversary
of the Effective Date shall cease to represent a claim or interest of any kind
or nature as a Partnership Unitholder or as a shareholder of the Purchaser. On
such date, the cash and Purchaser Shares to which the former holder of the
certificate referred to in the preceding sentence was ultimately entitled
hereunder shall be deemed to have been donated, surrendered and forfeited for
no consideration to the Purchaser. None of the Purchaser, the Partnership, GP,
the Corporation or the Depositary shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any cash or Purchaser Shares (or dividends, distributions and interest in
respect thereof) delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(f) In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented one or more outstanding Partnership Units shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Depositary will deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, certificates representing Purchaser Shares and/or a cheque for
the amount of any cash consideration to which such Partnership Unitholder is
entitled to receive in accordance with such holders Letter of Transmittal and
Election Form and Section 2.3 hereof, in each case, less any amounts withheld
pursuant to Section 3.6. When authorizing such payment and delivery in
exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the Person to whom
cheques and/or certificates are to be issued shall, as a condition precedent
to the payment and delivery thereof, give a bond satisfactory to the Purchaser
and the Depositary in such sum as the Purchaser and the Depositary may direct,
or otherwise indemnify the Partnership, the Purchaser and the Depositary in a
manner satisfactory to the Purchaser and the Depositary, against any claim
that may be made with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

 



      
 

 



 

 **3.3** ** ****Fractional Purchaser Shares.**

 



 

In no event shall any holder of Partnership Units or Corporation Shares be
entitled to receive a fractional Purchaser Share in consideration therefore.
Where the aggregate number of Purchaser Shares to be issued to a holder of
Partnership Units or to CPLP as consideration under this Arrangement would
result in a fraction of a Purchaser Share being issuable, the number of
Purchaser Shares to be received by such holder or CPLP shall be rounded down
to the nearest whole number of Purchaser Shares and neither CPLP nor any
Partnership Unitholder will be entitled to any compensation in respect of such
fractional Purchaser Share.

 



 

 **3.4** ** ****Fractional Cash.**

 



 

Any cash payable to a Partnership Unitholder or a Corporation Shareholder
pursuant to the Arrangement shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent.

 



 

 **3.5** ** ****Dividends and Distributions with Respect to Unsurrendered
Certificates.**

 



 

No dividend or other distribution declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to the Purchaser Shares with a record date after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding Partnership
Units or Corporation Shares unless and until the holder of such certificate
shall have surrendered such certificate in accordance with Section 3.2(c) or
Section 3.1(c), as the case may be, or complied with Section 3.2(f) or Section
3.1(f), as the case may be. Subject to applicable Law and Section 3.2 or
Section 3.1 hereof, as the case may be, at the time of such surrender or
compliance, there shall, in addition to the delivery of certificates
representing Purchaser Shares to which such Partnership Unitholder or
Corporation Shareholder, as the case may be, is thereby entitled, be delivered
to such holder, without interest, the amount of the dividend or other
distribution with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with
respect to such Purchaser Shares.

 



 

 **3.6** ** ****Withholding Rights.**

 



 

A holder of Partnership Units or Corporation Shares shall be liable for, and
the Purchaser and the Depositary shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any amount paid to such holder, such amounts as each of the Purchaser or the
Depositary is required or permitted to deduct and withhold under the Tax Act,
the _United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986_ , as amended, or any
provision of applicable federal, provincial, state, local or foreign Tax Law
with respect to any consideration otherwise payable hereunder to such holder,
and the Purchaser and the Depositary shall be entitled to recover from such
holder any portion of such amounts that is required to be withheld thereunder
and is not otherwise deducted or withheld. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof as
having been paid to the holder of the Corporation Shares or Partnership Units,
as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made, provided that such withheld amounts are actually remitted by the
Purchaser or the Depositary to the appropriate taxing authority in the name of
the relevant holder of Corporation Shares or the Partnership Units. To the
extent that the amount so required or entitled to be deducted or withheld from
any payment to such a holder exceeds the cash portion of the consideration
otherwise payable to the holder, the Purchaser and the Depositary are hereby
authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of such portion of the Purchaser
Shares otherwise deliverable to such holder as is necessary to provide
sufficient funds to the Purchaser or the Depositary, as the case may be, to
enable it to comply with such

 



      
 

 



 

deduction or withholding requirement or entitlement and the Purchaser or the
Depositary shall notify the holder thereof and remit to such holder any
unapplied balance of the net proceeds of such sale.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 4 _ 
AMENDMENTS_**

 



 

 **4.1** ** ****Amendments to Plan of Arrangement.**

 



 

(a) Subject to the provisions of the Interim Order and any Final Order, any
amendment, modification or supplement to this Plan of Arrangement may be made
jointly by the Partnership, GP, the Corporation and the Purchaser at any time
and from time to time following the Partnership Meeting and prior to the
Effective Time or unilaterally by the Purchaser at any time following the
completion of the Arrangement; provided that each such amendment, modification
or supplement must be (i) approved by the Court, and (ii) communicated to
Partnership Unitholders and Corporation Shareholders if and as required by the
Court; provided however that notwithstanding items (i) and (ii), any such
amendment, modification or supplement to this Plan of Arrangement may be made
without the approval of or communication to the Court, the Partnership
Unitholders or the Corporation Shareholders, provided that it concerns a
matter which, in the reasonable opinion of the Partnership, GP, the
Corporation and/or the Purchaser, as applicable, is of an administrative
nature required to better give effect to the implementation of this Plan of
Arrangement and is not adverse to the financial or economic interests of the
Partnership Unitholders and the Corporation Shareholders.

 



 

(b) Subject to the provisions of the Interim Order, any amendment,
modification or supplement to this Plan of Arrangement may be proposed jointly
by the Partnership, GP, the Corporation or the Purchaser at any time at or
prior to the Partnership Meeting with or without any other prior notice or
communication, and if so proposed and accepted by the Persons voting at the
Partnership Meeting, shall become part of this Plan of Arrangement for all
purposes.

 



 

(c) Any amendment, modification or supplement to this Plan of Arrangement that
is approved or directed by the Court following the Partnership Meeting shall
be effective only if (i) it is consented to by each of the Partnership, GP,
the Corporation and the Purchaser (in each case, acting reasonably), and (ii)
if required by the Court, it is consented to by the Partnership Unitholders
and the Corporation Shareholders voting in the manner directed by the Court.

 



 

(d) If, prior to the Effective Date, any term or provision of this Plan of
Arrangement, or the application thereof, is held by the Court to be invalid,
void or unenforceable, the Court, at the request of any of the Partnership,
GP, the Corporation and/or the Purchaser, shall have the power to alter and
interpret such term or provision to make it valid or enforceable to the
maximum extent practicable, consistent with the original purpose of the term
or provision held to be invalid, void or unenforceable, and such term or
provision shall then be applicable as altered or interpreted. Notwithstanding
any such holding, alteration or interpretation, the remainder of the terms and
provisions of this Plan of Arrangement shall remain in full force and effect
and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated by such holding,
alteration or interpretation.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) If, prior to the Effective Time, the Purchaser determines in its sole
discretion that the Bridge Loans will be drawn upon in connection with the
completion of the Arrangement, the Plan of Arrangement may be unilaterally
amended by the Purchaser without requiring the consent or approval of the
Corporation, GP, the Partnership or the Court as necessary (i) to provide that
all amounts of cash to be paid under the Arrangement to Partnership
Unitholders and Corporation Shareholders (excluding the amounts paid in
satisfaction of the Purchaser Note and under Section 2.3(h)) be paid by the
issuance of non-interest bearing demand promissory notes of the Purchaser in
an aggregate principal amount equal to such cash (" **Holder Notes** ") in
lieu of cash and (ii) to add to Section 2.3 an additional and final step,
being the payment of cash by the Purchaser to the holders of the Holder Notes
in an amount equal to the principal amount thereof in full satisfaction of the
Holder Notes, and the consequent cancellation of such notes.

 



 

(f) This Plan of Arrangement may be withdrawn prior to the Effective Time in
accordance with the terms of the Arrangement Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 5 _ 
OTHER TAX MATTERS_**

 



 

 **5.1** ** ****Tax Election.**

 



 

An Eligible Holder whose Partnership Units or Corporation Shares are exchanged
for consideration that includes Purchaser Shares and who deposits, or causes
its agent or other representative to deposit, prior to the Election Deadline
with the Depositary, a duly completed Letter of Transmittal and Election Form
or Corporation Letter of Transmittal and Election Form, as the case may be,
indicating such holders intention to file a Section 85 Election shall be
entitled to make an income tax election, pursuant to section 85 of the Tax Act
(and any analogous provision of provincial income tax law) (a " **Section 85
Election**") with respect to the exchange by completing and forwarding two
signed copies of the prescribed form of election to an appointed
representative, as directed by the Purchaser, on or before 90 days after the
Effective Date, duly completed with the details of the number of Partnership
Units transferred and the applicable agreed amounts for the purposes of such
joint elections. The Purchaser shall, within 60 days after receiving the
completed joint election forms from an Eligible Holder, and subject to such
joint election forms being correct and complete and in compliance with
requirements imposed under the Tax Act (or applicable provincial income tax
law), sign and return such forms to the Eligible Holder for filing with the
Canada Revenue Agency (or the applicable provincial tax authority). Neither
the Purchaser, the Partnership, GP nor any successor corporation shall be
responsible for the proper completion of any election form nor, except for the
obligation to sign and return duly completed election forms which are received
within 90 days of the Effective Date, for any Taxes, interest or penalties
resulting from the failure of a holder of Partnership Units to properly
complete or file such election forms in the form and manner and within the
time prescribed by the Tax Act (or any applicable provincial legislation). In
its sole discretion, the Purchaser or any successor corporation may choose to
sign and return an election form received by it more than 90 days following
the Effective Date or from an Eligible Holder who did not deposit, or cause
its agent or other representative to deposit, prior to the Election Deadline
with the Depositary, a duly completed Letter of Transmittal and Election Form
or Corporation Letter of Transmittal and Election Form, as the case may be,
indicating such holders intention to file a Section 85 Election, but will
have no obligation to do so.

 



      
 

 



 

 **5.2** ** ****Tax Returns and Tax Elections.**

 



 

Except as otherwise required by any applicable Law, the Partnership, the
Purchaser and GP shall not and shall not allow the Partnership or any
Partnership Subsidiary to amend, refile or otherwise modify or grant an
extension or waiver with respect to any Tax Return for the Partnership or the
Partnership Subsidiaries for any taxation year, or part of a taxation year,
ending on or before the Effective Date if such amendment, refiling,
modification or extension would cause any current or past member of the
Partnership to be subject to any additional liability for Taxes payable nor
shall the Purchaser request an audit or assessment of any such Tax Return or
extend the period during which a current or past member of the Partnership
would be liable for additional Taxes payable without the approval of the
Court.
