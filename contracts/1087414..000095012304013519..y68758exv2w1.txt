MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of November 10, 2004, among JONES APPAREL
GROUP, INC., a Pennsylvania corporation ("Parent"), FLINTSTONE ACQUISITION
CORP., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent
("Merger Sub"), and BARNEYS NEW YORK, INC., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company").   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Merger Sub and
the Company has approved and declared advisable, and the Board of Directors
of Parent has approved, this Agreement and the merger of Merger Sub with and
into the Company (the "Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement;   WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and as a condition and inducement to the
willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement,
Whippoorwill Associates, Inc. and Bay Harbour Management L.C. (collectively,
the "Principal Company Stockholders"), the Company and Parent are entering
into an agreement (the "Principal Stockholders\' Agreement") pursuant to
which each of the Principal Company Stockholders agrees, among other things,
to take certain actions in furtherance of the Merger, including causing the
execution and delivery of written consents in accordance with Section 228 of
the DGCL (a "Principal Stockholder Consent") pursuant to which the record
holders of the shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by each of
the Principal Company Stockholders will consent to the adoption of this
Agreement and the approval of the Merger without a meeting, without prior
notice and without a vote;   WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and as a condition and inducement to the
willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, Parent and
Howard Socol are entering into an agreement (the "Employment Agreement")
pursuant to which Howard Socol agrees, among other things, to continue his
employment with the Company after the Effective Time and not to have certain
relationships with third parties after the Effective Time;   WHEREAS,
immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of
the record holders of the shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned
by the Principal Company Stockholders will execute a Principal Stockholder
Consent and deliver it to the secretary of the Company (the "Secretary"), and
the Secretary shall certify and acknowledge that the Stockholder Approval has
been duly obtained; and   WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire
to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in
connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the
Merger;   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in
this Agreement, the parties hereto agree as follows:   1    ARTICLE
I   The Merger   Section 1.01. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company as of the Effective Time pursuant
to Section 251 of the DGCL. As of the Effective Time, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and the Company shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").  
Section 1.02. Closing. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place
at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on a date to be specified by the parties,
which shall be no later than the second business day after satisfaction or
(to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver of the conditions
set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their terms
cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions at such time), at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and
Manges LLP, 767 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10153, unless another time,
date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto; provided,
however, that if all the conditions set forth in Article VII shall not have
been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waived on such
second business day, the Closing will take place on the first business day on
which all such conditions shall have been satisfied or (to the extent
permitted by applicable Law) waived. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date".   Section 1.03.
Effective Time. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, as promptly as practicable after the Closing and on the
Closing Date, the parties shall file with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") duly
prepared, executed and acknowledged by the parties in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the DGCL, and, as promptly as practicable on or after
the Closing Date, the parties shall make all other filings or
recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective as of
such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, or as of such subsequent time or date as
Parent and the Company shall agree and shall specify in the Certificate of
Merger (the time and date at which the Merger becomes effective being the
"Effective Time").   Section 1.04.Effects of the Merger. From and after the
Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL,
including Section 259 thereof. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, as of the Effective Time, all the properties,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall
vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of
the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Surviving Corporation.   2    Section 1.05. Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws.   (a) The certificate of incorporation of the
Company shall be amended at the Effective Time to read as set forth on
Exhibit A hereto, and as so amended, shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law.   (b) The By-laws of Merger Sub, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the By-laws of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.   Section 1.06. Directors. The directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their death, resignation or
removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified,
as the case may be.   Section 1.07. Officers. The officers of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their death, resignation or
removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified,
as the case may be.   ARTICLE II   Effect of the Merger on the Capital
Stock of the Constituent  Corporations; Exchange of Certificates; Company
Stock Options and Warrants;  Debt Offer   Section 2.01. Effect on Capital
Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any holder of any
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("Company
Common Stock"), any shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Company ("Company Preferred Stock") or any shares of capital stock of
Merger Sub:   (a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding
share  of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become
one  validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock,
par  value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.   (b)
Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. Each  share of Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock that is owned by  the Company, Parent
or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time  shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and  retired and shall cease
to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered  in exchange therefor.  
(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock.  Each
issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than  shares to
be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and Appraisal   3   
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $19.00 in cash,  without
interest (the "Common Stock Merger Consideration"). Each issued  and
outstanding share of Company Preferred Stock (other than shares to be 
canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and Appraisal Shares) shall be 
converted into the right to receive $154.375 in cash without interest (the 
"Preferred Stock Merger Consideration"). All such shares of Company Common 
Stock and Company Preferred Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall 
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each 
holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time 
represented any such shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred 
Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect 
thereto, except the right to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration 
or the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, as applicable.   (d) Appraisal
Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to  the contrary, shares
("Appraisal Shares") of Company Common Stock or  Company Preferred Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective Time that are held
by any holder who is entitled to demand and  properly demands appraisal of
such shares pursuant to, and who complies in  all respects with, the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section  262") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the consideration  payable as provided in Section
2.01(c), but instead such holder shall be  entitled to payment of the fair
value of such shares in accordance with  the provisions of Section 262. As of
the Effective Time, all Appraisal  Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled  and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Appraisal Shares shall cease  to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the  fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance
with the provisions of  Section 262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
such holder shall fail  to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose
the right to  appraisal under Section 262 or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall  determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by  Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair
value of  such holder\'s Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease to
exist and  such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of
the  Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the 
Common Stock Merger Consideration or the Preferred Stock Merger 
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), as the case may be. The 
Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal  of
any shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, and  Parent
shall have the right to participate in and, subject to applicable  Law,
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.  None
of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall, without the written  consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to  settle, any
such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.   Section 2.02. Exchange
of Certificates.   (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company
to act as agent for payment   4   of the Common Stock Merger
Consideration and the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.01(c) upon surrender of Certificates (the "Paying Agent"). As of or
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited,
with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate amounts payable
pursuant to Section 2.01(c) in exchange for the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock (such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the "Exchange Fund").   (b) Exchange Procedures. As promptly
as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent
to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall be in such form as Parent
and the Company may reasonably agree to use) and (ii) instructions for use in
surrendering Certificates in exchange for the cash amounts specified in
Section 2.01(c). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed, and such other documents as may be reasonably required by
the Paying Agent, the holder of record of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01(c), and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the
proper amount of cash may be paid in exchange therefor to a person other than
the person in whose name a Certificate so surrendered is registered if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer
or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02(b),
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash
such holder shall be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(c). No
interest will be paid or will accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of
any Certificate.   (c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock
or Company Preferred Stock. All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates
in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock previously represented by such
Certificates. As of the close of business on the day on which the Effective
Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock, in each case that were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. If, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates
are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any
reason, such Certificates shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Article II.   5    (d) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any
cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the cash included in the
Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for
one year after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand,
and any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain
liable for, payment of such funds to which such holder may be due pursuant to
Section 2.01(c).   (e) Investment of Exchange Fund. Parent may cause the
Paying Agent to invest, as directed by Parent in its sole discretion, any
cash included in the Exchange Fund, and any capital gain, interest or other
income resulting from such investments shall inure to the benefit of Parent
and shall be paid to Parent from time to time by the Paying Agent.   (f)
Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such person of a bond
in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may direct as
indemnity against any successful claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the amount of cash which such holder
would be entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(c).   (g) Withholding Rights.
The Paying Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock, shares of Company Preferred Stock, Company
Stock Options or Warrants pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Code"), or under any provision
of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that such amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, such amounts
shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.  
Section 2.03. Company Stock Options and Warrants.   (a) Before the Closing,
the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee of
the Board of Directors of the Company administering the Company Stock Plans)
shall adopt such resolutions and take all such other actions as may be
necessary to provide that each Company Stock Option granted under the
Company\'s Employee Stock Option Plan or the Stock Option Plan for Non-
Employee Directors (together, the "Company Stock Plans"), as the case may be,
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not
then vested or exercisable, shall be canceled as of the Effective Time in
exchange for a lump sum payment in cash equal to the excess, if any, of (i)
the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject

Parent, an offer to purchase, and related consent solicitation to eliminate
certain covenants with respect to, all of the outstanding aggregate principal
amount of 9.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2008 of Barney\'s, Inc.
(the "Senior Notes") on the terms and conditions set forth in Section 2.04(a)
of the Company Disclosure Letter (or as may be agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent) and such other customary terms and conditions as may be
agreed between Parent and the Company (together with the related consent
solicitation, the "Debt Offer"). The Company (i) shall waive any of the
conditions to the Debt Offer (other than that the Merger shall have been
consummated and that there shall be no Restraint that has the effect of
preventing the consummation of the Debt Offer) as may be reasonably requested
by Parent and (ii) shall not, without the written consent of Parent, waive
any condition to the Debt Offer or make any changes to the terms and
conditions of the Debt Offer. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding
sentence, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Section
2.04(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company shall not be required
to amend the terms and conditions of the Debt Offer pursuant to instructions
from Parent if such amendment would decrease the price per Senior Note
payable in the Debt Offer or impose conditions to the Debt Offer in addition
to those set forth in Section 2.04(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter that
are materially adverse to holders of the Senior Notes.   (b) The Company
covenants and agrees that, immediately following the Consent Payment Deadline
(as defined in Section 2.04(a) of the Company Disclosure   7   Letter),
assuming the requisite consents are received, it shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries (as applicable) and the Senior Note Trustee or the
Collateral Agent under the security documents relating to the Senior Notes
(the "Collateral Agent"), as applicable, to, execute (i) a supplemental
indenture to the Indenture, dated April 1, 2003 (the "Indenture"), among
Barneys New York, Inc., certain of its Subsidiaries and Wilmington Trust
Company, as trustee (the "Senior Note Trustee") and (ii) each amendment to
the security documents relating to the Senior Notes, which supplemental
indenture and amendments to the security documents shall implement the
proposed amendments set forth in the Debt Offer Documents and shall become
operative substantially concurrently with the Effective Time, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the conditions to the Debt
Offer). Subject to Section 2.04(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
substantially concurrently with the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to accept for payment and, as promptly as practicable
thereafter, pay for the Senior Notes that have been properly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Debt Offer and in accordance with the Debt Offer
Documents.   (c) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, the
Company shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in
connection with the Debt Offer, including the offer to purchase, related
letter of transmittal and other related documents, including a letter to the
Securities and Exchange Commission in a form customary for fixed price spread
tender offers (collectively, the "Debt Offer Documents"), forms of which
shall be provided by Parent to the Company as promptly as practicable after
the date hereof. Subject to the preceding sentence, Parent and the Company
shall cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Debt Offer
Documents. All mailings to the holders of the Senior Notes in connection with
the Debt Offer shall be subject to prior review and comment by Parent, and no
Debt Offer Document shall be mailed or otherwise distributed to holders of
the Senior Notes without the written consent of Parent, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If at any time prior to the completion
of the Debt Offer any information in or concerning the Debt Offer Documents
is discovered by the Company or Parent, which information should be included
in an amendment or supplement to the Debt Offer Documents to prevent the Debt
Offer Documents from containing any untrue statement of a material fact or
from omitting to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
disseminated to the holders of the Senior Notes.   (d) Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 2.04, the Company shall comply with
the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Exchange
Act"), and any other Law to the extent such Law is applicable in connection
with the Debt Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any applicable Law
conflict with this Section 2.04, the Company shall comply with such
applicable Law and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations
hereunder by such compliance.   8    ARTICLE III   Representations and
Warranties of the Company   Except as set forth in the disclosure letter

numbered representation, warranty or covenant to the extent specified therein

matter in such section is disclosed in such a way as to make its relevance to

development, effect, condition or occurrence (any such item, an "Effect")
that is or is reasonably likely to adversely affect in a material respect the
enterprise value of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or that

obligations under this Agreement or prevents or materially impedes,
interferes with, hinders or delays the consummation of the Merger or any of

Effect to the extent such Effect results from (A) any change in conditions in
the United States, foreign or global economy or capital or financial markets
generally, including any change in interest or exchange rates, (B) any change
in conditions (including any change in general legal, regulatory, political,
economic or business conditions or any change in GAAP) in, or otherwise

price of the Company Common Stock (but not any Effect underlying such
decline), (D) the negotiation, execution, announcement or pendency of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including any impact

suppliers, distributors, partners or employees, (E) any act of terrorism or

the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, from such events is
disproportionate to the effect from such events on other persons generally
operating in the retail, apparel and accessories industry or (F) any action
taken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with the written consent of
Parent; it being understood and agreed that   9   for purposes of Section

arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)),

15   that (i) all information (both financial and non-financial) required
to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and (ii) all
such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company\'s management
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect
to such reports.   (g) Since February 1, 2003, the Company has not received
any notification of (i) a "significant deficiency" or (ii) a "material

ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or by Principal Stockholders\' Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby or thereby and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this
Agreement, the Principal Stockholders\' Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.   (b) In addition to and
without limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company undertakes and agrees to file as promptly as practicable after the
date hereof, a Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act with the United
States Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice (and shall file as promptly as practicable any
form or report required by any other Governmental Authority relating to
antitrust, competition, trade or other regulatory matters). Each of Parent
and the Company shall (i) respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries
or requests received from any Governmental Authority for
additional information or documentation and (ii) not extend any waiting
period under the HSR Act or enter into any Contract with any Governmental
Authority not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except with the written consent of the other parties hereto. Parent and the
Company shall take any and all commercially reasonable steps necessary to
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, competition
or trade law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect
to the Merger so as to enable the Effective Time to occur as promptly as
reasonably practicable and to avoid any suit or proceeding that would
otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the Effective Time;
provided, however, that Parent shall not be required to, and the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall not, without the written consent of Parent, agree or
proffer to divest or hold separate, enter into any licensing or similar
arrangement with respect to, or take any other action with respect to (A) any
of the properties, other assets (whether tangible or intangible) or any
portion of any business of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) any of
the properties, other assets (whether tangible or intangible) or any portion
of any business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than, in the
case of this clause (B), any such action that is not reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect. Each party hereto shall (x) promptly notify
the other party of any written communication to that party or its Affiliates
from any Governmental Authority and, subject to applicable Law, permit the
other party to review in advance any proposed written communication to any of
the foregoing, (y) not agree to participate, or to permit its Affiliates to
participate, in any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental
Authority with respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry concerning
this Agreement or the Merger unless it consults with the other party in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority,
gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat, and
(z) furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings
and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof)
between them and their Affiliates and their respective Representatives, on
the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of their respective
staffs, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger.  
38    Section 6.04. Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.   (a)
Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring as of or
prior to the Effective Time (and any rights relating to the advancement of
expenses) existing as of the date hereof in favor of the current or former
directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(each, an "Indemnitee") as provided in their respective certificates of
incorporation or by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) and
indemnification Contracts in existence as of the date hereof between the
Company or its Subsidiaries and any of them shall be assumed by the Surviving
Corporation, without further action, as of the Effective Time and shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms. Such rights shall not be amended, or otherwise modified in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights of the Indemnitees, unless
such modification is required by Law. In addition, the Surviving Corporation
shall pay any related expenses of any Indemnitee under this Section 6.04(a)
as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (including
expenses incurred to determine whether indemnification or exculpation is
available), provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides
an undertaking to repay such advances to the extent required by applicable
Law. Parent shall take any and all actions necessary to ensure that the
Surviving Corporation complies with and honors the foregoing obligation as in
effect on the date hereof, including providing funds, if necessary, to permit
the Surviving Corporation to comply with its obligations under this Section
6.04(a).   (b) Parent, from and after the Effective Time, shall cause (i)
the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation to
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to the limitation of
certain liabilities of directors, officers, employees and agents and
indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the
Company Certificate and the Company By-laws and (ii) the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws (or similar organizational documents) of each
Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to the limitation of certain liabilities of directors,
officers, employees and agents and indemnification than those in effect as of
the date hereof and set forth in the certificate of incorporation or by-laws
(or similar organizational documents) of the applicable Subsidiary of the
Company, which provisions, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees.   (c) For six years after
the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, obtain and maintain director\'s and officers\' liability insurance with
respect to acts, errors or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
("Run-Off Insurance"). Such Run-Off Insurance shall (i) solely be negotiated
and implemented by the Parent or its agents, (ii) provide coverage for each
person or entity covered by the Company\'s current directors and officers
liability insurance policy as in effect on the date hereof, (iii) not be
cancelable by the Parent, its agents or the Surviving Corporation during the
six year term of such Run-Off Insurance and (iv) be no less favorable
with respect to coverage terms and amounts in any material respect than
the   39   Company\'s current directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance policy as in effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that in
no event shall Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation
be obligated or required to pay annualized aggregate premiums for insurance
under this Section 6.04(c) in excess of 275% of the amount of the aggregate
premiums paid by the Company for the period from February 28, 2004 to, and
including, February 28, 2005, for such purpose (which premiums for such
period are hereby represented and warranted by the Company to be $429,250);
provided that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage
as may be obtained for such 275% amount. Subject to this Section 6.04(c), the
Parent or its agents shall have the right to substitute the insurance company
providing the Company\'s current director\'s and officer\'s liability
insurance policy with another financially sound insurance company.   (d)
The provisions of this Section 6.04 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her Representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may
have by contract or otherwise.   (e) In the event that the Surviving
Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person,
then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made
so that the successor and assign of the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, assumes the obligations set forth in this Section 6.04.   (f) The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.04
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
any Indemnitee to whom this Section 6.04 applies without the consent of the
affected Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom
this Section 6.04 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section
6.04).   Section 6.05. Fees and Expenses. All fees and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement, the Principal Stockholders\' Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall
be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the
Merger or any such other transaction is consummated, it being understood that
Parent shall pay all of the filing fees for the premerger notification and
report forms under the HSR Act.   Section 6.06. Public Announcements.
Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and give
each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or
other public statements with respect to this Agreement, the Principal
Stockholders\' Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, including the Debt Offer, and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement without the consent of the
other party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except
as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or
national securities quotation system. The parties   40   agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by
the parties.   Section 6.07. Employee Matters.   (a) For a period of not
less than twelve months after the Effective Time, Employees who continue
their employment after the Effective Time ("Affected Employees") shall
receive employee benefits substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
Company Plans listed on Section 3.14(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter
according to their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding for all purposes stock-based plans and other equity-based
compensation arrangements). Notwithstanding the foregoing, for a period of
not less than less than 18 months after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain the Barneys New York
Severance Plan with respect to Affected Employees and not to amend such plan
in a manner that is adverse to any Affected Employee.   (b) For purposes of
any applicable waiting period, vesting eligibility and benefit entitlement
(but excluding benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan),
following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to,
recognize each Affected Employee\'s service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time as service with Parent and its
Affiliates in connection with any tax-qualified pension plan, 401(k) savings
or other retirement plan and welfare benefit plan (including paid time off,
vacations and holidays) maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates in
which such Affected Employee participates, but only (i) to the extent such
service was recognized under a comparable plan of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) to the extent the recognition of such
service would not result in a duplication of benefits. Parent shall, or shall
cause its Affiliates to, waive any pre-existing condition
exclusions, evidence of insurability provisions, waiting period requirements
or any similar provision under any of the welfare plans maintained by Parent
or any of its Affiliates in which Affected Employees participate following
the Effective Time to the extent such limitations and restrictions were
waived or satisfied under the applicable Company Plan immediately prior to
the Effective Time. In addition, Affected Employees shall receive credit for
any co-payments, deductibles and annual out-of-pocket expenses incurred under
the welfare plans of the Company or any of its Affiliates during the calendar
year in which the Effective Time occurs, but prior to the Effective Time, for
purposes of the corresponding co-payments, deductibles and annual out-of-
pocket expenses under welfare plans of Parent or any of its Affiliates for
the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs.   (c) Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to
cause the transactions contemplated by Section 2.03 and any other
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby by
each individual who is a director or officer of the Company, to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.   41    (d) Nothing
contained in this Section 6.07 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be
construed to prevent, from and after the Effective Time, the termination of
employment of any individual Affected Employee or any change in the
particular employee benefits available to any such individual
Affected Employee or the amendment or termination of any particular Company
Plan or Company Benefit Agreement in accordance with the terms of such
Company Plan or Company Benefit Agreement.   ARTICLE VII   Conditions

None of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any
condition set forth in Section 7.01, 7.02 or 7.03, as the case may be, to be

Waiver   Section 8.01. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated, and

Agreement  under this clause 8.01(b)(i) shall not be available to any party
hereto  whose action or failure to act has been a principal cause of or
resulted  in the failure of the Merger to occur on or before such date and
such  action or failure to act constitutes a breach of this Agreement; or
(ii)  if any Restraint having the effect set forth in Section 7.01(c) shall
be  in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable;   (c) by
Parent, (i) if the Company shall have materially breached or  failed to
perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or  agreements set

Company.   Section 8.02. Effect of Termination. In the event of termination
of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section

effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub
or the Company, other than the provisions of Section 3.23, Section 4.09, the
last sentence of Section 6.02, Section 6.05, this Section 8.02 and Article
IX, which provisions shall survive such termination, and except to the extent
that such termination results from the willful breach by a party of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement.   Section 8.03. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by
the parties hereto at any time before or after receipt of the Stockholder
Approval; provided, however, that after such approval has been obtained,
there shall be made no amendment without obtaining the further approval of
the stockholders of the Company if such further approval is required by Law.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of each of the parties hereto.   45    Section 8.04.
Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may
(i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other parties, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto
or (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein; provided, however, that, after the Stockholder Approval has been
obtained, there shall be granted no extension or waiver without obtaining the
further approval of the stockholders of the Company if such further approval
is required by Law in connection with such extension or waiver. Any agreement
on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Any
such waiver shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent inaccuracy or noncompliance. The failure or delay of any party
to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement
or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights nor shall any
single or partial exercise by any party to this Agreement of any of its
rights under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such
rights or any other rights under this Agreement.   Section 8.05. Procedure
for Termination, Amendment or Waiver. A termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.01, an amendment of this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.03 or an extension or waiver of any provision of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.04 shall, in order to be effective, require (i) approval by the
board of directors of each party hereto that is required to act in connection
with such termination, amendment, extension or waiver pursuant to Section
8.01, 8.03 or 8.04, as the case may be, and (ii) to the extent required by
Section 8.03 or 8.04, approval by the Company\'s stockholders.   ARTICLE
IX   General Provisions   Section 9.01. Nonsurvival of Representations and
Warranties. None of the representations and warranties in this Agreement or
in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the
Effective Time. This Section 9.01 shall not limit any covenant or agreement

Effective Time.   Section 9.02. Notices. Except for notices that are
