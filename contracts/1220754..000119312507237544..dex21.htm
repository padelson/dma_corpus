viii _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made as of
November 6, 2007, by and among Charter LCI Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), The Providence Service Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), PRSC Acquisition Corporation, a
Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("
_Merger Sub_ "), and, only with respect to those Sections of this Agreement
expressly applicable to it, CLCI Agent, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company, as the representative of the Sellers and certain other persons
identified in _Section 9_ hereof (the " _Stockholders  Representative_").

_Background_

A. Merger Sub is a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Parent intends to
acquire the Company on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

B. The stockholders, option holders and warrant holders of the Company are
collectively referred to herein as the " _Sellers_ ".

C. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desires to enter into a
transaction whereby Merger Sub will merge with and into Company (the "
_Merger_ "), with the Company being the surviving entity. In the Merger, each
issued and outstanding share of the Companys Class A common stock, par value
$.01 per share, and Class B Common Stock, par value $.01 per share
(collectively, " _Company Common Stock_ "), other than the Dissenting Shares
(as defined in  _Section 2.7(a)_ hereof), will be converted into the right
to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration (as defined in _Section
1.5(a)_ hereof).

D. The respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have each
approved this Agreement and the Merger in accordance with the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), and determined
that the Merger is advisable. Parent has adopted this Agreement and approved
the Merger on behalf of Merger Sub, as the sole member of Merger Sub, and in
accordance with the DGCL.

E. The Companys Board of Directors has recommended the Merger and this
Agreement for approval by the Companys stockholders (the " _Company
Recommendation_ "), and the Companys stockholders will adopt this Agreement
and approve the Merger.

F. Certain senior executives of the Company have, simultaneously with the
execution of this Agreement, entered into certain "Terms of Employment"
agreements with the Surviving Entity, which agreements include
confidentiality, noncompetition and nonsolicitation covenants, to be
effective upon the Closing (as defined in _Section 1.2_ hereof) in
consideration for the substantial and valuable consideration such senior
executives will receive upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and to protect the goodwill and confidential, proprietary and
trade secret information of the Surviving Entity (as defined in _Section 1.1_
hereof). _Agreement_

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

1\. _The Merger_.

1.1 _Structure of the Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, Merger Sub shall
be merged with and into the Company, and the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease, at the Effective Time (as defined in _Section 1.3_
hereof). Following the Effective Time, the Company shall be the surviving
entity (the " _Surviving Entity_ "), shall become a direct, wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent, and all the rights and obligations of the Merger Sub
shall be vested in the Company in accordance with the DGCL.

1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions
to closing contained in _Sections 5_ and _6_ hereof, the closing of the Merger
(the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be specified by
the parties (the " _Closing Date_ "), which shall be no later than the second
business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
_Sections 5_ and _6_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions), unless another time or date is agreed to by the parties hereto.
The Closing will be held at the offices of Blank Rome LLP, Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania or at such other location as is agreed to by the parties hereto.

1.3 _Effective Time_. At, and subject to, the Closing, the parties shall
cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger in
substantially the form attached to this Agreement as _Exhibit A_ (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") executed in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such
time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware, or at such subsequent date or time as Parent and the
Company shall agree and as so specified in the Certificate of Merger (the
time at which the Merger becomes effective being hereinafter referred to as
the " _Effective Time_ ").

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
Section 259 of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at
and after the Effective Time: (i) the Surviving Entity shall possess all of
the rights, privileges, powers and franchises, and be subject to all the
restrictions, disabilities and duties of each of the Merger Sub and the
Company; (ii) all the rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises,
of a public as well as of a private nature, and all property, real, personal
and mixed, and all debts due on whatever account, including, without
limitation, all choses in action, and all and every other interest of or
belonging to or due to either the Merger Sub or the Company shall be taken
and deemed to be transferred to, and vested in, the Surviving Entity without
further act or deed; and all property, rights and privileges, immunities,
powers and franchises and all and every other interest shall be thereafter as
effectually the property of the Surviving Entity as they were of either Merger
Sub or the Company prior to the Effective Time; and (iii) subject to the terms
of this Agreement, all debts, liabilities, duties and obligations of the
Company shall become the  



 

2  debts, liabilities, duties and obligations of the Surviving Entity, and the
Surviving Entity shall thenceforth be responsible and liable for all the
debts, liabilities, duties and obligations of the Company, and the rights of
creditors of the Company shall not be impaired by the Merger, and may be
enforced against the Surviving Entity.

1.5 _Merger Consideration; Escrow Fund_.

(a) Subject to adjustment as set forth in _Sections 2.4_ and _2.5_ below, and
payable in accordance with _Section 1.5(h)_, the aggregate merger
consideration to be paid by Parent and Merger Sub at Closing for all
the outstanding Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options and Company
Warrants shall be an amount equal to the difference between (i) $220,000,000
and (ii) the sum of (1) the Closing Date Net Indebtedness (defined below)
and (2) the Company Transaction Expenses (defined below). The result of the
calculation in the preceding sentence shall be increased by the amount of the
Estimated Working Capital Surplus, if any, or decreased by the amount of the
Estimated Working Capital Deficit, if any (such consideration, in the
aggregate and as adjusted, the _"Merger Consideration"_ ).

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock or shares of capital
stock of Merger Sub, said shares shall be converted as follows:

(c) _Capital Stock of the Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
the capital stock of the Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one
fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock, $0.001 par value per
share, of the Surviving Corporation, so that after the Effective Time, Parent
shall be the holder of all of the issued and outstanding shares of the
Surviving Corporation. 

(d) _Cancellation of Company-Owned Stock_. Any shares of Company Common Stock
that are owned by the Company shall be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist without any conversion thereof.

(e) _Capital Stock of the Company_. Each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with
_Section 1.5(d)_ above and any Dissenting Shares) shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into the right to receive an amount equal to (i) the quotient of (A) the sum
of (1) the Merger Consideration, _plus_ (2) the aggregate exercise price of
the Company Stock Options, _plus_ (3) the aggregate exercise price of the
Company Warrants, _divided by_ (B) the sum of (1) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
_plus_ (2) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of the Company Stock Options outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, _plus_ (3) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of the Company Warrants outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (the _"Common Stock Merger Consideration"_ ), and (ii)
any additional amounts as may be payable pursuant to _Sections 2.4_ and _2.5_
below. All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and  



 

3  shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such
shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive (i) the Common Stock Merger Consideration ( _less_ the _pro rata_
portion of the Escrow Fund) in consideration therefor upon the surrender of
such certificate in accordance with _Section 2.1_ hereof, _plus_  (ii) any
additional amounts as may be payable pursuant to _Sections 2.4_ and _2.5_
below. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, in no event
will the aggregate amounts paid to Sellers exceed the Merger Consideration
plus any additional amounts as may be payable pursuant to _Sections 2.4_ and
_2.5_ below.

(f) _Company Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each then outstanding
option to purchase Company Common Stock, whether vested or unvested (a
_"Company Stock Option"_ ), will be cancelled and exchanged into the right to
receive, immediately after the Effective Time, the Option Consideration,
which shall be payable immediately after the Effective Time by delivery of (i)
shares of common stock of Parent, par value $.001 per share (the " _Parent
Common Stock_ "), as further described on _Exhibit B_ and (ii) any additional
amounts as may be payable pursuant to _Sections 2.4_ and _2.5_ below.
Following the Effective Time, there shall be no outstanding Company Stock
Options. For purposes of this Agreement, the term _"Option Consideration"_
means an amount equal to (i) the Common Stock Merger Consideration _multiplied
by_ the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the
Company Stock Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
_less_ (ii) the aggregate exercise price of such Company Stock Options for
such shares.

(g) _Company Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each then outstanding warrant
to purchase Company Common Stock (a _"Company Warrant"_ ), will be cancelled
in exchange for the right to receive an amount equal to (i) the Common Stock
Merger Consideration _multiplied by_ the number of shares of Company Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of the Company Warrants outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, _less_  (ii) the aggregate exercise price of
such Company Warrants for such shares (the " _Warrant Consideration_ "), and
(iii) any additional amounts as may be payable pursuant to _Sections 2.4_ and
_2.5_ below. Following the Effective Time, there shall be no outstanding
Company Warrants and any payment required pursuant to this _Section 1.5(g)_
in connection with any Company Warrants shall constitute a part of the Merger
Consideration. 

(h) An amount equal to (1) the Merger Consideration _less_ (2) the Option
Consideration shall be payable in cash at the Closing.

(i) $11,178,000 in cash of the Merger Consideration payable to holders of
Company Common Stock and Company Warrants (the  _"Escrow Fund"_ ), shall be
deposited at the Closing with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as escrow
agent (the _"Escrow Agent"_ ) in accordance with an escrow agreement dated as
of the Closing Date in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_
(the _"Escrow Agreement"_ ) by and among Parent, the Escrow Agent and the
Stockholders Representative.

meanings:

(i) _"Closing Date Indebtedness"_ means the Indebtedness (as defined in
_Section 3.12(c)_ hereof) of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis as of the close of business on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date.



 

4 (ii) _"Closing Date Net Indebtedness"_ means the difference between (a)
the Closing Date Indebtedness and (b) cash and cash equivalents (but not
including any restricted cash) of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis as of the close of business on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date. _ _

(iii) _"Company Transaction Expenses"_ means the unpaid out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred by the Company in furtherance of this Agreement and the
Merger, including Brokers Fees (as defined below), the DandO Tail Premium, the

Plan in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), any
employee or consultant of the Company and its Subsidiaries upon consummation
of the Merger. " _Company Transaction Expenses_ " shall not include any
Management Transaction Expenses.

1.6 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Entity_. The
certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of
incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving Entity until thereafter changed
or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law (as defined in _Section
3.1_ hereof). 

1.7 _Directors and Officers_. The directors of Merger Sub shall, from and
after the Effective Time, become the directors of the Surviving Entity until
their successors shall have been duly elected, appointed or qualified or until

the Company shall, from and after the Effective Time, become the officers of
the Surviving Entity until their successors shall have been duly elected,

in accordance with the certificate of formation and operating agreement of
the Surviving Entity.

1.8 _Pre-Closing Delivery of Information_. No later than two business days
prior to the scheduled Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a
true and correct schedule detailing the Companys calculation of the Merger
Consideration payments in  _Section 1.5_ hereof (including the Merger
Consideration payable to each Seller) to be made at Closing (the " _Merger
Consideration Statement_ "). Such statement shall be attached to this
Agreement as _Schedule 1.8_ of the Disclosure Schedule.

1.9 _Recalculation of Merger Consideration_. Within 10 days after the final
determination of the 2008 Audited Financial Statements and the statement of
2008 Adjusted EBITDA, if the Earn-Out Payment (or any portion thereof) is
earned, then the amount of such payment to be paid to each Seller pursuant to
_Section 2.5_ shall be determined in accordance with _Schedule 1.9_ of the
Disclosure Schedule.



 

5 2\. _Certain Effects of the Merger; Post Closing Adjustments._

2.1 _Exchange Procedures._

(a) Parent will deposit, on or before the Effective Time with the
Stockholders Representative, cash sufficient to pay immediately following the
Effective Time (the _"Exchange Fund"_ ), and Parent shall instruct the
Stockholders Representative to timely pay, the aggregate Merger
Consideration payable at the Closing (net of the amount required to be
contributed to the Escrow Fund). At Parents sole discretion, the
Stockholders Representative shall invest any cash included in the Exchange
Fund so long as such investment would not delay payment to any Seller. Parent
shall be required to restore any loss to the Exchange Fund resulting from such
investments of cash and any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent or its designee.

(b) Parent shall cause the Stockholders Representative to deliver, at the
Effective Time, to each holder of record of a certificate(s) which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock (" _Company Stock Certificates_ ") whose shares are to be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section
2.1_, and to each holder of a Company Warrant: (i) a letter of transmittal in
substantially the form attached to this Agreement as _Exhibit D_  (the "
_Transmittal Letter_ "), and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering the
Company Stock Certificate(s) and the warrant agreements, or for providing
separate stock powers to the extent that such Company Stock Certificates are
already in the Companys possession, in exchange for the allocable portion of
the Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon surrender
of such certificate. No interest shall accrue on the Merger Consideration
payable upon the surrender of the Company Stock Certificates or warrant
agreements for the benefit of, or be paid to, the holders of the Company Stock
Certificates or holders of Company Warrants, as the case may be. Parent and
the Company shall reasonably cooperate to facilitate delivery of Transmittal
Letters and related instructions to the Company (which the Company may
disseminate to its stockholders) sufficiently in advance of Closing so as to
enable the Companys stockholders and warrant holders to deliver completed
materials to the Stockholders Representative within such a time frame as will
permit receipt by such stockholders of any cash payments due on the Closing
Date.

(c) Upon surrender to the Stockholders Representative of its Company Stock
Certificate(s), accompanied by a properly completed Transmittal Letter, (i) a
holder of Company Common Stock will be entitled to receive, promptly after the
Effective Time, the Merger Consideration, without interest, in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by its Company Stock
Certificate(s). Until so surrendered, each such Company Stock Certificate
shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to
receive the allocable portion of the Merger Consideration to be paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such certificate(s). If requested by
any holder of shares of Company Common Stock, the Stockholders Representative
shall make the foregoing cash payment by wire transfer on the Closing Date, if
the Stockholders Representative shall have received the materials required
by this Section and otherwise within two business days after receipt of the
required materials by the Stockholders Representative.

  

 

6 (d) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a person other
than the person in whose name a Company Stock Certificate so surrendered is
registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that such Company Stock
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer, and the person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Stockholders Representative any transfer or other similar taxes required as a
result of such payment to a person other than the registered holder of such
Company Stock Certificate, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Stockholders Representative that such tax has been paid or is not payable.
Parent or the Stockholders Representative shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent,
the Company or the Stockholders Representative are required to deduct and
withhold under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law, with
respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so
withheld by Parent or the Stockholders Representative, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Stockholders
Representative.

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective
Time, Company Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving Entity, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged for the allocable portion of the Merger
Consideration, without interest, in accordance with the procedures set forth
in this  _Section 2_.

(f) At any time following the six month anniversary of the Effective Time,
Parent shall be entitled to require the Stockholders Representative to
deliver to it any remaining portion of the Exchange Fund that was deposited
with the Stockholders Representative at the Effective Time (including any
interest received with respect thereto and other income resulting from
investments by the Stockholders Representative, as directed by Parent
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ above), and stockholders shall be entitled to
look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Laws) with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of
their Company Stock Certificates, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor the Stockholders
Representative shall be liable to any holder of a Company Stock Certificate
for Merger Consideration (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto)
or cash from the Exchange Fund in each case delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(g) In the event any Company Stock Certificates shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Company Stock Certificate(s) to be lost, stolen or destroyed and
upon agreeing to indemnify Parent against any claim that may be made against
it or the Surviving Entity with respect to such Company Stock Certificate(s),
the Stockholders Representative will issue the Merger Consideration, without
interest, deliverable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificates.



 

7 (h) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option shall have been cancelled
and exchanged into Parent Company Stock as described on _Exhibit B_ attached
hereto.

(i) At the Effective Time, subject to the delivery of an
appropriate Transmittal Letter, each holder of Company Warrants shall receive
from the Stockholders Representative the applicable Warrant Consideration (
_less_ the _pro rata_ portion of the Escrow Fund) into which the Company
Warrants shall have been converted pursuant, and subject to, the provisions
of _Section 1.5(f)_ hereof.

2.2 _Registration of Parent Common Stock_. The shares of Parent Common Stock
to be issued in connection with the Earn-Out Payment (as defined in _Section
2.5_ hereof), if any, will be issued in a transaction exempt from registration
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), by
reason of Section 4(2) thereof. So long as shares of Parent Common Stock
having an aggregate value in excess of $1,000,000 are issued in connection
with the Earn-Out Payment, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to prepare and file as promptly as practicable, and, in any event, within 30
days following the Earn-Out Payment Date, a registration statement (the "
_Registration Statement_ ") with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
" _SEC_ ") covering the resale of such shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
connection with the Earn-Out Payment, and Parent shall use commercially
reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become
effective as promptly as practicable after filing; _provided_ that Parent may
(i) postpone (one-time only) filing of the Registration Statement for a period
not to exceed 60 days if required in order for Parent to satisfy the SECs
financial statement requirements for the Registration Statement and (ii)
postpone (one-time only) effectiveness of the Registration Statement for a
period not to exceed 60 days after the date it has been advised by the SEC
that it has no further comments on the Registration Statement if the board of
directors of Parent determines in good faith that such effectiveness would
materially and adversely affect Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
shall have no obligation to register any shares of Parent Common Stock under
this _Section 2.2_ if (i) such shares are eligible for sale pursuant to Rule
144(k) of the Securities Act, or any successor rule, without any limitation as
to volume or (ii) such shares have been publicly sold. Parents obligation in
the preceding sentence to file the Registration Statement within 30 days is
subject to the condition that the holders of Company Common Stock provide
Parent promptly, but in no event more than five days after the Earn-Out
Payment Date, all information relating to them requested by Parent for
inclusion in the Registration Statement, and such obligation of Parent to file
the Registration Statement shall be postponed to the extent of any delay in
providing such information. Parent shall pay all costs and expenses incident
to the performance of its obligations pursuant to this _Section 2.2_ (other
than the costs of any advisors to the holders of Parent Common Stock). Parent
shall indemnify and hold harmless each holder of the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be registered pursuant to this _Section 2.2_ (and each of such
holders officers, directors, agents, employees and each person controlling
such holder) against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities (including
reimbursement of legal expenses) arising out of or based on any untrue
statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any
amendment thereto) and any prospectus contained therein (or amendment or
supplement thereto), or based on any omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
in light of the circumstances in which they were made not misleading  



 

8  ( _provided, however,_ that Parent will not be liable in any such case to
the extent that (i) any such claim, loss, damage, liability or expense arises
out of or is based on any untrue statement or omission based upon written
information furnished to Parent by an instrument duly executed by such holder
and stated to be specifically for use therein), (ii) use of a prospectus
during a period after Parent has notified the holders of Parent Common Stock
in writing of the suspension of the use of such prospectus, (iii) failure of
such holder to deliver a prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, as
required by applicable laws; _provided_ that Parent shall have delivered to
such holder such prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, or (iv) any
loss, liability, claim, damage or expense which, in the case of this _clause
(iv)_ , is finally judicially determined to have resulted from the gross
negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of any such party seeking
indemnification. Each holder of Parent Common Stock, severally, but not
jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Parent, (and each of Parents
officers, directors, agents, employees and each person controlling Parent)
against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities (including reimbursement
of legal expenses) described in the indemnity described above but only
with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements
or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or
any prospectus included therein (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in
reliance upon and in conformity with written information with respect to such
holder furnished to Parent by or on behalf of such holder expressly for use in
the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or such prospectus (or
any amendment or supplement thereto); _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
holder shall be liable for any claims hereunder in excess of the amount of net
proceeds received by such holder from the sale of Parent Common Stock pursuant
to such Registration Statement. Each indemnified party shall give notice as
promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action or
proceeding commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought
hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve
such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not
materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve
it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this
indemnity agreement. In case any such action, claim, suit, investigation or
proceeding shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify
the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying
party shall be entitled to participate therein and to assume the defense
thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that any such action,
claim, suit, investigation or proceeding includes both an indemnified party
and the indemnifying party, and such indemnified party reasonably concludes
that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties
that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying
party, or if the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense of the
action, claim, suit, investigation or proceeding, in either case in a timely
manner, then such indemnified party may employ separate counsel to represent
or defend it in any such action, claim, suit, investigation or proceeding and
the indemnifying party will pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such
counsel; _provided, further,_ that the indemnifying party will not be required
to pay the fees and disbursements of more than one counsel for
all indemnified parties (and one separate local counsel). In any action,
claim, suit, investigation or proceeding the defense of which the indemnifying
party assumes, the indemnified party will have the right to participate in
such litigation and to retain its own counsel at such indemnified partys own
expense. No indemnifying party shall (i) without the prior written consent of
the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to
any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by  



 

9  any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim
whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought
under this _Section 2.2_ (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual
or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent
(1) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all
liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim
and (2) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault,
culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party or
(ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). If
the indemnification provided for in this _Section 2.2_ is for any reason
unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in
respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to
therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount
of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such
indemnified party, as incurred, in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative fault of Parent on the one hand and the holders on the
other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in
such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of Parent on the one
hand and the holders on the other hand shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates
to information supplied by Parent, or by the holders and the parties relative
intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or
prevent such statement or omission as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. In no event shall any holder of Parent Common Stock be liable
pursuant to this _Section 2.2_ for an amount in excess of the amount of net
proceeds received by such holder from the sale of Parent Common Stock pursuant
to such Registration Statement, unless Parent is liable for such excess amount
as a result of an untrue statement or omission based upon written information
furnished to Parent by such holder and stated to be specifically for use in
such Registration Statement.

2.3  _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company, the officers and directors of the
Company and the Surviving Entity are fully authorized in the name of their
respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful
and necessary action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with this
Agreement.

11 (d) Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall have 30 days following
receipt of the Proposed Closing Statement during which to notify the other
party of any dispute of any item contained in the Proposed Closing Statement,
which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such dispute.

(e) If the Stockholders Representative or Parent does not notify the other
party of any such dispute within such 30-day period, the Proposed Closing

(f) If either the Stockholders Representative or Parent does notify the
other party of any such dispute within such 30-day period, the Final Closing
Statement shall be resolved as follows:

(i) Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall cooperate in good faith
to resolve any such dispute as promptly as possible.

(ii) In the event Parent and the Stockholders Representative are unable to
resolve any such dispute within 15 days (or such longer period as Parent and
the Stockholders Representative shall mutually agree in writing) of notice
of such dispute, such dispute shall be submitted to, and all issues having a
bearing on such dispute shall be resolved by a national accounting firm that

Arbitrator) and deliver it to Parent and the Stockholders Representative
within 10 days after the resolution of such objections. Such revised balance
sheet shall be deemed the Final Closing Statement.

(g) For purposes of determining the information on the Final Closing
Statement, the parties may take into consideration all facts which are known
prior to the final determination of the Final Closing Statement.



 

12 (h) To the extent there is a Working Capital Deficit on the Final Closing

15 (d) The Earn-Out Payment shall be paid by Parent in cash; _provided_ that,
subject to Parent obtaining the approval of its stockholders of such issuance
in accordance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350 (the " _Necessary Approval_
"), each Seller shall have the right to elect to receive up to 50% of its _pro
rata_  share of the Earn-Out Payment (as set forth on _Schedule 1.9_ of the
Disclosure Schedule) in the form of shares of Parent Common Stock. Parent
agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Necessary
Approval at the first meeting of the stockholders of Parent following the
date of this Agreement. If Parent fails to obtain the Necessary Approval and a
Seller elects to receive a portion of such Sellers _pro rata_ share of the
Earn-Out Payment in the form of shares of Parent Common Stock, then Parent
shall pay such portion of the Earn-Out Payment to such Seller in cash in an
amount equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
such Seller would have received if the Necessary Approval had been obtained
by Parent, _multiplied by_ (ii) the volume weighted average of the price per
share of the Parents Common Stock for the 20 trading days immediately
preceding the Earn Out Payment Date (such closing price, the " _Earn Out
Payment Per Share Price_ "), _provided, however,_ that the Earn Out Payment
Per Share Price shall not exceed the product of (i) 2.0, _multiplied by_ (ii)
the Signing Per Share Price. Each Seller shall, within 10 days after final
determination of the 2008 Audited Financial Statements and the statement of
2008 Adjusted EBITDA, notify the Stockholders Representative in writing as to
such Sellers election. Parent shall, within two business days following the
expiration of such 10-day period (the _"Earn-Out Payment Date"_ ), (i) pay an
amount equal to the aggregate cash portion of the Earn-Out Payment by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account or accounts
designated by the Stockholders Representative and (ii) provide notice to the
transfer agent for Parent to deliver to each Seller who has made an election
to receive a portion of its Earn-Out Payment in shares of Parent Common Stock
certificates representing such shares. Upon the receipt of the cash payment
referred to in clause (i) above, the Stockholders Representative shall
disburse promptly such amount to the Sellers in accordance with their
respective pro rata ownership in the Company immediately prior to the Closing.
For the purposes of this _Section 2.5_, the value of each share of Parent
Common Stock shall be equal to $31.42 (the " _Signing Per Share Price_ ").

(e) During the period from the Effective Time until December 31, 2008,
subject to Parents policies, procedures and practices generally applicable
to all of its subsidiaries, and in the absence of the Companys and its
Subsidiaries EBITDA for any two consecutive calendar quarters being less than
80% of the budgeted EBITDA for such calendar quarters, each of Parent and the
Surviving Entity will (except with respect to borrowed Indebtedness
(including, without limitation, any convertible debt), tax reporting and
payments, the provision of services or products provided by Parent generally
for the benefit of its subsidiaries and operations resulting from an
integration plan between Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries, the
development of which is participated in by the chief executive officer of the
Company), (i) operate the business of the Surviving Entity and its
Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business consistent with the past
practice of the Company and (ii) refrain from removing material assets or
material contracts from the business of the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries consistent with the past practice of the Company. Parent
shall refrain from intentionally taking any actions intended to reduce 2008
Adjusted EBITDA for the purpose of reducing the amount of the Earn-Out
Payment.



 

16 (f) If a Change of Control occurs during the period from the Effective Time
until the Earn-Out Payment Date which ascribes an enterprise value to the
Company of in excess of $220,000,000, then, regardless as to whether the Earn-
Out Payment would otherwise be payable, Parent shall pay to the Stockholders
Representative (for prompt disbursement by the Stockholders Representative
to the Sellers in accordance with their respective _pro rata_ ownership in the
Company immediately prior to the Closing) the full amount of the Earn-Out
Payment ($40,000,000). For the avoidance of doubt, the occurrence of a Change
of Control at an enterprise value of less than $220,000,000 shall not release
Parent of its obligations under this _Section 2.5_ if the Earn-Out Payment
otherwise becomes due and payable.

(g) Promptly following any acquisition by Parent of any entity engaged in the
transportation brokerage business during the period from the Closing
Date until December 31, 2008, Parent hereby agrees that its Board of
Directors shall, in good faith, recalculate the original performance targets
(the " _New Performance Targets_ ") used to determine the Earn-Out Payment
to appropriately reflect such acquisition, with such New Performance Targets
to be subject to the approval of the Stockholders Representative, such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the
Stockholders Representative disapproves of the New Performance Targets, a
dispute will be deemed to exist and Parent may submit the New Performance
Targets to the Arbitrator and all such disputes with respect to the New
Performance Targets shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures set
forth in _Section 2.5(c)_.

2.6 _Seller Matters_. By his, her or its execution of this Agreement, each
Seller executing this Agreement, in his, her or its capacity as a stockholder
of the Company, hereby approves and adopts this Agreement and authorizes the
Company, its directors and officers to take all actions necessary for
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and its Exhibits. Such execution shall
be deemed to be action taken by the written consent of each Seller for
purposes of Section 228 of the DGCL. As a result of this approval, each
Seller also confirms that he, she or it is no longer entitled to any appraisal
rights pursuant to the DGCL.

2.7 _Appraisal Rights._

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has exercised such
holders appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, and who,
as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such
appraisal rights ( _"Dissenting Shares"_ ), shall not be converted into or
represent a right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration, but the
holder of the Dissenting Shares shall only be entitled to such appraisal
rights as are granted pursuant to the DGCL.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of  _Section 2.7(a)_ above, if any holder
of shares of Company Common Stock who demands his, her or its appraisal rights
with  



 

17  respect to such shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure
to perfect or otherwise) his, her or its rights to receive payment for the
fair market value of such shares under Section 262 of the DGCL, then, as of
the later of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, such holders
shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to
receive the applicable Merger Consideration upon surrender of the
certificate(s) representing such shares.

and the Code and the regulations and rulings thereunder, except for non-
compliances which would not be materially adverse to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.



 

32 (e) Each Benefit Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has
received a favorable determination or opinion letter from the Internal
Revenue Service with respect to its qualified status under the Code, including
all amendments to the Code effected by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and
subsequent legislation, the application for such letter was accurate and
complete in all material respects, and nothing has occurred since the date of
such letter that would adversely affect the qualified status of such Benefit
Plan.

(f) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary, any Benefit Plan, any trust
created thereunder, nor, to the Knowledge of the Knowledgeable Sellers,
any trustee or administrator thereof has engaged in a transaction in
connection with which the Company or any Subsidiary, any Benefit Plan, any
such trust, or any trustee or administrator thereof, or any party dealing with

under any Benefit Plan has an exercise price that has been or may be less than

may be) as of the date such option was granted or has any feature for the
deferral of compensation that could render the grant subject to Section 409A
of the Code.

affecting enforcement of creditors rights generally, (ii) as limited by Laws

4.5 _Required Consents_. Except as contemplated hereby, no agreement or other
instrument binding upon Parent or Merger Sub requires a consent or other
action by any person as a result of the execution, delivery and performance of

aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parents business (as presently conducted and as currently proposed to be
conducted), operations, results of operations, properties or financial
condition or prevent the consummation of, or materially delay Parents
or Merger Subs ability to perform its obligations hereunder or to
consummate, the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger).

Stock within the meaning of Section 4(2) of the Securities Act, other than as
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) make any offers or sales of any security
or solicit any offers to buy any security under circumstances that would

not cured within 30 days of written notice thereof; or

(d) by the Company, if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached any of its

Stockholders Representative and hold him harmless against any loss, liability
or expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the

hereof), and the Escrow Agent and Parent shall be entitled to rely upon any
such notice, communication, decision, action, failure to act within a
designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or
instruction as being a notice or communication to or by, or a decision,
action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent,

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Parent or Merger Sub
in this Agreement; or



 

60 (b) any breach of, or failure to timely perform, any of the covenants or
agreements made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement.

10.3 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

(a) Neither the Acquiror Indemnified Persons nor the Target Indemnified
Persons may recover in respect of any claim for indemnification as a result
of any breach of any representation or warranty in accordance with _Sections
10.1(a)_ , _10.1(f)_ or _10.2(a)_ , respectively, unless and until the
Indemnifiable Losses in accordance with _Sections 10.1(a)_ , _10.1(f)_ or 
_10.2(a)_ , respectively, have been incurred, paid or accrued in an aggregate
amount greater than $1,400,000 (the " _Indemnification Threshold_ "). Once the

Statement), _Section 3A.1_ (Power and Authorization), _Section 3A.4_
(Capital Stock) and _Section 4.3_ (Authority, Authorization and

in no event shall the Indemnification Threshold apply to any Indemnifiable

10.1(b)_ , _(c)_ , _(d)_ , or  _(e)_ or (ii) any Target Indemnified Person
pursuant to _Section 10.2(b)_.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Acquiror Indemnified Persons may not recover in respect of any claim for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.1(e)_ unless and until the
Indemnifiable Losses pursuant to  _Section 10.1(e)_ have been incurred, paid
or accrued in an aggregate amount greater than $250,000 (the " _Litigation
Indemnification Threshold_ "). Once the Litigation Indemnification Threshold
has been exceeded with respect to claims for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 10.1(e)_, the Acquiror Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to
recover all Indemnifiable Losses as a result of a claim for indemnification
pursuant to _Section 10(e)_ incurred, paid or accrued by them in excess of
the Litigation Indemnification Threshold. From and after the Effective Time,
the General Counsel of the Company and his or her staff, at the direction of

10.1(a)_ or  _10.1(f)_ above will not exceed $19,100,000 (the " _Seller
Indemnification Cap_ "); _provided, however,_ that the Seller Indemnification
Cap shall not apply with respect to Indemnifiable Losses resulting from a
breach of _Section 3.2_ (Capitalization and Voting Rights of the Company),
_Section 3.3_ (Capitalization and Voting Rights of the Subsidiaries),
_Section 3.5_ (Authority, Authorization and Enforceability), the fourth
sentence of _Section 3.20(a)_ (Taxes), _Section 3.30_ (Votes Required and
Obtained), _Section 3.32_ (Merger Consideration Statement), _Section 3A.1_
(Power and Authorization) and _Section 3A.4_ (Capital Stock), for which
purposes the Seller Indemnification Cap shall be deemed to be the Merger
Consideration actually received by the Sellers. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall the Seller Indemnification
Cap apply to any Indemnifiable Loss suffered by any Acquiror Indemnified
Person pursuant to _Sections 10.1(b)_ , _(c)_ , _(d)_ or _(e)_ , for which
purposes the Seller Indemnification Cap shall be deemed to be the

resulting from a breach of _Section 4.3_ (Authority, Authorization and
Enforceability). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
in no event shall the Parent Indemnification Cap apply to any Indemnifiable
Loss suffered by any Target Indemnified Person pursuant to _Section 10.2(b)_.

(d) The period during which claims for indemnification under this _Section
10_ may be initiated shall commence upon the date hereof and terminate at 5:00

by written notice from Parent to Stockholders Representative or from
Stockholders Representative to Parent, as the case may be, setting forth the
nature of the claim in reasonable detail, including the estimated amount of
the claim, prior to expiration of the Claim Period shall not terminate until
the claim is finally resolved. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the right of

(Power and Authorization), _Section 3A.4_ (Capital Stock) shall survive until
the applicable statute of limitation date plus 90 days. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the right of the Target Indemnified Persons to assert an
indemnification claim for a breach of _Section 4.3_ (Authority, Authorization
and Enforceability) shall survive until the applicable statute of limitation

contained in this Agreement shall survive the consummation of the Merger and
continue until the expiration of the Claim Period, after which time such
representations and warranties shall terminate, except that claims with
respect to any breach of any representation or warranty initiated prior to
the expiration of the Claim Period in accordance with the foregoing do not
terminate until such claims are finally resolved.

(e) All calculations of Indemnifiable Losses shall take into account any
insurance proceeds actually received by the applicable Indemnified Person
in connection with the matter out of which such Indemnifiable Losses arose.
Indemnification payments under  



 

62  this _Section 10_ shall be paid without reduction for any Tax benefits
available to the applicable Indemnified Person; _provided, however,_  that,
to the extent that a Indemnified Person recognizes Tax benefits with respect
to any Indemnifiable Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
_Section 10_, such Indemnified Person shall pay the amount of such Tax
benefits to the Obligated Person as such Tax benefits are actually recognized
by such Indemnified Person.

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein, the limitations set forth in _Sections
10.3(a)_ , _(b)_ , _(c)_ and _(d)_ as applicable (i) to the Company and
Sellers, shall not be applicable in the case of fraud on the part of the
Company or any of the Sellers, and (ii) to Parent, shall not be applicable in
the case of fraud on the part of Parent.

(g) For purposes of this _Section 10_, the determination of whether any
representation, warranty or covenant has been breached shall give effect to a
Material Adverse Effect qualification or other materiality qualification
contained in the representation, warranty or covenant. Once a representation,
warranty or covenant has been breached, the amount of Indemnifiable Losses
arising out of such breach shall be determined without giving effect to any
Material Adverse Effect qualification or other materiality qualification. 

10.4 _Release of Indemnity Escrow Fund; Reduction of Option Values_. Subject
to the limitations set forth in this  _Section 10_, (a) (i) the Escrow Fund
(or any portion thereof) and (ii) reductions in the value of the shares of
Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to the Stock Option Cancellation and
Exchange Agreements, in an aggregate amount equal to $822,000, shall be used
to satisfy Indemnifiable Losses of the Acquiror Indemnified Persons under this
_Section 10_ as provided in the Escrow Agreement and the Option Holder
Agreements, respectively, and (b) the Escrow Fund (or any portion thereof)
shall be released to the Acquiror Indemnified Persons or the Stockholders
Representative, as applicable, as provided in the Escrow Agreement.

10.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. Subject to the specific terms of this Agreement,
absent fraud on the part of the Company or any of the Sellers,
the indemnification provided for in this _Section 10_ and specific
performance as applicable to any matters for which the remedy of specific
performance or injunctive relief are available shall be the sole and exclusive
post-Closing remedies available to Parent, the Surviving Entity and the other
Acquiror Indemnified Persons for any claims arising in connection with the
Merger or in connection with, under or based upon this Agreement. Subject to
the specific terms of this Agreement, absent fraud on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub, the indemnification provided for in this _Section 10_ and
specific performance as applicable to any matters for which the remedy of
specific performance or injunctive relief are available shall be the sole and
exclusive post-Closing remedies available to the Target Indemnified Persons
for any claims arising in connection with the Merger or in connection with,
under or based upon this Agreement, and in any case, neither Parent
nor Merger Sub shall be liable for an amount exceeding the Merger
Consideration.

10.6 _Indemnification Procedures_. In the case of any claim or litigation
asserted by any Target Indemnified Person or any Acquiror Indemnified Person,
as the case may be (which person asserting a claim is referred to as an "
_Indemnified Person_ "), written notice setting forth the nature of the claim
or litigation in reasonable detail (including the estimated



 

63  amount of the claim or litigation) shall be given by the Indemnified Person
to Parent or the Stockholders Representative, as the case may be, as
the agent of the party or parties required to provide indemnification (the "
_Obligated Person_ ") as soon as practicable after such Indemnified Person has
actual knowledge of the claim or litigation as to which indemnity may
be sought; _provided, however,_ that the failure by any Indemnified Person to
give such notice shall not relieve the Obligated Person of its indemnification
obligation under this Agreement except and only to the extent that such
Obligated Person is actually and materially prejudiced or damaged as a result
of such failure to give notice.

(b) In the case of any claim or litigation as to which Parent (or any
Acquiror Indemnified Person) is the Indemnified Person and which, if
successfully asserted, would be reasonably likely to exceed the Seller
Indemnification Cap, Parent shall have the right to elect to assume and
control the defense of any such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom
(at the expense of the Obligated Person) for a period of 30 days from its
receipt of or giving of, as the case may be, written notice pursuant to
_Section 10.6(a)_ above. If Parent does not make a timely written election
to assume and control the defense of any such claim or litigation as described
above, then the Obligated Person shall assume and control the defense of such
claim or litigation (at its own expense). 

(c) In the case of any claim or litigation as to which Parent (or any Acquiror
Indemnified Person) is the Indemnified Person and which is not reasonably
likely to exceed the Seller Indemnification Cap, the Stockholders
Representative, on behalf of the Obligated Person, shall assume and control
the defense of such claim or litigation (at its own expense).

(d) In the case of any claim or litigation as to which Parent is the Obligated
Person, Parent shall assume and control the defense of such claim
or litigation (at the expense of Parent).

(e) With respect to any such claim or litigation for which an Obligated Person
assumes and controls the defense thereof pursuant to this _Section 10.6_,
the Obligated Person shall have the full right to defend against any such
claim or litigation; _provided, however,_ that Obligated Person shall not
enter into any settlement or compromise that provides for injunctive or other
non-monetary relief affecting the Indemnified Person or that does not include
a provision whereby the plaintiff or claimant in the matter releases the
Indemnified Person from all liability with respect thereto unless the
Obligated Person obtains prior written consent of the Indemnified Person
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding
the assumption of the defense of any such claim or litigation by an Obligated
Person, the Indemnified Person may participate in such defense at its own
expense. The Indemnified Person shall have the right to employ separate
counsel and to participate in the defense of such claim or litigation,
and the Obligated Person shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses
of such separate counsel if (i) the Indemnified Person shall have determined
in good faith that an actual or likely conflict of interest makes
representation by the same counsel or the counsel selected by the Obligated
Person inappropriate or (ii) the Obligated Person shall have authorized the
Indemnified Person to employ separate counsel at the Obligated Persons
expense.



 

64 (f) With respect to any claim or litigation for which Parent, as the
Indemnified Person, makes a timely written election to assume and control the
defense thereof pursuant to Section 10.6(b), Parent shall have the full right
to defend against any such claim or litigation (at the expense of the
Obligated Person); _provided, however,_ that Parent shall not enter into any
settlement or compromise unless Parent obtains prior written consent of the
Obligated Person (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

(g) Each party shall give its full reasonable cooperation to the party
defending any claims subject to indemnification hereunder. Such cooperation
shall include using commercially reasonable efforts toward (i) furnishing
and, upon request, procuring the attendance of potential witnesses for
interview, preparation, the submission of witness statements and the giving of
evidence at any related hearing; (ii) promptly furnishing documentary
evidence to the extent available to it or its Affiliates; and (iii) providing
access to any other relevant party, including any agents of or advisers to the
parties as reasonably needed. In no event shall an Indemnified Person enter
into any settlement or compromise of any claim or litigation as to which an
Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnity hereunder without the prior
written consent of the Obligated Person. In any event, the Indemnified Person
and the Obligated Person and their counsel shall cooperate in the defense of
any such claim or litigation subject to this Section 10 and keep such persons
informed of all material developments relating to any such claim
or litigation, subject to privilege limitations or potential or actual
conflicts of interest, and provide copies of all relevant correspondence and
documentation relating thereto.

writing, by Parent, the Company and Sellers holding a majority of the Company

without the further approval of such stockholders.

11.8 _Severability_. If one or more provisions of this Agreement are held to
be unenforceable under applicable Law, such provision shall be excluded from
this Agreement and the balance of this Agreement shall be interpreted as if
such provision were so excluded and shall be enforceable in accordance with
its terms.

11.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents referred to herein
constitute the entire agreement among the parties and no party shall be
liable or bound to any other party in any manner by any warranties,
representations, or covenants except as specifically set forth herein or
therein.

further instruments and to take such further action as may reasonably be
necessary to carry out the intent of this Agreement.

 

11.11 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall bind, benefit, and be enforceable by
and against Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, Stockholders Representative and
their respective successors and consented-to assigns. No party shall in any
manner assign any of its, his or her rights or obligations under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties; _provided_

signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, no failure to exercise, delay in exercising, or
single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy by any party, and no

power or remedy.

11.13 _References_. All words used in this Agreement shall be construed to be
of such number and gender as the context requires or permits. References to:

organization or other entity; (ii) the term "business day" shall means any
day other than a Saturday, a Sunday or a legal holiday on which banks in the
States of New York are not open; (iii) an "Affiliate" of any person means
another person that directly, or indirectly through one or more
intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with,
such first person, where "control" means the possession, directly or
indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management
policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by
Contract, as trustee or executor, or otherwise, (iv) "party" shall mean
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Sellers or with respect  



 

68  to Sections 9 and 11 of this Agreement, the Stockholders Representative,
(v) "hereof," "hereby," "hereunder" and "herein" shall mean this Agreement as
a whole and not any particular provision of this Agreement and (vi)
"including," "includes" or "include" shall mean including without limitation.

11.14 _Jurisdiction and Process_. In any Action between or among any of the

object to the removal of such Action to any federal court located in the State
of Delaware, (iii) each of the parties irrevocably waives the right to trial

occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

11.16 _Neutral Construction_. In view of the fact that each of the parties
hereto has been represented by its own counsel and this Agreement has been
fully negotiated by all parties, the legal principle that ambiguities in a
document are construed against the draftsperson of that document shall not
apply to this Agreement.

11.17 _Survival of Obligations_. Except when another time period is specified
herein, all of the covenants of the parties set forth in this Agreement shall
survive until they have been performed in full or waived in writing by the
party entitled to the benefit of such performance.
