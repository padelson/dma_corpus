which such financial institutions have agreed to provide, subject only to the terms and conditions therein, debt financing in the amounts set forth therein (being collectively referred to as the &#147;<U>Debt Financing</U>&#148; and, together with

purposes set forth in such Debt Commitment Letter. The Company is an express third-party beneficiary of the Equity Funding Letter, which provides that Parent and the Guarantors will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or
other equitable relief in connection with the exercise of such third-party beneficiary rights in accordance with the terms of the Equity Funding Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, neither of the Financing Letters has been amended or modified,
no such amendment or modification is contemplated, none of the respective commitments contained in such letters have been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect and no such withdrawal, termination or rescission is contemplated; provided,
that the existence or exercise of any &#147;market flex&#148; provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter shall not be deemed to constitute a modification or amendment of the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent or Merger Sub has fully paid or
caused to be paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid by it in connection with the Financing Letters that are payable on or prior to the date hereof. Assuming the Financing is funded in accordance with the Financing Letters
on the Closing Date, the net proceeds contemplated by the Financing Letters (after netting out applicable fees, expenses, original issue discount and similar premiums and charges and after giving effect to the maximum amount of flex (including
original issue discount flex) provided under the Debt Commitment Letter) will in the aggregate be sufficient for Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (and any repayment or refinancing of debt
contemplated by, or required in connection with the transactions described in, this Agreement, the Equity Funding Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter) and any other amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the Transactions
(including all amounts payable in respect of Company Stock Options, Company RSUs and Company RSAs under this Agreement) and to pay all related fees and expenses of Parent and Merger Sub (collectively, the &#147;<U>Required Amount</U>&#148;). The
Financing Letters are (x)&nbsp;legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, and, to Parent&#146;s and Merger Sub&#146;s knowledge, each of the other parties thereto, (y)&nbsp;enforceable in accordance with their
respective terms against Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, and each of the other parties thereto, in each case except as such enforceability may be limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception, and (z)&nbsp;in full force and effect. As of the

knowledge, any other parties thereto under the Equity Funding Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions contained in Section 7.3(a) and 7.3(b), Parent does not have any
reason to believe that (i)&nbsp;it or any of the other parties to the Financing Letters will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the Financing Letters required to be satisfied by it, (ii)&nbsp;the conditions thereof will

which they are entitled. The parties acknowledge and agree that (i)&nbsp;the provisions set forth in Section&nbsp;8.3 and Section&nbsp;10.10(c) shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any party&#146;s right to specific
enforcement and (ii)&nbsp;the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. The parties hereto agree not to assert that a remedy
of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. Time
shall be of the essence for purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to a valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section&nbsp;8.1, it is explicitly agreed that the right of the Company to
seek and obtain an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief enforcing Parent&#146;s and Merger Sub&#146;s obligations to cause (x)&nbsp;the Equity Financing to be funded to fund the Merger or (y)&nbsp;cause Parent and Merger Sub
to consummate the Merger (but not the right of the Company to such injunctions, specific performance or other equitable remedies for any other reason) shall be subject to the following conditions being satisfied: (A)&nbsp;the conditions set forth in
Section&nbsp;7.1 and Section&nbsp;7.2 (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which shall be capable of being satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied at the time the Closing would have
occurred and remain satisfied, but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded, (B)&nbsp;the Debt Financing (including any alternative financing that has been obtained in accordance with Section&nbsp;6.14(b)) has been funded in accordance
with the terms thereof or will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing if the Equity Financing were to be funded at the Closing and (C)&nbsp;the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that if specific
performance is granted and the Debt Financing and the Equity Financing are funded, then it would take such actions required of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing to occur. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled
to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parent&#146;s or Merger&#146;s obligation to consummate the Merger if the Debt Financing (including any alternative financing that has been obtained in accordance with Section&nbsp;6.14(b)) has not been
funded (or will not be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing were to be funded at the Closing). </P>

proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself,
create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had

completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or officer of the corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed
to serve, at the request of the corporation, as a director, officer, partner, employee or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan), or
by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees) and, to the extent permitted by law, amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of
Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation, except
that no indemnification shall be made under this Section&nbsp;2 in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which Indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation, unless, and only to the extent, that the Court of Chancery of
Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of such liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnity for such expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees) which the Court of Chancery of Delaware or such other court shall deem proper. </P>

the extent that an Indemnitee has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 1 and 2 of Part B of this Article VI, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, or on
appeal from any such action, suit or proceeding, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees) actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection therewith. </P>

such Indemnitee must notify the corporation in writing as soon as practicable of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving such Indemnitee for which indemnity will or could be sought. With respect to any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation of which the corporation is so notified, the corporation will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense and/or to assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee. After

so to assume such defense, the corporation shall not be liable to Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, other than as provided below in this Section&nbsp;4. Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his or her own counsel in connection with such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
incurred after notice from the corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of Indemnitee unless (i)&nbsp;the employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been authorized by the corporation, (ii)&nbsp;counsel to Indemnitee
shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest or position on any significant issue between the corporation and Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such action, suit, proceeding or investigation or (iii)&nbsp;the
corporation shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel for Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the corporation, except as
otherwise expressly provided by this Article VI. The corporation shall not be entitled, without the consent of Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any claim brought by or in the right of the corporation or as to which counsel for Indemnitee shall
have reasonably made the conclusion provided for in clause (ii)&nbsp;above. The corporation shall not be required to indemnify Indemnitee under this Article VI for any amounts paid in settlement of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation
effected without its written consent. The corporation shall not settle any action, suit, proceeding or investigation in any manner which would impose any penalty or limitation on Indemnitee without Indemnitee&#146;s written consent. Neither the

proceeding or investigation or any appeal therefrom shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such matter; provided, however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in advance of the
final disposition of such matter shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall ultimately be determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified
by the corporation as authorized in this Article VI; and provided further that no such advancement of expenses shall be made under this Article VI if it is determined (in the manner described in Section&nbsp;6) that (i)&nbsp;Indemnitee did not act
in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation, or (ii)&nbsp;with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his or her
conduct was unlawful. Such undertaking shall be accepted without reference to the financial ability of Indemnitee to make such repayment. </P>

of expenses pursuant to Section&nbsp;1, 2, 3 or 5 of Part B of this Article VI, an Indemnitee shall submit to the corporation a written request. Any such advancement of expenses shall be made promptly, and in any event within 60 days after receipt
by the corporation of the written request of Indemnitee, unless (i)&nbsp;the corporation has assumed the defense pursuant to Section&nbsp;4 of Part B of this Article VI (and none of the circumstances described in Section&nbsp;4 of Part B of this
Article VI that would nonetheless entitle the Indemnitee to indemnification for the fees and expenses of separate counsel have occurred) or (ii)&nbsp;the corporation determines within such <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">60-day</FONT> period that
Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section&nbsp;1, 2 or 5 of Part B of this Article VI, as the case may be. Any such indemnification, unless ordered by a court, shall be made with respect to requests under
Section&nbsp;1 or 2 only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination by the corporation that the indemnification of Indemnitee is proper because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section&nbsp;1 or 2, as
the case may be. Such determination shall be made in each instance (a)&nbsp;by a majority vote of the directors of the corporation consisting of persons who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question
(&#147;disinterested directors&#148;), whether or not a quorum, (b)&nbsp;by a committee of disinterested directors designated by majority vote of disinterested directors, whether or not a quorum, (c)&nbsp;if there are no disinterested directors, or
if the disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel (who may, to the extent permitted by law, be regular legal counsel to the corporation) in a written opinion, or (d)&nbsp;by the stockholders of the corporation. </P>

expenses as granted by this Article VI shall be enforceable by Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction. Neither the failure of the corporation to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification is
proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the corporation pursuant to Section&nbsp;6 of Part B of this Article VI that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of

establishing Indemnitee&#146;s right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any suit brought by Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification

Section&nbsp;7 of Part B of this Article VI, the corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee pursuant to this Article VI in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee unless the initiation thereof was approved by
the Board of Directors or is a successful proceeding by such Indemnitee to enforce such Indemnitee&#146;s right to indemnification under this Certificate of Incorporation or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article VI, the
corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee to the extent such Indemnitee is reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, and in the event the corporation makes any indemnification payments to an Indemnitee and such Indemnitee is subsequently
reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, such Indemnitee shall promptly refund indemnification payments to the corporation to the extent of such insurance reimbursement. </P>

or investigation arising out of or relating to any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of such amendment, termination or repeal. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Other Rights</U>. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Article VI shall not be

action in Indemnitee&#146;s official capacity and as to action in any other capacity while holding office for the corporation, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer, and shall inure to the benefit of the
estate, heirs, executors and administrators of Indemnitee. Nothing contained in this Article VI shall be deemed to prohibit, and the corporation is specifically authorized to enter into, agreements with officers and directors providing
indemnification rights and procedures different from those set forth in this Article VI. In addition, the corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by its Board of Directors, grant indemnification rights to other employees or
agents of the corporation or other persons serving the corporation and such rights may be equivalent to, or greater or less than, those set forth in this Article VI. </P>
