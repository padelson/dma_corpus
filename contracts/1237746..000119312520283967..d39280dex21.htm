WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and

to the terms and conditions set forth in the Voting Agreement, to vote or
cause to be voted certain shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by
them in favor of the Merger, adopting this Agreement and any other actions

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
Parent, the Merger Sub and the Company, intending to be legally bound, hereby
agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, the Merger Sub shall merge
with and into the Company at the Effective Time.

   

1.2 _Effective Time of the Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, as soon
as practicable on the Closing Date, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
cause a certificate of merger or other appropriate documents (in any such
case, the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be duly prepared, executed and
acknowledged in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and filed
with the Secretary of State. The Merger shall become effective upon the due
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State or at such
subsequent time or date as the Parent and the Company shall agree and specify
in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

1.3 _Closing_. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent
permitted by applicable law) of the conditions set forth in Article VII, the
Closing shall take place remotely by exchange of documents and signatures (or
their electronic counterparts) as soon as practicable (but in any event no
later than the second Business Day) following the day on which the last to be
satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of such conditions) shall be satisfied
or waived in accordance with this Agreement, or at such other date, time or
place as the parties hereto shall agree in writing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time), then
the Closing shall occur instead on the date following the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions that is the earlier to occur of (a) any Business Day
during the Marketing Period as may be specified by Parent on no less than two
(2) Business Days prior notice to the Company and (b)  one (1) Business Day
following the final day of the Marketing Period.

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time (a) the separate
existence of the Merger Sub shall cease, the Merger Sub shall be merged with
and into the Company and the Company shall continue as the Surviving
Corporation in the Merger and (b) the certificate of incorporation of the
Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended
and restated in its entirety to read as set forth on _Exhibit A_ , and as so
amended and restated shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter further amended in accordance with the
DGCL. In addition, subject to Section 6.6(b) hereof, the Parent shall cause
the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to be amended and restated in their
entirety so that, immediately following the Effective Time, they are identical
to the bylaws of the Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that all references to the name of the Merger Sub
therein shall be changed to refer to the name of the Company, and, as so
amended and restated, such bylaws shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation, until further amended in accordance with the DGCL. The Merger
shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL and in this
Agreement.

1.5 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors
of the Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the
Surviving Corporation, in each case to hold office in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and until
their successors are duly elected and qualified.

 

ARTICLE II

 

TREATMENT OF COMPANY SECURITIES

 

2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, the Merger Sub,
the Parent or the holder of any shares of the capital stock of the Company or
capital stock of the Merger Sub:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of the Merger Sub_. Each share of the common stock, par
value $0.0001 per share, of the Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.0001
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  



2

    

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All shares
of Company Common Stock that are held in the treasury of the Company and any
shares of Company Common Stock owned by any Subsidiary of the Company, the
Parent, the Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of the Parent immediately prior
to the Effective Time (such shares, collectively, "Excluded Shares") shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be paid or
delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Merger Consideration for Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section
2.2, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance
with Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically converted
into the right to receive $9.50, without interest thereon (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) in
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.2.

 

(d) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall
be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split,
reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock
occurring (or for which a record date is established)  after the date hereof
and prior to the Effective Time.

2.2 _Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall (i)
enter into an agreement (in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Company) with the Paying Agent for the Paying Agent to act as paying agent for
the Merger and (ii) deposit with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, for payment through the Paying Agent in accordance with
this Section 2.2, the Payment Fund. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose. The Payment Fund may be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by the Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall
be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most
recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available);
_provided_ , _however_ , that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the
amounts payable hereunder and, subject to Section 2.2(e), the Parent shall
take all actions necessary to ensure that the Payment Fund includes at all
times cash sufficient to satisfy the Parents obligation to pay the Merger
Consideration under this Agreement. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments (net of any losses) shall be paid to the Parent pursuant
to Section 2.2(e). Subject to 2.2(e), in the event the Payment Fund
is diminished below the level required for the Paying Agent to make prompt
cash payments as required under Section 2.2(b), including any such
diminishment as a result of investment losses, the Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, immediately deposit additional cash into
the Payment Fund in an amount equal to the deficiency in the amount required
to make such payments.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) Promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) after the
Effective Time, the Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall (1)
be prepared prior to the Closing, (2) specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in
Section 2.2(g)) to the Paying Agent, and (3) otherwise be in such form and
have such provisions as the Parent and the Company may reasonably agree), and
(B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.2(g)) in exchange
for the Merger 

 



3

    

 Consideration payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.2(g)) to the
Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be promptly paid in exchange
therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to (1) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.2(g))
multiplied by (2) the Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder
of Uncertificated Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article
II. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Uncertificated
Shares shall, upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message" in
customary form with respect to any Uncertificated Share (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), be
promptly paid the Merger Consideration in respect of such Uncertificated
Share, and such Uncertificated Share shall forthwith be cancelled.

 

(c) _Interest; Transfers; Rights Following the Effective Time_. No
interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of
such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares which is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to
a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated
Shares is registered, if, in the case of a Certificate, such Certificate is
presented to the Paying Agent, and in each case the transferor provides to
Paying Agent (i) all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer
and (ii) evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate and
all Uncertificated Shares (other than Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
representing Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.1(c).

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All
Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates and cancellation
of Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed
to have been paid in satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled
and exchanged as provided in this Article II, subject to Section 2.2(e). No
dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the Effective Time will
be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares.

(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates and Uncertificated Shares
for one (1) year after the Effective Time (including all interest and other
income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to
it) shall be delivered to the Parent, upon demand, and any holder of a
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares who has not previously complied with this
Section 2.2 shall be entitled to receive only from the Parent or the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other
similar laws) payment of its claim for Merger Consideration, without interest.

 

(f) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of the
Parent, the Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any
amount required to be delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 



4

    

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent
shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented thereby pursuant to this Agreement. Parent or the
Paying Agent may, in its reasonable determination and as a condition precedent
to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such reasonable and
customary amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against Parent or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

2.3 _Company Stock Plans_.

 

(a) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-
outstanding and unexercised Company Stock Option shall vest in full. If any
such Company Stock Option is not exercised prior to the Effective Time, then
at the Effective Time such Company Stock Option shall automatically be
canceled and converted into the right to receive from the
Surviving Corporation an amount of cash equal to the product of (i) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock then underlying such Company Stock
Option multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over
the exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option, without any
interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding. The aggregate
amount payable by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to the preceding sentence
shall be paid, net of any applicable withholding Taxes, by the Parent to the
Surviving Corporation on the Closing Date for distribution by the Surviving
Corporation through, to the extent applicable, the Surviving Corporations
payroll to the holders of Company Stock Options, without any interest thereon
and subject to all applicable withholding Taxes, upon the later of (A) five
(5) Business Days after the Closing Date and (B) the date of the Companys
first regularly scheduled payroll after the Closing Date. In the event that
the exercise price of any Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be canceled, without any
consideration being payable in respect thereof, and have no further force or
effect.

(b) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company
RSU, other than a Specified RSU, that is then outstanding and unvested shall
vest in full. Each Company RSU, other than a Specified RSU, that is
outstanding as of the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount
of cash equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock then underlying such Company RSU multiplied by (B) the Merger
Consideration (the " _RSU Consideration_ "). The aggregate amount payable by
the Surviving Corporation pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be paid,
net of any applicable withholding Taxes, by the Parent to the Surviving
Corporation on the Closing Date for distribution by the Surviving Corporation
through, to the extent applicable, the Surviving Corporations payroll to the
holders of Company RSUs, without any interest thereon and subject to all
applicable withholding Taxes, upon the later of (i) five (5) Business
Days after the Closing Date and (ii) the date of the Companys first
regularly scheduled payroll after the Closing Date.

 

(c) Each Specified RSU shall automatically be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the RSU Consideration the
holder of the Specified RSU would have received had the Specified RSU been a
Company RSU payable pursuant to Section 2.3(b) (the " _Specified RSU
Consideration_ "), _provided_ , that the payment of the Specified RSU
Consideration shall be made at the same time(s) that the Specified RSUs would
have vested in accordance with their terms and will remain subject to the

vesting upon a termination of the holders employment in connection with or
following the Merger shall continue to apply to the Specified RSU
Consideration), _provided_ _further_ that the Company may modify the dates
upon which the Specified RSU Consideration will be paid as set forth on
Schedule 2.3(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The Surviving Corporation

multiplied by (B) the Merger Consideration. The aggregate amount payable by
the Surviving Corporation pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be paid,
net of any applicable withholding Taxes, by the Parent to the
Surviving Corporation on the Closing Date for distribution by the Surviving
Corporation through, to the extent applicable, the Surviving Corporations
payroll to the holders of Company RSAs, without any interest thereon and

Business Days after the Closing Date and (ii) the date of the Companys first
regularly scheduled payroll after the Closing Date.

times from and after the Effective Time sufficient liquid funds to satisfy
its obligations pursuant to Section 2.3(a), Section 2.3(b), Section 2.3(c) and

(f) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall mail to each Person who is a holder of Company Stock Options,
Company RSUs (including Specified RSUs) or Company RSAs a letter describing
the treatment of and payment for such equity awards pursuant to this Section
2.3 and providing instructions for use in obtaining payment therefor;

Company shall provide a copy of such letter to Parent for review and shall
consider Parents comments in good faith.

 

(g) The Parent and the Company may agree to treat equity compensation held
by Company employees subject to non-U.S. law in a manner other than that
contemplated above in this Section 2.3 to the extent permitted under the terms
of the applicable Company Stock Plan and related award agreement and necessary
to take into account applicable non-U.S. law or Tax or employment
considerations; provided that in no event shall any Company Stock Options,
Company RSUs, or Company RSAs remain outstanding following the

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1, but shall be
cancelled and any Certificate or Uncertificated Shares representing Dissenting
Shares shall represent only such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a
holder of Dissenting Shares.

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such
(through failure to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the
Effective Time or the date of loss of such status, such shares shall thereupon
be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1, without
interest, and shall not thereafter be deemed to be Dissenting Shares.

 

(c) The Company shall give the Parent: (i) prompt notice of any written
demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to the DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand,
notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to the DGCL that relates to such demand; and (ii) the opportunity to

6

    

 for an amount in excess of the Merger Consideration prior to the Effective
Time with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument unless the Parent
shall have given its written consent to such payment or settlement offer,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

2.5 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Parent, the Merger Sub, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or any other
recipient of payments hereunder any amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
other applicable state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld, (a) such amounts shall be timely remitted by the Parent, the
Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the
case may be, to the applicable Governmental Entity and (b) such amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder or other recipient in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made.

 2.6 _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right,
title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, then the directors and officers of
the Surviving Corporation shall be fully authorized to take all such lawful
and necessary action.

21

    

 required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they shall be made, not
misleading in any material respect.

 

4.4 _Operations of the Merger Sub_. The Merger Sub was formed solely for
the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
has engaged in no other business activities and has conducted its operations
only as contemplated by this Agreement.

 

4.5 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete
copies, including all exhibits and schedules thereto, of (a) the executed
commitment letter, dated as of November 1, 2020 (the " _Equity Funding Letter_
"), from the Guarantors, pursuant to which the Guarantors have agreed to make
an equity investment in Parent, subject only to the terms and conditions
therein, in cash in the aggregate amount set forth therein (the " _Equity
Financing_ "), and (b) the executed commitment letter and Redacted Fee Letter,
dated as of November 1, 2020 (collectively, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "
and, together with the Equity Funding Letter, the " _Financing Letters_ "),
among Merger Sub and the financial institutions party thereto, pursuant
to which such financial institutions have agreed to provide, subject only to
the terms and conditions therein, debt financing in the amounts set forth
therein (being collectively referred to as the " _Debt Financing_ " and,
together with the Equity Financing, collectively referred to as the "
_Financing_ ") for purposes of, among other things, financing the
Transactions, the related fees and expenses to be incurred by Parent in
connection therewith and for the other purposes set forth in such Debt
Commitment Letter. The Company is an express third-party beneficiary of the
Equity Funding Letter, which provides that Parent and the Guarantors will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
relief in connection with the exercise of such third-party beneficiary rights
in accordance with the terms of the Equity Funding Letter. As of the date of
this Agreement, neither of the Financing Letters has been amended or
modified, no such amendment or modification is contemplated, none of the
respective commitments contained in such letters have been withdrawn,
terminated or rescinded in any respect and no such withdrawal, termination or
rescission is contemplated; provided, that the existence or exercise of any
"market flex" provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter shall not be
deemed to constitute a modification or amendment of the Debt Commitment
Letter. Parent or Merger Sub has fully paid or caused to be paid any and all
commitment fees or other fees required to be paid by it in connection with the
Financing Letters that are payable on or prior to the date hereof. Assuming
the Financing is funded in accordance with the Financing Letters on the
Closing Date, the net proceeds contemplated by the Financing Letters (after
netting out applicable fees, expenses, original issue discount and similar
premiums and charges and after giving effect to the maximum amount of flex
(including original issue discount flex) provided under the Debt Commitment
Letter) will in the aggregate be sufficient for Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (and any repayment or
refinancing of debt contemplated by, or required in connection with the
transactions described in, this Agreement, the Equity Funding Letter or the
Debt Commitment Letter) and any other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions (including all amounts
payable in respect of Company Stock Options, Company RSUs and Company RSAs
under this Agreement) and to pay all related fees and expenses of Parent and
Merger Sub (collectively, the " _Required Amount_ "). The Financing Letters
are (x) legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent and Merger Sub, as
applicable, and, to Parents and Merger Subs knowledge, each of the other
parties thereto, (y) enforceable in accordance with their respective terms
against Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, and each of the other parties
thereto, in each case except as such enforceability may be limited by the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception, and (z) in full force and effect. As of
the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or, to
Parents or Merger Subs knowledge, any other parties thereto under the
Equity Funding Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date of this
Agreement, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions contained in Section
7.3(a) and 7.3(b), Parent does not have any reason to believe that (i) it or
any of the other parties to the Financing Letters will be unable to satisfy on
a timely basis any term or condition of the Financing Letters required to be
satisfied by it, (ii) the conditions thereof will not otherwise be satisfied
or (iii) the full amount of the Financing needed to fund the Required Amount
will not be available on the Closing Date. The only conditions precedent or
other contingencies (including, if applicable, as related to the "market
flex" provisions) related to the obligations of the Guarantors to

 



22

    

 fund the full amount of the Equity Financing and the lenders to fund the
full amount of the Debt Financing are those expressly set forth in the Equity
Funding Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter, respectively. As of the date
of this Agreement, there are no side letters or other contracts or
arrangements (other than customary engagement and fee credit letters with
respect to any offering of debt securities referenced in the Debt Commitment
Letter, in each case that does not impact the conditionality or amount of the
Financing and would not reasonably be expected to prevent, impair or delay the
consummation of the Financing) to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is
a party related to the funding of all or any portion of the Financing
necessary to fund the Required Amount other than as expressly contained in the
Financing Letters and delivered to the Company prior to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement. 

4.6 _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent
has delivered to the Company the duly executed limited guarantee of the
Guarantors, dated as of the date of this Agreement, in favor of the Company in
respect of Parents obligation to pay the Parent Termination Fee and Parents
and Merger Subs other payment or reimbursement obligations arising under, or
in connection with, this Agreement and the Transactions, up to the aggregate
amount set forth therein (collectively with all exhibits, schedules, annexes
and amendments thereto, the " _Guarantee_ "). The Guarantee is in full force
and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of each Guarantor,
enforceable against such Guarantor in accordance with its terms, and no event
has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or
would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of
any Guarantor under the Guarantee.

 

4.7 _Solvency_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any Guarantor is entering
into this Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either
present or future creditors of Parent, Merger Sub or such Guarantor or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates or of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Assuming satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Parents
and Merger Subs obligation to consummate the Merger, and after giving effect
to the Transactions, any alternative financing incurred in accordance with
Section 6.14 and the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration, any other
repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated in this Agreement or the
Financing Letters, payment of all amounts required to be paid in connection
with the consummation of the Transactions, and payment of all related fees
and expenses of Parent and Merger Sub, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will be Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately after the
consummation of the Transactions. For the purposes of this Agreement, the
term "Solvent", when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any
date of determination, (a) the fair value of the assets of such Person and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, at a fair valuation, will exceed
the debts and liabilities, direct, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, of
such Person and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, (b) the present fair
saleable value of the property of such Person and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis will be greater than the amount that will be required to
pay the probable liability of such Person and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis on their debts and other liabilities, direct, subordinated,
contingent or otherwise, as such debts and other liabilities become absolute
and matured, (c) such Person and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will
not have unreasonably small capital with which to conduct the businesses in
which they are engaged as such businesses are now conducted and are proposed
to be conducted following the Closing Date and (d) such Person and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will be able to pay their debts and
liabilities, direct, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and
liabilities become absolute and matured.

any of their respective "Affiliates" or "Associates" (as those terms are
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) (a) directly or indirectly "owns" (as such
term is defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) or, within the past three (3)
years, has "owned" (as such term is defined in Section 203 of the DGCL)
beneficially or otherwise, any shares of Company Common Stock, any other
securities of the Company or any options, warrants or other rights to acquire
shares of Company Common Stock or other securities of the Company, or any
other economic interest (through derivative securities or otherwise) in the
Company, or (b) has been an "Affiliate" or "Associate" (as those terms are
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) of the Company at any time during the past
three (3) years. Assuming the accuracy of the Companys representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.2(a) and the second sentence of

 



23

    

 Section 3.4(a), the restrictions contained in Section 203 of the DGCL do not
apply to the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

4.9 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no Legal
Proceeding pending and of which the Parent has been notified or, to the
Parents knowledge, threatened against the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
in each case that, individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, there
are no judgments, orders or decrees outstanding against the Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely
to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

4.10 _Other Agreements or Understandings_. There are no contracts,
agreements or other arrangements or understandings (whether oral or written)
or commitments to enter into contracts, agreements or other arrangements or
understandings (whether oral or written) (a) between Parent, the Merger Sub,
the Guarantors or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of
the Companys management or the Company Board, on the other hand, or (b)
pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company would be entitled to receive
consideration of a different amount or nature than the Merger Consideration or
pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company agrees to vote to adopt this
Agreement or approve the Merger or agrees to vote against any Superior
Proposal.

of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

4.12 _Independent Investigation_. Each of the Parent and the Merger
Sub acknowledges that it has conducted to its satisfaction its own
independent investigation and analysis of the business, operations, assets,
liabilities, results of operations, condition (financial or otherwise) and
prospects of the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries and that each of the
Parent and the Merger Sub and its Representatives have received access to such
books and records, facilities, equipment, contracts and other assets of the
Company and the Companys Subsidiaries that it and its Representatives have
desired or requested to review for such purpose, and that it and its
Representatives have had a full opportunity to meet with the management of the
Company and the Companys Subsidiaries and to discuss the business,
operations, assets, liabilities, results of operations, condition (financial
or otherwise) and prospects of the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries.

 

4.13 _No Other Company Representations or Warranties_. The Parent and the
Merger Sub hereby acknowledge and agree that, except for the representations
and warranties set forth in Article III (in each case as qualified and limited
by the Company Disclosure Schedule), (a) none of the Company or any of its

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 6.1 _No Solicitation_.

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. Except as set forth in this Section

Acquisition Proposal.

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, subject to compliance with Section 6.1(c), at any time prior to
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval the Company may (A) furnish non-
public information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to any
Qualified Person (and the Representatives of such Qualified Person), pursuant
to a confidentiality agreement not materially less restrictive with respect to
the confidentiality obligations of the Qualified Person than the
Confidentiality Agreement, provided that such confidentiality agreement shall

prohibit the Company from satisfying its obligations hereunder or (z) require
the Company or its Subsidiaries to pay or reimburse the Company the
counterpartys fees, costs or expenses, (B) engage in discussions or

breach their obligations pursuant to this Section 6.1 and (y) the Company
Board has determined that the failure to take the actions contemplated by this
sentence would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary obligations under applicable law and; and _provided_ , ___further_
, _however_ , that the Company will promptly make available to Parent any non-
public information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that is
provided to any such Person or its Representatives that was not previously
made available to Parent.

 

(b) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_.
Prior to the Specified Time:

 

(i) the Company Board shall not, except as set forth in this Section 6.1,
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to the Parent, the
Company Board Recommendation;

(ii) the Company Board shall publicly reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days after Parent so requests in
writing (it being understood that the Company will have no obligation to make
such reaffirmation on more than three (3) separate occasions);

(iii) the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall not make or fail
to make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender or
exchange offer, other than a recommendation against such offer or a "stop,
look and listen" communication by the Company Board (or a committee thereof)
to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication) (it being
understood that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may refrain from
taking a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until the close of
business on the tenth (10th) Business Day after the commencement of a tender
or exchange offer in connection with such Acquisition Proposal without such
action being considered a violation of this Section 6.1(b) or a Company Board
Recommendation Change);

(iv) the Company Board shall not fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement;

(v) the Company Board shall not, except as set forth in this Section 6.1,
adopt, approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or any proposal
that is reasonably expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal (any action
described in clauses (i) through (v), a " _Company Board Recommendation
Change_ "); and

 



29

    

(vi) the Company shall not enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement
or similar agreement (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") providing
for the consummation of a transaction contemplated by any Acquisition
Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.1(a)
entered into in the circumstances referred to in Section 6.1(a)).

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement (including the provisions of this Section 6.1), at any time
prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to a Superior
Proposal or an Intervening Event if: (i) the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and outside
financial advisor) that the failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations under applicable law; (ii) so long as the Company and its
Subsidiaries are not in material breach of their obligations pursuant to this
Section 6.1 with respect to an Acquisition Proposal underlying such Company
Board Recommendation Change; (iii) the Company has notified the Parent in
writing that it intends to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change,
describing in reasonable detail the reasons for such Company Board
Recommendation Change (a " _Recommendation Change Notice_ ") (it being
understood that the Recommendation Change Notice shall not constitute a
Company Board Recommendation Change or a Trigger Event for purposes of this
Agreement); (iv) if requested by the Parent, the Company shall have made its
Representatives available to negotiate (to the extent that Parent desires to
so negotiate) with the Parents Representatives any proposed modifications to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement during the three (3) Business Day
period following delivery by the Company to the Parent of such Recommendation
Change Notice; and (v) if the Parent shall have delivered to the Company a
written, binding and irrevocable offer to alter the terms or conditions of
this Agreement during such three (3) Business Day period, the Company Board
shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel),
after considering the terms of such offer by the Parent, that the failure to
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would still be reasonably likely
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable law;
provided, however, that in the event of any material revisions to an
Acquisition Proposal underlying a potential Company Board Recommendation
Change, the Company will be required to notify Parent of such revisions and
the applicable three (3) Business Day period described above shall be extended
until two (2) Business Days after the time Parent receives notification from
the Company of such revisions.

(c) _Notices to the Parent_. The Company shall promptly (and in any event
within one (1) Business Day) advise the Parent orally, with written
confirmation to follow, of (i) the Companys receipt of any written
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) a summary of the material terms and conditions of
any such Acquisition Proposal; (iii) all material written requests, proposals
or offers (including any written documents containing material terms which
relate to such requests, proposals or offers), including any proposed
agreements and any material changes to the terms of the Acquisition Proposal,
received by or made to the Company from any Person making an Acquisition
Proposal; and (iv) the identity of the Person making any such Acquisition
Proposal (unless, in the case of clause (iv), such disclosure is prohibited
pursuant to the terms of any confidentiality agreement with such Person that
is in effect on the date of this Agreement).

 

(d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Company Board from (i)
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position with respect to a tender
offer contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of
its position thereunder (none of which, in and of itself, shall be deemed to
constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change), or (ii) making any
disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the
Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure to so
disclose could be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable law, it
being understood that nothing in the foregoing will be deemed to permit the
Company or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to effect a Company
Board Recommendation Change other than in accordance with Section 6.1(b).

 



30

    

(e) _Cessation of Ongoing Discussions_. The Company shall, and shall
direct its Representatives to: (i) cease immediately all discussions and
negotiations that commenced prior to the date of this Agreement regarding any
proposal that would constitute (if made after the date of this Agreement), or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
request the prompt return or destruction of all non-public information
concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries theretofore furnished to any
Person with whom a confidentiality agreement in contemplation of an
acquisition transaction was entered into at any time within the six (6) month
period immediately preceding the date hereof and (iii) terminate all access
granted to any such Persons or their respective Representatives referenced in
clauses (i) and (ii) to any physical or electronic data room; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing shall not in any way limit or modify any of the
Companys rights under the other provisions of this Section 6.1.

6.2 _Nasdaq Listing_. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to continue the listing of the Company Common Stock on Nasdaq. Each of
the parties hereto agrees to cooperate with the other parties hereto and to
use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken, all actions
necessary to delist the Company Common Stock from Nasdaq as promptly as
possible following the Effective Time and the deregistration of the Company
Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such
delisting.

6.3 _Confidentiality; Access to Information_.

(a) Except as expressly modified herein, the Confidentiality Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall (and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to) afford to the Parents Representatives, reasonable
access, upon reasonable notice, during normal business hours and in a manner
that does not disrupt or interfere with business operations, to all of its
books, contracts and records as the Parent shall reasonably request, and,
during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to) promptly make available to the Parent (i) a copy of each
report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received
by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities laws and (ii) all other information in the Companys
possession concerning its business, properties and assets as the Parent may
reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be
required to permit any inspection or other access, or to disclose any
information, (A) other than as contemplated by Section 6.1, in connection
with an Acquisition Proposal, Trigger Event, Recommendation Change Notice or
Superior Proposal Notice, (B) that in the reasonable judgment of the Company
would: (1) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of any third party,
(2) violate any legal requirement or contract or any obligation of the Company
with respect to confidentiality or privacy, including under any privacy
policy, or (3) jeopardize protections afforded the Company under the
attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine, or (C) that
the Company in good faith determines, in light of any COVID-19 Responses, that
such access would reasonably be expected to jeopardize the health and safety
of any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries; provided, further, that
the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the
information in clauses (A) through (C) to Parent in an alternative manner and
limit the information it is otherwise unable to provide. Any such information
shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. Prior to the Closing,
neither the Parent nor the Merger Sub shall (and each shall cause its
Affiliates and Representatives not to) contact or communicate with any of the
employees, customers, licensors or suppliers of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, without the prior written consent of the Company. 

6.4 _Legal Conditions to the Merger_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms hereof, including Section 6.1, Section 6.4(b),
Section 6.4(c) and Section 6.4(d), each party hereto shall each use its
reasonable best efforts to:

(i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done,
and to assist and cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable;

 



31

    

(ii) as promptly as practicable, obtain any consents, licenses, permits,
waivers, approvals, authorizations, or orders required to be obtained by such
party (or any of its Subsidiaries) from any Governmental Entity in connection
with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be
required to pay any monies or agree to any material undertaking in connection
with any of the foregoing;

(iii) as promptly as practicable, make all necessary filings, and
thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to this
Agreement and the Merger required under (A) the Exchange Act, and any other
applicable federal or state securities laws, (B) the HSR Act, any other
applicable Antitrust Laws and any related governmental request thereunder and
(C) any other applicable law;

(iv) contest and resist any action, including any administrative or
judicial action, and seek to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) (a " _Restrictive Order_ ") which has the effect of making the
Merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

(v) execute or deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of,
this Agreement; and

(vi) with the prior written consent of Parent, seek all consents, waivers
and approvals and delivering all notifications pursuant to any Company
Material Contracts, in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of
the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries be required to pay any monies or agree to any
material undertaking in connection with any of the foregoing.

The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other in connection with the
making of all such filings and submissions contemplated by the foregoing
clauses (ii) or (iii), including providing copies of all such documents to
the non-filing Person and its advisors prior to filing and, if requested,
accepting reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection
therewith. Each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish
to each other all information required for any application or other filing to
be made pursuant to any applicable law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing
contained in this Section 6.4(a) shall limit any obligation under any other
provision in this Section 6.4.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section
6.4, each of the Parent and the Company shall as soon as reasonably
practicable and in any event within five (5) Business Days following the date
of this Agreement, if required, make an appropriate filing of a Notification
and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act (including seeking early termination
of the waiting period under the HSR Act) with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. None of the Parent, the Merger Sub or the
Company shall commit to or agree with any Governmental Entity to stay, toll
or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or other applicable
Antitrust Laws or enter into a timing agreement with any Governmental Entity,
without the prior written consent of the other parties.

 

(c) Subject to the terms hereof, and without limiting the Parents
obligations under Section 6.4(d), the parties hereto shall, and shall cause
each of their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to obtain any government clearances or approvals
required for the Closing under any Antitrust Law, to respond to any
government requests for information under any Antitrust Law, to cause any
waiting periods under any applicable Antitrust Laws to expire or be
terminated, and to contest and resist any action, including any legislative,
administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any Restrictive Order. The parties hereto shall consult and
cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one
another, in connection with, and provide to the other parties in advance, any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in
connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law; 

 



32

    

 provided, however, that Parent shall make the ultimate determination about
which analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions and proposals, if any, are necessary. To the extent permitted by law
or Governmental Entities reviewing the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the parties will provide each other the opportunity to participate
in meetings and other substantive conversations with any such Governmental
Entities.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Parent
shall propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is
accepted, commit to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses
of the Parent or, effective as of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation, or their respective Subsidiaries, or otherwise offer to take or
offer to commit to take any action which it is capable of taking and if the
offer is accepted, take or commit to take such action that limits its freedom
of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses,
services or assets of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their
respective Subsidiaries, in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any Restrictive Order, which would have the effect of
preventing or delaying the Closing beyond the Outside Date.

 6.5 _Public Disclosure_. Except as may be required by law or stock
market regulations, (a) the press release announcing the execution of this
Agreement shall be issued only in such form as shall be mutually agreed upon
by the Company and the Parent and (b) the Parent and the Company shall use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other
party before issuing any other press release or otherwise making any
public statement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that these restrictions shall not apply to any Company
communications permitted pursuant to Section 6.1 in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal, Trigger Event, Recommendation Change Notice or Superior
Proposal Notice.

 

6.6 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of the Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each Indemnified Party against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys
fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified
Party is or was an officer, director, manager, employee or agent of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, while a director, manager or officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, is or was serving at the request of
the Company or one of its Subsidiaries as an officer, director, manager,
member, trustee, fiduciary, employee or agent of another Person, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted by law. Each Indemnified Party will be entitled to
advancement of expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in the defense
of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from each of the
Parent and the Surviving Corporation within ten (10) Business Days of receipt
by the Parent or the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a
request therefor; _provided_ , that any Indemnified Party to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking, to the extent required by the DGCL, the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational
documents) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or in any
indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, to repay such advances if it is determined by a final
determination of a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is
not subject to appeal) that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification under applicable law. Without limitation of the foregoing or
any other provision of this Section 6.6, the Parent and the Company agree
that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any
Indemnified Party, whether provided in the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or in any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified
Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, shall survive the Merger
and continue in full force and effect, and shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right
thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

 



33

    

(b) From the Effective Time through the six (6)-year anniversary of the
date on which the Effective Time occurs, the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws or other organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall contain, and the Parent shall cause the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws or other organizational documents of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to so contain, provisions no less favorable
with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of
each Indemnified Party than are set forth in the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 

(c) Subject to the next sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall either
(i) maintain, and the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for six (6) years from
the Effective Time the Current DandO Insurance with respect to matters existing
or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), so long as the annual premium therefor would
not exceed the Maximum Premium, or (ii) purchase a Reporting Tail Endorsement
and maintain such endorsement in full force and effect for its full term. If
the Companys or the Surviving Corporations existing insurance expires, is
terminated or canceled during such six-year period or exceeds the Maximum
Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain, and the Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to obtain, as much directors and officers
liability insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for an
annualized premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium, on terms and
conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than the Current
DandO Insurance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Company may, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a Reporting Tail
Endorsement, _provided_ , that the Company does not pay more than six times
the Maximum Premium for such Reporting Tail Endorsement. If a Reporting Tail
Endorsement has been purchased by the Company prior to the Effective
Time, the Parent shall cause such Reporting Tail Endorsement to be maintained
in full force and effect for its full term and cause all obligations
thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) In the event the Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
expressly assume and succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section
6.6.

(e) If any Indemnified Party makes any claim for indemnification or
advancement of expenses under this Section 6.6 that is denied by the Parent
and/or the Company or the Surviving Corporation, and a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that the Indemnified Party is entitled to such
indemnification or advancement of expenses, then the Parent, the Company or
the Surviving Corporation shall pay the Indemnified Partys costs and
expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with pursuing his or her claims to
the fullest extent permitted by law.

(f) The provisions of this Section 6.6 are intended to be in addition to
the rights otherwise available to any Indemnified Party by law, charter,
statute, bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their
representatives.

 

6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give
prompt notice to the Parent, of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of
any event, which occurrence or failure to occur is reasonably likely to cause
any representation or warranty of such Person (or, in case of the Parents
obligation to provide notice, any representation or warranty of the Merger
Sub) contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate (i) in the case of
any representation or warranty of the Company, in any manner that would
result in the failure of the condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) or (ii) in
the case of any representation or warranty of the Parent or the Merger Sub, in
any manner that would result in the failure of the condition set forth in
Section 7.2(a) or (b) any material breach by such Person (or, in case of the
Parents obligation to provide notice, any material breach by the Merger Sub)
of any covenant or agreement set 

 



34

    

 forth in this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that the Companys
compliance or failure to comply with this Section 6.7 shall not be taken into
account for purposes of determining whether the condition referred to in
Section 7.3(b) has been satisfied.

 

6.8 _MIP; Severance_.

 

(a) Parent shall assume sponsorship of the Companys 2020 Management
Incentive Plan (the " _MIP_ ") and related awards, in each case as in effect
as of the date hereof, and shall administer the MIP and awards in accordance
with their terms. All decisions under the MIP shall be made, subject to the
terms of the MIP and the immediately subsequent sentence, by Parent. On or
around February 15, 2021, the Company shall pay (or, if the Effective Time has
already occurred Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, pay), the
bonuses provided by the MIP, with such bonuses calculated as the greater of
(a) 100% of the target bonus amounts determined under the MIP or (b) the
bonuses determined using actual achievement pursuant to the formula set forth
in the 2020 MIP, in each case using the terms in effect as of the date of
this Agreement (without any discretionary reduction of payments); and, for
any Company Employee whose employment ends on a termination without Cause (as
defined in the Companys Severance Practices) after December 31, 2020, any
requirement that the individual remain employed at the date of bonus payment
shall be waived.

(b) If any Company Employee (who is not otherwise a party to an employment
agreement, offer letter or similar agreement or arrangement or any amendment
or supplement of any of the foregoing, in each case that provides for a
different treatment with respect to severance) whose employment is terminated
on or prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Time under circumstances
under which such Company Employee would have been eligible to receive
severance benefits under the Company Severance Practices, the Parent
will cause the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to provide such
Company Employee severance benefits consistent with those that would have been
paid under the Company Severance Practices as in existence on the date of this
Agreement, provided, however, that entitlement to any severance benefits may
be conditioned on the Company Employees timely signing, returning, and not
revoking a release in the form customarily used by the Company as of the date
of this Agreement.

 

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.8 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee, officer,
director, manager or consultant, or any other individual associated therewith,
shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Section
6.8. The provisions of Sections 6.8(a) and (b) shall not apply to persons
employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries outside the United States,
it being agreed that such persons shall be treated in accordance with
applicable law and the terms of any contracts covering them.

 

6.9 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "business combination" or
"control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute or regulation is
or may become applicable to any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the parties hereto shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to (a) take such actions as are reasonably necessary so
that the transactions contemplated hereunder may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and (b) otherwise take all such
actions as are reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects of
any such statute or regulation on such transactions.

 6.10 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all reasonable steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Company
equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a
director or officer of the Company and who would otherwise be subject to Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to be exempt under such rule to the
extent permitted by applicable law.

 

6.11 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partys
rights or obligations under this Agreement, (a) nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give the Parent or the Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct the Companys operations prior to the Effective
Time and (b) prior to the

 



35

    

 Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and
its Subsidiaries operations.

 

6.12 _Security Holder Litigation_. The Company shall give the Parent: (i)
prompt notice of all litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement brought by any stockholder
of the Company or any holder of the Companys other securities against
the Company and/or its directors or officers (" _Security Holder Litiga_
_tion_ ") (including by providing copies of all pleadings with respect
thereto) and keep Parent reasonably informed at Parents request with respect
to the status thereof; and (ii) the opportunity to participate, at the
Parents expense, in any negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
Security Holder Litigation. The Company shall not make any arrangement,
compromise, payment or settlement offer or enter into any arrangement,
compromise, payment or settlement prior to the Effective Time with respect to
any Security Holder Litigation unless the Parent shall have given its written
consent thereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

6.13 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders  Meeting_.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable (and no later than twenty (20)
Business Days) after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall (i) prepare
(with the Parents reasonable cooperation) and file with the SEC a proxy
statement (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "
_Proxy Statement_ ") to be sent to the stockholders of the Company relating
to the special meeting of the Companys stockholders (such special meeting and
any adjournments and postponements thereof, the " _Company
Stockholders Meeting_ ") to be held to consider, among other matters, the
adoption of this Agreement and (ii) set a record date for determining the
stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Company Stockholders
Meeting and commence a broker search pursuant to Section 14a-13 of the
Exchange Act in connection therewith and the Company will give due
consideration in good faith to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by Parent or its counsel. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company without
providing the Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon .
The Company will advise the Parent promptly after it receives any oral or
written request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments
thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information, will promptly provide the Parent with copies of any written
communication from the SEC or any state securities commission and a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the responses thereto, and will respond to
requests by the SEC with respect thereto as promptly as reasonably
practicable. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information
relating to the Company or the Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or the Parent that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so
that the Proxy Statement would not contain any misstatement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
shall promptly be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required under
applicable law, disseminated to stockholders of the Company; _provided_ , that
the delivery of such notice and the filing of any such amendment or supplement
shall not affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made
by any party hereunder or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder
to any party.

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Companys receipt
of notice from the SEC that the SEC has completed its review of the Proxy
Statement (or, if the SEC does not inform the Company that it intends to
review the Proxy Statement on or before the tenth (10th) calendar day
following the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement pursuant to Rule 14a-6
under the Exchange Act, as promptly as reasonably practicable following such
10th calendar day), the Company, acting through the Company Board, shall duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting for
the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and, if applicable,
the advisory vote required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act in
connection therewith; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board shall
be permitted to adjourn, delay or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting in
accordance with applicable law (but not beyond the Outside

 



36

    

 Date) (i) to the extent necessary to allow reasonable additional time for
the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the
Company Board has determined in good faith after consultation with outside
counsel is reasonably likely to be necessary or appropriate under applicable
law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and
reviewed by the Companys stockholders prior to the Company Stockholders
Meeting, (ii) on no more than two (2) occasions, if there are insufficient
shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company
Stockholders Meetings or (iii) if on the date on which the Company
Stockholders Meeting is then-scheduled, the Company has not received proxies
representing the Company Stockholder Approval. Except to the extent that (A)
the Company Board shall have effected a Company Board Recommendation Change
in accordance with Section 6.1(b), the Company, through the Company Board,
shall (1) recommend to its stockholders that they adopt this Agreement and (2)
include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (B) use its reasonable
best efforts to solicit and obtain the Company Stockholder Approval.

 

6.14 _Financing_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use, and shall cause its Affiliates
to use, reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms (including, if applicable, as
related to the "market flex" provisions) and subject only to the conditions
set forth in the Financing Letters, including using reasonable best efforts to
(i) maintain in effect and comply with the Financing Letters and the
definitive agreements relating to the Financing, including the payment
of related fees and expenses in connection therewith as and when due and
payable, until the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect
to the Debt Financing on the terms (including, if applicable, as related to
the "market flex" provisions) and subject only to the conditions set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter, (iii) satisfy (and cause its Affiliates to
satisfy) on a timely basis all conditions to funding applicable to Parent and
its Affiliates in the Financing Letters and the definitive agreements related
thereto (or, if necessary or deemed advisable by Parent, seek the waiver of
conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub contained in such Financing
Letter or such definitive agreements related thereto), (iv) upon the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of such conditions), consummate the
Financing at or prior to the Closing Date, including using its (and causing
its Affiliates to use) reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and the
other Persons committing to fund the Financing to fund the Financing at the
Closing and (v) enforce its rights under the Financing Letters and the
definitive agreements relating to the Financing. Parent shall not, and shall
not permit any of its Affiliates to, take any action not otherwise required
under this Agreement that is a breach of, or would result in termination of,
any of the Financing Letters. Parent, Merger Sub and the Guarantors shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Company, agree to or permit any
termination of or amendment, supplement or modification to be made to, or
grant any waiver of any provision under, the Financing Letters or the
definitive agreements relating to the Financing if such termination,
amendment, supplement, modification or waiver would (A)(1) reduce the
aggregate amount of any portion of the Financing (including by increasing the
amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount except by operation of
the "market flex" provisions as in effect on the date of this Agreement) or
(2) reduce the amount of Equity Financing unless the Debt Financing is
increased by a corresponding amount no later than the date of such amendment,
modification or waiver and, after giving effect thereto, the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 4.5 shall be true and correct, (B) impose
new or additional conditions precedent to the availability of the Financing or
otherwise expand, amend or modify in any manner adverse to the interests of
the Company any of the conditions precedent to the Financing as set forth in
the Financing Letters, or otherwise expand, amend or modify any other
provision of the Financing Letters in a manner that would reasonably
be expected to delay or prevent or make less likely to occur the funding of
the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) or the
completion of the Transactions on the Closing Date or (C) adversely impact the
ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, to enforce its
rights against other parties to the Financing Letters or the definitive
agreements with respect to the Financing on the terms and conditions contained
in the Financing Letters. Parent shall deliver to the Company true and
complete copies of any amendment, modification, supplement, consent or waiver
to or

 



37

    

 under any Financing Letter or the definitive agreements relating to the
Financing promptly upon execution thereof. Subject to the limitations set out
in this clause (a), Parent and Merger Sub may amend, supplement, modify or
replace the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect at the date of this Agreement
solely to add or replace lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents, managers or similar entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment
Letter as of the date of this Agreement.

(b) Parent shall, upon request, keep the Company informed on a reasonably
current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange
the Debt Financing and provide to the Company drafts (reasonably in advance of
execution) and thereafter complete, correct and executed copies of the
material definitive documents for the Debt Financing. Parent and Merger Sub
shall give the Company prompt notice (i) of any breach, default (or any event
that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any default or breach), termination, cancellation or
repudiation by any party to any of the Financing Letters or definitive
documents related to the Financing of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes
aware, (ii) of the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication from any Financing Source with respect to any (A) actual or
potential breach, default, termination, cancellation or repudiation by any
party to any of the Financing Letters or any definitive document related to
the Financing of any provisions of the Financing Letters or any definitive
document related to the Financing or (B) material dispute or disagreement
between or among any parties to any of the Financing Letters or any
definitive document related to the conditionality of the Financing, the
obligation to fund the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded
at Closing (other than customary negotiations with respect to the terms of the
Debt Financing) and (iii) of the occurrence of an event or development that
would reasonably be expected to adversely impact the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub to obtain all or any portion of the Financing contemplated by the
Financing Letters on the terms and conditions, in the manner and from the
sources contemplated by any of the Financing Letters or the definitive
documents related to the Financing (or if at any time for any other reason
Parent or Merger Sub believes that it will not be able to obtain all or any
portion of the Financing contemplated by the Financing Letters on the terms
and conditions, in the manner and from the sources contemplated by any of the
Financing Letters or the definitive documents related to the Financing). As
soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within two Business Days of
the date the Company delivers to Parent or Merger Sub a written request,
Parent and Merger Sub shall provide any information reasonably requested by
the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in the immediately
preceding sentence. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable
on the terms (including, if any, as related to the applicable "market flex"
provisions) and conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, and
such portion is reasonably required to pay the Required Amount, or Parent
becomes aware of any event or circumstance that would reasonably be expected
to make any such portion of the Debt Financing unavailable on the terms
(including, if any, as related to the applicable "market flex" provisions) and
conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent shall promptly
notify the Company in writing and Parent and Merger Sub shall use
their reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in replacement thereof,
and negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to,
alternative financing from the same or alternative sources in an amount
sufficient to pay the Required Amount with conditions not materially less
favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent and Merger Sub (or their respective
Affiliates) than the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event. Parent shall
deliver to the Company true and complete copies of all contracts, agreements
or other arrangements (including Redacted Fee Letters) pursuant to which any
such alternative source shall have committed to provide any portion of
the Debt Financing; provided, however, that Parent and Merger Sub shall not
be required to obtain financing which (in the reasonable judgment of Parent)
includes terms and conditions materially less favorable (taking into account
any "market flex" provisions), taken as a whole, to Parent and Merger Sub, in
each case relative to those in the Debt Financing being replaced.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing
contained in this Section 6.14(b) shall require, and in no event shall the
reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to
require, Parent or Merger Sub to (i) seek the Equity Financing from any source
other than those counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that
contemplated by, the Equity Funding Letter or (ii) pay any fees or any
interest rates applicable to the Debt Financing in excess of those
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including the "market flex"
provisions), or agree to any "market flex" term less favorable to Parent and
Merger Sub or Company than such corresponding "market flex" term

 



38

    

 contained in or contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (in either case,
whether to secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise).
For purposes of this Section 6.14, (x) references to the "Financing" shall
include the financing contemplated by the Financing Letters as permitted to be
amended, modified, supplemented or replaced by this Section 6.14, (y)
references to the "Debt Commitment Letter" shall include such documents as
permitted to be amended, modified, supplemented or replaced by this Section
6.14 and (z) references to "Debt Financing" shall include the debt financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as permitted to be amended,
modified, supplemented or replaced by this Section 6.14.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to provide, and to cause its Subsidiaries to provide, to Parent and
Merger Sub, in each case at Parents sole cost and expense, such reasonable
cooperation as is customary and reasonably requested by Parent in connection
with the arrangement of the Debt Financing (and taking into account the
timing of the Marketing Period), including using its reasonable best efforts
to:

 

(i) furnish Parent and Merger Sub and their Debt Financing Sources (w)
with, the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the related
audited consolidated statements of income and cash flows as of and for the
fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019 (each of which
Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that they have received) and, if the
Closing Date occurs after February 11, 2021, the audited consolidated balance
sheet and consolidated statements of income and cash flows of the Company for
the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020, (x) with the unaudited consolidated
balance sheet of the Company and the related unaudited consolidated statements
of income and cash flows as of and for each of the fiscal quarters that is not
a fiscal year-end after the date of the most recent financial statements
delivered pursuant to the foregoing clause (w) and ended at least forty-five
(45) days before the Closing Date, (y) if the Marketing Period commences prior
to the filing date of an Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q but after the end of the Companys corresponding fiscal year or
quarter, as applicable, customary "flash" or "recent developments" data and
(z) to the extent requested with specificity and in writing, such other
pertinent and customary financial and other information derived from the
historical books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent
shall reasonably request of a type and form customarily included in marketing
materials for a senior secured bank financing or an offering memorandum with
respect to a private placement of high yield debt securities pursuant to Rule
144A under the Securities Act, as applicable, subject to exceptions customary
for such financings (it being understood that to the extent any information
under Section 6.14(c)(i)(w), (x) or (y) is contained in any Company SEC
Reports, such inclusion shall constitute furnishing to Parent and Merger Sub
hereunder) (provided, that in no event shall the Company be required to
provide (A) any post-Closing or pro forma financial statements, post-
Closing pro forma adjustments desired to be incorporated into any information
used in connection with the Financing based on post-Closing actions or capital
structure (including any synergies or cost savings), projections, ownership or
an as-adjusted capitalization table or any financial statements not available
to the Company and prepared in the ordinary course of its financial reporting
practice, (B) any description of all or any component of the Financing,
including any such description to be included in liquidity and capital
resources disclosure or any "description of notes", or other information
customarily provided by the Debt Financing Sources or their counsel, (C) risk
factors relating to all or any component of the Financing, (D) consolidating
financial information, subsidiary financial statements, "segment reporting" or
any other information of the type required by Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10 or Rule
3-16 of Regulation S-X, (E) Compensation Disclosure and Analysis required by
Regulation S-K Item 402(b), (F) other information not reasonably available to
the Company and its Subsidiaries under its current internal control and
reporting systems or (G) other information customarily excluded from a Rule
144A offering memorandum) (the information described in clauses (A) through
(G), the " _Excluded Information_ ");

 

(ii) assist in preparation for and participate (and cause senior management
and Representatives, with appropriate seniority and expertise, of the Company
and its Subsidiaries to participate) in a reasonable number of meetings and
presentations with actual or prospective lenders, road shows and due diligence
sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies upon reasonable
request, and otherwise cooperate with the marketing and due diligence efforts
for any of the Debt Financing (it being understood, if circumstances so

 



39

    

 require, that any such meetings, presentations, road shows and/or sessions
will be held virtually and not in person and shall be scheduled at mutually
convenient times);

 

(iii) assist Parent, Merger Sub and the Debt Financing Sources, upon
reasonable request, with the timely preparation of reasonable and customary
(A) rating agency presentations and Offering Documents customarily used to
arrange transactions similar to the Debt Financing by companies of a
comparable size in a comparable industry as the Company and its Subsidiaries;
and (B) pro forma financial statements and forecasts of financial statements
of the Company and its Subsidiaries for one or more periods following the
Closing Date, in each case based solely on financial information and
data derived from the Companys and its Subsidiaries historical books and
records; provided, however, that neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries will be required to provide any information or assistance with
respect to the preparation of pro forma financial statements and forecasts of
financing statements relating to (X) the determination of the proposed
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing, the interest rates thereunder or the
fees and expenses relating thereto; (Y) the determination of any post-Closing
or pro forma cost savings, synergies, capitalization, ownership or other pro
forma adjustments desired to be incorporated into any information used in
connection with the Debt Financing; or (Z) any financial information related
to Company or any adjustments, in each case, that are not directly related to
the acquisition of the Company and its Subsidiaries;

 

(iv) reasonably cooperate with the pledging of collateral and the granting
of security interests in respect of the Debt Financing, it being understood
that such documents will not take effect until the Closing;

(v) provide customary authorization letters to the Debt Financing Sources
with respect to Company information included in a customary confidential
information memorandum for a syndicated bank financing authorizing the
distribution of information to prospective lenders; provided, however, that
all such materials have been previously identified to, and provided to, the
Company;

 

(vi) facilitate and assist in the preparation, execution and delivery of
one or more credit agreements, indentures, purchase agreements, guarantees,
certificates (provided that no officers of the Company that will not be
continuing officers, acting in such capacity, shall be required to execute any
solvency certificate) and other definitive financing documents as may be
reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub (including furnishing all
information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
businesses to be included in any schedules thereto or in any perfection
certificates); provided, that the foregoing documentation shall be subject to
the occurrence of the Closing Date and become effective no earlier than the
Closing Date;

 

(vii) promptly furnish (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date) Parent, Merger Sub and the Debt Financing Sources
with all documentation and other information about the Company and its
Subsidiaries as is reasonably requested by Parent, Merger Sub or the Debt
Financing Sources relating to applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act and the
requirements of 31 C.F.R. § 1010.230, to the extent requested in writing at
least eight (8) Business Days prior to the Closing Date; and 

(viii) in connection with any offering of high yield debt securities as
part of the Debt Financing, cause the independent registered public
accountants of the Company confirm that they are prepared to issue a customary
comfort letter upon the "pricing" and "closing" of the debt securities
included in the Debt Financing (subject to the completion by such accountants
of customary procedures relating thereto) and to provide drafts thereof
reasonably in advance of "pricing" and "closing" upon request of Parent.

 

Such requested cooperation shall not, in the Companys reasonable judgment,
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business or operations of the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries. In no event shall the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries be required to bear any cost or expense, pay any commitment
or other fee, enter into any definitive agreement, incur any other liability
or obligation, make any other payment or agree to provide any indemnity in
connection with the Financing or any of the foregoing effective prior to the
Closing. In addition,

 



40

    

 nothing in this Section 6.14 shall require any action that would conflict
with or violate the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries organizational
documents or any laws, rules or regulations or result in, prior to the
Effective Time, the contravention of, or that would reasonably be expected to
result in, prior to the Effective Time, a violation or breach of, or default
under, any contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the Company or its Subsidiaries or
their respective officers, directors (with respect to any Subsidiary of the
Company) or employees shall be required to execute or enter into or
perform any agreement, certificate or other document with respect to the
Financing contemplated by the Financing Letters (other than customary
authorization letters referred to in this Section 6.14) that is not contingent
upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Closing and no
directors of the Company that will not be continuing directors, acting in such
capacity, shall be required to execute or enter into or perform any agreement,
or to pass any resolutions or consents, with respect to the Financing. Parent
shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable and documented (A) attorneys fees and (B) fees and expenses of the
Companys accounting firms engaged to assist in connection with the Financing)
incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives in connection with the Financing, including the cooperation of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives contemplated by this Section 6.14 and the compliance by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives with its obligations under this Section 6.14, and shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs
or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing and any information used in connection therewith,
including compliance by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Representatives with its obligations under this Section 6.14.
Nothing contained in this Section 6.14 or otherwise shall require the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to be an issuer or obligor with respect to the
Debt Financing prior to the Effective Time.

(d) The Company and its Subsidiaries consent to the use of their logos in
connection with the Debt Financing so long as such logos (i) are used solely
in a manner that is customary for such purpose and not intended to or
reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries or the
reputation or goodwill of the Company or its Subsidiaries; (ii) are used
solely in connection with a description of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
their business and products or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and (iii) are used in a manner consistent with the other terms and
conditions that the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably impose. The
Company shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
such materials or other similar documents, or any materials for rating
agencies, that include information about the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prepared in connection with the Debt Financing.

 

(e) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, refrain from taking,
directly or indirectly, any action that could reasonably be expected to
result in the failure of any of the conditions contained in the Financing
Letters or in any definitive agreement relating to the Financing. Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the Companys
obligations under Section 6.14(c), none of the obtaining of the Financing or
any permitted alternative financing, or the completion of any issuance of
securities contemplated by the Financing, is a condition to the Closing,
and reaffirm their obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement irrespective and independently of the availability of the
Financing or any permitted alternative financing or the completion of any such
issuance.

 

(f) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the
Company obtained by Parent or its Representatives pursuant to clause (c)
above shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement; provided, that, upon notice to the Company, Parent may provide such
information to potential sources of capital and to rating agencies and
prospective lenders and investors during syndication of the Debt Financing
(including any permitted alternative financing) subject to customary
confidentiality arrangements with such Persons regarding such information.

 



41

    

6.15 _Debt Tender Offers and Redemptions; Pay-off Letters_.

(a) At the request and expense of Parent, the Company shall promptly at a
time reasonably requested by Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to
commence an offer to purchase and/or consent solicitation for any and all of
the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes on price terms
that are acceptable to Parent and such other customary terms and conditions as
are reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent to be consummated
substantially simultaneously with the Closing using funds provided by Parent
(the " _Debt Tender Offer_ ") and Parent shall assist the Company in
connection therewith. The closing of the Debt Tender Offer shall be
conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, and the parties shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt Tender Offer to close on the
Closing Date; provided that the consummation of the Debt Tender Offer with
respect to the Senior Notes shall not be a condition to Closing. Concurrent
with the Effective Time, and in accordance with the terms of the Debt Tender
Offer (if any), the Surviving Corporation shall accept for purchase and
purchase each series of Senior Notes properly tendered and not properly
withdrawn in the Debt Tender Offer using funds provided by or at the direction
of Parent. Parent hereby covenants and agrees to provide (or to cause to be
provided) immediately available funds to the Company for the full payment at
the Effective Time of all Senior Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn to
the extent required pursuant to the terms of the Debt Tender Offer.

(b) If reasonably requested by the Parent in writing, the Company shall,
in accordance with the applicable redemption provisions of the Senior Notes
and the Indenture, (A) issue a notice of optional redemption for all of the
outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes, pursuant to the
redemption provisions of the Indenture (which notice of optional redemption
may be requested to be issued prior to the Closing Date but conditioned on the
Closing) and (B) use reasonable best efforts to take any other actions
reasonably requested by the Parent to facilitate the satisfaction and
discharge of the Senior Notes pursuant to the satisfaction and discharge
provisions of the Indenture and the other provisions of the Indenture
applicable thereto; provided that neither the Company nor its counsel shall
be responsible for the delivery of any legal opinions with respect thereto and
any such Discharge of the Senior Notes shall only be required if conditioned
on the occurrence of the Closing. The redemption and satisfaction and
discharge of the Senior Notes pursuant to the preceding sentence are referred
to in this Section 6.15 collectively as the "Discharge" of such series of
Senior Notes.

 

(c) Parent shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in
connection with any Debt Tender Offer, including the offer to purchase,
related letter of transmittal, and other related documents (collectively, the
" _Offer Documents_ "), and provide the Company with a reasonable opportunity
to comment and make reasonable changes to such documents. Parent and the
Company shall reasonably cooperate with each other in the preparation of the
Offer Documents. The Offer Documents (including all amendments or supplements)
and all mailings to the holders of the Senior Notes in connection with any
Debt Tender Offer shall be subject to the prior review of, and comment by, the
Company and Parent and shall be reasonably acceptable to each of them. If at
any time prior to the completion of any Debt Tender Offer any information in
the Offer Documents should be discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or
Parent, on the other, which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Offer Documents, so that the Offer Documents shall not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made, not misleading,
the party that discovers such information shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or
supplement prepared by Parent describing such information shall be
disseminated by or on behalf of the Company to the holders of the
Senior Notes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.15,
the Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act and any other applicable law to the extent such laws are
applicable in connection with the any Debt Tender Offer and such compliance
will not be deemed a breach hereof.

 

(d) So long as the Company has sufficient immediately available funds
provided by or at the direction of Parent for the full payment of the Senior
Notes validly tendered, the Company shall waive any of the

 



42

    

 conditions to any Debt Tender Offer (other than that the Merger shall have
been consummated and that there shall be no final order, decree, judgment,
injunction, ruling or other non-appealable action prohibiting consummation of
any Debt Tender Offer) as may be reasonably requested by Parent in writing and
shall not, without the written consent of Parent, waive any condition to any
Debt Tender Offer or make any changes to any Debt Tender Offer other than as
agreed between Parent and the Company.

 

(e) In connection with any Debt Tender Offer, Parent may select one or more
dealer managers, information agents, depositaries and other agents, in each
case as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, to provide assistance
in connection therewith and the Company shall enter into customary agreements
(including indemnities) with such parties so selected; provided that neither
the Company nor its counsel shall be responsible for the delivery of any legal
opinions with respect thereto. Parent shall pay the fees and out-of-pocket
expenses of any dealer manager, information agent, depositary or other agent
retained in connection with any Debt Tender Offer upon the incurrence of
such fees and out-of-pocket expenses.

 

(f) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs, fees and
expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the
Companys compliance with its obligations under this Section 6.15, including
all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred
by or on behalf of the Company in connection with any Debt Tender Offer or
Discharge made in respect of the Senior Notes (including any out-of-pocket
costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation
or distribution of any Offer Documents or other documents related thereto).
Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Representatives
from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or liabilities
incurred by any of them in connection with any action taken by them pursuant
to this Section 6.15 with respect to any Debt Tender Offer or Discharge (in
each case other than as a result of the Companys fraud or willful
misconduct), and the Company shall not be required to take any actions
pursuant to this Section 6.15 that would result in, prior to the Effective
Time, the contravention of, or that would reasonably be expected to result in,
prior to the Effective Time, a violation or breach of, or default under, any

subject to the terms hereof, after stockholder approval hereof:

(a) by mutual written consent of the Parent and the Company at any time
prior to the Effective Time;

(b) by either the Parent or the Company at any time prior to the Effective
Time and after the Outside Date if the Effective Time shall not have occurred
on or before the Outside Date; _provided_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) (i) shall not be available to any
party hereto if the failure of such party (or any Affiliate of such party) to
fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been a principal cause of or
primarily resulted in the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or
before the Outside Date, (ii) if the Marketing Period shall have commenced
but not have been completed by the date that is three Business Days prior to
the Outside Date, but all other conditions to the Closing (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been
satisfied or, to the extent permitted by law, waived, then the Outside Date
shall be extended to the third Business Day following the final day of the
Marketing Period, and such date shall become the Outside Date for purposes of
this Agreement; and (iii) shall be subject to the proviso set forth in Section
8.1(i);

 

(c) by either the Parent or the Company at any time prior to the Effective
Time if a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a

final action, in each case having the effect of permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that a party hereto shall not be permitted to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) if the failure of
such party (or any Affiliate of such party) to fulfill any obligation under
this Agreement has been a principal cause of or primarily resulted in the
issuance of any such order, decree, ruling or the taking of such other action;

 

(d) by the Parent or the Company if the Company Stockholder Approval shall
not have been obtained at the Company Stockholders Meeting duly convened
therefor or at any adjournment or postponement thereof at which a vote on the
adoption of this Agreement was taken; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party
hereto shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.1(d) if such failure to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval is
attributable to the failure of such party (or any Affiliate of such party) to
perform in any material respect any covenant in this Agreement required to be
performed by such party (or any Affiliate of such party) at or prior to the
Effective Time;

(e) by the Parent, if, prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board
shall have effected a Company Board Recommendation Change (a " _Trigger Event_
"); provided, that any such termination must occur within ten (10) Business
Days after the occurrence of the Trigger Event;

 



45

    

(f) by the Company, at any time prior to receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval, in the event that: (i) the Company shall have
received a Superior Proposal; (ii) the Company Board has determined in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure proceed
pursuant to this Section 8.1(f) would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary obligations under applicable law; (iii) so long as the
Company and its Subsidiaries are not in material breach of their obligations
pursuant to Section 6.1 with respect to such Superior Proposal; (iv) the
Company has notified the Parent in writing that it intends to enter into a
definitive agreement relating to such Superior Proposal, specifying the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (a " _Superior
Proposal Notice_ ") (it being understood that the Superior Proposal Notice
shall not constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change or a Trigger Event
for purposes of this Agreement); (v) if requested by the Parent, the Company
shall have made its Representatives available to negotiate with the Parents
Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement during the three (3) Business Day period following delivery by the

Company will be required to notify Parent of such revisions and the
applicable three (3) Business Day period described above shall be extended
until two (2) Business Days after the time Parent receives notification from
the Company of such revisions; (vi) if the Parent shall have delivered to
the Company a written, binding and irrevocable offer to alter the terms or
conditions of this Agreement during such three (3) Business Day period, the
Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel), after considering the terms of such offer by the Parent,
that the Superior Proposal giving rise to such Superior Proposal Notice
continues to be a Superior Proposal and it would still be reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations of the Company Board under
applicable law not to accept such Superior Proposal; and (vii) concurrently
with the termination of this Agreement, the Company pays the Parent the
Termination Fee contemplated by Section 8.3(b)(ii) and enters into the
definitive agreement to consummate the transaction contemplated by such
Superior Proposal;

 

(g) by the Parent, prior to the Effective Time, if there has been a breach
of or failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement, which breach or
failure to perform (i) would cause the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a)
or Section 7.3(b) not to be satisfied, and (ii) shall not have been cured
within twenty (20) Business Days following receipt by the Company of written
notice of such breach or failure to perform from the Parent; _provided_ , that
neither the Parent nor the Merger Sub is then in material breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant under this Agreement;

(h) by the Company, prior to the Effective Time, if there has been a
breach of or failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of the Parent or the Merger Sub set forth in this

set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) not to be satisfied, and (ii)
shall not have been cured within twenty (20) Business Days following receipt
by the Parent of written notice of such breach or failure to perform from the
Company; _provided_ , that the Company is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant under this Agreement.

(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
actions taken at the Closing) have been satisfied, (B) the Company has
confirmed by notice to Parent after the end of the Marketing Period that all
conditions set forth in Section 7.2 have been satisfied (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the
Closing) or that it is willing to waive any unsatisfied conditions in Section
7.2 and (C) the Merger shall not have been consummated within three (3)
Business Days after the delivery of such notice; _provided_ , that
notwithstanding anything in Section 8.1(b) to the contrary, no party shall be
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b) during such
three (3) Business Day period following delivery of the notice referred to in
clause (B) above.

 

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement
as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall immediately become void and

entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h). Any fee due

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by

absent such agreement and that each of the Termination Fee and the

Parent, as the case may be, fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to
this Section 8.3, and, in order to obtain the payment, Parent or the Company,
as the case may be, commences a suit, action or proceeding which results in a

by the parties hereto by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards
of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time to the extent permitted
by law; _provided_ , that following receipt of the Company Stockholder

requires further approval or adoption by the stockholders of the Company
without such further approval or adoption or (ii) by rule or regulation
of any stock exchange requires further approval by the stockholders of the
Company without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended,
modified or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or
otherwise, except by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an
amendment, modification or supplement hereto (as applicable), signed on behalf
of each of the parties hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, this Section 8.4, Section 8.5, Section 10.4, Section
10.10(c) Section 10.11 and Section 10.12 (and any other provision of this
Agreement to the extent that an amendment, modification or supplementation of

amended, modified or supplemented in a manner that is adverse in any respect
to a Debt Financing Source without the prior written consent of such Debt

party. Such extension or waiver shall not apply to any time for performance,
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or noncompliance with any
agreement or condition, as the case may be, other than that which is specified
in the extension or waiver. The failure of any party hereto to assert any of
its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
such rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
last sentence of each of Section 8.4, Section 8.5, Section 10.4, Section
10.10(c), Section 10.11 and Section 10.12, (and any other provision of this
Agreement to the extent a waiver of such provision would modify the substance
of the foregoing) may not be waived, in whole or in part, in a manner adverse
to any of the Debt Financing Sources without the prior consent of
the adversely affected Debt Financing Sources.

8.6 _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver_. A
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, an amendment,
modification or supplement of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.4 or an
extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.5 shall, in order

shall not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder,
except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by the terms and provisions of

 



62

    

 Section 6.6 (with respect to which the Indemnified Parties shall be third
party beneficiaries), (b) prior to the Effective Time, for the right of
holders of shares of Company Common Stock to pursue claims for damages
(including damages based on loss of the economic benefits of the transaction
to the stockholders of the Company, taking into account without limitation the

relief (including equitable relief) for any breach of this Agreement by the

the Company in its sole and absolute discretion, as agent for the stockholders
of the Company, it being understood and agreed that any and all interests in
such claims shall attach to such shares of Company Common Stock and
subsequently transfer therewith and, consequently, any damages, settlements or
other amounts recovered or received by the Company with respect to such
claims (net of expenses incurred by the Company in connection therewith) may,
in the Companys sole and absolute discretion, be (i) distributed, in whole or
in part, by the Company to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock of
record as of any date determined by the Company or (ii) retained by the
Company for the use and benefit of the Company on behalf of its stockholders

10.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, Parent or Merger Sub may assign all or any portion of its rights and
obligations pursuant to this Agreement (a) or as collateral to the applicable
Debt Financing Sources in connection with the Debt Financing without the
consent of the Company, but no such assignment shall relieve any assignor of
any of its respective liabilities or obligations under this Agreement in the
event its obligations are not performed, or (b) to one or more of its
Affiliates that was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated hereby, has engaged in no other business activities
and has conducted its operations only as contemplated by this Agreement
(provided that no such assignment shall (x) affect the obligations of any
such Affiliate who has committed to provide Equity Financing or the Guarantors
under the Guarantee, (y) impede or delay the consummation of the Transactions
or (z) relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its obligations under this
Agreement).

 

10.6 _Severability_. Any term or provision (or part thereof) of this
Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any
jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining
terms and provisions (or parts thereof) hereof or the validity or
enforceability of the offending term or provision (or part thereof) in any
other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision (or part
thereof) hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the court making
such determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision (or
part thereof), to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid
or unenforceable term or provision (or part thereof) with a term or provision
(or part thereof) that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision (or
part thereof), and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the
event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto shall replace such invalid or unenforceable term
or provision (or part thereof) with a valid and enforceable term

 



63

    

 or provision (or part thereof) that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable
term (or part thereof).

 

10.7 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but

or in any other certificate, agreement or document related to this Agreement
shall include images of manually executed signatures transmitted by facsimile
or other electronic format (including "pdf") and other electronic signatures
(including, DocuSign and AdobeSign). The use of electronic signatures and
electronic records (including, any contract or other record created,
generated, sent, communicated, received, or stored by electronic means) shall
be of the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a manually
executed signature or use of a paper-based record-keeping system to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, including the Federal Electronic
Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the Delaware Uniform
Electronic Transactions Act and any other applicable law.

particular provision of this Agreement; (c) "date hereof" refers to the date
set forth in the initial caption of this Agreement; (d) "extent" in the
phrase "to the extent" means the degree to which a subject or other thing

convenience only and do not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement; (f) definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to
the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms; (g) references to a
Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns; (h) references to an

Agreement prepared by any party shall affect the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement.

 

10.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware.

10.10 _Remedies_. 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a Person will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
Person, and the exercise by a Person of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

 

(b) Irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were
otherwise breached, as money damages or other legal

 



64

    

 remedies (including any fees payable pursuant to Section 8.3), even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages, including if
the parties hereto fail to take any action required of them hereunder to
consummate this Agreement. Accordingly, except as expressly set forth in this
Section 10.10(b), in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the
Company, on the one hand, or the Parent and/or the Merger Sub, on the other
hand, of any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this
Agreement, the Company, on the one hand, and the Parent and the Merger Sub, on
the other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement, by the other
(as applicable), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in the courts described in Section 10.11 without proof of damages
or otherwise, to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other under this
Agreement, in each case without posting a bond or other security and in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled. The parties
acknowledge and agree that (i) the provisions set forth in Section 8.3 and
Section 10.10(c) shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any
respect any partys right to specific enforcement and (ii) the right of
specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without that
right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.
The parties hereto agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement
is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, and
not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate
remedy or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law.
Time shall be of the essence for purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to a valid termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, it is explicitly agreed that the right
of the Company to seek and obtain an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief enforcing Parents and Merger Subs obligations to
cause (x) the Equity Financing to be funded to fund the Merger or (y) cause
Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger (but not the right of the
Company to such injunctions, specific performance or other equitable remedies
for any other reason) shall be subject to the following conditions being
satisfied: (A) the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing,
each of which shall be capable of being satisfied at the Closing) have been
satisfied at the time the Closing would have occurred and remain satisfied,
but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded, (B) the Debt
Financing (including any alternative financing that has been obtained in
accordance with Section 6.14(b)) has been funded in accordance with the terms
thereof or will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing
if the Equity Financing were to be funded at the Closing and (C) the Company
has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that if specific performance
is granted and the Debt Financing and the Equity Financing are funded, then it
would take such actions required of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing
to occur. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be
entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parents or Mergers
obligation to consummate the Merger if the Debt Financing (including any
alternative financing that has been obtained in accordance with Section
6.14(b)) has not been funded (or will not be funded at the Closing if the
Equity Financing were to be funded at the Closing).

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary:

 

(i) in the event that the Company shall terminate this Agreement and
receive full payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section
8.3(c), together with any indemnification for or reimbursement of any
applicable expenses pursuant to Section 6.14(c), 6.15 or 8.3(d), the receipt
of the Parent Termination Fee together with such expenses shall be the sole
and exclusive monetary remedy for any and all losses or damages suffered or
incurred by the Company or any other Person in connection with this Agreement
(and the termination hereof), the Financing Letters or the Guarantee, the
Transactions (and the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matter
forming the basis for such termination, and neither the Company nor any other
Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding
against Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors, the Debt Financing Sources or any
of their respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
equityholders, financing sources, managers, members, directors, officers,
agents, attorneys, assignees or Affiliates (collectively, the " _Parent
Related Parties_ ") arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the
Financing Letters or the Guarantee, any of the Transactions (or the
abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such
termination (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Confidentiality
Agreement); _provided_ , that nothing in this Section 10.10(c) shall limit the
rights of the Company, its Subsidiaries 

 



65

    

 and their respective Representatives under the Confidentiality Agreement or
to be indemnified and reimbursed for expenses in accordance with Section
6.14(c), 6.15 or 8.3(d); and

 

(ii) in the event that Parent or its designee shall receive full payment of
the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(b), together with any
reimbursement of applicable expenses pursuant to Section 8.3(d), the receipt
of the Termination Fee and any applicable expenses referred to in Section
8.3(d) shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy for any and all losses
or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective
Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the
termination hereof), the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any
matter forming the basis for such termination, and (A) none of Parent, Merger
Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled
to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company and
its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future
officers, employees, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members or
Affiliates (collectively, " _Company Related Parties_ ") arising out of or
in connection with this Agreement, any of the Transactions or any matters
forming the basis for such termination.

 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, while each of the Company and Parent may
pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with Section
10.10(b) and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee or the Termination Fee,
as applicable, under Section 8.3(b) or Section 8.3(c) or the recovery of
monetary damages, under no circumstances shall the Company or Parent be
permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance that
results in a Closing and any money damages, including all or any portion of
the Parent Termination Fee or the Termination Fee, as applicable. The
parties acknowledge and agree that the fact that the parties have agreed to
this Section 10.10(d) shall not be deemed to affect any partys right to
specific performance under Section10.10(b).

 

10.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (a)
consents to submit itself to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if that court does not have
jurisdiction, a federal court sitting in the State of Delaware in any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in
respect of such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in any such
court, (c) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (d)
agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement in
any other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any
bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other
Person with respect thereto. Any party hereto may make service on another
party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served
at the address and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section
10.2. Nothing in this Section 10.11, however, shall affect the right of any
Person to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties agrees that it will not
bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third
party claim of any kind or description, whether at law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Debt Financing Sources in any
way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including, any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing, or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than the United States District Court for the Southern District
of the State of New York or the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
County of New York, and that (x) the provisions of Section 10.12 relating to
the waiver of jury trial shall apply to any such action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third party claim and (y) any such action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third party claim will be governed and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (except as expressly
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter).

10.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND

AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED

HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG

ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE DEBT FINANCING.

 

10.13 _Disclosure Schedule_. The Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
arranged in Sections corresponding to the numbered sections contained in this
Agreement, and the disclosure in any section shall qualify (a) the
corresponding section of this Agreement and (b) the other sections of this
Agreement, to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from a reading of
such disclosure that it also qualifies or applies to such other sections. The
inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be
deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such
information is required by the terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, has
resulted in or would result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or is outside
the Ordinary Course of Business.

 

10.14 _Parent Guarantee_. The Parent agrees to take all action necessary
to cause the Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to
perform all of its agreements, covenants and obligations under this Agreement.

AMENDED AND RESTATED

 

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

 

OF

ENDURANCE INTERNATIONAL GROUP HOLDINGS, INC.

The name of this corporation is Endurance International Group Holdings, Inc.

 

The registered office of the corporation in the State of Delaware shall be
Corporation Service Company, 251 Little Falls Drive, City of Wilmington, DE
19808, County of New Castle, and the name of the registered agent of the
corporation in the State of Delaware at such address is Corporation Service
Company.

 

The purpose of this corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for
which a corporation may be organized under the Delaware General Corporation
Law.

This corporation is authorized to issue only one class of stock, to be
designated Common Stock. The total number of shares of Common Stock presently
authorized is 1,000, each having a par value of $0.0001.

The management of the business and the conduct of the affairs of the
corporation shall be vested in its Board of Directors. The number of directors
which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be fixed by the
Board of Directors in the manner provided in the Bylaws.

 

No person entitled to vote at an election for directors may cumulate votes to
which such person is entitled unless required by applicable law at the time
of such election. During such time or times that applicable law requires
cumulative voting, every stockholder entitled to vote at an election for
directors may cumulate such stockholders votes and give one candidate a
number of votes equal to the number of directors to be elected multiplied by
the number of votes to which such stockholders shares are otherwise entitled,
or distribute the stockholders votes on the same principle among as many
candidates as such stockholder desires. No stockholder, however, shall be
entitled to so cumulate such stockholders votes unless (A) the names of such
candidate or candidates have been placed in nomination prior to the voting and
(B) the stockholder has given notice at the meeting, prior to the voting, of
such stockholders intention to cumulate such stockholders votes. If any
stockholder has given proper notice to cumulate votes, all stockholders may
cumulate their votes for any candidates who have been properly placed in
nomination. Under cumulative voting, the candidates receiving the highest
number of votes, up to the number of directors to be elected, are elected.

 

The Board of Directors is expressly empowered to adopt, amend or repeal the
Bylaws of the corporation. The stockholders shall also have power to adopt,
amend or repeal the Bylaws of the corporation; provided, however, that, in
addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the
corporation required by law or by this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, such action by stockholders shall require the affirmative vote
of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the then-
outstanding shares of the capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

Except to the extent that the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
prohibits the elimination or limitation of liability of directors for
breaches of fiduciary duty, no director of the corporation shall be personally
liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for any
breach of fiduciary duty as a director, notwithstanding any provision of law
imposing such liability. No amendment to or repeal of this provision shall
apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any
director of the corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of
such director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal. If the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware is amended to permit further
elimination or limitation of the personal liability of directors, then the
liability of a director of the corporation shall be eliminated or limited to
the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware as so amended.

   

The corporation shall provide indemnification as follows:

 

1. _Actions, Suits and Proceedings Other than by or in the Right of the Corporation_. The corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, indemnify each person who was or is a party or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or officer of the corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the corporation, as a director, officer, partner, employee or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) (all such persons being referred to hereafter as an "Indemnitee"), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys fees), liabilities, losses, judgments, fines (including excise taxes and penalties arising under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974), and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. 

2. _Actions or Suits by or in the Right of the Corporation_. The corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, indemnify any Indemnitee who was or is a party to or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or officer of the corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the corporation, as a director, officer, partner, employee or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys fees) and, to the extent permitted by law, amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made under this Section 2 in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which Indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation, unless, and only to the extent, that the Court of Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of such liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses (including attorneys fees) which the Court of Chancery of Delaware or such other court shall deem proper. 

 

3. _Indemnification for Expenses of Successful Party_. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Article VI, to the extent that an Indemnitee has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 1 and 2 of Part B of this Article VI, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, or on appeal from any such action, suit or proceeding, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection therewith. 

 

4. _Notification and Defense of Claim_. As a condition precedent to an Indemnitees right to be indemnified, such Indemnitee must notify the corporation in writing as soon as practicable of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving such Indemnitee for which indemnity will or could be sought. With respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the corporation is so notified, the corporation will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense and/or to assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee. After notice from the corporation to Indemnitee of its election 

   

 so to assume such defense, the corporation shall not be liable to Indemnitee
for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in
connection with such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, other than as
provided below in this Section 4\. Indemnitee shall have the right to employ
his or her own counsel in connection with such action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after
notice from the corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be
at the expense of Indemnitee unless (i) the employment of counsel by
Indemnitee has been authorized by the corporation, (ii) counsel to
Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of
interest or position on any significant issue between the corporation and
Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such action, suit, proceeding or
investigation or (iii) the corporation shall not in fact have employed
counsel to assume the defense of such action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel for
Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the corporation, except as otherwise
expressly provided by this Article VI. The corporation shall not be entitled,
without the consent of Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any claim brought
by or in the right of the corporation or as to which counsel for Indemnitee
shall have reasonably made the conclusion provided for in clause (ii) above.
The corporation shall not be required to indemnify Indemnitee under this
Article VI for any amounts paid in settlement of any action, suit, proceeding
or investigation effected without its written consent. The corporation shall
not settle any action, suit, proceeding or investigation in any manner which
would impose any penalty or limitation on Indemnitee without Indemnitees
written consent. Neither the corporation nor Indemnitee will unreasonably
withhold or delay its consent to any proposed settlement.

 

5. _Advance of Expenses_. Subject to the provisions of Section 6 of Part B of this Article VI, in the event of any threatened or pending action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the corporation receives notice under this Article VI, any expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in defending an action, suit, proceeding or investigation or any appeal therefrom shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such matter; provided, however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of such matter shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall ultimately be determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this Article VI; and provided further that no such advancement of expenses shall be made under this Article VI if it is determined (in the manner described in Section 6) that (i) Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation, or (ii) with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. Such undertaking shall be accepted without reference to the financial ability of Indemnitee to make such repayment. 

 

6. _Procedure for Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_. In order to obtain indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to Section 1, 2, 3 or 5 of Part B of this Article VI, an Indemnitee shall submit to the corporation a written request. Any such advancement of expenses shall be made promptly, and in any event within 60 days after receipt by the corporation of the written request of Indemnitee, unless (i) the corporation has assumed the defense pursuant to Section 4 of Part B of this Article VI (and none of the circumstances described in Section 4 of Part B of this Article VI that would nonetheless entitle the Indemnitee to indemnification for the fees and expenses of separate counsel have occurred) or (ii) the corporation determines within such 60-day period that Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1, 2 or 5 of Part B of this Article VI, as the case may be. Any such indemnification, unless ordered by a court, shall be made with respect to requests under Section 1 or 2 only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination by the corporation that the indemnification of Indemnitee is proper because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made in each instance (a) by a majority vote of the directors of the corporation consisting of persons who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question ("disinterested directors"), whether or not a quorum, (b) by a committee of disinterested directors designated by majority vote of disinterested directors, whether or not a quorum, (c) if there are no disinterested directors, or if the disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel (who may, to the extent permitted by law, be regular legal counsel to the corporation) in a written opinion, or (d) by the stockholders of the corporation. 

   

7. _Remedies_. The right to indemnification or advancement of expenses as granted by this Article VI shall be enforceable by Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction. Neither the failure of the corporation to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the corporation pursuant to Section 6 of Part B of this Article VI that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. Indemnitees expenses (including attorneys fees) reasonably incurred in connection with successfully establishing Indemnitees right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any suit brought by Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder it shall be a defense that the Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. 

 

8. _Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article VI, except as set forth in Section 7 of Part B of this Article VI, the corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee pursuant to this Article VI in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee unless the initiation thereof was approved by the Board of Directors or is a successful proceeding by such Indemnitee to enforce such Indemnitees right to indemnification under this Certificate of Incorporation or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article VI, the corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee to the extent such Indemnitee is reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, and in the event the corporation makes any indemnification payments to an Indemnitee and such Indemnitee is subsequently reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, such Indemnitee shall promptly refund indemnification payments to the corporation to the extent of such insurance reimbursement. 

 

9. _Subsequent Amendment_. No amendment, termination or repeal of this Article VI or of the relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or any other applicable laws shall adversely affect or diminish in any way the rights of any Indemnitee to indemnification under the provisions hereof with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of such amendment, termination or repeal. 

 

10. _Other Rights_. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law (common or statutory), agreement or vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in Indemnitees official capacity and as to action in any other capacity while holding office for the corporation, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer, and shall inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors and administrators of Indemnitee. Nothing contained in this Article VI shall be deemed to prohibit, and the corporation is specifically authorized to enter into, agreements with officers and directors providing indemnification rights and procedures different from those set forth in this Article VI. In addition, the corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by its Board of Directors, grant indemnification rights to other employees or agents of the corporation or other persons serving the corporation and such rights may be equivalent to, or greater or less than, those set forth in this Article VI. 

 

11. _Partial Indemnification_. If an Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Article VI to indemnification by the corporation for some or a portion of the expenses (including attorneys fees), liabilities, losses, judgments, fines (including excise taxes and penalties arising under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) or amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation and any appeal therefrom but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the corporation shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion of such expenses (including attorneys fees), liabilities, losses, judgments, fines (including excise taxes and penalties arising under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) or amounts paid in settlement to which Indemnitee is entitled. 

12. _Insurance_. The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, 

   

 trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) against any
expense, liability or loss incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or
arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the corporation
would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability
or loss under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

 

13. _Savings Clause_. If this Article VI or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Indemnitee as to any expenses (including attorneys fees), liabilities, losses, judgments, fines (including excise taxes and penalties arising under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including an action by or in the right of the corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article VI that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. 

 

14. _Definitions_. Terms used herein and defined in Section 145(h) and Section 145(i) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware shall have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in such Section 145(h) and Section 145(i). 

 

The corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any
provision contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and
all rights conferred upon the stockholders herein are granted subject to this
reservation.

 

Unless the corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative
forum, the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware shall be the sole and
exclusive forum for any stockholder (including a beneficial owner) to bring
(i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the corporation,
(ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any
current or former director, officer, other employee or stockholder of the
corporation to the corporation or the corporations stockholders, (iii) any
action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware
General Corporation Law or the corporations certificate of incorporation or
bylaws or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers
jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware or (iv) any
action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except
for, as to each of (i) through (iv) above, any claim as to which the Court of
Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not
consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days
following such determination), which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction
of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or for which the Court
of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. If any provision or
provisions of this Article VIII shall be held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable as applied to any person or entity or circumstance for any
reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
validity, legality and enforceability of such provisions in any other
circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Article VIII (including,
without limitation, each portion of any sentence of this Article VIII
containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable
that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) and the
application of such provision to other persons or entities and circumstances
shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
