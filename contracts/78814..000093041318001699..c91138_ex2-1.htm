(xv) the assets set forth on Section 1.2(b)(xv) of the Disclosure Schedules.

  



  

Section 1.3. _Consent to Assignment_.

  



  

(a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, this
Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to sell, assign, transfer or
convey any Transferred Asset or any claim, right or benefit thereunder or
arising therefrom (collectively, including the Transferred Assets, the "
_Interests_ "), if an attempted sale, assignment, transfer or conveyance of
such Interest would constitute a breach or a violation of any applicable Law,
or would adversely affect the rights of the Purchaser thereunder, or if such
Interest cannot be sold, assigned, transferred or conveyed without any third-
party consent that has not been obtained by (or does not remain in full force
and effect at) the Closing (any such Interest, an " _Excluded Interest_ "),
unless and until ( _i_ ) such Excluded Interest can be sold, assigned,
transferred or conveyed in accordance with _Section 1.2(a)_ without such a
breach, violation of Law or adverse effect on the Purchaser's rights
thereunder or ( _ii_ ) such third-party consent is obtained, at which time,
in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), such Excluded Interest and any related
Assumed Liability shall be deemed to be sold, assigned, transferred or
conveyed in accordance with _Section 1.2(a)_ and assumed in accordance with
_Section 1.4(a)_  and shall cease to be an Excluded Interest.

  



  

(b) During the six (6) months following the Closing Date, to the extent any
Interest remains an Excluded Interest, the parties shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in any reasonable and lawful
arrangements reasonably satisfactory to both parties as shall provide the
benefits of such Excluded Interest to the Purchaser or its designee and shall
require the Purchaser or its designee to pay or satisfy the corresponding
liabilities and obligations with respect to such Excluded Interest, in each
case to the same extent as if such Excluded Interest had been transferred to
the Purchaser as of the Closing. The parties shall use their

   

4 
--- 

  

--- 

     

commercially reasonable efforts to structure the provision of the benefits of
any Excluded Interest to Purchaser in a manner that does not result in
any member of the Seller Group or any of their Affiliates recognizing net
taxable income (taking into account any deductions available for payments
made to Purchaser) with respect to such structure; provided, that if
notwithstanding such efforts any member of the Seller Group or any of their
Affiliates recognizes net taxable income as a result of such structure, then
the amount payable by Seller shall be reduced by 25.5% of such net taxable
income and provided further that the foregoing shall not prevent any
member of the Seller Group or any of their Affiliates from reporting net
taxable income arising from such structure on its Tax
returns. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no
member of the Seller Group shall have any obligation to seek any third-party
consent or to cooperate in providing the benefits of any Excluded Interest to
the Purchaser, in either case, following the first anniversary of the Closing
Date. The parties acknowledge that the failure of any third party consent to
be obtained or the failure of any Interest to constitute a Transferred Asset
or any circumstances resulting therefrom shall not, in and of
itself, constitute a Business Material Adverse Effect or a breach by the
Seller of any representation, warranty, condition, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement. No member of the Seller Group shall be required
to make any material expenditure or incur any material liability in
connection with any such activities described in this _Section 1.3(b)_ ,
unless reimbursed by the Purchaser for the full amount of any such
expenditure or liability. Notwithstanding the six month time period specified
in the first sentence of this _Section 1.3(b)_ , with respect to any Excluded
Interest that is a Contract with a Governmental Authority, the reasonable and
lawful arrangement contemplated by this _Section 1.3(b)_ shall continue until
the end of the term of such Contract as in effect on the Closing Date.

  



  

Section 1.4. _Assumed Liabilities; Excluded Liabilities_.

  



  

(a) _Assumed Liabilities_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Local Transfer Agreements, at the Closing, the Purchaser
shall assume and agree to pay, honor, discharge and perform in full when due,
and shall indemnify and hold Seller and its Affiliates harmless from, all of
the following Liabilities of the members of the Seller Group (other than the
Transferred Entity, as the Purchaser will not directly assume any Liabilities
of the Transferred Entity, although all such Liabilities will remain
Liabilities of the Transferred Entity after the Closing and the Purchaser
shall indemnify and hold the Seller and its Affiliates harmless from all such
Liabilities (other than Excluded Liabilities)) as they exist at the Effective
Time (collectively, the " _Assumed Liabilities_ "), it being understood and
agreed that the Assumed Liabilities do not include any Liabilities of any
member of the Seller Group that are expressly identified in clauses (i)

conduct of the Business prior to, on or following the Closing Date (in each
case, other than the Excluded Employee Liabilities);

  



  

(vi) all Liabilities to the extent arising from or relating to the
possession, occupation, operation, or maintenance of the real properties
subject to the Morangis Transferred Real Property Sublease, whether arising
or accruing before, on or after the Closing Date, and whether such
Liabilities relate to conditions that existed before, on, or after the Closing
Date;

  



  

(vii) all Liabilities to the extent relating to the Business arising under
Environmental Laws;

  



  

(viii) all Liabilities to the extent arising out of or relating to any
Transferred Intellectual Property;

  



  

(ix) all accounts payable owed to suppliers and any other third parties to

any member of the Seller Group (and shall not directly assume any
Liabilities of the Transferred Entity, although all such Liabilities will
remain Liabilities of the Transferred Entity after the Closing; provided that
the Seller shall indemnify and hold the Purchaser and its Affiliates harmless
from all Liabilities of the Transferred Entity that are Excluded Liabilities)
other than the Assumed Liabilities expressly identified in clauses (i) through
(xi), inclusive, of _Section 1.4(a)_ , and the members of the Seller Group
(other than the Transferred Entity) shall retain, and shall indemnify and
hold the Purchaser and its Affiliates harmless from, all other Liabilities of
the members of the Seller Group and all Excluded Liabilities of the
Transferred Entity. All such Liabilities of the members of the Seller Group
are referred to herein as the " _Excluded Liabilities_ ". The Excluded
Liabilities shall include the following:

  



  

(i) all Liabilities to the extent related to the Excluded Assets, including
all Liabilities relating to any business of any member of the Seller
Group other than the Business;

expressly described as being assumed by the Purchaser in _Section 5.10_ and
(E) any other employment and employee Liabilities to the extent such
Liabilities are expressly described as being retained by a member of the
Seller Group in _Section 5.10_ (collectively, the " _Excluded Employee
Liabilities_ ");

  



  

(iv) all Liabilities for Taxes related to the Business or Transferred Assets

equal to ( _i_ ) Three Hundred Sixty One Million Dollars and No Cents
($361,000,000.00) (the " _Purchase Price_ "),  _plus_ ( _ii_ ) the Estimated
Adjustment Amount (which may be positive or negative) (the " _Closing Purchase
Price_ "). The Closing Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment as
provided in _Section 1.8_.

  



  

Section 1.6. _Pre-Closing Estimated Adjustment of Purchase Price_. No later
than five (5) Business Days prior to Closing, the Seller shall prepare
and deliver to the Purchaser a statement (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_
") setting forth the Estimated Closing Working Capital, the Estimated Closing
Cash, the Estimated Transferring Indebtedness and the Estimated Adjustment
Amount, such statement to be prepared in good faith and in accordance with
the Accounting Principles set forth on _Exhibit A_ (the "
_Accounting Principles_ "). The Purchaser shall review the Estimated Closing
Statement and notify the Seller prior to the Closing of any good faith
disagreement that the Purchaser may have with respect to any amount set forth

Section 1.7. _Closing Adjustments Schedule_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as practicable, but no later than ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, __ the Seller shall prepare and deliver to the Purchaser a
schedule setting forth the Seller's calculation of Closing Working Capital,
Closing Cash, Transferring Indebtedness and the Final Purchase Price (the "
_Closing Adjustments Schedule_ "), prepared in accordance with the Accounting
Principles.

  



  

(b) If the Purchaser disagrees with the Seller's calculation of the Final
Purchase Price delivered pursuant to _Section 1.7(a)_ , the Purchaser may,
within sixty (60) days after delivery of the documents referred to in _Section
1.7(a)_ , deliver a notice to the Seller disagreeing with any

   

7 
--- 

  

--- 

     

such calculation and setting forth the Purchaser's calculation of the
applicable amounts and, in reasonable detail, the Purchaser's grounds for
such disagreement. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify those items
or amounts as to which the Purchaser disagrees, and the Purchaser shall be
deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the
Closing Adjustments Schedule and the calculation of the Final Purchase Price
delivered pursuant to _Section 1.7(a)_. If no notice of disagreement is
delivered in accordance with this _Section 1.7(b)_ , the Seller's
calculations of the Final Purchase Price, Closing Working Capital, Closing
Cash and Transferring Indebtedness shall become final and binding.

  



  

(c) If a notice of disagreement shall be delivered pursuant to _Section
1.7(b)_ , the Purchaser and the Seller shall, during the thirty (30) days
following such delivery, use their reasonable best efforts to reach agreement
on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine, as may be required,
the amount of Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash and Transferring
Indebtedness. If, during such period, the Purchaser and the Seller are unable
to reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter jointly engage the
Accountant and shall instruct the Accountant promptly to review this
Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating
Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash and Transferring Indebtedness, as
applicable. The Purchaser and the Seller shall instruct the Accountant to (
_i_ ) consider, in making such calculation(s), only those items or amounts in
the Closing Adjustments Schedule or the Seller's calculation of Closing
Working Capital, Closing Cash and Transferring Indebtedness as to which the
Purchaser has disagreed, ( _ii_ ) prepare its calculations and render its
decision consistent with the terms of this Agreement and ( _iii_ ) deliver to
the Purchaser and the Seller, within thirty (30) days, a report setting forth
such calculations, which, in each case, shall not be more than the amount
thereof shown in the Seller's calculation delivered pursuant to _Section
1.7(a)_ , nor less than the amount thereof shown in the Purchaser's
calculation delivered pursuant to _Section 1.7(b)_. Such report shall be final
and binding upon the Purchaser and the Seller. The Purchaser and the Seller
shall each pay their own fees and expenses in connection with the resolution
of any disputes by the Accountant and the fees and expenses of the Accountant
shall be paid by the Purchaser and the Seller in inverse proportion to the
difference between the Final Purchase Price proposed by each of them and the
Final Purchase Price as determined by the Accountant.

  



  

(d) The Purchaser and the Seller agree that they will, and agree to cause
their respective independent accountants and the personnel of the
Business to, cooperate and assist in the preparation of the Closing
Adjustments Schedule and the calculation of Closing Working Capital, Closing
Cash and Transferring Indebtedness and in the conduct of the Accountant's
review referred to in this _Section 1.7_ , including the making available to
the extent necessary of books, records, work papers and personnel.

  



  

Section 1.8. _Post-Closing Adjustment of Purchase Price_.

  



  

(a) Following the final determination of Final Purchase Price, Closing
Working Capital, Closing Cash and Transferring Indebtedness pursuant to
_Section 1.7_ , a payment (the " _Final Purchase Price Adjustment_ "), shall
be made by the Seller (or one or more Affiliates designated by the Seller) to
the Purchaser (or one or more Affiliates designated by the Purchaser), or by
the Purchaser (or one or more Affiliates designated by the Purchaser) to the
Seller (or one or more Affiliates designated by the Seller), as
applicable, as an adjustment to the

   

8 
--- 

  

--- 

   

Purchase Price. The Final Purchase Price Adjustment shall be an amount equal
to the Closing Purchase Price, _minus_ the Final Purchase Price. If the Final
Purchase Price Adjustment is positive, such amount shall be paid to the
Purchaser (or one or more Affiliates designated by the Purchaser) by the
Seller (or one or more Affiliates designated by the Seller), and if the Final
Purchase Price Adjustment is negative, the absolute value of such amount
shall be paid to the Seller (or one or more Affiliates designated by the
Seller) by the Purchaser (or one or more Affiliates designated by the
Purchaser).

  



  

(b) _Method of Payment_. Any payments pursuant to _Section 1.8(a)_ shall be
made in U.S. dollars and shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated by the receiving party
within ten (10) days after the Final Purchase Price has been determined.

the final determination of the Final Purchase Price, the Seller shall
deliver to the Purchaser a proposed schedule (the " _Allocation Schedule_ ")

promptly after approving the

   

11 
--- 

  

--- 

    

Allocation Schedule, it shall sign the Allocation Schedule and return an
executed copy thereof to the Seller. In the event that the Purchaser does
not agree with the Allocation Schedule as proposed by the Seller and provides
the Seller with written notice of such disagreement, and the basis for such
disagreement, within twenty (20) Business Days after delivery of the proposed
Allocation Schedule, the Purchaser and the Seller shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve any differences, provided that, if the Purchaser does not
provide such written notice within twenty (20) Business Days after delivery
of the proposed Allocation Schedule, the proposed Allocation Schedule shall
become the final Allocation Schedule. In the event that the Purchaser and the
Seller are unable to resolve any differences within forty-five (45) days
after delivery of the proposed Allocation Schedule by the Seller to the
Purchaser, the parties shall retain a mutually acceptable national accounting
firm to determine the final Allocation Schedule. The fees and expenses of
such accounting firm shall be borne equally by the Purchaser and the Seller,
and the decision of such firm shall be final and binding on the parties. The
Purchaser and the Seller shall file and cause to be filed all Tax Returns and
execute such other documents as may be required by any taxing authority, in a
manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule, and shall not take any
position inconsistent therewith in any examination of any Tax Return, in any
refund claim or in any litigation or investigation, except as required by
applicable Laws.

  



  

Section 2.5. _Deferred Closings_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if (i) any (x) consent,
approval or employee information and/or consulting obligations from or with
any employee consultation body or other similar body or (y) other filing,
consent, approval or action of any Governmental Authority or third party, in
each case set forth on Section 2.5(a) of the Disclosure Schedules, shall not
have been obtained or completed by the Closing Date or (ii) the Purchaser has
not been able to form a legal entity in any jurisdiction that is
necessary for the acquisition of Transferred Assets in such jurisdiction or
the employment of Business Employees in such jurisdiction and (iii) in either
of the cases described in clauses (i) and (ii) the Closing is required to be
held as provided in _Section 2.1_ , then the transfer of the Transferred
Assets and the Transferred Employees and the assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities in the jurisdiction in which such consent, approval, obligation,
filing or action has not been obtained or completed (each, a "
_Deferred Jurisdiction_ ") (such Transferred Assets, Transferred Employees
and Assumed Liabilities, collectively, a " _Deferred Business_ ") will not
occur on the Closing Date, but shall instead occur as set forth in this
_Section 2.5_ and the Disapplied Provisions shall not apply to the Deferred
Business as of the Closing. In respect of the Disapplied Provisions, ( _A_
) the term "Business" shall be deemed to exclude the Deferred Business, ( _B_
) the term "Transferred Assets" shall be deemed to exclude the Transferred
Assets in the Deferred Jurisdiction, ( _C_ ) the term "Assumed
Liabilities" shall be deemed to exclude the Assumed Liabilities in the
Deferred Jurisdiction and ( _D_ ) the term "Transferred Employees" shall be
deemed to exclude the Transferred Employees in the Deferred Jurisdiction, in
each case, as of the Closing.

  



  

(b) The closing of each transfer of a Deferred Business (a " _Deferred
Transfer_ ") will be effected on the third Business Day after the relevant
consent, approval, obligation, filing or action in such Deferred Jurisdiction
has been obtained or completed. The parties shall use reasonable best efforts
to ensure that any Deferred Transfer occurs as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Closing Date (the date on which the Deferred Transfer occurs, the "
_Local Closing Date_ ") in accordance with this  _Section 2.5_. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Closing

   

12 
--- 

  

--- 

    

Date shall not be delayed as a result of any Deferred Transfer and there
shall be no change in the amount paid at the Closing pursuant to _Section 1.5_
 as a result of any Deferred Transfer. At the closing of each Deferred
Transfer, the relevant members of the Seller Group, on the one hand, and the
Purchaser or an Affiliate of the Purchaser, on the other, shall execute and
deliver the Local Transfer Agreement pertaining to such Deferred
Jurisdiction. Notwithstanding that legal title to the Deferred Businesses will
not be transferred to the Purchaser on the Closing Date, all provisions of
this Agreement (including the calculation of Closing Working Capital,
Closing Cash and Transferring Indebtedness) __ shall apply to the parties as
though such transfer occurred at the Closing, except to the extent otherwise
expressly provided in this _Section 2.5_. Neither the Seller nor any of its
Affiliates makes any representation or warranty of any kind whatsoever,
whether express or implied, at Law or in equity, with respect to the Deferred
Businesses, other than as set forth in _Article III_ of this Agreement and
then only as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date, in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

(c) From and after the Closing, and until the Deferred Transfer, each
Deferred Business (including all Cash generated with respect thereto) will
be held for the Purchaser's (or its designated Affiliate's) benefit and
account and will be managed and operated by the Seller Group for the
Purchaser's (or its designated Affiliate's) benefit and account, including,
for the avoidance of doubt, all items of income, gain and loss, all Tax
expense and Tax benefit (on a net basis, to the extent actually used by
the Seller Group in the taxable year in which the Deferred Transfer occurs or
either of the two Tax years immediately subsequent thereto), and any such net
amount (taking into account all such items of income, gain, loss, Tax expense,
and Tax benefit with respect to such Deferred Business) shall, promptly
following the applicable Deferred Transfer, (i) be paid over to the Purchaser
by the Seller or its Affiliate, if such net amount is a positive amount or
(ii) be reimbursed by the Purchaser or its Affiliate to the Seller, if such
net amount is a negative amount. The Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser a
statement reflecting its calculation of such net amount in reasonable detail
promptly following the applicable Deferred Transfer (each, a " _Deferred
Transfer Statement_ "). In the event that the Purchaser does not agree with a
Deferred Transfer Statement as proposed by the Seller and provides the
Seller with written notice of such disagreement, and the basis for such
disagreement, within twenty (20) Business Days after delivery of the proposed
Deferred Transfer Statement, the Purchaser and the Seller shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve any differences, provided that, if the Purchaser does
not provide such written notice within twenty (20) Business Days after
delivery of the proposed Deferred Transfer Statement, the proposed Deferred
Transfer Statement shall become the final Deferred Transfer Statement
applicable to such Deferred Transfer. In the event that the Purchaser and the
Seller are unable to resolve any differences within forty-five (45) days
after delivery of the proposed Deferred Transfer Statement by the Seller to
the Purchaser, the parties shall retain a mutually acceptable national
accounting firm to determine the final Deferred Transfer Statement applicable
to such Deferred Transfer. The fees and expenses of such accounting firm
shall be borne equally by the Purchaser and the Seller, and the decision of
such firm shall be final and binding on the parties. Any such payment
pursuant to this _Section 2.5(c)_ shall be treated as a decrease in the
Purchase Price (in the case of a payment to the Purchaser) or an increase in
the Purchase Price (in the case of a payment to the Seller) and, to the
extent the final Allocation Schedule has been agreed as provided in _Section
2.4_ at the time of any such payment, the portion of the Purchase Price
allocated to such Deferred Business shall be decreased (but not below
zero) or increased accordingly.

   

13 
--- 

  

--- 

    

(d) During the period from the Closing Date through (and including) the Local
Closing Date (the " _Interim Period_ "), the Seller shall cause each Deferred
Business to be operated on a basis consistent with past practice (and
accounted for in a manner consistent with 2017, including the treatment of
allocated costs and related party transactions) or, unless prohibited by
applicable Law, otherwise in such manner as the Purchaser shall reasonably
request.

  



  

(e) Except to the extent relating to or arising out of gross negligence or
willful misconduct by a member of the Seller Group, the Purchaser
will indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Group from and against any and
all Losses which the Seller Group may incur or suffer, and any and all Taxes,
to the extent such Losses or Taxes arise out of or as a result of the Seller
Group's post-Closing direct or indirect ownership, management or operation of
each Deferred Business.

(a) Section 3.9(a)(i) of the Disclosure Schedules is a list of all patents,
pending patent applications, registered trademarks, trademark
applications, registered copyrights and domain names included in the
Transferred Intellectual Property (the " _Registered IP_ "). The Registered
IP is valid, enforceable and in good standing with the relevant Governmental
Authority with which it was filed (excluding expired and lapsed patents and
European Patents to the extent not enforceable except through a national
filing). Section 3.9(a)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedules is a list of all
product names that are material to the Business.

member of the Seller Group is the owner of all right, title and interest in
and to the Transferred Intellectual Property transferred by it, subject only
to non-exclusive licenses granted to customers in the ordinary course of
business or patent cross-licenses with third parties, which are not material
to the Business, entered into in connection with settlement of an IP dispute.
Each member of the Seller Group has taken commercially reasonable steps
to protect and maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets included in the
Transferred Intellectual Property. Section 3.9(b) of the Disclosure Schedule
lists all patent cross-licenses with third parties entered into in connection
with settlement of any IP dispute related to the Business.

  



  

(c) The operation of the Business as currently conducted does not infringe,
misappropriate, dilute or otherwise violate the Intellectual Property of
another Person. To the Knowledge of the Seller, no Person is infringing,
misappropriating, diluting or otherwise violating the Transferred
Intellectual Property.

  



  

(d) No member of the Seller Group is party to any pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Seller, threatened actions, suits or proceedings ( _i_
) alleging that the operation of the Business, infringes, misappropriates,

Transferred Intellectual Property and the Intellectual Property
licensed under the IP License Agreement will be sufficient to permit the
Purchaser to continue to conduct the Business immediately following the
Closing in substantially the same manner as the Business is being conducted as
of the date hereof, provided that the foregoing is not a representation as to
non-infringement of any Intellectual Property of any Person, which is the
subject of the first sentence of _Section 3.9(c)_. For the avoidance of
doubt, the conduct of the Business immediately following the Closing in
substantially the same manner as the Business is being conducted as of the
date hereof, including the use of the Transferred Intellectual Property, will
not (taking account of the License

   

18 
--- 

  

--- 

    

Agreement) infringe, misappropriate, dilute or otherwise violate the Excluded
Intellectual Property owned by Seller or its Affiliates.

  



  

(g) No software included in the Transferred Assets incorporates any open
source code in a manner that would (i) require the contribution, sale,
licensing, provision or public disclosure to any person of any source code
for such software or (ii) impose limitations on the Purchaser's or the
Transferred Entity's right to require royalty payments from or restrict
further distribution of such software. Neither the Seller nor any of its
Affiliates, including the Transferred Entity, have participated in any
standards setting activities that would materially affect the proprietary
nature of any such software or restrict the ability of the Purchaser or the
Transferred Entity to enforce, license, or exclude others from using any
software included in the Transferred Assets. Every member of the Seller Group
is and has been in compliance with all applicable licenses with respect to any
third party software that constitute open source incorporated in software

components is rendered temporarily or permanently inoperative as a result of
a natural or other disaster. Since January 1, 2015, (i) there has not been any

years, the Business and each of its officers, directors, employees, and to
the Knowledge of the Seller, agents, distributors and other individuals or
entities acting for or on behalf of the Business (collectively, the "

and correct copies of the following with respect to each Business Benefit
Plan required to be listed in Section 3.14(a) of the Disclosure

(b) Each Assumed Benefit Plan is and has at all times been operated in all
material respects in accordance with its terms and with all applicable Laws
including ERISA and the Code. With respect to each such Assumed Benefit Plan
that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, each such
plan has been determined by the IRS to be so qualified as to form, and each
trust forming a part thereof has been determined by the IRS to be exempt from
tax pursuant to Section 501(a) of the Code. To the Knowledge of the
Seller, no reason exists that would reasonably be expected to cause such
qualified status to be revoked for any period.

  



  

(c) There are no pending Actions or, to the Knowledge of the Seller, asserted
against any of the Assumed Benefit Plans, the assets of any of the trusts
under such plans, the plan sponsors, the plan administrator or any fiduciary
of any such plan (other than routine benefit claims) that could result in the
imposition of any material Liability on the Purchaser. There are no
investigations or audits by any Governmental Authority of any such Assumed
Benefit Plans, any trusts under such plans, the plan sponsor, the plan
administrator or any fiduciary of any such plan that have been instituted or,
to the Knowledge of the Seller, threatened.

  



  

(d) No member of the Seller Group is obligated to contribute to any
multiemployer plan, as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, on behalf of any

Person or entity that would be treated as a single employer with any member
of the Seller Group for purposes of Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the
Code, there does not exist, nor do any circumstances exist that would
reasonably be expected to result in, any Controlled Group Liability that would

entity that, together with the Purchaser, is treated as a single employer
under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code.

or Section 412 of the Code, and no member of the Seller Group has contributed

business in the last six (6) years. The Seller has not been required to post
any security under ERISA or Section 401(a)(29) of the Code with respect to
any Assumed Benefit Plan, and no fact or event exists that could reasonably be
expected to give rise to any such lien or requirement to post any such
security with respect to any Assumed Benefit Plan.

(f) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Seller and the
consummation by each member of the Seller Group of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not (alone or in combination with any
other event) result in an increase in the amount of compensation or benefits
or the acceleration of the vesting or timing of payment of any compensation or
benefits payable to or in respect of any current or former employee, officer,
director or independent contractor of the Business or any increased or
accelerated funding obligation with respect to any Assumed Benefit Plan.

  



  

(g) No Assumed Benefit Plan provides any post-employment or post-retirement
life, health or welfare benefits to any Business Employee (or dependents
or beneficiaries thereof), except as otherwise required by Section 4980B of
the Code or any other applicable Law, or where the cost of such benefit is
borne by the Business Employee.

  



  

(h) No member of the Seller Group has any Liability for any material Tax or
penalty arising under Sections 4971, 4972, 4975, 4979, 4980 or 4980B of the
Code or Title IV of ERISA with respect to any Assumed Benefit Plan that has
not been satisfied in full.

  



  

(i) All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made or accrued
with respect to any Assumed Benefit Plan have been made on or before
their due dates. All Assumed Benefit Plans are funded to the extent required
under applicable Laws and there exists no event or condition that has or will
subject the Purchaser or the Transferred Entity to any material Liability
under the terms of any Assumed Benefit Plan, ERISA, the Code, or any other
applicable Law. No insurance policy or any other agreement affecting any
Assumed Benefit Plan requires or permits a retroactive increase in
contributions, premiums or other payments due thereunder.

  



  

(j) Subject to the requirements of all applicable Laws, no provision of any
Assumed Benefit Plan nor of any agreement, and no act or omission of
any member of the Seller Group in any way limits, impairs, modifies or
otherwise affects the right of such member of the Seller Group to
unilaterally amend or terminate any Assumed Benefit Plan, and no commitments
to improve or otherwise amend any Assumed Benefit Plan have been made.

party shall have been, duly executed and delivered by the Purchaser, and,
assuming due authorization and delivery by the Seller, this Agreement
constitutes, and upon their execution each such Transaction Document shall
constitute, valid and binding obligations of the Purchaser, enforceable
against the Purchaser in accordance with their terms, subject to the
Enforceability Exceptions.

  



  

Section 4.3. _No Conflict; Governmental Authorizations_.

  



  

(a) The execution and delivery by the Purchaser of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents to which it is a party and the consummation by
the Purchaser of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not and
will not ( _i_ ) violate or conflict with any organizational documents of the
Purchaser, ( _ii_ ) violate, conflict with or result in a breach of, or
constitute a default by (or create an event which, with notice or lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default by) the Purchaser, or give rise to a
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or loss
of a material benefit under, or result in the creation of any Encumbrance
(except for Permitted Encumbrances) upon any material assets of the Purchaser
under, any material Contract of the Purchaser, or ( _iii_ ) violate or result
in a breach of any Permit held by the Purchaser or any Governmental Order
or, subject to the matters described in _Section 4.3(b)_ , Law applicable to

materially delay, the Purchaser's ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.

  



  

(b) Except as provided in _Section 5.5(b)_ , no consent of, or registration,

such Person is greater than the total amount of liabilities, including,
contingent liabilities, of such Person; ( _b_ ) the present fair salable
value of the assets of such Person is not less than the amount that will be
required to pay the probable liability of such Person on its debts as they
become absolute and matured; ( _c_ ) such Person has not incurred and does not
intend to incur, debts or liabilities beyond such Person's ability to pay
such debts and liabilities as they mature; and ( _d_ ) such Person is not
engaged in business or a transaction, and is not about to engage in business
or a transaction, for which such Person's property would constitute an
unreasonably small capital. The amount of contingent liabilities at any time

of all the facts and circumstances existing at such time, represents
the amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured
liability.

contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Equity Financing_ "). The Equity
Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Sponsor, enforceable against Sponsor in accordance with
its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. The aggregate proceeds
contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter, if funded, will be sufficient to

under the Equity Commitment Letter.

communication from any party to any of the Commitment Letters with respect to

or any other party to any of the Commitment Letters, ( _ii_ ) any actual or
potential failure to satisfy any condition precedent or other contingency set
forth in any of the Commitment Letters or ( _iii_ ) any intention of such
party to terminate any of the Commitment Letters or to not provide all or any
portion of the Financing. The Purchaser (both before and after giving effect
to any "market flex" provisions contained in the Commitment Letters): ( _A_ )
has no reason to believe it will not be able to satisfy on a timely basis
each term and condition relating to the closing or funding of the Financing
on the Closing Date; ( _B_ ) knows of no fact, occurrence, circumstance or
condition that would reasonably be expected to ( _1_ ) cause any of the
Commitment Letters or Financing to terminate, to be withdrawn, modified,
repudiated or rescinded or to be or become ineffective, ( _2_ ) cause any of
the terms or conditions relating to the closing or funding of any portion of
the Financing on the Closing Date not to be met or complied with or ( _3_
) otherwise cause the full amount (or any portion) of the funds contemplated
to be available under the Commitment Letters on the Closing Date to not be
available to the Purchaser on a timely basis; and ( _C_ ) knows of no
potential impediment to the funding of any of the payment obligations of the
Purchaser under this Agreement (assuming compliance by the Seller with the
provisions hereof and the accuracy of the representations and warranties made
by such Persons herein). As of the date of this Agreement, the Purchaser is
not aware of any fact or occurrence that makes any representation or warranty
of the Purchaser in this Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letters inaccurate
(assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by such
Persons herein). The Purchaser has fully paid any and all commitment fees or
other fees or deposits required by the Debt Commitment Letters and Financing
to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement, and the Purchaser will pay
when due all other commitment or other fees arising under the Debt Commitment
Letters and Financing as and when they become payable.

obligations of the Purchaser under this Agreement. The Limited Guaranty is in
full force and effect and is a valid and binding obligation of Sponsor,
enforceable against

      

32 
--- 

  

--- 

    

Sponsor in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability
Exceptions, and no event has occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default on the part of Sponsor under the
Limited Guaranty.

  



  

Section 4.8. _Investments_. The Purchaser and its Affiliates do not own any
business, Person or assets that would reasonably be expected to create a
material risk of not obtaining any applicable clearance, approval, consent or
waiver from any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(xv) authorize, commit or agree to take any of the foregoing actions in
respect of which it is restricted by the provisions of this _Section 5.1_.

  



  

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this Agreement is

the Seller Group's business, including, prior to the Closing, the Business.
Prior to the Closing, the Seller Group shall exercise, consistent with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over
its businesses and operations.

(i) continue to be bound by the provisions of _Section 5.1(a)_ and (ii) cause

Section 5.2. _Confidentiality; Access to Information_.

  



  

(a) The parties acknowledge that the information being made available to them
by any member of the Seller Group (or its agents or representatives) is
subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement dated November 30, 2017
by and between Platinum Equity Advisors, LLC and the Seller (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms of which are incorporated herein by
reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement will terminate solely with respect to information
relating to the Business; _provided_ that the Purchaser acknowledges that any
and all other information provided or made available to it or its
representatives concerning any member of the Seller Group or any Affiliate of
any member of the Seller Group will remain subject to the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement and all other provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive in accordance with its terms after
the Closing. Notwithstanding any provision of the Confidentiality Agreement,
the Seller hereby consents to the disclosure by the Purchaser to the Debt
Financing Sources of any confidential information as to which disclosure
would otherwise be limited under the Confidentiality Agreement, subject to the
requirement that the Debt Financing Sources be informed of the Purchaser's
confidentiality obligations with respect thereto under the Confidentiality
Agreement and agree with the Purchaser to be bound by such confidentiality
obligations.

  



  

(b) From the date hereof until the Closing Date or earlier termination of
this Agreement, to the extent permitted by Law, the Seller shall, and
shall cause the other members of the Seller Group to, provide the Purchaser
and its representatives with such reasonable access to the facilities of the
Business, the Business's principal personnel and the books and records
pertaining to the Business as the Purchaser may reasonably request in writing
in order to effectuate the transactions contemplated hereby, without charge to
the Purchaser (but otherwise at the Purchaser's expense); _provided_ that (
_i_ ) certain materials subject to confidentiality obligations or attorney-
client privilege, or which may not be shared with the other party pursuant to
applicable Law, have not been and will not be so delivered or made available
to the Purchaser

      

36 
--- 

  

--- 

    

or its representatives, ( _ii_ ) neither the Purchaser nor any of its
representatives shall conduct any invasive investigation, testing or
sampling of any environmental media and ( _iii_ ) such access will be
requested in writing with reasonable advance notice and exercised during
normal business hours and without causing unreasonable interference with the
operations of the Business. The Purchaser and its representatives shall not
contact any suppliers, customers, landlords and other business relations or
employees of the Business without the Seller's prior written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Without limiting the foregoing, promptly following the date hereof, the
Seller shall provide the Purchaser with an electronic copy of the virtual
data room maintained by Intralinks in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as it existed as of the close of business on
the day prior to the date hereof.

  



  

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Seller and the
Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith to (i) assist the Purchaser to
develop the stand-alone capability to provide payroll services following the
Closing, (ii) test the effectiveness of the Seller's consolidation and data
migration solution and (iii) facilitate the parties' joint efforts to enable
the Business to operate on a stand-alone basis following the Closing;
provided, that the Seller shall not be required to take any such action
requested by the Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 5.2(c)_ if such action
would require the Seller or any of its Affiliates to incur any out-of-pocket
fees or expenses unless the Purchaser agrees to reimburse the Seller or such
Affiliate for such fees or expenses. In connection with assisting the
Purchaser to develop the stand-alone capability to provide payroll services
following the Closing, the Seller shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, authorize Automatic Data Processing, Inc. to transfer to the
Purchaser such information as the Purchaser may reasonably request in
writing, such authorization to be provided no later than three (3) Business
Days after the Purchaser's request.

  



  

Section 5.3. _Publicity_. From the date hereof until the Closing or earlier
termination of this Agreement, the Purchaser and the Seller shall not, and
each shall cause its Affiliates and its and their representatives not to,
issue any press release or public announcement concerning this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, without obtaining the prior written
approval of the other party hereto, which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, unless, in the reasonable judgment of the Purchaser or
the Seller, disclosure is otherwise required by applicable Law or the rules
of any stock exchange, as applicable; _provided_ that, to the extent required
by applicable Law or by the rules of any stock exchange, the party intending
to make such release or announcement shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts, consistent with such applicable Law, to consult with the other party
with respect to the text thereof; _provided_ , _further_ , that no party
shall be required to obtain consent pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ to the
extent any proposed release or announcement is consistent with information
that has previously been made public without breach of the obligations under
this _Section 5.3_.

  



  

Section 5.4. _Post-Closing Access_.

  



  

(a) The Seller shall, and shall cause each other member of the Seller Group
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Purchaser at the Closing all properties, books, records,
Contracts, information and documents in the Seller's, such member of the
Seller Group's or any of their respective Affiliates' possession relating to
the Business that are part of the Transferred Assets. As soon as is
reasonably practicable after the

      

37 
--- 

  

--- 

    

Closing, the Seller shall, and shall cause each other member of the Seller
Group to, deliver or cause to be delivered to the Purchaser any remaining
properties, books, records, Contracts, information and documents relating to
the Business that are part of the Transferred Assets that are not already in
the possession or control of the Purchaser.

  



  

(b) The Purchaser agrees that it will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to,
preserve and keep the books of accounts and financial and other records held
by it relating to the Business (including accountants' work papers) for a
period of seven years from the Closing Date;  _provided_ that, prior to
disposing of any such records after such period, the applicable Person shall
provide written notice to the Seller of its intent to dispose of such records
and shall provide the Seller with the opportunity to take ownership
and possession of such records (at the Seller's sole expense) within 30 days
after such notice is delivered. If the Seller does not confirm its intention
in writing to take ownership and possession of such records within such 30-day
period, the Person who possesses the records may proceed with the disposition
of such records.

  



  

(c) The Seller and the Purchaser shall make, or cause to be made, all records
and other information relating to the Business and all employees and auditors
(including by making them available for depositions, interrogatories,
testimony, investigation and preparation in connection with any legal or
arbitration proceeding) available to the other, as may be reasonably required
by such party, and at the sole expense of the requesting party, ( _i_ ) in
connection with any audit or investigation of, insurance claims by, legal
proceedings against, disputes involving, or governmental investigations of,
the Seller or the Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates, ( _ii_ )
in order to enable the Seller or the Purchaser to comply with its obligations
under this Agreement and each other agreement, document or instrument
contemplated hereby or thereby or ( _iii_ ) for any other reasonable business
purpose relating to the Seller, the Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates, but excluding, in each case, any dispute between the Seller or
any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, on the other hand, except as would be required by applicable
civil process or applicable discovery rules

  



  

(d) Promptly following the Closing, the Seller shall provide the Purchaser
with an electronic copy of the virtual data room maintained by Intralinks
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as it
existed as of the close of business on the day prior to the Closing.

  



  

Section 5.5. _Governmental Approvals and Notifications_.

  



  

(a) Without limiting the Purchaser's obligations set forth in this _Section
5.5_ , each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly
as practicable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties
hereto shall cooperate to make, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
all filings and applications with and to, and obtain all licenses,
permits, consents, waivers, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and
orders of, applicable Governmental Authorities to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including under applicable Antitrust Laws). In
furtherance of the foregoing:

      

38 
--- 

  

--- 

    

(b) The parties hereto shall ( _i_ ) file or cause to be filed as promptly as
practicable, but in no event later than ten Business Days following
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, with any applicable
Governmental Authority all notification and report forms that may be required
for the transactions contemplated hereby and thereafter provide as promptly as
practicable any supplemental information requested in connection therewith
pursuant to any Antitrust Law and ( _ii_ ) include in each such filing,
notification and report form referred to in the immediately preceding clause
(i) a request for early termination or acceleration of any applicable
waiting or review periods, to the extent available under the applicable
Antitrust Law. In connection therewith, each party hereto shall ( _A_ )
furnish to the other parties such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as any such other party may reasonably request in connection with
its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under any
Antitrust Law, ( _B_ ) subject to applicable Laws, provide the other party
with a draft of any filing or submission and a reasonable opportunity to
review such draft before making or causing to be made such filing or
submission (provided, however, that confidential information pertaining to
each party may be withheld or redacted as appropriate), and consider in good
faith the views of such other party regarding such filing or submission, (
_C_ ) not extend any applicable waiting or review periods or enter into any
agreement with a Governmental Authority to delay or not to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated on the Closing Date, except
with the prior written consent of the other parties, ( _D_ ) not have any
substantive contact with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing
or proceeding contemplated by this _Section 5.5(b)_ , unless such party has
engaged in prior consultation with the other party and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority, given the other party the
opportunity to participate and ( _E_ ) keep the other party apprised of the
status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for
additional information from, any applicable Governmental Authority (subject
to redaction of any provided materials with respect to any
confidential information).

  



  

(c) The Purchaser further agrees to take, and to cause its Affiliates to
take, any action to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment that may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon
as reasonably possible, including ( _i_ ) the prompt use of its best efforts
to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any permanent,
preliminary or temporary injunction or other order, decree, decision,
determination or judgment that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or
otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including ( _A_ ) the defense through litigation on the merits of
any claim asserted in any court, agency or other proceeding by any Person,
including any Governmental Authority, seeking to delay, restrain, prevent,
enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of such transactions, ( _B_ ) the
proffer and agreement by the Purchaser or its Affiliates of its willingness to
sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of, or hold separate pending such
disposition, and promptly to effect the sale, lease, license, disposal and
holding separate of, such assets, rights, product lines, categories of assets
or businesses or other operations or interests therein of the Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Transferred Assets
and the Transferred Entity) (and the entry into agreements with, and
submission to orders of, the relevant Governmental Authority giving effect
thereto) no later than 60 days from the date of this Agreement and ( _C_ )
the proffer and agreement by the Purchaser and its Affiliates of their
willingness to take such other actions, and promptly to effect such other
actions (and the entry into agreements with, and submission to orders of, the
relevant Governmental Authority giving

      

39 
--- 

  

--- 

    

effect thereto) no later than 60 days from the date of this Agreement, in
each case if such action should be reasonably necessary or advisable to
avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual, anticipated or threatened (
_1_ ) commencement of any proceeding in any forum or ( _2_ ) issuance of any
order, decree, decision, determination or judgment that would delay, restrain,
prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by any Governmental Authority and ( _ii_ ) the
prompt use of its best efforts to take, in the event that any permanent,
preliminary or temporary injunction, decision, order, judgment,
determination or decree is entered or issued, or becomes reasonably
foreseeable to be entered or issued, in any proceeding or inquiry of any kind
that would make consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with its terms unlawful or that would delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any and all steps (including the
appeal thereof and the posting of a bond) necessary to resist, vacate, modify,
reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate or remove such actual, anticipated or
threatened injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination or decree so
as to permit such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that the Purchaser shall
not be required to take any action pursuant to this _Section 5.5(c)_ that
would reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on the
assets, financial condition or operations of the Business, taken as a whole.

  



  

(d) Nothing in _Section 5.5(c)_ shall obligate the Purchaser or its
Affiliates to agree to any divestitures or other remedy not conditioned on the
consummation of the Closing. Neither the Purchaser nor the Seller shall, nor
shall the Purchaser or the Seller permit any of their respective Subsidiaries
to, acquire or agree to acquire any business, Person or division thereof, or
otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if the entering into of a
definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of such acquisition would
reasonably be expected to materially increase the risk of not obtaining the
applicable clearance, approval, consent or waiver from any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

(e) The filing fees under Antitrust Laws and all other applicable Laws shall
be borne by the Purchaser.

  



  

Section 5.6. _Third-Party Consents_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser and the Seller shall, and the Seller
shall cause each other member of the Seller Group to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all
consents required in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including all required consents
under Transferred Business Contracts and the Morangis Transferred Real
Property Sublease and the Danbury Lease, but excluding consents of
Governmental Authorities, which are governed by _Section 5.5_ ; _provided_
that ( _i_ ) neither the Purchaser nor any member of the Seller Group shall be
obligated to pay any consideration to any third party from whom consent is
requested; and ( _ii_ ) obtaining any such consents shall not be a
condition to Closing.

  



  

(b) The Purchaser and the Seller shall, and the Seller shall cause each other
member of the Seller Group to, use commercially reasonable efforts after the
Closing Date to obtain any consents, approvals or authorizations of any third
parties that are not obtained prior to the Closing Date and that are required
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this

      

40 
--- 

  

--- 

    

Agreement; _provided_  that neither the Purchaser nor any member of the
Seller Group (nor any of their respective Affiliates) shall be obligated to
pay any consideration to any third party from whom consent is requested.

  



  

Section 5.7. _Shared Contracts_.

  



  

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing, upon the Purchaser's reasonable
request, with respect to any Shared Contract that is not a
Transferred Business Contract, the Seller and the Purchaser shall use, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to use, commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the counterparty to such Shared Contract ( _i_ )
to enter into a new contract with the Purchaser or any designee of the
Purchaser, on terms substantially similar in all material respects to those
contained in such Shared Contract, in order for the Business to receive the
applicable benefits under such Shared Contract (each such new contract, a "
_New Contract_ "), it being understood that a New Contract will not
necessarily contain the same terms as the Shared Contract to which it
relates, or ( _ii_ ) if practicable, and (subject to any required third-party
consents or notices and any restrictions imposed by applicable Law), to
assign to the Purchaser or any designee of the Purchaser the benefits and
obligations under such Shared Contract to the extent relating to the
Business; _provided_ , that no member of the Seller Group shall be required to
assign any such benefits and obligations under any Shared Contract if doing
so would reasonably be anticipated to materially and adversely affect the
rights of such member of the Seller Group thereunder. In connection with the
entering into of New Contracts, the Seller and the Purchaser shall use, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to use, reasonable best efforts to
ensure that each member of the Seller Group and its Affiliates are released
by such counterparty with respect to all liabilities and obligations relating
to the Business and arising after the Closing and the Purchaser shall
indemnify and hold harmless the applicable member of the Seller Group
from and against all Losses to the extent arising from or relating to the
obligations of the Purchaser or the Business under any New Contract.

  



  

(b) If, prior to the Closing, the parties are not able, with respect to any
such Shared Contract, to obtain a New Contract in respect of such
Shared Contract or to assign to the Purchaser or its designee the benefits
and obligations of such Shared Contract to the extent relating to the
Business, then for a period of six months following the Closing, (i) the
Seller and the Purchaser shall continue to use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such counterparty to enter into such a New Contract or so
assign such benefits and obligations under such Shared Contract and ( _ii_ )
until such time as such a New Contract is executed or such benefits and
obligations under such Shared Contract are so assigned, the Seller and the
Purchaser shall enter into such reasonable and lawful arrangements reasonably
satisfactory to both parties as shall provide the applicable rights and
benefits of such Shared Contract to the Purchaser or its designee, and shall
require the Purchaser or its designee to pay or satisfy the corresponding
liabilities and obligations with respect to such Shared Contract, in each
case to the same extent as if such a New Contract had been executed or such
benefits and obligations had been so assigned as of the Closing. The parties
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to structure the provision of the
benefits of any Shared Contract to Purchaser in a manner that does not result
in any member of the Seller Group or any of their Affiliates recognizing net
taxable income (taking into account any deductions available for payments made
to Purchaser) with respect to such structure, _provided_ , that if
notwithstanding such efforts any member of the Seller Group or any of their
Affiliates recognizes net taxable income as a result of such structure, then
the amount

      

41 
--- 

  

--- 

    

payable by Seller shall be reduced by 25.5% of such net taxable income, and
provided further, that the foregoing shall not prevent any member of the
Seller Group or any of their Affiliates from reporting net taxable income
arising from such structure on its Tax returns as required by applicable Law
as reasonably determined by Seller. Notwithstanding the six month time period
specified in the first sentence of this _Section 5.7(b)_ , with respect to
any Shared Contract that is a Contract with a Governmental Authority, the
reasonable and lawful arrangement contemplated by this _Section 5.7(b)_ shall
continue until the end of the term of such Shared Contract as in effect on
the Closing Date.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except as
provided in the final sentence of _Section 5.7(b)_ , no member of the Seller
Group shall have any obligation under this _Section 5.7_ following the first
anniversary of the Closing Date. No member of the Seller Group shall be
required to make any expenditure or incur any liability in connection with any
such activities described in this _Section 5.7_ , unless reimbursed by the
Purchaser for the full amount of any such expenditure or liability (for
actual costs only). The Purchaser acknowledges that no member of the Seller
Group shall have any liability or obligation with respect to any New Contract
or failure to obtain any New Contract.

  



  

(d) From the date hereof through the Closing, neither the Seller nor any of
its Affiliates will enter into any new Contract that would constitute a
Shared Contract without prior consultation with the Purchaser as to the
provisions of such Shared Contract that will affect the Business and without
the Purchaser's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

Section 5.8. _Further Action; Accounts Payable; Payments Made_.

  



  

(a) From time to time after the Closing Date, and for no further
consideration, the Purchaser and the Seller shall, and to the extent any
Transferred Assets or Assumed Liabilities are held by any other member of the
Seller Group, the Seller shall cause such other member of the Seller Group
to, execute, acknowledge and deliver, or cause to be executed, acknowledged
and delivered, such assignments, transfers, consents, assumptions and other
documents and instruments and take such other actions as may reasonably be
necessary to appropriately consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
including ( _i_ ) transferring back to the Seller (or applicable member
of the Seller Group) any asset or Liability that was not contemplated by this
Agreement to be transferred to the Purchaser at the Closing but was so
transferred at the Closing and ( _ii_ ) transferring to the Purchaser any
asset or Liability contemplated by this Agreement to be transferred to the
Purchaser that was not so transferred at the Closing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, from time to time after the Closing Date, if
Seller intends to enforce a patent included in the Transferred
Intellectual Property, Seller shall take any action reasonably requested by
the Purchaser to resolve any issues with respect to the chain of title with
respect to such patent, provided that the Seller and the Purchaser shall each
bear one-half of any third party out-of-pocket fees and expenses (i.e., not
including any charges for internal personal or other internal resources)
reasonably incurred in taking such action, and further provided that Seller
shall be deemed to have discharged its obligations pursuant to this sentence
(and shall not be obligated to bear any out-of-pocket fees or expenses) if it
provides Purchaser with an employment or consultant agreement for the
applicable inventor that includes a general assignment of such inventor's work
product.

      

42 
--- 

  

--- 

    

(b) In the event that any member of the Seller Group (excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Transferred Entity) pays, on or after the
Closing Date, any account payable that constitutes an Assumed Liability, such
member of the Seller Group shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the
Purchaser in full for such payment. The applicable member of the Seller Group
may deliver notice claiming reimbursement, together with reasonable
supporting documentation that such payment was made, to the Purchaser, and the
Purchaser shall, within five Business Days of receiving such notice,
reimburse such member of the Seller Group in full for such payment.

  



  

(c) The Seller, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, agree
that, after the Closing Date, they shall hold and shall promptly (and in any
event within ten (10) Business Days after receipt) transfer and deliver or
cause to be delivered to the Purchaser or the Seller, as applicable, from
time to time as and when received by either of them, any cash, checks with
appropriate endorsements (using commercially reasonable efforts not to
convert such checks into cash), or other property that either of them may
receive after the Closing Date which property belongs to the other party,
including any payments of accounts receivable, and shall account to the other
party for all such receipts.

  



  

(d) In the event of a dispute between the parties regarding the Seller's or
the Purchaser's obligations under Section 5.8(b) or Section 5.8(c), the
parties shall cooperate and act in good faith to promptly resolve such dispute
and, in connection with such cooperation, allow each other reasonable access
to the records of the other relating to such disputed item.

  



  

Section 5.9. _Expenses_. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby
are consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party
hereto incurring such expenses.

  



  

Section 5.10. _Employees and Employee Benefit Plans_.

  



  

(a) _Business Employee List_. The Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser an
update to the Business Employee List at a reasonable time prior to the
Closing Date.

  



  

(b) _Continuation of Employment_.

  



  

(i) Where applicable Law provides for the automatic transfer of employment of
any Business Employee upon the consummation of the Closing, the parties ( _A_
) shall take or cause to be taken such actions as are required under
applicable Law to accomplish such transfer of employment of such Business
Employee to the Purchaser or an Affiliate of the Purchaser by operation of Law
as of the Closing and ( _B_ ) shall not take and shall not cause to be taken
any such actions that would result in the employment of such Business Employee
not transferring to the Purchaser by operation of Law as of the Closing.
Where applicable Law does not provide for the automatic transfer of
employment of any Business Employee upon the consummation of the Closing, the
Purchaser shall make offers of employment to such Business Employee (which
offers may be of at-will employment to the extent permitted by applicable Law)
in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 5.10_ , to be effective as
of the Closing.

  



  

(ii) The parties acknowledge that the transfer of the portions of the
Business conducted by the Seller Group in the European Union (" _EU_ ") and
certain other countries

      

43 
--- 

  

--- 

    

constitutes a transfer of business within the meaning of EU Council Directive
2001/23/EC, the national Laws implementing the same or any similar
Laws applicable in non-EU jurisdictions, and each Business Employee with
respect to such portions of the Business shall be referred to herein as a "
_European Employee_." Subject to _Section 5.10(b)(iii)_ below, the parties
further acknowledge that, as a result, the employment of the European
Employees, including all related rights and obligations, will transfer by
operation of Law to the Purchaser, as applicable, as of the Closing Date,
except with respect to any European Employee who timely exercises his or her
rights, if any, under any applicable Law to prevent such transfer from
occurring. Each European Employee or other Business Employee whose employment
transfers automatically to the Purchaser by operation of Law, together with
each other Business Employee of the Transferred Entity, is referred to herein
as an " _Automatic Transferred Employee_." The Purchaser will assume by
operation of Law, as of the Closing, all Liabilities with respect to the
Automatic Transferred Employees except to the extent otherwise provided in
this _Section 5.10_.

  



  

(iii) The parties will use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
the approval of the applicable Governmental Authority or any labor
authority as may be required for the transfer of the Automatic Transferred
Employees, if any, who are "protected employees" under applicable Law. If any
Business Employee requires a work permit or employment pass or other legal or
regulatory approval for his or her employment with the Purchaser, the
Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such
permit, pass or other approval to be obtained and in effect prior to the
Closing Date. In the event any such permit, pass or other approval is not
obtained and in effect prior to the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such permit, pass or other
approval to be obtained as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter.

  



  

(c) _Offers of Employment_. Each Business Employee (other than Business
Employees who are on long-term disability or other long term leave of
absence) who is not an Automatic Transferred Employee is referred to herein as
an " _Offer Employee_ ". The Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its
Affiliates make an offer of employment to such Offer Employee (which offer may
be of at-will employment to the extent permitted by applicable Law), at least
fifteen (15) days prior to the anticipated Closing Date (or such longer
period as may be required by applicable Law, the terms of any applicable
Labor Contract or the Severance Obligations), with such employment to be
effective as of the Closing Date. Any such offer of employment shall ( _i_ )
comply with applicable Law, any applicable Labor Contract and this _Section
5.10_ and ( _ii_ ) provide for terms and conditions of employment which, in
the case of each Business Employee are sufficient to avoid Severance
Obligations. Each such Offer Employee who accepts such offer of
employment from the Purchaser, collectively with each Automatic Transferred
Employee, is referred to herein as a " _Transferred Employee_ ". The Seller
shall retain all Liabilities with respect to any Offer Employee who does not
accept an offer of employment that complies with the terms of this Agreement.
Except as otherwise specifically provided in this _Section 5.10_ or to the
extent required by applicable Law, effective as of the day after the Closing
Date (or such later date on which a Transferred Employee commences employment
with the Purchaser), the Transferred Employees shall cease (i) all active
participation in and accrual of benefits under the Business Benefit Plans,
other than any such plan that is sponsored, maintained, contributed to or
required to be contributed to by the Transferred Entity and (ii) receiving
payment of their wages from the Seller Group. If and to the extent that any
Business Employee who is on long-term disability or other long-term leave of
absence as of the Closing

      

44 
--- 

  

--- 

    

Date but who would otherwise have been an Offer Employee is able to return to
active employment within 180 days of the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
make such Business Employee an offer of employment as provided above and, if
accepted, such Business Employee will become a Transferred Employee from and
after the date that his or her employment with the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates commences as provided in such offer.

  



  

(d) _Continuation of Compensation and Benefits._ Until the later of December
31, 2018 (or, if the Closing occurs after July 31, 2018, until six (6) months
after the Closing Date, or, in any event, for such longer period as is
required by applicable Law), the Purchaser shall provide to each Transferred
Employee ( _i_ ) a base salary or base wages (including, in the case of
persons receiving commission based income, the rate of commissions) and cash
incentive compensation opportunities that are no less favorable than those
provided to such Transferred Employee as in effect immediately prior to the
Closing Date, ( _ii_ ) other employee benefits (excluding, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, equity compensation, defined benefit retirement
benefits and retiree life and retiree medical benefits, other post-employment
benefits and long-term incentive or deferred compensation) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such
Transferred Employee as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date and (
_iii_ ) any other additional terms and conditions of employment required by
applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the compensation and benefits
of Transferred Employees who are covered by a Labor Contract shall be provided
in accordance with the applicable Labor Contract. Except to the extent
otherwise provided in a Labor Contract or at applicable Law, nothing
contemplated by this Agreement shall be construed as requiring the Purchaser
to be obligated to continue the employment of any Transferred Employee for any
period after the Closing Date or to provide any specific employee benefit;
_provided_ that the Purchaser shall provide such Transferred Employee with
pay and benefits to the extent required pursuant to _Section 5.10(e)(ii)_.

  



  

(e) _Severance Obligations_.

  



  

(i) The parties intend that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall not constitute a separation, termination or severance of employment of
any Business Employee prior to or upon the consummation of the Closing and
that the Business Employees will have continuous and uninterrupted employment
immediately before and immediately after the Closing Date, and the Purchaser
shall comply with any requirements under applicable Law to ensure the same.
The Purchaser shall bear any costs related to, and shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Seller from and against, any claims made by any Business
Employee for any Severance Obligations, in each case, arising out of,
relating to or in connection with any of the following: ( _A_ ) the failure of
the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries to make offers of employment to, or
continue the employment of, any Business Employee in accordance with this
Agreement or as required by applicable Law or a Labor Contract, ( _B_ ) any
Transferred Employee's transfer (automatic or otherwise) of employment to or
continuation of employment with the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries upon
the Closing Date or ( _C_ ) any action taken on or after the Closing Date by
the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any
Transferred Employee or which provides such Transferred Employee a right to
terminate employment, including in the case of this clause (C), any action or
omission by the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries ( _1_ ) to amend or
otherwise modify on or after the Closing Date any terms and conditions of
employment applicable to, or compensation and benefits provided to, any

      

45 
--- 

  

--- 

    

Transferred Employee or ( _2_ ) that does not comply with applicable Law or
the terms of any Assumed Benefit Plans or applicable Labor Contract.

  



  

(ii) Notwithstanding  _Section 5.10(d)_ , the Purchaser shall provide each
Transferred Employee whose employment is terminated within twelve (12) months
following the Closing Date (or within such longer period as may be required by
applicable Law) with severance and other separation benefits no less
favorable than the severance and other separation benefits which such
Transferred Employee would have been eligible to receive under the Business
Benefit Plans as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date and set forth
on Section 5.10(e)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedules.

  



  

(f) _Prior Service Credit_. From and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred
Entity) to, give to each Transferred Employee full credit for all purposes
(including for purposes of eligibility to participate, level of benefits,
vacation accrual and other paid time off, severance or separation
entitlements, long-service pay, vesting and benefit accrual) under any
employee benefit plan or arrangement provided, maintained or contributed to by
the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entity)
for such Transferred Employee's service with the Seller Group, and with any
predecessor employer, to the same extent recognized by the Seller Group
immediately prior to the Closing Date, except to the extent such credit would
result in the duplication of benefits for the same period of service.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted under any applicable
Law, the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entity)
shall not be required to provide credit for such service for benefit accrual
purposes under any employee benefit plan or arrangement of the Purchaser or
its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entity) that is a defined benefit
pension plan, unless such plan is an Assumed Benefit Plan, or which would
result in a duplication of any benefit otherwise provided under a Business
Benefit Plan.

  



  

(g) _Cash Incentive Bonus Plans_. Without limiting the generality of _Section
5.10(d)_ , effective as of the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall, or shall
cause its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entity) to, assume all
liability for and make any and all payments required with respect to
compensation payable in respect of any Transferred Employee (whether relating
to periods prior to or following the Closing Date) under the 2018 fiscal year
cash-based bonus or incentive compensation plan or arrangements maintained by
any member of the Seller Group, in each case, in an amount no less than the
amount such Transferred Employee would have been eligible to receive for the
applicable performance period had such Transferred Employee remained an
employee of such member of the Seller Group through the requisite date,
assuming achievement of applicable goals and conditions at target performance
levels, but taking into account any payments actually received by any
Transferred Employee in respect of such arrangements prior to the Closing.
The foregoing notwithstanding, an appropriate accrual shall be included in
determining Closing Working Capital for any Liabilities assumed by the
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this _Section 5.10(g)_ that
is required to be accrued as of the Effective Time under Accounting
Principles.

(h) _Certain Welfare Benefits Matters_.

  



   

(i) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.10(d)_ , effective as of
immediately following the Closing, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entity) to, have in effect for the
benefit of the Transferred Employees employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements providing medical, dental, vision, health, non-occupational
short-term disability and long-term disability benefits and any other
employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements required by applicable Law
(collectively, the " _Purchaser Welfare Plans_ "). The Purchaser shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entity) to, use
reasonable best efforts to ( _A_ ) waive all limitations as to pre-existing
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods and actively-at-work requirements
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the
Transferred Employees and their dependents and beneficiaries under the
Purchaser Welfare Plans, to the extent waived under the applicable
corresponding Business Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date,
and ( _B_ ) provide each Transferred Employee and his or her
eligible dependents and beneficiaries with credit under the Purchaser Welfare
Plans for any co-payments and deductibles paid under the
applicable corresponding Business Benefit Plans prior to the Closing Date in
the calendar year in which the Closing occurs for purposes of satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements (and any annual and
lifetime maximums) under any Purchaser Welfare Plan in which such Transferred
Employee participates.

  



  

(ii) From and after the Closing Date, the Seller Group shall retain all
Liabilities with respect to Former Employees who had been employed in the
United States and their eligible dependents and beneficiaries under the
welfare benefit plans and programs maintained by any member of the Seller
Group, if and to the extent such persons are participating in such plans and
programs under COBRA as of immediately prior to the Closing Date. From and
after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall be responsible for all Liabilities
with respect to the right of any Transferred Employee whose employment
terminates on or after the Closing Date (and any right derived from
such Transferred Employee by his or her eligible dependents and
beneficiaries) to health insurance under COBRA and applicable state or
similar law.

  



  

(iii) From and after the Closing Date, the Seller Group shall retain all
Liabilities in accordance with the Business Benefit Plans for payment of
all medical, dental, vision and health (collectively, " _Welfare Benefit
Claims_ ") incurred under such plans prior to the Closing Date with respect
to any Transferred Employee (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof), and the
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entity) shall not
assume any Liability with respect to such Welfare Benefit Claims, except to
the extent required by applicable Law or to the extent such Welfare Benefit
Claims ( _A_ ) are incurred under any Assumed Benefit Plan or ( _B_ ) are
insured under an insurance policy in respect of which ( _1_ ) the Transferred
Entity (or, as of the Closing, the Purchaser or its Subsidiaries) becomes the
beneficiary or ( _2_ ) a Transferred Employee (or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof) is the beneficiary and such insurance policy transfers
with such Transferred Employee pursuant to applicable Law to the Purchaser
and its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entity) as of the Closing. The
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entity) shall be
liable for payment of all Welfare Benefit Claims incurred on or after the
Closing Date with respect to any Transferred Employee (or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof), and, from and after the Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall (including the Transferred Entity) cause all such Welfare
Benefit Claims to be assumed by and administered under the Purchaser Welfare
Plans.

(i) _Tax-Qualified Savings/401(k) Plan/Seller 's Deferred Compensation
Plan/Canada Registered Pension Plan_.

  



  

(i) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.10(d)_ , effective on or
promptly following the Closing Date, the Purchaser or its Subsidiaries shall
have in effect one or more defined contribution plans that include a qualified
cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code
(and a related trust exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code)
(collectively, the " _Purchaser 401(k) Plan_ "). Each Transferred Employee
participating in a Business Benefit Plan that is a defined contribution
plan that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the
meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (collectively, the " _Business 401(k)
Plan_ ") immediately prior to the Closing Date shall become a participant in
the Purchaser 401(k) Plan as of the Closing Date and each other Transferred
Employee shall be eligible to participate in the Purchaser 401(k) Plan as of
the Closing Date.

  



  

(ii) The Purchaser shall cause the Purchaser 401(k) Plan to accept a "direct
rollover" to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan of the account balances of each
Transferred Employee (including promissory notes evidencing all outstanding
loans) under the Business 401(k) Plan, if such direct rollover is elected in
accordance with applicable Law by such Transferred Employee.

  



  

(iii) From and after the Closing Date, the Seller Group shall retain all
assets and Liabilities under the nonqualified deferred compensation plan
maintained by the Seller Group for the benefit of the Business Employees in
the United States.

  



  

(iv) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.10(d)_ , effective on or
promptly following the Closing Date, the Purchaser or its Affiliates shall
have in effect a registered pension plan (within the meaning of Section 248(l)
of the Income Tax Act (Canada)) in Canada and each Business Employee who is
principally employed in Canada and becomes a Transferred Employee and
participates in a registered pension plan maintained by any member of the

entitled under applicable Law or any policy of any member of the Seller Group
to be paid for any vacation days and paid time off days accrued but not yet
taken by the Transferred Employees as of the Closing Date with respect to the
calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs or with respect to any prior
calendar year (the " _Accrued Vacation Days_ "), the Seller shall pay any
required amounts to such Transferred Employee. As of the Closing, the
Purchaser shall assume and honor all the Accrued Vacation Days for which
payout is not made pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence and the
aggregate dollar value of such Liability shall be accrued as a current
liability in determining Closing Working Capital pursuant to the Accounting
Principles.

(k) _Seller Pension Plans_.

  



  

(i) Except with respect to ( _A_ ) any assets and Liabilities that will
transfer to the Purchaser or its Subsidiaries pursuant to applicable Law
(including through the Transferred Entity) as set forth on Section 5.10(k) of
the Disclosure Schedules or ( _B_ ) any Liabilities under the defined benefit
pension plan set forth on Section 5.10(k) of the Disclosure Schedules ("
_Transferred Pension Liabilities_ "), ( _I_ ) from and after the Closing
Date, the Seller Group shall retain all assets and Liabilities under tax-
qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension
plans maintained by each member of the Seller Group for the benefit of the
Business Employees, and the Seller Group shall make payments to Transferred
Employees with vested rights or deemed to have vested rights thereunder in
accordance with the terms of the applicable plan and applicable Law, as in
effect from time to time and ( _II_ ) effective as of the Closing Date, each
Transferred Employee shall cease active participation in such plans and
service performed for, and compensation earned from, any employer other than a
member of the Seller Group (or their predecessors, to the extent recognized
under the applicable plan), shall not be taken into account for any purpose
under the applicable plan.

  



  

(ii) With respect to the Transferred Pension Liabilities, the Purchaser shall
assume or shall cause to be assumed all Liabilities under the applicable
defined benefit plan with respect to the Transferred Employees (and their
respective eligible dependents and beneficiaries).

  



  

(l) _Retiree Benefits_. Except with respect to any Liabilities that transfer
to the Purchaser or one of its Subsidiaries pursuant to applicable Law
(including through the Transferred Entity) as set forth on Section 5.10(l) of
the Disclosure Schedules, the Seller Group shall retain all Liabilities in
respect of Transferred Employees who meet the minimum age and service
eligibility requirements or are deemed to meet such requirements to receive
benefits under the post-retirement health, dental and life insurance plans
maintained by any member of the Seller Group (such plans collectively, the "
_Seller Retiree Welfare Plans_ ") immediately prior to the Closing. The
Seller Group also shall retain all Liabilities under the Seller Retiree
Welfare Plans in respect of all Former Employees and all employees who are
not Transferred Employees.

  



  

(m) _Equity-Based Compensation_. The Seller Group shall retain all
Liabilities under the equity-based compensation plans maintained by any
member of the Seller Group for the benefit of the Business Employees and
shall take all steps necessary to ensure that all outstanding awards under
any such plans held by any Transferred Employees will vest in full as of the
Closing Date.

  



  

(n) _Flexible Spending Accounts_. Effective on or promptly following the
Closing Date, the Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to,
have in effect flexible spending arrangements under a cafeteria plan
qualifying under Section 125 of the Code (the " _Purchaser Flexible Spending
Account Plan_ "). From and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall be
liable for all Liabilities and account balances of the flexible spending
account plan maintained in the United States by each member of the Seller
Group with respect to Transferred Employees and their dependents (the "
_Seller Flexible Spending Account Plan_ "), and all claims for reimbursement
that have not been paid as of the Closing Date shall be paid pursuant to and
under the terms of the Purchaser Flexible Spending Account Plan. As soon as
practicable following the Closing Date, ( _i_ ) the Seller Group shall
transfer to the Purchaser an amount in cash

   

49 
--- 

  

--- 

    

equal to the excess, if any, of the aggregate contributions to the Seller
Flexible Spending Account Plan made by Transferred Employees prior to
the Closing Date for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs over the
aggregate reimbursement payouts made to Transferred Employees prior to the
Closing Date for such year from such plan and ( _ii_ ) the Purchaser shall
cause such amounts to be credited to each such Transferred Employee's
accounts under the Purchaser Flexible Spending Account Plan. In connection
with such transfer, the Purchaser shall deem that such employees' deferral
elections made under the Seller Flexible Spending Account Plan for the plan
year in which the Closing Date occurs shall continue in effect under the
Purchaser Flexible Spending Account Plan for the remainder of the plan year
in which the Closing Date occurs. If the aggregate reimbursement payouts made
to Transferred Employees from the Seller Flexible Spending Account Plan prior
to the Closing for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs exceed
the aggregate accumulated contributions made by the Transferred Employees to
such plan prior to the Closing Date for such plan year, the Purchaser shall
make a payment equal to the value of such excess (or the portion thereof able
to be funded from such additional contributions) to the Seller as soon as
practicable following the Purchaser's receipt of additional contributions from
the applicable Transferred Employee.

  



  

(o) _WARN_. The Purchaser agrees to provide, or cause its Affiliates to
provide, any required notice under the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (" _WARN_ ") or any similar federal,
state or local Law or regulation, and to otherwise comply with WARN and any
other similar Law or regulation, in each case with respect to any "plant
closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined in WARN) or group termination or
similar event affecting Business Employees (including as a result of the
Acquisition) and occurring on and within ninety (90) days after the Closing
Date. None of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates shall take any action
after the Closing that would cause any termination of employment of any
Business Employees that occurs before the Effective Time to constitute a
"plant closing" or "mass layoff" or group termination under WARN or any
similar federal, state or local Law or regulation, or to create any liability
or penalty to any member of the Seller Group for any employment terminations
under applicable Law. On the Closing Date, the Seller shall notify the
Purchaser of any layoffs of any U.S. Business Employees in the 90-day period
prior to the Closing.

  



  

(p) _Employee Consultations_. The Seller shall fully comply with all of its
obligations (however arising) to inform and consult with, and in respect of,
the Business Employees, whether the same arises under any employee
consultation bodies or applicable Law. The Purchaser shall take such steps as
are required by applicable Law, the terms of any employee consultation bodies,
as applicable, or as are otherwise reasonably required by the Seller to
facilitate compliance by the Seller with its obligations to inform and
consult. The Purchaser shall fully comply with all of its obligations
(however arising) to inform and consult with, and in respect of, the Business
Employees, whether the same arises under any employee consultation bodies or
applicable Law. Section 5.10(p) of the Disclosure Schedules lists all
obligations of any member of the Seller Group or the Purchaser to inform and
consult with, and in respect of, the Business Employees, whether the same
arises under any employee consultation bodies or applicable Law.

  



  

(q) _Administration._  Following the date hereof, the parties hereto shall
reasonably cooperate in all matters reasonably necessary to effect the
transactions contemplated by this _Section 5.10_ , including exchanging
information and data relating to the Business Employees'

   

50 
--- 

  

--- 

    

workers' compensation, employee benefits and employee benefit plan coverages
(except to the extent prohibited by applicable Law) and encouraging the
Business Employees to accept the Purchaser's offers of employment made
pursuant to _Section 5.10(c)_. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, to the extent any of the Transferred Employees are in the United
States, the Seller will, and will cause the other members of the Seller Group
to, cooperate with the Purchaser and the Purchaser's agents to provide the
Purchaser with all the Transferred Employees' payroll tax records required by
federal and state agencies necessary for the Purchaser to optimize federal
and state payroll tax law relating to successor-in-interest transactions,
including the transactions contemplated hereby, such records to include, but
not be limited to, the following: ( _i_ ) an executed release form granting
permission to the Purchaser and its agents to obtain quarterly payroll data
relating to the Transferred Employees from all states within which the
Business was conducted by any member of the Seller Group, ( _ii_ ) when
required by state taxing agencies, the Seller will, and will cause the other
members of the Seller Group to, provide signatures (or notarized signatures)
necessary to grant permission for the Purchaser to file for transfers of
experience of the Transferred Employees' payroll tax accounts in states
which require a signed release by the predecessor member of the Seller Group,
and ( _iii_ ) if the Seller or any member of the Seller Group used an outside
payroll tax administrator, then the Seller will provide the Purchaser with a
contact person at such payroll vendor and hereby grants, and shall cause each
member of the Seller Group to grant, the Purchaser permission to have access
to relevant successor-in-interest reports from the payroll vendor to the
extent related to the Transferred Employees.

  



  

(r) _Employee Records._ As of the Closing Date, the Seller shall provide to
the Purchaser, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and Contract, all
employee records reasonably necessary to administer the compensation and
benefits of the Transferred Employees under any Assumed Benefit Plan or other
employee benefit plan, agreement or arrangement. The Purchaser shall ensure
that all such records are used only in connection with the employment of such
Transferred Employee and shall keep such employment records confidential, and
shall indemnify and hold harmless the members of the Seller Group from and
against any statutory, common Law or other claims that arise from the use by
the Purchaser of such employment records from and after the Closing Date
other than for lawful employment or compensation-related purposes.

  



  

(s) _Employee Leasing Arrangement_. Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall
use its best efforts to develop the stand-alone capability to provide payroll
services (" _Payroll Services_ ") for the Business in the United States
immediately following the Closing. If, after the Purchaser's best efforts,
the Purchaser is unable to develop Payroll Services in the United States
fifteen (15) days prior to the Closing, the Parties will enter into an
Employee Leasing Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit D_ (the " _Employee Leasing Agreement_ "). Following the expiration
of the Employee Leasing Agreement, if the Employee Leasing Agreement is
entered into, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, offer
employment to each U.S. Business Employee in accordance with the provisions
of this _Section 5.10_ and the Employee Leasing Agreement, with
such employment to be effective as of the first day following the expiration
of the Employee Leasing Agreement. If the Employee Leasing Agreement is
entered into by the Parties, the term "Transferred Employees" shall be deemed
to exclude the U.S. Business Employees on the Closing Date, but shall be
deemed to include the

   

51 
--- 

  

--- 

    

U.S Business Employees on the first day following the expiration of the
Employee Leasing Agreement.

  



  

(t) _No Third Party Beneficiaries._ No provision of this _Section 5.10_
shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any current or former
employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of any member of the
Seller Group (including the Transferred Entity). Nothing herein shall ( _i_ )
guarantee employment for any period of time or preclude the ability of the
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entity) to terminate
the employment of any Transferred Employee at any time and for any reason, (
_ii_ ) require the Purchaser or its Subsidiaries to continue any
employee benefit plans or arrangements or prevent the amendment, modification
or termination thereof after the Closing Date or ( _iii_ ) amend any Business
Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plans or arrangements.

  



  

Section 5.11. _French Put Option_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this Agreement
shall not constitute a binding agreement to sell or purchase the French
Business until the French Put Option is exercised.

  



  

(b) In the event that the French Put Option is exercised at or prior to
Closing, this _Section 5.11_ shall terminate and shall cease to have effect
with respect to the French Business.

  



  

(c) In the event that the French Put Option is not exercised at or prior to
Closing:

  



  

(i) The Disapplied Provisions shall not apply to the French Business at the
Closing;

  



  

(ii) in respect of the Disapplied Provisions, ( _A_ ) the term "Business"
shall be deemed to exclude the French Business, (B) the term "Transferred
Assets" shall be deemed to exclude the French Transferred Assets (including
for purposes of calculating Closing Working Capital), the Transferred Equity
Interests and the other assets referred to in _Section 1.2(a)(xiv)_ , ( _C_ )
the term "Assumed Liabilities" shall be deemed to exclude the French Assumed
Liabilities (including for purposes of calculating Closing Working Capital)
and ( _D_ ) the term "Transferred Employees" shall be deemed to exclude the
applicable French Put Option Employees, in each case, as of the Closing;

  



  

(iii) ( _A_ ) the amount of Closing Cash shall be deemed to be zero and ( _B_
) the amount of Transferring Indebtedness of the Transferred Entity and any
other Transferring Indebtedness of the French Business shall be deemed to be
zero;

  



  

(iv) the Closing Purchase Price to be paid at Closing shall be reduced in the
amount set forth in Section 5.11(c)(iv) of the Disclosure Schedules (the "
_Put Option Price_ ");

  



  

(v) upon exercise by the Seller of the French Put Option prior to the Expiry
Date, the Purchaser shall purchase the French Business at a price (the "
_Estimated French Business Price_ ") equal to the Put Option Price _plus_ (
_A_ ) Estimated Closing Cash, _plus_ ( _B_ ) the Seller's good faith estimate
of the Current Assets of the French Business, _minus_  ( _C_ ) the Seller's
good faith estimate of the Current Liabilities of the French Business, _minus_
( _D_ ) French Target Working Capital, _minus_ ( _E_ ) the Seller's good
faith estimate of the Transferring Indebtedness of the French

Business, in the case of each of the preceding clauses (A), (B), (C), (D) and
(E) determined as of the time of exercise of the French Put Option; and

  



  

(vi) _Section 1.7_ and _Section 1.8_ shall apply, _mutatis mutandis_ , to
the Estimated French Business Price calculated pursuant to _Section
5.11(c)(v)_.

  



  

(d) _French Put Option Terms_.

  



  

(i) The French Put Option will enter into force at the date hereof. The
Seller hereby accepts the benefit of the French Put Option and may, at its
own discretion and option, elect to exercise the French Put Option in
accordance with the procedures set forth herein, without having the Seller
being committed to sell to the Purchaser the French Business. The Seller shall
only be entitled to exercise the French Put Option for all (and not a
portion) of the French Business. The French Put Option may be exercised by the
Seller at any time during the fifteen (15) Business Day period after the date
upon which all of the information and consultation processes of the French
Works Council have been completed in accordance with the applicable Laws and
the notification and information processes to the French Put Option Employees
(the " _Notification and Information Processes_ ") required under
applicable Laws in France in connection with the sale of the French Business
have been completed, until the Expiry Date, by sending to the Purchaser a
notice, in the form set forth in Section 5.11(d)(i) of the Disclosure
Schedules (the " _Exercise Notice_ ").

  



  

(ii) Subject to delivery of the Exercise Notice by the Seller, the Purchaser
hereby promises and undertakes to purchase and assume from the Seller Group
all (and not a portion) of the Transferred Equity Interests, French
Transferred Assets and French Assumed Liabilities in accordance with and
subject to the terms and conditions specified in this Agreement (the " _French
Put Option_ "), it being understood that, for the sake of clarity, if the
French Put Option is exercised prior to Closing, the Transferred
Equity Interests, French Transferred Assets and French Assumed Liabilities
shall be included in the Transferred Assets and Assumed Liabilities and the
purchase price for the Transferred Equity Interests, French Transferred Assets
and French Assumed Liabilities shall be included in the computation of the
Purchase Price.

  



  

(iii) As soon as practicable, the Seller will cause the relevant member of
the Seller Group ( _i_ ) to initiate the information and

(iv) The parties shall keep each other regularly informed of the status of
each these processes and provide to the other party a copy of the opinion of

(v) The French Put Option shall automatically terminate on the earlier of (

contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents or, in the
absence of any such opinion, the date upon which the French Works Council is
deemed to have issued a negative opinion under applicable Law and ( _B_ )
conclusion of the Notification and Information Processes (the " _Expiry Date_
"), unless the French Put Option is exercised on or prior to such date.

  



  

(vi) The Seller shall not, directly or indirectly, and shall not permit any
of its Affiliates to, sell or commit to sell the French Transferred Assets or
the Transferred Equity Interests so long as the French Put Option remains

Section 5.12. _Intercompany Accounts; Affiliate Agreements_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall cause any amounts owed to or by
any member of the Seller Group or Affiliate thereof, on the one hand, from or
to any member of the Seller Group or Affiliate thereof, on the other hand,
which amounts are owed in connection with the Business, to be cancelled or
settled.

  



  

(b) The Seller shall cause all Affiliate Agreements or Contracts entered into
after the date hereof that would be Affiliate Agreements if entered into as
of the date hereof, other than the Transition Services Agreement, the Lease
Servicing Agreement, the Infinity Meter Agreement, the Presort Commercial

and the Maintenance Services Agreement, to be settled or terminated prior to
the Closing without any further or continuing Liability on the part of the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, other than as specified on Section 5.12(b)
of the Disclosure Schedules.

  



  

Section 5.13. _Seller Marks_. Except as expressly set forth herein, the
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not register or own, or attempt to
register or own, and shall not directly or indirectly use, in any fashion,
including in signage, corporate letterhead, business cards,
internet websites, marketing material and the like, or seek to register or
own, in connection with any products or services anywhere in the world in any
medium, any trademarks, service marks, domain names, trade names, trade dress,
trade styles or other indicia of origin (collectively, " _Marks_ ") that
include, are identical to or are confusingly similar to, any Marks
that constitute Excluded Assets, including any corporate symbols or logos
incorporating the Marks set forth on Section 5.13 of the Disclosure Schedules
(collectively, the " _Seller Marks_ "), nor shall any of them challenge or
oppose or assist any third party in challenging or opposing the rights of any
member of the Seller Group anywhere in the world in any of the Seller
Marks. Subject to the restrictions set forth herein, the Seller hereby
extends, on behalf of itself and the other members of the Seller Group, to
the Purchaser effective as of the Closing Date, a personal, limited,
nonexclusive, royalty-free transition license to continue to use the Seller
Marks: ( _i_ ) for 180 days after the Closing Date on existing signage and
other materials, in each case included in the Transferred Assets as of the
Closing Date and ( _ii_ ) with respect to the Transferred Inventory,
until such Transferred Inventory has been sold. It is understood and agreed
that the Purchaser will not be required to change labels on equipment in the
possession of any customer of the Business. The transition license granted
under this _Section 5.13_ does not allow Purchaser to: ( _i_ ) create signage
and other materials (including inventory) bearing the Seller Marks after
the Closing Date or ( _ii_ ) use the Seller Marks in signage, marketing and
advertising materials at any trade show or in other promotional events after
the Closing Date. Except as permitted under this _Section 5.13_ , no use of
the Seller Marks shall be made by the Purchaser or its Affiliates and the
Purchaser shall in

   

54 
--- 

  

--- 

    

any event transition away from all use of the Seller Marks as soon as is
reasonably practicable after the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall ensure
that the quality of all goods and services offered or sold under any of the
Seller Marks shall be at least as high as the quality maintained by the
members of the Seller Group and their respective Affiliates for such goods and
services as of the Closing and, at the Seller's request, shall provide the
Seller with samples of its use of the Seller Marks to permit the Seller to
confirm the Purchaser's compliance with the quality control requirements of
this sentence. All use of the Seller Marks as permitted hereunder shall
inure solely to the benefit of the Seller Group. The Purchaser shall incur
all costs associated with re-branding of the Transferred Assets with signage,
symbols and marks not constituting the Seller Marks, which re-branding shall
be completed during the term of the 180-day transition license granted under
this _Section 5.13_.

  



  

Section 5.14. _Financing_.

  



  

(a) The Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letters
(including any flex provisions), including by using reasonable best efforts to
( _i_ ) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letters on the terms and
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters (or on terms not
materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to the Purchaser, taken as a
whole (including with respect to the conditionality thereof), than the terms
and conditions in the Debt Commitment Letters), ( _ii_ ) negotiate and enter
into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (the " _Debt
Financing Agreements_ ") on terms and conditions (including any flex
provisions) not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to the Purchaser
(including with respect to the conditionality thereof), than those contained
in the Debt Commitment Letters, ( _iii_ ) ensure the accuracy of all
representations and warranties of the Purchaser set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters or Debt Financing Agreements to the extent necessary to
cause the funding of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date, ( _iv_ ) comply
with all covenants and agreements of the Purchaser set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters or Debt Financing Agreements, to the extent necessary to
cause the funding of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date, ( _v_ )
satisfy on a timely basis all conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letters or Debt Financing Agreements that are within its control, to the
extent necessary to cause the funding of the Debt Financing on the Closing
Date, and ( _vi_ ) upon satisfaction of such conditions and the other
conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to their satisfaction or waiver), consummate the Financing at or
prior to the Closing (and in any event prior to the Termination Date);
_provided_ that nothing herein shall be construed to require the Purchaser to
seek specific performance or otherwise commence litigation against any Debt
Financing Source. The Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the parties to the Commitment Letters to fund on the Closing Date the
Financing required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including borrowing notwithstanding the fact that any
"flex" provisions in the Debt Commitment Letters are exercised.

  



  

(b) The Purchaser shall promptly inform the Seller in reasonable detail
regarding all material activity and timing considerations concerning the
Financing, including any material adverse change with respect to the Financing
that would reasonably be expected to cause the amount of the Financing
necessary to pay the purchase price payable hereunder not to be available on
the Closing Date. Without limiting the foregoing, the Purchaser agrees to
notify the Seller promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days, if
at any time prior to the

   

55 
--- 

  

--- 

    

Closing Date ( _i_ ) a Commitment Letter expires or is terminated for any
reason, ( _ii_ ) a counterparty indicates in writing that it will not
provide, or it refuses to provide, all or any portion of the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letters on the terms set forth therein or (
_iii_ ) for any reason, the Purchaser no longer believes in good faith that it
will be able to obtain on a timely basis all or any portion of the Financing
on substantially the terms described in the Commitment Letters. The Purchaser
shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Affiliates to, without the prior
written consent of the Seller, take any action or enter into any
transaction that could reasonably be expected to impair, delay or prevent
consummation of all or any portion of the Financing to be funded on the
Closing Date. Without the prior written consent of the Seller, the Purchaser
shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver
of any provision under, the Commitment Letters if such amendment,
modification, joinder, termination or waiver ( _A_ ) reduces the aggregate
amount of the Financing to be funded on the Closing Date, ( _B_ ) imposes
additional conditions precedent to the availability of the Financing to be
funded on the Closing Date or amends or modifies any of the
existing conditions to the funding of the Financing in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the funding of the
Financing on the Closing Date or ( _C_ ) materially adversely impacts the
ability of the Purchaser to enforce its rights against the other parties to
the Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements with respect thereto. The
Purchaser shall promptly deliver to the Seller copies of any material
amendment, modification, waiver, termination or replacement of any of the
Commitment Letters.

  



  

Section 5.15. _Financing Cooperation_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to provide such cooperation to the Purchaser as may reasonably be
requested by the Purchaser in connection with obtaining the Debt Financing
necessary to complete the transactions contemplated hereby, including using,
and causing its Affiliates and representatives to use, commercially reasonable
efforts to ( _i_ ) furnish to the Purchaser and the Debt Financing Sources
information, financial statements and financial data relating to the Business
of the form and type customarily used in offering memoranda for financing
engagements of the type contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including
the Marketing Information), ( _ii_ ) participate in a reasonable number (and
in any event not less than 2) of requested meetings, presentations, road
shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating
agencies in connection with the Debt Financing, ( _iii_ ) assist with the
preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents,
bank information memoranda and similar documents reasonably required in
connection with the Debt Financing, ( _iv_ ) request the independent
accountants of the Seller to provide reasonable assistance to the Purchaser in
connection with the Debt Financing consistent with their customary practice,
( _v_ ) facilitate the execution and delivery at the Closing of the
Debt Financing Agreements, ( _vi_ ) provide all documentation and other
information that is required by United States regulatory authorities under
applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including, without limitation, the Patriot Act, in each case, at
least four (4) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, to the
extent reasonably requested in writing at least nine (9) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, (vii) provide in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Purchaser and the Debt Financing Sources payoff letters
and/or lien releases and terminations with respect to any Indebtedness to be
repaid in connection with, or otherwise not permitted hereunder to remain
outstanding upon, the Closing (collectively, the " _Payoff Letters and Lien
Terminations_ "), (viii)

   

56

--- 

    

ensure that there shall be no competing offering, placement or arrangement of
any debt securities or syndicated credit facilities with respect to the
Business, (ix) ensure that the syndication of the Debt Financing benefits
from the existing lending relationships of the Business and (x) cooperate
reasonably with the Debt Financing Sources' due diligence, to the extent
customary and reasonable. Without limiting the foregoing, the Seller shall
promptly deliver the Updated Financial Statements to the Purchaser; provided,
however, that if and to the extent that the 2017 Audited Financial Statements
and the Updated Financial Statements for the fiscal quarter ending March 31,
2018 are delivered after May 11, 2018, the Trigger Date shall be extended one
day for each day after May 11, 2018 until the day that the 2017 Audited
Financial Statements and the Updated Financial Statements for the fiscal
quarter ending March 31, 2018 are delivered to the Purchaser, provided, that
if any such extended date is not a Business Day, then the Trigger Date
shall be extended to the next Business Day after such date.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, ( _i_ ) nothing contained in this _Section
5.15_ shall require cooperation with the Purchaser to the extent it would
interfere unreasonably with the Business or operations of the Seller, encumber
any of the assets of any member of the Seller Group or require any member of
the Seller Group to pay any commitment or other fee or make any other payment
in connection with the Debt Financing (unless simultaneously reimbursed by
the Purchaser pursuant to the terms of this Agreement), result in a breach of
any contract in effect as of the date hereof, or impose any liability on any
member of the Seller Group or any of their respective Affiliates and ( _ii_ )
no member of the Seller Group or any Affiliate of any member of the Seller
Group or any of their respective directors, officers or employees shall ( _A_
) be required to take any action in the capacity as a member of the board of
directors or managers or as an officer of the Seller, ( _B_ ) have any
liability or any obligation under any Debt Financing Agreement or any other
agreement or document related to the Debt Financing or ( _C_ ) be required to
incur any other liability in connection with the Debt Financing.

  



  

(c) The Purchaser shall promptly, upon request by the Seller, reimburse the
Seller for any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees, reasonable independent accountants'
fees and $35,000 in independent accountants' fees incurred in preparing the
Updated Financial Statements) incurred by any member of the Seller Group in
connection with the cooperation contemplated by this _Section 5.15_ and shall
indemnify and hold harmless the members of the Seller Group and their
representatives for and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing, any action
taken by them at the request of the Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 5.15_
and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than information
provided by any member of the Seller Group or any Affiliate of any member of
the Seller Group).

  



  

Section 5.16. _Insurance_. The Purchaser acknowledges that coverage for the
Business under the insurance policies of the Seller Group (the "
_Seller Insurance_ ") will cease as of the Closing Date, and that the Seller
will not purchase any "tail" policy or other additional or substitute
coverage for the benefit of the Purchaser relating to the Seller Insurance or
the Business applicable in any period after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding
the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, if and to the
extent that the Seller Insurance provided coverage for any events that
occurred prior to the Closing or for any claims made prior to the Closing,
claims may be brought or continued to be pursued under any such Seller
Insurance after

   

57 
--- 

  

--- 

    

the Closing at the Purchaser's sole cost and expense (including any
applicable retentions or deductibles in connection with such claims).

  



  

Section 5.17. _Resignations_. At the Purchaser's request, the Seller shall
cause the Manager of the Transferred Entity, as of immediately prior to
the Closing, to deliver to the Purchaser his or her resignation as the
Manager of the Transferred Entity, effective at the time of the Closing.

  



  

Section 5.18. _R andW Insurance Policy_. To the extent the Purchaser obtains a
representation and warranty insurance policy in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby (a " _R andW Insurance Policy_"), any such
RandW Insurance Policy shall include a provision whereby the insurer expressly
waives, and agrees not to pursue, directly or indirectly, any subrogation
rights against any member of the Seller Group, or any former or current
stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives of any member of the Seller Group with respect to any claim
made by any insured thereunder (except for knowing and intentional fraud in
connection with the transaction). The Purchaser shall not waive, amend or
modify such subrogation provision, or allow such provision to be waived,
amended or modified, without the prior written consent of the Seller.

  



  

Section 5.19. _Non-Competition_.

  



  

(a) The Seller agrees that for the period from the Closing Date until the
fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, it shall not and shall cause each
other member of the Seller Group not to, directly or indirectly, engage in a
business anywhere in which the Business operates as of immediately prior to
the Closing, the primary activity of which business competes with the
Business, as conducted as of the date hereof or as of the Closing Date (each,
a " _Competitive Activity_ "); _provided_ that the foregoing shall not
prohibit any member of the Seller Group from collectively owning up to an
aggregate of 5% of the outstanding shares of any class of capital stock of
any Person that engages in any Competitive Activity (a " _Competing Person_ ")
so long as no member of the Seller Group has any participation in the
management of such Competing Person.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, nothing in
this _Section 5.19_ shall prohibit any member of the Seller Group from:

  



  

(i) investing in any Person that invests in, manages or operates a
Competitive Activity, so long as such investment is less than 25% of the
outstanding ownership interest in such Person and such member of the Seller
Group does not control such Person or Competitive Activity;

  



  

(ii) acquiring the whole or any part of a Person or business that engages in
any Competitive Activity; _provided_ that where such Competitive Activities
of such Person or business represent greater than 25% of the annual revenues
as set out in the latest available annual financial statements of that Person
or business, such member of the Seller Group shall divest such Person,
business or portion thereof to the extent engaging in such Competitive
Activity within twelve (12) months after the consummation of such
acquisition (irrespective of whether the end of such 12-month period occurs
after the expiration of the non-compete period)

   

58 
--- 

  

--- 

    

at such price and on such terms as the Seller deems commercially reasonable
(but in no event shall such member of the Seller Group be required to
divest such Competitive Activity at a loss or be required to discontinue
operation of such Competitive Activity in order to comply with this _Section
5.19_ );

  



  

(iii) owning any securities through any employee benefit plan;

  



  

(iv) performing any Competitive Activity for the benefit of the Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates, including the performance of any Competitive Activity
required or contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction Document;

conducted as of the Closing Date by or within any retained businesses of any
member of the Seller Group, including the businesses of the Seller Group that
are set forth on Section 5.19(b)(v) of the Disclosure Schedules, and any
reasonable expansion of such retained businesses (which may include geographic
expansion, product expansion and/or channel expansion).

  



  

Section 5.20. _Non-Solicitation_.

  



  

(a) The Seller agrees that, from and after the Closing until the second
anniversary of the Closing Date, it shall not, and shall cause each other
member of the Seller Group and any other Affiliates not to, (i) solicit for
employment any Transferred Employee or (ii) hire any of the senior managers
listed on Section 5.20 of the Disclosure Schedules; provided, however, that
the foregoing shall not (x) apply to solicitations (A) made by job
opportunity advertisements and headhunter searches not specifically targeting
employees of the Business, (B) targeting any employee whose employment by the
Business was terminated by the Purchaser or an Affiliate of the Purchaser (or
who resigned with the consent of the Purchaser) at any time or (C) targeting
any other employee whose employment by the Business terminated as a result of
the employee's voluntary resignation more than three (3) months prior to such
solicitation or (y) prohibit any member of the Seller Group from hiring any
of the senior managers listed on Section 5.20 of the Disclosure Schedules if
such person has not been employed in the Business for a period of six (6)
months prior to such hire or if such person's employment was terminated by
the Purchaser or an Affiliate of the Purchaser (or if such person resigned
with the consent of the Purchaser).

  



  

(b) The Purchaser agrees that from and after the date of this Agreement until
the second anniversary of the Closing Date, it shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, solicit for employment any Person who is an employee of any
member of the Seller Group (other than Transferred Employees); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to solicitations ( _i_ )
made by job opportunity advertisements and headhunter searches not
specifically targeting any employees of any member of the Seller Group or (
_ii_ ) targeting any employee whose employment by the applicable member of the
Seller Group terminated more than three (3) months prior to such
solicitation.

Section 5.23. _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, the Purchaser
shall pay 100% of any transfer, documentary, sales, use, value added, stamp,
registration and other similar Taxes or notarial fees incurred in connection
with the transactions contemplated under this Agreement (all such items so
incurred are referred to herein collectively as " _Transfer Taxes_ "). All
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
Transfer Taxes shall be filed by the Purchaser; _provided_ that the Seller
will reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser in the preparation, execution and
filing of any such Tax Returns and other documentation as necessary.

  



  

(b) The Purchaser shall prepare and file all Tax Returns related to the
Business or Transferred Assets required to be filed after the Closing Dates,
except (i) Income Tax Returns of or with respect to any member of the Seller
Group and (ii) for the avoidance of doubt, Tax Returns related to the French
Business required to be filed prior to the exercise by the Seller of the
French Put Option prior to the Expiry Date, each of which will be filed by
the Seller in its sole discretion. If any Tax Return prepared by the
Purchaser could reasonably be expected to give rise to an adverse impact on
the Final Adjustment Amount or result in a payment by any member of the
Seller Group, the Purchaser shall furnish the Seller with a copy of such Tax
Return at least 30 days prior to the due date thereof for the Seller's
comment, and shall incorporate any reasonable comments of the Seller prior to
filing such Tax Return.

  



  

(c) The Purchaser and the Seller shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to) ( _i_ ) provide the other party and its Affiliates with such
assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation
of any Tax Return or claim for refund, the determination of a tax liability
for Taxes or a right to refund of Taxes or the conduct of any audit or other
examination by any taxing authority or any judicial or administrative
proceeding relating to Taxes and ( _ii_ ) retain (and provide the other
party and its Affiliates with reasonable access to) all records or
information which may be relevant to such Tax Return, claim for refund, Tax
determination, audit, examination or proceeding. Such cooperation and
information shall include providing copies of all relevant Tax Returns,
together with accompanying schedules and related workpapers, documents
relating to rulings or other determinations made by taxing authorities and
records concerning the ownership and tax basis of property, which either party
may possess. Each party shall make its employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide explanation of any documents or
information provided hereunder. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, the party requesting assistance hereunder shall reimburse
the other for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in providing any
Tax Return, document or other written information, and shall compensate the
other for any reasonable costs (excluding wages and salaries and related
costs) of making employees available, upon receipt of reasonable
documentation of such costs. Any information obtained under this _Section
5.23_ shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in
conducting any audit, examination or other proceeding. The Purchaser and the
Seller agree that the sharing of information and cooperation contemplated by
this _Section 5.23_ shall be done in a manner so as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the parties.

prior to the Closing Date to treat the Transferred Entity as disregarded from
its sole owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

  



  

(e) _VAT_. The Seller and the Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
treated as neither a supply of goods nor a supply of services for applicable
VAT purposes. If a Tax authority at any time determines in writing that VAT
is payable on the sale of all or some of the Transferred Assets pursuant to
this Agreement, the Seller shall promptly deliver to the Purchaser a copy of
such written determination and a proper VAT invoice in respect of the VAT
payable and the Purchaser shall within five (5) days of the receipt of such
determination and VAT invoice pay to the Seller a sum equal to the amount of
VAT determined by the Tax authority to be chargeable. The Seller shall submit
any pertinent correspondence with the relevant Tax authorities in respect of
such VAT to the Purchaser for the Purchaser's comment and shall incorporate
any reasonable comments of the Purchaser prior to transmitting such
correspondence to such Tax authorities. If the Purchaser pays to a member of
the Selling Group an amount in respect of VAT under this _Section 5.23(e)_ and
the relevant Tax authorities finally determine that some portion of such VAT
was not properly chargeable, such member of the Selling Group shall promptly
issue a credit note to the Purchaser and re-pay such portion to the
Purchaser.

  



  

(f) _French Tax Considerations_. Pursuant to Article 223 N 2 of the French
_code g eneral des impot_, the French Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to

Year in which the Closing Date for the Transferred Entity occurs.
The Purchaser shall reimburse or cause the Transferred Entity to reimburse
the French Parent for such installment payments that are due after such
Closing Date, such reimbursement to be made at least five Business Days before
the due date of the installment to which it relates.

  



  

Section 5.24. _Seller Guarantees_. Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall
use reasonable best efforts to ( _i_ ) arrange for substitute bonds and
guarantees to replace ( _A_ ) the Seller Guarantees set forth on Section 5.24
of the Disclosure Schedules and ( _B_ ) any Seller Guarantees entered into in
the ordinary course of business after the date hereof and prior to the Closing
or ( _ii_ ) assume all obligations under each Seller Guarantee, obtaining
from the creditor, beneficiary or other counterparty a full release (in a
form satisfactory to the Seller) of all parties liable, directly or
indirectly, for reimbursement to the creditor or fulfillment of other
obligations to a beneficiary or counterparty in connection with amounts drawn
under the Seller Guarantees. To the extent the beneficiary or counterparty
under any Seller Guarantee does not accept any such substitute bond, Purchaser
guarantee or other obligation proffered by the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall
( _x_ ) indemnify, defend and hold harmless each member of the Seller Group
against, and reimburse each member of the Seller Group for, all amounts paid
(including costs and expenses) in connection with such Seller Guarantees,
including the Seller's and its Affiliates' expenses in maintaining such Seller
Guarantees, whether or not any such Seller Guarantee is drawn upon or
required to be performed, and shall in any event promptly reimburse
the relevant member of the Seller Group to the extent any Seller Guarantee is
called upon and the Seller or its Affiliates makes any payment or is
obligated to reimburse the party issuing the Seller Guarantee and ( _y_ ) not
without the Seller's prior written consent, amend in any manner adverse to
the Seller or any

   

61

of its Affiliates, or extend (or permit the extension of), any Seller
Guarantee or any obligation supported by any Seller Guarantee.

  



  

Section 5.25. _Transfer Act Compliance_. Buyer and Seller shall comply with
the covenants and agreements set forth in Section 5.25 of the
Disclosure Schedules, which is hereby incorporated into this Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.26. _Modifications to Shared Space Schedule_. The parties shall
cooperate in good faith from and after the date hereof to agree prior to the
Closing Date on any modifications to Section 3.16(d) of the Disclosure
Schedules that the parties determine in good faith to be
reasonably necessary, including modifications to (i) add or remove Shared
Spaces or (ii) modify the headcount with respect to certain Shared Spaces
(with a corresponding increase or decrease to the $500/month fee per
headcount), it being understood that no such modification to Section 3.16(d)
of the Disclosure Schedules shall (A) cause any individual who would otherwise
not be a Business Employee to become a Business Employee or (B) cause any
individual who would otherwise be a Business Employee not to be a Business
Employee.

any respect to a Debt Financing Source shall require the prior written
consent of such Debt Financing Source.

  



  

Section 8.6. _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective legal
representatives and successors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement
shall not be assigned by any party hereto by operation of Law or otherwise
without the express written consent of each of the other parties; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no consent of the Seller will be required for any assignment
by the Purchaser of ( _i_ ) any of its rights or obligations hereunder to any
Affiliate, provided that no such assignment shall relieve the Purchaser or its
obligations to the Seller hereunder, ( _ii_ ) any rights hereunder pursuant
to a collateral assignment of its rights hereunder to any Debt Financing
Source or ( _iii_ ) of all of Purchaser's rights and obligations hereunder to
any purchaser of all or substantially all of the Business.

  



  

Section 8.7. _Disclosure Schedules_. The Disclosure Schedules shall be
construed with and as an integral part of this Agreement to the same extent
as if the same had been set forth verbatim herein. Any matter disclosed
pursuant to the Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed to be an admission
or representation as to the materiality of the item so disclosed. With respect
to the Disclosure Schedules, any disclosure made on any section or subsection
thereof with respect to any representation or warranty shall be deemed to be
made with respect to any representation or warranty to which it is reasonably
apparent that it relates.

  



  

Section 8.8. _Specific Performance_.

  



  

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were

   

82

--- 

    

otherwise breached and money damages would be both incalculable and an
insufficient remedy for any such failure to perform or breach of this
Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that, subject to _Section 8.8(b)_ , the
parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties hereby waive, in any
action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law
and the posting of any bond or other security in connection therewith. Nothing
contained herein shall prevent a party from seeking damages in the event that
specific performance is not available.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including
this _Section 8.8_ , it is agreed that the Seller shall only be entitled to
specific performance of the Purchaser's obligation to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded if ( _i_ ) all of the conditions set forth in _Section
6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but
which conditions are, at the time that the Seller seeks specific
performance pursuant to this _Section 8.8(b)_ , capable of being satisfied if
Closing were to occur at such time, other than any conditions that have not
been satisfied as a result of the Purchaser's breach of this Agreement), (
_ii_ ) the Purchaser fails to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is
required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.1_ (ignoring, for
purposes of determining whether the Closing is required to have occurred
pursuant to _Section 2.1_ , any conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and
_Section 6.2_ that have not been satisfied as a result of the Purchaser's
breach of this Agreement) and ( _iii_ ) the Seller has confirmed that, if
specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing is funded, then the
Seller shall take such actions as are within its control to cause the Closing
to occur.

Section 8.9. _Governing Law, etc_. This Agreement shall be governed in all
respects, including as to validity, interpretation and effect, by the
internal laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the conflict
of laws rules thereof to the extent that the application of the law of
another jurisdiction would be required thereby. Each party hereby irrevocably
agrees that any action, suit or other proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby shall be brought in
the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within
the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, then any state or federal court
within the State of Delaware), and each party hereby submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit, action or other proceeding. A
final judgment in any such suit, action or other proceeding may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any
objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or other
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated hereby in such courts, and hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court
that any such action, suit or other proceeding brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party further agrees that service
of any process, summons, notice or document to such party pursuant to
_Section 8.1_ , or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law, shall be
valid and sufficient service thereof. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY
IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE
ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION, PERFORMANCE AND
ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

  



  

Section 8.10. _Construction_. The headings of Articles and Sections in this
Agreement are provided for convenience only and will not affect its
construction or interpretation. The language used in this Agreement is the
language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of
strict construction shall be applied against any party.

  



  

Section 8.11. _Local Transfer Agreements_.

  



  

(a) The parties do not intend this Agreement to transfer title to the
Transferred Equity Interests or to any Transferred Assets, or to
constitute the assumption of any Assumed Liabilities, in any jurisdiction in
which such transfer or assumption is required by applicable Law to be made
pursuant to a Local Transfer Agreement, in which case the Transferred Equity
Interests or any such Transferred Assets or Assumed Liabilities, as
applicable, shall only be transferred or assumed by the applicable Local
Transfer Agreement (which transfers and assumptions shall, except as
otherwise expressly set forth herein, be on an "as-is", "where-is"
basis, without representation or warranty of any kind or nature). The parties
shall not enter into any Local Transfer Agreement with respect to a
jurisdiction in which the Seller has an obligation to inform and consult with
Business Employees regarding the transactions contemplated hereby, until such
information and consultation process has concluded, and such Local Transfer
Agreement shall reflect any changes as may be reasonably agreed by the
parties to take into account the results of such information and consultation
process.

   

84 
--- 

  

--- 

    

(b) Notwithstanding the generality of _Section 8.11(a)_ , to the extent that
the provisions of a Local Transfer Agreement (including any
provisions required by local Law to be included in the Local Transfer
Agreement) are inconsistent with, or (except to the extent they implement a
transfer in accordance with this Agreement) additional to, the provisions of
this Agreement (or do not fully give effect to the provisions of this
Agreement with respect to the transfer of the Transferred Equity Interests and
Transferred Assets or the assumption of Assumed Liabilities): ( _i_ ) the
provisions of this Agreement shall prevail; and ( _ii_ ) so far as permissible
under applicable Law of the relevant jurisdiction, the Seller Group and the
Purchaser shall cause the provisions of the relevant Local Transfer Agreement
to be adjusted, to the extent necessary to give effect to the provisions of
this Agreement.

  



  

(c) Each party hereto shall not, and shall cause its respective Affiliates
not to, bring any claim (including for breach of any warranty,
representation, undertaking, covenant or indemnity relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby) against the other party or any of its
Affiliates in respect of or based upon any of the Local Transfer Agreements,
except to the extent necessary to enforce any transfer of the Transferred
Equity Interests and Transferred Assets or the assumption of Assumed
Liabilities sold or assigned to the Purchaser hereunder in a manner
consistent with the terms of this Agreement. All such claims (except as
referred to above) shall be brought in accordance with, and be subject to the
provisions, rights and limitations set out in, this Agreement, and no party
shall be entitled to recover damages or obtain payment, reimbursement,
restitution or indemnity under or pursuant to any of the Local
Transfer Agreements (but without prejudice to the establishment of the
existence of the claim hereunder). To the extent that a party does bring such
a claim (except as referred to above), that party shall indemnify the other
party (and/or that other party's relevant Affiliates) against all Losses
which it or they may suffer through or arising from the bringing of such claim
against it or them.

  



  

Section 8.12. _Provision Respecting Legal Representation_. Each party to this
Agreement agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates
and representatives, that Debevoise and Plimpton LLP may serve as counsel to
the Seller, on the one hand, and the Business and the Transferred Entity, on
the other hand, in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and that,
following consummation of such transactions, Debevoise and Plimpton LLP (or any
successor) may serve as counsel to the Seller or any Affiliate or
representative of the Seller, in connection with any litigation, claim or
obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the other
Transaction Documents or such transactions notwithstanding such prior
representation of the Business or the Transferred Entity and each party to
this Agreement consents thereto and waives any conflict of interest arising
therefrom, and each party to this Agreement shall cause its Affiliates and
representatives to consent to waive any conflict of interest arising from
such representation.

  



  

Section 8.13. _Privilege_. The Purchaser, for itself and its Affiliates, and
its and its Affiliates' respective successors and assigns, hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally acknowledges and agrees that all attorney-
client privileged communications between the Seller, the Transferred Entity
or their respective current or former Affiliates or representatives and their
counsel, including Debevoise and Plimpton LLP, made before the consummation of
the Closing in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution,
delivery and Closing under this Agreement or any Transaction Document, any
dispute arising from this Agreement, the other

   

85 
--- 

  

--- 

    

Transaction Documents or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or, before the Closing, any other matter, shall continue after the
Closing to be privileged communications with such counsel and neither the
Purchaser nor any of its former or current Affiliates or representatives nor
any Person purporting to act on behalf of or through the Purchaser or any of
its current of former Affiliates or representatives, shall seek to obtain the
same by any process on the grounds that the privilege attaching to such
communications belongs to the Purchaser, the Transferred Entity or the
Business or on any other grounds.

  



  

Section 8.14. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously
in one or more counterparts (including by facsimile or electronic .pdf
submission), and by the different parties in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall
constitute one and the same agreement.

  



  

Section 8.15. _No Survival_. None of the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement, or in any certificate delivered by any party at
Closing, will survive the Closing, and none of the parties shall have any
liability to each other after the Closing for any breach thereof. The
covenants and agreements which contemplate performance prior to the Closing
will survive until the first anniversary of the Closing Date, and the
covenants and agreements which contemplate performance after the Closing will
survive in accordance with their respective terms.

  



  

Section 8.16. _Debt Financing Sources_.

  



  

(a) Seller hereby (i) acknowledges that none of the Debt Financing Sources
shall have any liability under this Agreement for any claim based on, in
respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby, including,
but not limited to, any dispute related to, or arising from, the Debt
Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing or any related agreements or the
performance thereof, (ii) waives any rights or claims against any of the Debt
Financing Sources under this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt

to assist) any action, arbitration, audit, hearing, investigation,
litigation, petition, grievance, complaint, suit or proceeding against any
Debt Financing Source arising out of this Agreement in connection with this
Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing or any
related agreements or the performance thereof or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each party
hereto agrees (i) that it will not bring or support any legal action, suit or
proceeding of any kind or description (whether at law, in equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise) against any Debt Financing Source in any way relating

performance thereof, in any forum other than any federal or state court
located in the State of New York in New York County in the Borough of
Manhattan, (ii) that any such legal action, suit or proceeding shall
