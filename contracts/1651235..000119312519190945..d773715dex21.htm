(i) _Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Dissenting Shares and shares cancelled pursuant to Section 1.8(c))
shall be automatically converted into the right to receive, subject to and in
accordance with Section 1.9, an amount of cash equal to the Per Share Cash
Amount, without interest. As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company

(ii) _Vested Company Options, Vested Company RSUs and Vested Company
PSUs_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent will not
assume any Vested Company Option, Vested Company RSU or Vested Company PSU. At
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need for any
further action on the part of the holder thereof, each Vested Company Option
that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each Vested Company RSU that is unexpired, outstanding and has
not yet been settled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each
Vested Company PSU that is unexpired, outstanding and has not yet been settled
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each subject to and in
accordance with Section 1.9, shall terminate and be converted into
and represent the right to receive the applicable Cash-Out Amount from Parent
for such Vested Company Option, Vested Company RSU or Vested Company PSU;
_provided_ that the Surviving 

 



11

    

 Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from such
Cash-Out Amount the amount of withholding for Taxes required to be deducted
and withheld as a result of the Transactions. The Cash-Out Amount payable
pursuant to this Section 1.8(a)(ii) shall be rounded to the nearest cent and
computed after aggregating Cash-Out Amounts for all Vested Company Options,
Vested Company RSUs or Vested Company PSUs represented by a particular grant
held by such Person.

 

(iii) _Unvested Company Options and Unvested Company RSUs_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent will not assume any
Unvested Company Option or any Unvested Company RSU. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without the need for any further action on the part
of the holder thereof, each Unvested Company Option that is unexpired,
unexercised and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
each Unvested Company RSU that is unexpired, outstanding and has not yet been
settled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each subject to and in
accordance with Section 1.8(a)(v) and Section 1.9, shall be converted into and
represent the right to receive the applicable Cash-Out Amount from Parent for
such Unvested Company Option or Unvested Company RSU (the " _Unvested Cash
(Options/RSUs)_ ").

 

(iv) _Unvested Company PSUs_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, Parent will not assume any Unvested Company PSU. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need for any further action on
the part of the holder thereof, each Unvested Company PSU that is unexpired,
outstanding and has not yet been settled immediately prior to the Effective
Time, subject to and in accordance with Section 1.8(a)(v) and Section 1.9,
shall be converted into and represent the right to receive the applicable

Cash (PSUs)_ " and, together with the Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs), the "
_Unvested Cash_ ").

 

(v) _Payment of Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs) and Unvested Cash (PSUs)_.
The cash payment pursuant to (A) Section 1.8(a)(iii) for Unvested Company
Options and Unvested Company RSUs shall be subject to the same restrictions
and vesting arrangements (including all provisions with respect to the
acceleration of vesting following the Effective Time that would apply if such
awards were assumed by Parent pursuant to the Companys Amended and Restated
Severance and Change in Control Benefits Plan (the " _CIC Plan_ ") and/or any
retention agreement set forth on Schedule 1.8(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter after giving effect to the applicable Employment Offer Documents) that
were applicable to such Unvested Company Options or Unvested Company RSUs, and
(B) Section 1.8(a)(iv) in exchange for Unvested Company PSUs shall be subject
to the same restrictions and vesting arrangements after giving effect to the
applicable Employment Offer Documents that were applicable to such Unvested
Company PSUs, in each case as of the Effective Time by virtue of Section
1.8(a)(iii) and Section 1.8(iv) as applicable. Therefore, the Unvested Cash
(Options/RSUs) and Unvested Cash (PSUs) shall not be payable by Parent at the
Effective Time, and shall instead become payable by Parent on the date that
such Unvested Company Options, Unvested Company RSU or Unvested Company PSUs
would have become vested under the vesting schedule in place for such awards
at the Effective Time (subject to the restrictions and other terms of
such vesting schedule and giving effect to the applicable terms with respect
to acceleration of vesting under the CIC Plan and/or any retention agreement
set forth on Schedule 1.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter and applicable
Employment Offer Document); _provided_ that if such conditions and terms are
not satisfied and vesting ceases at any point after the Effective Time (after
giving effect to any applicable terms of acceleration), no such cash payments
shall be made. Parent shall make, or in its discretion shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to make, all such required payments to holders of
Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs) and Unvested Cash (PSUs) no later than the
earlier of (A) the end of the second 

 



12

    

 completed payroll cycle following the date on which the corresponding
Unvested Company Option, Unvested Company RSU and Unvested Company PSUs would
have become vested under the vesting schedule in place for such awards at the
Effective Time and (B) the 15th day of the calendar month following the date
on which the corresponding Unvested Company Option, Unvested Company RSU
and Unvested Company PSUs would have become vested under the vesting schedule
in place for such awards at the Effective Time and in no event later than the
end of the calendar year in which the corresponding Unvested Company Option,
Unvested Company RSU or Unvested Company PSUs, would have become vested
(subject to the restrictions and other terms of such vesting schedule and
giving effect to the applicable terms with respect to acceleration of vesting
under the CIC Plan and/or any retention agreement set forth on Schedule
1.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter and applicable Employment Offer
Documents); _provided_ that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from such Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs) and
Unvested Cash (PSUs) the amount of withholding for Taxes required to be
deducted and withheld as a result of the Transactions. The Unvested Cash
(Options/RSUs) payable pursuant to Section 1.8(a)(iii) and Unvested Cash
(PSUs) payable pursuant to this Section 1.8(a)(v) on a given payment date
shall be rounded to the nearest cent and computed after aggregating Cash-Out
Amounts for all Unvested Company Options, Unvested Company RSUs and Unvested
Company PSUs represented by a particular grant previously held by such Person
that would have vested on the relevant vesting date. All amounts payable
pursuant to Section 1.8(a)(v) and Section 1.8(a)(iv) shall be paid without
interest. No Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs) or Unvested Cash (PSUs), or right
thereto, may be pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned or transferred (including
any transfer by operation of law), by any Person, other than Parent, or be
taken or reached by any legal or equitable process in satisfaction of any
Liability of such Person, prior to the distribution to such Person of such
Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs) and Unvested Cash (PSUs) in accordance with this
Agreement.

 

(b) _Capital Stock of Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of capital
stock of Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without further action on
the part of the sole stockholder of Sub, be converted into and become one
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation (and the shares of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation into which the shares of Sub capital stock
are so converted shall be the only shares of the Surviving Corporations
capital stock that are issued and outstanding immediately after the Effective
Time). The certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Sub common stock will
evidence ownership of the same number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(c) _Cancellation of Company Capital Stock Owned by the Company and
Parent_. At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Capital Stock that are
owned by the Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and each share of Company Capital Stock owned by Parent or any direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company or subsidiary of Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled without any
conversion thereof.

 

(d) _Adjustments_. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into capital stock), reorganization, reclassification,
combination, recapitalization or other like change with respect to the Company
Capital Stock occurring after the Agreement Date and prior to the
Effective Time, all references in this Agreement to specified numbers of
shares of any class or series affected thereby, and all calculations provided
for that are based upon numbers of shares of any class or series (or trading
prices therefor) affected thereby, shall be equitably adjusted to the extent
necessary to provide the parties hereto the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend, reorganization, reclassification, combination,
recapitalization or other like change.

 



13

    

(e) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
if any stockholder of the Company that is entitled to assert appraisal rights
properly demands appraisal rights in accordance with Delaware Law and complies
with all conditions and obligations of Section 262 thereof, and such
perfected appraisal rights are not effectively withdrawn or lost, each
Dissenting Share held by such Dissenting Stockholder shall not be converted at
the Effective Time into the right to receive the applicable portion of the
consideration payable in the Merger, but shall be entitled only to such
rights as are granted by Delaware Law to a holder of Dissenting Shares. The
Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demand for
appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time, withdrawals of
such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and
received by the Company that relate to such demands, and (ii) the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands
under Delaware Law. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment or offer to make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any claim or demand in respect
of any Dissenting Shares. If, after the Effective Time, any Dissenting
Stockholder shall fail to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost
the right to seek appraisal rights, the Dissenting Shares held by such
Dissenting Stockholder shall immediately be converted into the right to
receive the cash payable pursuant to Section 1.8(a) in respect of such shares
as if such shares never had been Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall issue and
deliver to the holder thereof at (or as promptly as reasonably practicable
after) the applicable time or times specified in Section 1.9(c), following the
satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 1.9(c), the
amount of cash to which such holder would be entitled in respect thereof
under Section 1.8(a) as if such shares never had been Dissenting Shares (and
all such cash shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to have
become deliverable to such holder pursuant to Section 1.8(a)).

1.9. _Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Parents transfer agent, Computershare Trust
Company, N.A. shall act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") in the
Merger.

(b) _Parent to Deposit Cash_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent
shall deposit or cause a direct or indirect subsidiary of Parent to deposit
with the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article I the
cash payable pursuant to Section 1.8(a)(i) and Section 1.8(a)(ii) (which, for
the avoidance of doubt, excludes the Unvested Cash) ( _provided_ that the cash
payable pursuant to Section 1.8(a)(ii) may instead be paid directly by either
Parent through its payroll provider or, if so directed by Parent, by the
Surviving Corporation through its payroll provider).

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly (and in any event within three
Business Days) following the Effective Time, Parent shall instruct the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates (" _Certificates_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective

transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall contain such other provisions
as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use of such letter
of transmittal in effecting surrender of Certificates in exchange for
the cash payable pursuant to Section 1.8(a). Each holder of record of book-
entry shares (" _Uncertificated Shares_ ") shall not be required to deliver a

to receive the cash payable pursuant to Section 1.8(a). In lieu thereof, each
holder of record of one or more Uncertificated Shares may provide an "agents
message" in customary form with respect to any Uncertificated Share (or
such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably
request). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, or upon receipt
by the Exchange Agent of an appropriate agents message (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as the 

 



14

    

 Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Uncertificated Shares,
each holder of such Certificate or such Uncertificated Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the cash amount that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.8(a) in respect of the Company
Capital Stock represented by such Certificate or such Uncertificated Shares
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, excludes any Unvested Cash), and the
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate
purposes, to evidence only the right to receive cash pursuant to Section
1.8(a), except as provided in Section 1.8(e).

 

(d) _No Interest_. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash payable
pursuant to Section 1.8(a) or otherwise in connection with the Merger.

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any cash amount payable pursuant
to Section 1.8(a) is to be paid to a Person other than the Person to which
the Certificate or Uncertificated Shares surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of the payment thereof that the
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall, as applicable, be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such exchange shall have paid to Parent or any agent
designated by it any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
payment of cash in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares surrendered, or established to the
satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 1.9, none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or
any party hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Applicable Legal Requirement.

(g) _Unclaimed Cash_. Any portion of funds held by the Exchange Agent that
has not been delivered to any holders of Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares pursuant to this Article I within 12 months after the Effective Time
shall promptly be paid to Parent, and thereafter each holder of a Certificate
or Uncertificated Shares who has not theretofore complied with the exchange
procedures set forth in and contemplated by Section 1.9(c) shall look only to
Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat and similar laws) for its
claim, only as a general unsecured creditor thereof, to the cash payable to
such holder pursuant to Section 1.8(a).

1.10. _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. All cash
paid or payable following the surrender for exchange of shares of Company
Capital Stock in accordance with this Agreement shall be so paid or payable in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital
Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records
of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, any Certificate or Uncertificated Shares are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, such Certificate or Uncertificated
Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

 

1.11. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such Certificate, following the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the record holder thereof, such cash as may be
required pursuant to Section 1.8(a) in respect of such Certificate; 
_provided_ that Parent or the Exchange Agent may, in its respective reasonable
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
record holder of such Certificate to deliver a customary bond in such
reasonable sum as Parent or the Exchange Agent may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, the Exchange Agent and/or any of their respective Representatives
with respect to such Certificate.

1.12. _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation, their
respective subsidiaries and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the cash otherwise deliverable under this Agreement and from any
other payments otherwise required pursuant to this Agreement, to any holder of
any shares of Company Capital Stock, any Company Options, any Company RSUs,
any Company PSUs, any Certificates or any Uncertificated Shares such amounts
as any of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, their respective subsidiaries or
the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to any
such deliveries and payments under the Code or any other Applicable Legal
Requirements. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to or
credited by the relevant Tax Authority, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid
to such holders in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

1.13. _Tax Consequences_. The parties hereto intend the Merger to be a
taxable sale of the Company Capital Stock by the Companys stockholders.
Parent makes no representations or warranties to the Company or to any holder
of Company Capital Stock, Company Options, Company RSUs or Company PSUs

Company or any such holder arising in connection with this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the other transactions or agreements contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company acknowledges that the Company and such holders
are relying solely on their own Tax advisors in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions and agreements contemplated
by this Agreement.

 Business and is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction (to the extent the concept is recognized by such

forth a true, correct and complete list of the Subsidiaries of the Company
and their respective jurisdictions of organization or formation. All of the

There are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, "put" or "call"
rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or other Contracts to which the

the Subsidiaries is bound with respect to the issued or unissued capital stock
or other securities of any Subsidiary, or otherwise obligating the Company or
any Subsidiary to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire or sell any such securities. Other than the Subsidiaries and in
connection with passive investments in publicly traded securities, the Company
does not directly or indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or
any interest convertible or exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or
similar interest in, any Person. There are no outstanding obligations of the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries under any Contract to which it is a party
or by which it is bound to make any equity investment (in the form of a

or a Subsidiary) in an amount in excess of $500,000 in respect of any single
Person.

(d) Subject to the accuracy of the representation set forth in Section 3.4,

proprietary work.

(m) To the knowledge of the Company, the employment of any employee of the
Company or any Subsidiary or the use by the Company or any Subsidiary of the
services of any consultant or independent contractor does not subject the
Company or any Subsidiary to any material Liability to any third party

to work for or provide services to the Company or any Subsidiary, whether such
Liability is based on contractual or other legal obligations to such third
party.

other Transactions. Parent owns beneficially and of record all of the

beneficially own any shares of Company Capital Stock. Neither Parent nor Sub,

period ending on the Agreement Date, as those terms are used in Section 203
of Delaware Law.

3.5. _Information Supplied_. The information supplied by Parent or Sub
for inclusion in the Proxy Statement shall not, on each applicable filing
date, on the date of mailing to the Companys stockholders and at the time of

statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading or (ii) omit
to state any material fact necessary to correct any statement in any earlier
communication with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the Company
Stockholder Meeting that has become misleading. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in the foregoing, neither Parent nor Sub makes any
representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by the
Company that is contained in (or incorporated by reference in) the Proxy
Statement.

 

3.6. _Availability of Funds_. Parent has on the Agreement Date and will
have available to it upon the Effective Time, sufficient funds to consummate
the Merger and the other Transactions, including payment in full of the
amounts payable pursuant to Section 1.8(a) to the holders of Company Capital
Stock and the holders of Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs,
respectively.

3.7. _Absence of Litigation_. There is no Legal Proceeding pending and
served or, to the knowledge of Parent, pending and not served or overtly
threatened against Parent or Sub, except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. To
the knowledge of Parent or Sub neither Parent nor Sub is subject to any
continuing Order of, or continuing investigation by, any Governmental Entity,
except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

3.8. _Brokers_. No agent, broker, investment banker, financial advisor or
other firm or Person is or shall be entitled, as a result of any action or
agreement of the Parent or any of its Affiliates, to any brokers, finders,
financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection with any
of the Transactions for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would
have any obligations or liabilities prior to the Effective Time.

Representatives has made any representation or warranty, express or implied,
to Parent, Sub or any of their respective Representatives in connection with
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

(b) In connection with the due diligence investigation of the Company and
the Subsidiaries by Parent and Sub and their respective Affiliates,
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, Representatives or
advisors, Parent and Sub and their respective Affiliates, stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, agents, Representatives and advisors have
received and may continue to receive after the Agreement Date from the Company

officers, employees, consultants, agents, Representatives and
advisors certain estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward looking
information, as well as certain business plan information, regarding the
Company and the Subsidiaries and their businesses and operations. Parent and
Sub hereby acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to
make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward looking
statements, as well as in such business plans, and that Parent and Sub will
have no claim against the Company and the Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers, employees,
consultants, agents, Representatives or advisors, or any other person with
respect thereto unless any such information is expressly addressed
or included in a representation or warranty contained in Article II.
Accordingly, Parent and Sub hereby acknowledge and agree that neither the
Company and the Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Affiliates,
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents,
Representatives or advisors, nor any other person, has made or is making any
express or implied representation or warranty with respect to such estimates,
projections, forecasts, forward looking statements or business plans unless

warranty contained in Article II.

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means, with respect to the Company, any agreement,
offer, proposal or indication of interest (other than this Agreement, the

relating to, or involving: (A) any acquisition or purchase by any Person or
Group, directly or indirectly, of more than 20% of the outstanding voting

the Company, (B) any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar
transaction involving the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to which the
stockholders of the Company immediately preceding such transaction hold

in any single transaction or series of related transactions.

(b) _Notice_. The Company shall advise Parent in writing as promptly
as practicable (but in no event more than one Business Day) after actual

Company, by any Company Representative) (excluding, for this purpose employees
who are not directors or officers) of (i) any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any
inquiry, indication of interest, proposal or offer that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) any request
for non-public information (including access to any of the properties, books

to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall describe the material
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of
interest, proposal, offer or request and the identity of the Person or Group
submitting any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest,
proposal, offer or request. The Company shall keep Parent informed on a
reasonably prompt basis (but in no event more than one Business Day after
actual receipt) of the status and material terms of, and any material
amendments or modifications or proposed material amendments or modifications
to, any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest, proposal,
offer or request and any material correspondence or communications related
thereto, and shall provide to Parent as promptly as practicable (but in no
event more than one Business Day after receipt) a true, correct and complete
copy of all written requests, proposals or offers provided to the Company, a
Subsidiary or a Company Representative in connection with any
such Acquisition Proposal or request (including any material amendments or

shall notify Parent promptly following any meeting of the Company Board at
which the Company Board has determined to provide non-public information to
any Person in connection with any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry,
indication of interest, proposal, offer or request.

 

(c) _Superior Proposals_. In the event that any Person or Group submits to
the Company (and does not withdraw) an unsolicited, written Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board concludes in good faith (after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of national standing)
is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, then,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.3(a), the Company may,
so long as the Company Stockholder Approval has not yet been obtained, (i)
enter into discussions with such Person or Group regarding such Acquisition
Proposal and (ii) deliver or make available to such Person non-public
information regarding the Company and the Subsidiaries; _provided_ that, in
each such case, the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives
shall have complied with each of the following: (A) none of the Company, the
Subsidiaries or any Company Representative shall have violated this Section
5.3 in any material respect, (B) the Company Board first shall have concluded
in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations to the Companys 

 



56

    

 stockholders under Applicable Legal Requirements, (C) prior to making
available to any such Person any material non-public information, the
Company first shall have received from such Person an executed Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement (a copy of which executed Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement shall be provided to Parent, for informational purposes only, within
one Business Day of its execution) and (D) prior to or contemporaneously with
delivering or making available any such non-public information to such Person,
the Company shall have delivered or made available such non-public information
to Parent (to the extent such non-public information has not previously been

" _Superior Proposal_ " means, with respect to the Company, an unsolicited,
_bona fide_ written offer submitted after the Agreement Date by a Person or
Group to acquire, directly or indirectly, (i) pursuant to a tender offer,
exchange offer, merger, consolidation or other business combination (including
by means of a tender offer followed by a back-end merger) beneficial ownership
of 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the Company or (ii) 50%
or more of the assets of the Company, that the Company Board has concluded in
its good faith judgment (following consultation with its outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor of national standing), taking into account,
among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other aspects
of the offer, including conditions to consummation and the Person making the
offer, in each case deemed relevant by the Company Board (x) would be, if
consummated, more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the Companys
stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders) than the terms of this
Agreement and (y) is reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms proposed
(as determined in the good faith judgment of the Company Board).

 

(d) _Change of Recommendation or Termination for Superior Proposal_.
Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Company Board from effecting a
Change of Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal or the Company
from terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(h) to enter into a
definitive agreement to accept a Superior Proposal if:

 

(i) the Company Stockholder Approval has not yet been obtained;

 

(ii) the Company has not breached in any material respect the provisions of
Section 5.2 and this Section 5.3;

(iii) such Superior Proposal has been submitted to the Company, has not
been withdrawn and continues to be a Superior Proposal;

(iv) the Company has provided to Parent at least four Business Days prior
written notice (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") that stated expressly (A)
that the Company has received such Superior Proposal, (B) the material terms
and conditions of such Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person or
Group submitting such Superior Proposal and (C) that the Company Board intends
to effect a Change of Recommendation (it being understood that the Notice of
Superior Proposal shall not, in and of itself, constitute a Change of
Recommendation for purposes of this Agreement so long as such notice clearly
states that it is not a Change of Recommendation and that the Company Board
has not otherwise effected a Change of Recommendation), and has provided
Parent with an unredacted copy of such Superior Proposal, together with
unredacted copies of all proposed transaction agreements received by the
Company Board and, subject to any express restrictions imposed by the lenders
thereto, any financing commitments relating thereto to the extent received by
the Company Board (collectively, the " _Superior Proposal Materials_ "),
concurrently with the delivery of such Notice of Superior Proposal;

 



57

    

(v) the Company has, during the four-Business Day period referred to in
Section 5.3(d)(iv), if requested by Parent, made the Company Representatives
available to discuss and negotiate in good faith with Parents Representatives
any modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement that Parent
desires to propose such that such Superior Proposal would cease to constitute
a Superior Proposal;

 

(vi) Parent has not, within four Business Days of Parents receipt of such
Notice of Superior Proposal, made a written, binding and irrevocable (through
the expiration of such four-Business Day period) offer that the Company Board
has concluded in good faith (following consultation with its outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor of national standing) to be at least as
favorable to the Companys stockholders as such Superior Proposal (it being
agreed that (A) the Company Board shall convene a meeting to consider any such
offer by Parent following the receipt thereof, (B) the Company Board will not
effect a Change of Recommendation and the Company will not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(h) for four Business Days after receipt by
Parent of such Notice of Superior Proposal and such Superior Proposal
Materials and (C) any change to the financial or other material terms of such
Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal to Parent
and a new two-Business Day period and discussion process under this Section
5.3(d) (and all references to four-Business Day periods in this Section 5.3(d)
shall be deemed two-Business Day periods for purposes of this Section
5.3(d)(vi)(C)); _provided_ that such new Notice of Superior Proposal shall in
no event shorten the original four-Business Day period); and

 

(vii) the Company Board has concluded in good faith (following consultation
with its outside legal counsel) that, in light of such Superior Proposal and
any modifications proposed by Parent pursuant to Section 5.3(d)(vi), the
failure to effect a Change of Recommendation and terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(h) (if applicable) would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under Applicable Legal
Requirements.

 

(e) _Change of Recommendation for Intervening Event_. Nothing in this
Agreement shall prevent the Company Board from effecting a Change of
Recommendation for a reason unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any Change of Recommendation proposed to be made in
response to an Acquisition Proposal may only be made pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms of Section 5.3(d)) if:

(i) the Company Stockholder Approval has not yet been obtained;

(ii) the Company has not breached in any material respect the provisions
of Section 5.2 and this Section 5.3;

(iii) the Company Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation
with its outside legal counsel) that, in light of material facts, events
and/or circumstances that as of the Agreement Date, were unknown by the
Company Board and were not reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of
the Agreement Date (an " _Intervening Event_ ") and taking into account the
results of any discussions with Parent as contemplated by subsection (iv) and
any offer from Parent contemplated by subsection (v), the failure to make a
Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations
to the Companys stockholders under Applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_
that in no event shall any of the following, in and of itself, constitute
or be deemed an Intervening Event: (A) any determination by the Company Board
that the Per Share Cash Amount payable in the Merger is not sufficient (
_provided_ that such exception shall not apply to any underlying cause for
such determination), (B) the Company exceeding any earnings projections or
predictions made by the Company (whether or not publicly announced) or
securities

 



58

    

 or financial analysts and any resulting analyst upgrades of the Companys
securities or any change in the trading price of the Company Common Stock (
_provided_ that such exception shall not apply to any underlying cause for
such performance), (C) any facts, events or circumstances resulting from any
breach of this Agreement by the Company or (D) the receipt, existence or terms
of any Acquisition Proposal or any matter relating thereto or the
consequences thereof;

(iv) the Company has provided to Parent at least four Business Days prior
written notice that the Company Board intends to effect a Change of
Recommendation (" _Notice of Intervening Event_ ") and if requested by Parent,
the Company shall have made the Company Representatives available during the
four-Business Day period to discuss with Parents Representatives (A) the
facts, events and circumstances underlying such proposed Change of
Recommendation and the Company Boards reason for proposing to effect such
Change of Recommendation and (B) any modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement that Parent desires to propose that that would
obviate the need for the Company Board to effect such Change of
Recommendation; and

 

(v) Parent shall not have, within the aforementioned four-Business Day
period, made a written, binding and irrevocable (through the expiration of
such four Business Day period) offer that the Company Board concludes in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial
advisor of national standing) would obviate the need for the Company Board to
effect such Change of Recommendation (it being agreed that (A) the Company
Board shall convene a meeting to consider any such offer by Parent following
the receipt thereof, (B) the Company Board will not effect a Change of
Recommendation for four Business Days after receipt by Parent of the Notice of
Intervening Event and (C) any material change in the facts, events or
circumstances related to the Intervening Event shall require a new Notice
of Intervening Event to Parent and a new two-Business Day period and
discussion process under subsection (iv) (and all references to four-Business
Day periods in this Section 5.3(e) shall be deemed two-Business Day periods
for purposes of this Section 5.3(e)(v)(C)); _provided_ that such new Notice of
Intervening Event shall in no event shorten the original four-Business Day
period).

 

(f) _Compliance with Tender Offer Rules_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) taking and
disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated by Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders that
the Company Board has concluded in good faith (following consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that failure to make such disclosure would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders
under Applicable Legal Requirements (a " _Required Fiduciary Disclosure_ ");
_provided_ that (A) any "stop, look, and listen" communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, and any
substantially similar communication that solely constitutes a recitation of
the fact that an Acquisition Proposal has been received and a factual
description of the terms thereof, and that no position has been taken by the
Company Board as to the advisability or desirability of such Acquisition
Proposal, shall not be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation if it is also
accompanied by a public statement by the Company Board expressly reaffirming
the Company Board Recommendation, (B) such Required Fiduciary Disclosure shall
not be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation if it relates to an
Acquisition Proposal and the text of such Required Fiduciary Disclosure
includes a public statement that the Company Board is expressly reaffirming
the Company Board Recommendation and (C) the Company Board shall not
recommend that the Companys stockholders tender shares of Company Capital
Stock in connection with any tender or exchange offer or otherwise effect a
Change of Recommendation unless specifically permitted by, and in accordance
with, Section 5.3.

 



59

    

5.4. _Access to Information_.

 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, (i) the Company shall afford Parent
and its Representatives reasonable access, upon reasonable notice, during
business hours to (A) all of the properties, books, Contracts and records of
the Company and each Subsidiary. (B) data reasonably requested by Parent
regarding the Companys equity incentive awards and related Tax compliance

Business, results of operations, accounting methods, product development
efforts, properties (tangible and intangible, including Intellectual

reasonably request and (ii) the Company shall maintain the virtual data room
established in connection with this Agreement and provide Parent and its
Representatives access thereto; _provided_ that with respect to clause (i),
any such access shall be conducted at a reasonable time, under the supervision
of appropriate personnel of the Company and in such a manner as not
to unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of the business of the
Company. Nothing herein shall require the Company to disclose any information
to Parent (A) to the extent related to an Acquisition Proposal, Change of
Recommendation, Notice of Superior Proposal or Notice of Intervening Event
(except as otherwise required by the terms of this Agreement) or (B) if such
disclosure would (i) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of any
third party, (ii) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege (so
long as the Company has reasonably cooperated with Parent in an effort to
permit such inspection of or to disclose such information on a basis that does
not waive such privilege with respect thereto) or (iii) contravene any
applicable Legal Requirement, fiduciary duty, Contract or any obligation of
the Company with respect to confidentiality or privacy (so long as the Company
has reasonably cooperated with Parent in an effort to permit such inspection
of or to disclose such information on a basis that does not contravene any
such obligations with respect thereto); _provided_ that information shall be
disclosed subject to execution of a joint defense agreement in customary
form, and disclosure may be limited to external counsel for Parent, to the
extent the Company determines doing so may be reasonably required for the
purpose of complying with applicable Antitrust Laws. With respect to the
information disclosed pursuant to this Section 5.4, Parent shall comply with,
and shall instruct Parents Representatives to comply with, all of its
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(b) No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to
this Section 5.4 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or condition contained herein.

 

5.5. _Confidentiality; Public Disclosure_.

 

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge that Parent and the Company have
previously executed a Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of March 17, 2019
(as may be amended from time to time in accordance with its terms, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which shall continue in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms.

 

(b) Parent and the Company have agreed to certain communications regarding
the Transactions, including (i) the text of the initial press release
announcing the execution of this Agreement and the Transactions and (ii)
certain statements by Parent regarding the continuation after the Closing of
the Companys merchant model and licensing practices regarding standards-
essential patents. Except with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or Change
of Recommendation and as provided in Section 5.3 or in connection with any
dispute under this Agreement, the Company shall consult with Parent before
issuing or making, and shall provide and shall not issue any press release or
make any public statement relating to this Agreement or the Transactions
without the prior written consent of Parent; _provided_ that the Company may,
without obtaining such prior consent, issue such press release or make such
public statement to the extent that the Company determines in good faith
(following consultation with its outside legal counsel) that such press
release or public statement is required by Applicable Legal Requirements to
be issued or

 



60

    

 made; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company has used reasonable efforts
to consult and discuss in good faith with Parent the form and content thereof
prior to its release and has considered in good faith any reasonable changes
that are suggested by Parent prior to releasing or making such press release
or public statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
foregoing, each party may, without such consultation or consent, make any
public statement in response to questions from the press analysts, investors
or those attending industry conferences, make internal announcements to
employees and make disclosures in Company SEC Reports, so long as such
statement is consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or
public statements made jointly by the parties (or individually, if approved by
the other party). The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Company Representatives to comply with this Section 5.5. Prior to
the Closing, (i) neither Parent nor Sub shall (and each shall cause its
Affiliates and Representatives not to) contact or communicate with any of the
employees, customers, licensors or suppliers of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries, without the prior written consent of the Company and (ii) the
Company shall consult in good faith with Parent on the Companys general
communications strategy for customers, suppliers and employees regarding the
Merger.

Company shall apply for or otherwise seek, and use its respective reasonable
best efforts to obtain, all consents and approvals required to be obtained by
it for the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions. Without
limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, each of Parent and the
Company shall make any initial filings required under the HSR Act and any
other additional filings (" _Merger Notification Filings_ ") required by the
HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the
Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other Applicable Legal
Requirements that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions

and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in
connection with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or any foreign
or other Antitrust Law, (ii) coordinate with one another in preparing and
exchanging such materials, (iii) promptly provide one another (and its
counsel) with copies of all filings, presentations or submissions (and a
summary of any oral presentations) made by such party to any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Transactions; _provided_ that with respect to
any such analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions or proposals or such filings, presentations or submissions, each of
Parent and the Company need not supply the other (or its counsel) with copies
(or in case of oral presentations, a summary) to the extent that any
Applicable Legal Requirement requires such party or its subsidiaries to
restrict or prohibit access to any such information and (iv) use reasonable
efforts to provide one another the opportunity to attend and participate in
any in-person meetings, substantive telephone calls or conferences with any
Governmental Entity in connection with securing approvals and expiration of
relevant waiting periods under Antitrust Laws, to the extent
such participation is not restricted by the Governmental Entity. In addition,
any party may, as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
confidential and competitively sensitive material provided to the other
parties under this Section 5.6 as "Outside Counsel Only." Such materials and
the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal
counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers, or directors of the recipient, unless express written
permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials. Without
limiting Parents cooperation obligations described in this Section

strategy (including with respect to negotiating any remedies) for securing

information provided to comply in all material respects with, any Applicable
Legal Requirements and (iii) any proposal by a Governmental Entity regarding a
settlement of any investigation. Each party hereto will respond promptly to
and comply with any request for information relating to this Agreement or the
Merger Notification Filings from any Governmental Entity charged with
enforcing, applying, administering or investigating any Antitrust Laws.
Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to any Merger Notification Filing made pursuant to Section 5.6(a),
each party hereto will promptly inform the other parties of such occurrence
and cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental Entity such amendment
or supplement.

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its respective reasonable
best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions under any applicable
Antitrust Laws. Parent and the Company shall take any and all of the
following actions to the extent necessary to cause the expiration of the

respect to the Transactions and to obtain the approval of any Governmental
Entity with jurisdiction over the enforcement of any Applicable Legal
Requirements regarding the Transactions: (i) entering into negotiations, (ii)
providing information required by Applicable Legal Requirements and (iii)
substantially complying with any "second request" for information pursuant to
applicable Antitrust Laws.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it is expressly

threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger or the other Transactions
as violative of any Antitrust Law Parent, shall not have any obligation to
litigate or contest any such Legal Proceeding or Order resulting therefrom
and (ii) Parent shall be under no obligation to make proposals, execute or
carry out agreements or submit to Orders providing for (A) the sale, license
or other disposition or holding separate (through the establishment of
a trust or otherwise) of any assets or categories of assets of Parent or the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates, (B) other than as set forth on
Schedule 5.6(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the imposition of any
limitation or restriction on the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates
to freely conduct their business or, following the Closing, the Business or
own such assets or (C) the holding separate of the shares of Company Capital
Stock or any limitation or regulation on the ability of Parent or any of its
Affiliates to exercise full rights of ownership of the shares of Company
Capital Stock (any of the foregoing, an " _Antitrust Restraint_ ").

 

(e) Nothing in this Section 5.6 shall limit a partys right to terminate
the Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b) so long as such party has until such
date complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section
5.6.

 

5.7. _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 5.6(d), each of the parties hereto agrees to use its respective
reasonable best efforts, and to cooperate with each other party hereto to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably necessary, appropriate or desirable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the
other Transactions, including (i) taking all reasonable actions necessary to
satisfy the respective conditions set forth in Article VI and (ii) executing
and delivering such other instruments and doing and performing such other acts
and things as may be reasonably necessary, appropriate or desirable to effect
completely the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions. 

 



62

    

5.8. _Third-Party Consents; Consultations_.

 

(a) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (not to
require a concession or expenditure, other than immaterial processing or
consent fees, or material undertaking) to obtain, prior to the Closing, all
consents, waivers and approvals required under Contracts of the Company or a
Subsidiary to the extent reasonably requested by Parent. For the avoidance of
doubt, the failure to obtain any such consent, waiver or approval shall not
constitute a breach of covenant or agreement for all purposes of this
Agreement, including Section 6.3(b).

 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Agreement Date, the Company
will initiate a process of informing and consulting appropriate
representatives of its non-U.S. employees or the non-U.S. employees
themselves, to the extent required under Applicable Legal
Requirements, regarding a prospective transfer of employment to Parent or any
of its Affiliates with effect following the Closing. Subject to Section 5.4
and Applicable Legal Requirements, the Company shall allow Parent or its
relevant Affiliate to participate in such information and consultation
process.

5.9. _Notice of Certain Matters_.

 

(a) Each party will notify the other party in writing promptly after
learning of (i) any change, occurrence or event that is reasonably likely to
cause any representation or warranty of such Person (or, in case of Parents
obligation to provide notice, any representation or warranty of Sub) contained
in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate or (ii) any material breach by
such Person (or, in case of the Parents obligation to provide notice, any
material breach by Sub), in each case in any manner that would to cause any of
such other partys conditions to closing set forth in Article VI not to be
satisfied. The Company will (A) notify Parent in writing reasonably promptly
after receipt of a written notice from any Governmental Entity alleging that
the consent of such Governmental Entity is required in order to consummate
the Transactions and (B) use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Parent

any Governmental Entity concerning Export Control Laws, Import Control
Laws or Sanctions.

(b) Except to the extent necessary to avoid the duplication of benefits,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its other
Affiliates to recognize the service of each Continuing Employee with the
Company or its Affiliates before the Effective Time (to the same
extent recognized by the Company or its Affiliates immediately prior to the
Effective Time) as if such service had been performed with Parent or its
Affiliates under the terms of plans of Parent or any of its Affiliates. For
the avoidance of doubt, the recognition of service under this Section 5.10(b)
shall apply to eligibility and vesting and level of benefit and benefit
accrual under all employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by the
Parent or its Affiliates (including vacation and severance plans) that such
employees may be eligible to participate in after the Effective Time, but
shall not apply for purposes of benefit accrual under a defined benefit plan.

 



63

    

(c) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent or
its Affiliates in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate
after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its other Affiliates, to the extent permitted by the relevant
welfare plan, and consistent with such plans application to similarly
situated employees of Parent or its Affiliates who are not Continuing
Employees, to waive all limitations as to waiting periods, actively-at-work
requirements, evidence of insurability requirements, preexisting conditions
and other exclusions with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to such employees (and their spouses, domestic
partners and dependents) to the extent such conditions and exclusions were
satisfied or did not apply to such employees (or their spouses, domestic
partners or dependents) under the welfare plans maintained by the Company or
its Affiliates prior to the Effective Time.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions
of this Section 5.10, the provisions of Section 5.10 shall apply only with
respect to Continuing Employees (and their dependents and beneficiaries) who
are covered under Company Employee Plans that are maintained primarily for
the benefit of employees employed in the United States (including Continuing
Employees regularly employed outside the United States to the extent they
participate in such Company Employee Plans). With respect to
Continuing Employees not described in the preceding sentence, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, comply with
all applicable Laws, directives and regulations relating to employees and
employee benefits matters applicable to such employees.

(e) This Section 5.10 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each party hereto (meaning, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent, Sub and
the Company), and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 5.10. In no event shall
the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any
Company Benefit Plan or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary
or any of their respective Affiliates, (ii) alter or limit the ability of
Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation) to
amend, modify or terminate any of the Company Employee Plans or any other
benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the
Effective Time or (iii) confer upon any current or former employee or
other service provider of the Company or Subsidiaries, any right to
employment or continued employment or continued service with Parent or any of
its subsidiaries (including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation), or constitute or
create an employment or agreement with, or modify the at-will status of any,
employee or other service provider.

 

(f) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its other
Affiliates to, (i) assume and honor the obligations of the Company and the
Subsidiaries under the CIC Plan and any other contracts, providing for the
payment of severance set forth on Schedule 2.12(j) or Schedule 2.17(a)(vii) of
the Company Disclosure Letter, in accordance with their terms, and (ii) honor
all provisions with respect to vesting, accelerated vesting under the CIC Plan
and any retention agreement set forth on Schedule 1.8(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter and/or payment of any Unvested Company Options, Unvested
Company RSUs or Unvested Company PSUs following the Merger and cause all such
provisions to apply to payment of the Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs) and
Unvested Cash (PSUs) to the same extent as if the applicable Unvested Company
Options, Unvested Company RSUs or Unvested Company PSUs had been assumed by
Parent hereunder, subject in each case to the right to make amendments or
modifications to the extent permitted by such terms and subject to any
applicable Employment Offer Documents.

(g) During the period from the Agreement Date and continuing until the
earlier of the termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
Company will not (i) sponsor or maintain any new Company Employee Plan or new
benefit under existing Company Employee Plans which is not in effect as of the
Agreement Date except for non-material changes made in the Ordinary Course of
Business to ERISA-covered health and welfare plans as part of an annual
renewal process, (ii) increase its matching contribution formula under the
Company 401(k) Plan or (iii) increase its percentage of employer cost sharing
contribution to Company Employee Plans in excess of the percentage of cost
sharing in effect as of the Agreement Date except for non-material changes to
copays and deductibles (but not premiums) for any ERISA-covered health plan as
part of an annual renewal process.

 

5.11. _Equity Matters_. As soon as practicable following the Agreement
Date, the Company shall take all actions with respect to the Company ESPP
that are necessary to provide that: (i) with respect to any offering period in
effect as of the Agreement Date (the " _Current ESPP Offering Period_ "), no
employee who is not a participant in the Company ESPP as of the Agreement
Date may become a participant in the Company ESPP and no participant may
increase the percentage amount of his or her payroll deduction election from
that in effect on the Agreement Date such for Current ESPP Offering Period,
(ii) subject to the consummation of the Merger, the Company ESPP shall
terminate effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) if the
Current ESPP Offering Period terminates prior to the Effective Time, then
the Company ESPP shall be suspended and no new offering period shall be
commenced under the Company ESPP prior to the termination of this Agreement
and (iv) if any Current ESPP Offering Period is still in effect at the
Effective Time, then the last day of such Current ESPP Offering Period shall
be accelerated to the Business Day prior to the Closing Date and the final
settlement or purchase of shares of Company Common Stock thereunder shall be
made on that day by applying the formula set forth in Section 15(b)(2)(iv) of
the Company ESPP in effect on the Agreement Date. The Company shall provide
all required notices of the foregoing to the participants in accordance with
the Company ESPP.

 

5.12. _Termination of Benefit Plans_. Unless otherwise requested by Parent
in writing, at least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a true, correct and complete copy of
resolutions adopted by the Company Board, certified by the Secretary of the
Company, terminating the Companys 401(k) Plan (the " _401(k) Plan_ ") and
the flexible spending accounts for health and dependent care (" _FSAs_ "),
effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date and
contingent upon the Closing. In the event that termination of the Companys
401(k) Plan would reasonably be expected to trigger liquidation or surrender
charges, or similar fees, then the Company shall take such actions as are
necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees and
provide such estimate in writing to Parent no later than 10 Business Days
prior to the Closing Date.

 

5.13. _D andO Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent will assume, and will cause the Surviving Corporation
to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company and each
of the Subsidiaries to their respective present and former directors and
officers (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") pursuant to any indemnification
agreements with the Company or such Subsidiary made available to Parent and
any indemnification or advancement provisions under the Companys or such
Subsidiarys certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent
organizational documents) as in effect on the Agreement Date with respect to
their acts and omissions as directors and officers of the Company or such
Subsidiary occurring prior to the Effective Time, in each case, subject to
Applicable Legal Requirements. From and after the Effective Time, such
obligations shall be joint and several obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation. The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation will contain provisions with respect to advancement, exculpation
and indemnification that are at least as favorable in the aggregate to the
Indemnified Parties as those contained in the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Company (or equivalent organizational documents) as

 



65

    

 in effect on the Agreement Date, which provisions will not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective
Time in any manner that adversely affects the rights thereunder of the
Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is required by Applicable Legal
Requirements.

 

(b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect, for the benefit of the
Indemnified Parties with respect to their acts and omissions as directors and
officers of the Company or any Subsidiary occurring prior to the Effective
Time, the existing policy of directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by the Company or any Subsidiary as of the Agreement Date in the
form made available by the Company to Parent prior to the Agreement Date
(the " _Existing D andO Policy_"), to the extent that directors and officers
liability insurance coverage is commercially available; _provided_ that: (i)
the Surviving Corporation may substitute for the Existing DandO Policy a policy
or policies of comparable coverage, including a "tail" or "runoff" insurance
policy, (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay annual
premiums for the Existing DandO Policy (or for any substitute or "tail"
policies) in excess of an amount equal to 300% of the most recently paid
annual premium for the Existing DandO Policy (the " _Maximum Premium_ ") and
(iii) if requested by Parent, the Company shall issue a broker of record
letter acceptable to Parent permitting Parents insurance broker to negotiate
and place such "tail" or "runoff" insurance of comparable coverage, Parent
shall have the right to negotiate such coverage and the Company shall
reasonably cooperate therewith. In the event any future annual premiums for
the Existing DandO Policy (or any substitute policies) exceed the Maximum
Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to reduce the amount of
coverage of the Existing DandO Policy (or any substitute or "tail" policies) to
the amount of coverage that can be obtained for a premium equal to the Maximum
Premium. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company in its sole discretion
elects, by giving written notice to Parent at least two Business Days prior to
the Effective Time, in lieu of the foregoing insurance, the Company may
purchase a comparable "tail" or "runoff" extension to the Existing DandO Policy
for a period of six years after the Effective Time for a premium not to exceed
the Maximum Premium.

 

(c) This Section 5.13 shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is
intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Parties, shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation and Parent and shall be
enforceable by each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives, and may not be amended, altered or repealed after
the Effective Time without the prior written consent of the affected
Indemnified Party ( _provided_ that any amendment, alteration or repeal prior
the Effective Time shall be governed by Section 7.4). If any Indemnified Party
makes any claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under this
Section 5.13 that is denied by Parent and/or the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to such indemnification or advancement of
expenses, then Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall pay the
Indemnified Partys costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and
expenses, incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with pursuing his
or her claims to the fullest extent permitted by law.

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume and succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 5.13.

5.14. _Section 16 Matters_. Provided that the Company delivers to Parent
the Section 16 Information in a timely fashion, Parent and the Company shall
take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under
Applicable Legal Requirements) to cause any disposition of Company Capital

Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by Article I by each
Company Insider to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act. " _Section_ __ _ 16 Information_" means, with respect to each Company
Insider, the number of shares of Company Capital Stock held by such Company

5.15. _Takeover Statute_. The Company and the Company Board shall (i) take
all actions necessary to ensure that no takeover statute or similar statute
or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement and the Transactions
and (ii) if any takeover statute or similar statute or regulation becomes
applicable to this Agreement or any Transactions, take all action necessary
to ensure that the Merger and the other Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger
and the other Transactions.

Company or required authorized officer as specified therein.

amended Irish income Tax Return) of the Companys Irish subsidiary (each, a "
_Reviewed Return_ ") not less than 20 Business Days prior to the due date
(including extensions) of such Reviewed Return and shall consider in good
faith incorporating in such Reviewed Return as ultimately filed any reasonable
comments made in good faith by Parent not less than 10 Business Days prior to
such due date (including extensions).

 

5.17. _Director and Officer Resignations_. At the request of Parent, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a written letter
of resignation from each of the directors and officers of the Company and from
each of the directors and officers of each Subsidiary that will be effective
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Parent of, consult with Parent on and give Parent reasonable opportunity to
participate (at Parents expense) in the defense or settlement of (i) any
Legal Proceeding brought by current or former stockholders of the Company
against the Company and/or its directors or officers relating to the

Proceedings (as defined in Schedule 2.6 of the Company Disclosure Letter)
and (iii) any Legal Proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity being
initiated by or against it or any Subsidiary that is, or is reasonably likely
to be, material to the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,

any such Legal Proceedings, (B) keep Parent reasonably informed of the status
and material details of any such Legal Proceedings, (C) give Parent the

shall consider in good faith) on all material filings or responses to be made
by the Company in the defense or settlement of any such Legal Proceedings and
(D) not compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to
compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding any Stockholder
Litigation, or consent to the same without Parents prior written consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
_provided_ that Parents consent in this clause (D) shall not be required if
the settlement involves (I) solely (x) the payment of an aggregate amount not
to exceed the amount set forth in Schedule 5.19 of the Company Disclosure

until the Initial End Date or the Extended End Date) after delivery of written
notice from Parent to the Company of such breach or inaccuracy (it being
understood that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.1(f) if such breach or inaccuracy is cured during such period);

 

(g) by Parent, if a Triggering Event shall have occurred; or

 

(h) by the Company, if the Company Board has determined to enter into a
definitive agreement to accept a Superior Proposal; _provided_ that the
Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(h) only if
the Company: (i) has complied in all material respects with Section 5.3(d)
with respect to such Superior Proposal, (ii) concurrently enters into a
definitive agreement pursuant to which such Superior Proposal is to be
effected and (iii) has paid, or concurrently pays, to Parent all amounts due
pursuant to Section 7.3(b) in accordance with the terms specified therein.

 



71

    

A " _Triggering Event_ " shall be deemed to have occurred if: (A) a Change of
Recommendation shall have been effected or occurred for any reason, (B) the
Company shall have materially breached Section 5.2 or Section 5.3, (C) the
Company Board fails to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within 10
Business Days after Parent requests in writing that such recommendation be
reaffirmed in response to an Acquisition Proposal or material modification to
an Acquisition Proposal that has been publicly announced or otherwise becomes
publicly known (or if such request is delivered less than 10 Business Days,
but more than three Business Days, prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting,
then the Company Board shall be required to reaffirm such recommendation no
later than one Business Day prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting), (D)
the Company, the Company Board or any Company Representative shall resolve,
propose or agree to do any of the foregoing or (E) a tender or exchange offer
relating to securities of the Company shall have been commenced by a Person
unaffiliated with Parent and the Company fails to send to its stockholders
pursuant to Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Securities Act, within 10
Business Days after such tender or exchange offer is first published, sent or
given, a statement disclosing that the Company unconditionally recommends
rejection of such tender or exchange offer (the " _Rejection Recommendation_
") or fails to reaffirm the Rejection Recommendation in any press release
published by the Company (or by any of its Affiliates or Representatives) or
in any Schedule 14D-9 filed by the Company with the SEC, in each case relating
to such tender offer or exchange offer, at any time after the foregoing 10
Business Day period.

7.2. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent or the Company or
their respective stockholders or Representatives; _provided_ that (x) Section
5.5(a) (Confidentiality), this Section 7.2 (Effect of Termination), Section
7.3 (Expenses and Termination Fees) and Article VIII (General Provisions)
shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this
Agreement and (y) except as provided in Sections 7.3(c) and (e), nothing
herein shall relieve any party hereto from liability in connection with any
fraud or willful and material breach prior to such termination with respect
to any of such partys covenants or other obligations set forth in this
Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, "willful and material breach" shall
mean a material breach that is a consequence of an act undertaken, or a
failure to act, which the breaching party knew, or reasonably should have
known, would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in a material breach
of this Agreement.

 

7.3. _Expenses and Termination Fees_.

 

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in this Section 7.3, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions
shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses whether or not the Merger
is consummated.

 

(b) _Company Payment_. The Company shall pay to Parent a cash amount equal
to $120,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") in the event that this Agreement
is terminated: (i) pursuant to Section 7.1(g), (ii) pursuant to either Section
7.1(b) or Section 7.1(d) at a time when Parent would have been entitled
to terminate pursuant to Section 7.1(g), (iii) pursuant to Section 7.1(h) or
(iv) pursuant to either Section 7.1(b) (prior to the Company receiving the
Company Stockholder Approval), Section 7.1(d) or Section 7.1(f) and, in the
case of this clause (iv), (A) after the Agreement Date and prior to such
termination, an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company was publicly
disclosed and not publicly withdrawn, and (B) within 12 months following
the termination of this Agreement, either an Acquisition with respect to the
Company is consummated or the Company enters into a Contract providing for an
Acquisition that is subsequently consummated (even if consummated following
such 12-month period). The Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to

 



72

    

 an account designated by Parent promptly but in no event later than: (A) for
a termination described in clause (i) or (ii), within two Business Days after
the date of such termination, (B) for a termination described in clause
(iii), prior to or concurrently with such termination or (C) for a termination
described in clause (iv), within two Business Days after the date of the
consummation of such Acquisition.

 

(c) The Company acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in Section
7.3(b) are an integral part of the Transactions, (ii) the amount of, and the
basis for payment of, the fees and expenses described therein is reasonable
and appropriate in all respects and (iii) without this agreement, Parent would
not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a
timely manner the fee due pursuant to Section 7.3(b), and, in order to obtain
such payment, Parent makes a claim that results in a judgment for the amount
set forth in Section 7.3(b), the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount set forth in
Section 7.3(b) at the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A. in effect from time
to time from the date such payment was required to be made hereunder. Payment
under Section 7.3(b) and this Section 7.3(c) shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent. Payment of
the Termination Fee (and any additional amounts required under this Section
7.3(c)) to Parent by the Company in accordance with this Agreement shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and shall be deemed to be liquidated
damages for any actual or purported breach of this Agreement and for any and
all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent or any of its Affiliates
in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof),
the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the
basis for such termination and, after such payment has been made, the Company
and its Affiliates shall have no further liability for any such actual or
purported breach or for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by
Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement (and the
termination hereof), the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any
matter forming the basis for such termination. 

(d) " _Acquisition_ " means any of the following transactions (other than
the Transactions): (i) a merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction or series of
transactions involving the Company pursuant to which the stockholders of the
Company immediately preceding such transaction or series of transactions hold
less than 50% of the aggregate equity interests in the surviving or resulting
entity of such transaction or series of transactions or any direct or indirect
parent thereto, (ii) a sale or other disposition in a transaction or series
of transactions by the Company or the Subsidiaries of assets representing in
excess of 50% of the aggregate fair market value of the assets of the Company
and the Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction or series of
transactions or (iii) the acquisition by any Person or Group (including by way
of a tender offer or an exchange offer or issuance by the Company), directly
or indirectly, in a transaction or series of transactions, of beneficial
ownership or a right to acquire beneficial ownership of shares representing in
excess of 50% of the voting power of the shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such transaction or series of transactions.

 

(e) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion,
whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable under more than one
provision of this Agreement at the same or at different time and the
occurrence of different events.

 

7.4. _Amendment_. Subject to Applicable Legal Requirements, this Agreement
may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective boards of directors, at any time before or after the Company
Stockholder Approval has been obtained pursuant to an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto;  _provided_ that, after the
Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no such amendment shall be
made to the extent that Applicable Legal Requirements would require further
approval by the Companys stockholders without such further stockholder
approval.

 



73

    

7.5. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any
party hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto or (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for
the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The agreement of
Parent to any extension or waiver shall be deemed to be the agreement of Sub
to such extension or waiver. No delay in exercising any rights under this
Agreement shall constitute a waiver of such right, and no waiver of any breach
or default shall be deemed a waiver of any other breach or default of the same
or any other provision of this Agreement.

8.3. _Interpretation_.

 

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Articles, Sections or
Exhibits, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit
to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. When a reference is made to a
Schedule, such reference shall be to a Schedule of the Company Disclosure
Letter. Where a reference is made to an Applicable Legal Requirement, such
reference is to such Applicable Legal Requirement as then in effect. Where a
reference is made to a Contract or instrument such reference is to such
Contract or instrument as then in effect. The headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

(b) The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall
be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." The
phrases "provide to" and "deliver to" and phrases of similar import when used
herein, unless the context otherwise requires, shall mean that a true, correct
and complete paper or electronic copy of the information or material referred
to has been delivered to the party to whom such information or material is to
be provided. Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires: (i)
words of any gender include each other gender, (ii) words using the singular
or plural number also include the plural or singular number, respectively and
(iii) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereto," "hereunder" and derivative or
similar words refer to this entire Agreement and (iv) references to clauses
without a cross-reference to a Section or subsection are references to
clauses within the same Section or, if more specific, subsection. References
to any Person include the successors and permitted assigns of that Person.
References to any statute are to that statute as then in effect, and to the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. References to "$" and "dollars"
are to the currency of the United States. References from or through any date
shall mean, unless otherwise specified, from and including or through and
including, respectively. The definitions contained in this Agreement are
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to
the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. The
word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a
subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if."
All references to "days" shall be to calendar days unless otherwise indicated
as a "Business Day."

(c) Unless indicated otherwise, all mathematical calculations contemplated
by this Agreement shall be rounded to the tenth decimal place.

 



75

    

(d) The 1.0% threshold established by the parties hereto with respect to
the Companys capitalization in Section 6.3(a) shall not, in and of itself,
constitute an economic benchmark for determining whether any Effect shall be
deemed to be material in relation to the Company and the Business or shall
be deemed to constitute a Material Adverse Effect.

8.4. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto; _it_ _being_
  _understood_ that all parties hereto need not sign the same counterpart.

8.5. _Entire Agreement; Parties in Interest_. This Agreement and the
documents and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to herein
or delivered pursuant hereto, including all schedules and exhibits attached
hereto, and the Company Disclosure Letter, (i) constitute the entire
agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, except
for the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full force and
effect, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement, in accordance
with its terms, and (ii) are not intended to confer, and shall not be
construed as conferring, upon any Person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies hereunder, except the Indemnified Parties as expressly set
forth in Section 5.13.

 

8.6. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and any such assignment
or delegation without such prior written consent shall be null and void,
except that Parent may make such assignment or delegation to any direct or
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent without the prior consent of any
other party hereto; _provided_ that Parent shall remain liable for all of its
obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

 

8.7. _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and shall be interpreted so
as reasonably necessary to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The
parties hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

8.8. _Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise
provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party
hereto shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
party hereto of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any party of
any right to specific performance or injunctive relief. The parties hereto
agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity, and the parties hereto hereby waive
the requirement of any posting of a bond in connection with the remedies
described herein. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose 

 



76

    

 the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
relief on the basis that the other party has an adequate remedy at law or an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or equity.

8.9. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of laws, provision or rule (whether of the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws
of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware. The parties
hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware, New Castle County, or, if that court does
not have jurisdiction, a federal court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware, in
respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this
Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect
of the Transactions and thereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert,
as a defense in any Legal Proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement
hereof or thereof, that it is not subject thereto or that such Legal
Proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that
the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such
document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto
irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such Legal Proceeding shall
be heard and determined in such courts. The parties hereto hereby consent to
and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over
the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other
papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner
provided in Section 8.2 or in such other manner as may be permitted by
Applicable Legal Requirements, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.

 

8.10. _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, hereby waive, with respect to this Agreement, each Schedule
and each Exhibit attached hereto, the application of any Applicable Legal
Requirement, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document shall be construed against the party drafting such
agreement or document.

 

8.11. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
