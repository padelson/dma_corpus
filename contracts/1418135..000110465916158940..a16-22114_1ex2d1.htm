information purposes only to the Purchaser a draft of the Closing Statement
(as defined below) contemplated by the immediately following sentence,
including a good faith estimate of the Transaction Expenses, unpaid portion of
the 2016 Bonus Amount, Cash and Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount
(for the purposes of clarity, the parties acknowledge and agreement that such

with respect to the Transaction Expenses included in the Closing Total
Consideration) or of any financing or refinancing arrangements entered into at
any time by the Purchaser or any other transaction entered into by the
Purchaser in connection with the consummation of the Proposed Transaction, and
(ii) any of the plans, transactions, fundings, payments or changes which the

Purchaser or any of its assets or liabilities. The Purchaser shall have the
right to reasonably review and comment on the Closing Statement (and the
underlying calculation of the Closing Total Consideration and the components
thereof), _provided_ , that the Purchaser delivers any requested changes to
the Company at least two (2) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing
Date. In such case, the Purchaser and the Company shall, in good faith, use
their commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such comments or
requested changes and shall amend the Closing Statement to reflect any changes
to any component thereof so agreed upon by the Purchaser and the Company. If
the Purchaser and the Company agree on any changes to the Closing Statement,
then (i) the Closing Statement, as amended to reflect such changes, shall be
deemed to be the Closing Statement for all purposes of this Agreement and (ii)
the Closing Total Consideration shall be as set forth in such amended Closing
Statement. If the Purchaser and the Company are unable to agree on any changes
to the Closing Statement, then (x) such dispute shall not, under any
circumstance, delay the Closing, (y) the Companys draft of the Closing
Statement shall be deemed to be the Closing Statement for all purposes of this
Agreement and (z) the Closing Total Consideration shall be as set forth in the
Companys draft of the Closing Statement.

Section 2.7 _Effect of Merger on the Units of the Company_.

 



 

(a) _Effect on Company Units_.

 



 

(i) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of Company
Units issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (after
giving effect to (x) the acceleration of all Restricted Units and Profit
Interest Units and (y) the exercise (including the deemed exercise in
accordance with their terms) of all Company Warrants), the Company Units of
each Member, as recorded in the books or ledger of the Company, shall be
cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to
receive (without interest and less any applicable Tax withholding), upon the
transfer of such Company Units represented by book entry in the manner
provided in _Section 2.9(a)_, an amount in cash equal to the amount set forth
opposite such Members name on the Closing Statement, which amount shall be
calculated based on the Per Unit Closing Consideration.

 



 

(ii) For purposes of calculating the amount of cash payable to each Member
pursuant to this Agreement, all Company Units held by such Member (after
giving effect to (x) the acceleration of all Restricted Units and Profit
Interest Units and (y) the exercise (including the deemed exercise in
accordance with their terms) of any Company Warrants held by such Member)
shall be aggregated, and the aggregate amount of cash payable to such Member
shall be calculated by multiplying the number of Company Units held by such
Member by the Per Unit Closing Consideration (minus any applicable Threshold
Amount with respect to any Profit Interest Unit and the Warrant Exercise Price
with respect to any Company Warrant), rounded (up or down) to the nearest
whole cent. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
aggregate amount paid to the Members with respect to all of the Company Units
(after giving effect to (1) the acceleration of all Restricted Units and
Profit Interest Units and (2) the exercise (including the deemed exercise in
accordance with its terms) of all

 



       
 

 



 

Company Warrants) shall not exceed the sum of (A) the Closing Total
Consideration, (B) the Aggregate Consideration Surplus (if any) and (C) the
Escrow Distribution Funds (if any).

 



 

(b) _Effect on Restricted Units; Profit Interest Units_. Neither the Purchaser
nor the Surviving Company shall assume any Restricted Units in connection with
the Merger. At the Effective Time, each Restricted Unit outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without any action on the part
of the Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled
and converted into Company Units in accordance with its terms, and such
Company Units shall be deemed to be outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and, in accordance with _Section 2.7(a)(i)_, shall become a
right of such Member to receive, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to
the amount set forth opposite such Members name on the Closing Statement. The
cancellation of an award of Restricted Units as provided in the second
sentence of this _Section 2.7(b)_ shall be deemed the termination, and
satisfaction in full, of any and all rights the holder had or may have had in
respect of such Restricted Units other than the right to receive the payment
contemplated in the immediately preceding sentences. The Company (including,
as applicable, the board of managers of the Company) shall take all necessary
actions to provide that, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each Profit Interest Unit and each Restricted Unit shall become vested
without further action by the holder of such Company Unit.

 



 

(c) _Effect on Company Warrants_. Neither the Purchaser nor the Surviving
Company shall assume any Company Warrants in connection with the Merger. At
the Effective Time, each Company Warrant outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, without any action on the part of the Purchaser, Merger
Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into
Company Units in accordance with its terms, and such Company Units shall be
deemed to be outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and, in
accordance with _Section 2.7(a)(i)_, shall become a right of such Member to
receive, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the amount set forth
opposite such Members name on the Closing Statement, which amount shall
reflect a reduction for the applicable Warrant Exercise Price. The
cancellation of a Company Warrant as provided in the second sentence of this
_Section 2.7(c)_ shall be deemed the termination, and satisfaction in full
of, any and all rights the holder had or may have had in respect of such
Company Warrants other than the right to receive the payment contemplated in
the immediately preceding sentence.

 



 

(d) _Effect on Treasury Units_. Each Company Unit held in the treasury of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
extinguished at the Effective Time without any conversion thereof and no
payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

 



 

(e) _Effect on Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each unit of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable unit
of the Surviving Company, as a result of which, 100% of the issued and
outstanding equity interests of the Surviving Company shall be owned by the
Purchaser. Each certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any units
shall continue to evidence ownership of such units of the Surviving Company.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.8 _Paying Agent_. As promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall appoint the Paying Agent to act as paying agent
for the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Article
II_ and, in connection therewith, shall enter into an agreement with the
Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser and the Company;
_provided_ , that, the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to finalize
and execute the Paying Agent agreement as promptly as practicable following
the date of this Agreement and the Company shall provide to the Purchaser a
full mark-up of the form of Paying Agent agreement within two (2) Business
Days following the date of this Agreement and the Purchaser shall have until
the later of (i) two (2) Business Days following the delivery of such mark-up

Business Day period to respond to any subsequent revisions to the Paying Agent
agreement, and if the Company has further comments, each party shall have

the other party to the Paying Agent agreement. The parties shall use good
faith efforts to promptly respond to any request by the Paying Agent for
confirmation of provision of information for inclusion into the Paying Agent
agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Paying Agent agreement shall be
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser. At or prior to
the Closing, the Purchaser shall deposit an amount in cash equal to the
Closing Total Consideration into an account with the Paying Agent (the "
**Payment Fund** ") and, upon such deposit, the Purchaser shall be deemed to
have satisfied its obligation to pay the Per Unit Closing Consideration and
shall in no event have any liability to any holder of Company Units for the
payment of the Per Unit Closing Consideration other than with respect to the
Purchasers continuing obligation to enforce its rights under the agreement
with the Paying Agent to ensure that the Per Unit Closing Consideration is
paid to holders of Company Units in accordance with this _Article II_.

and the Purchaser shall review and respond to such draft of the Letter of

prior to the third (3rd) Business Day after receipt of such request, to any
request by the Paying Agent for confirmation of, or provision of, information
for inclusion into the Letter of Transmittal and any Exchange Documents and
any other documents including, but not limited to, IRS Forms W-8BEN or W-9, as
applicable, that the Paying Agent may reasonably require in order to effect
the exchange (together with the Letter of Transmittal, the " **Exchange
Documents** "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Letter of Transmittal and
Exchange Documents shall be in

 



      
 

 



 

form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser. The Paying Agent
shall mail the Exchange Documents to the address set forth opposite each
Members name on the Closing Statement. Each Member shall transfer such book-
entry Company Units (including all Company Units to be issued upon the vesting
of Restricted Units and all Company Units to be issued upon the exercise

returning, either prior to or following the Closing, to the Paying Agent duly
completed and validly executed Exchange Documents and shall return to the
Paying Agent the original certificate, to the extent in their possession,
representing any certificated Company Units owned by such Member, if any. Upon
acceptance of the Exchange Documents, such Member shall be entitled to
receive, for each Company Unit, the Per Unit Closing Consideration. Until so
transferred, each certificate outstanding after the Effective Time will be
deemed, for all purposes thereafter, to evidence only the right to receive the
cash consideration pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. No interest will
be paid or will accrue on the Per Unit Closing Consideration payable to any
Member. The Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Paying Agent to pay the Per Unit Closing Consideration to each Member promptly
following the later of (i) the Closing or (ii) the date such Member delivers
to the Paying Agent duly completed and validly executed Exchange Documents and
any original certificate, to the extent in their possession, representing any
certificated Company Units owned by such Member, if any. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in connection with any Final Closing Total Consideration payable to
(i) Tennman Brands, LLC with respect to any Profit Interest Units issued to
Tennman Brands, LLC pursuant to that certain Agreement, dated as of September
26, 2016, between the Company and Tennman Brands, LLC (the " **TB Agreement**
"), (ii) Rich Yorn with respect to Rich Yorn pursuant to that certain Award
Agreement, dated as of September 26, 2016, between the Company and Rich Yorn
(the " **Yorn Agreement** ") and (iii) David Lande of Ziffren Brittenham LLP
(together with Tennman Brands, LLC and Rich Yorn, the " **Tennman Parties** ")
pursuant to that certain Award Agreement, dated as of September 26, 2016,
between the Company and David Lande of Ziffren Brittenham LLP (such agreement,
together with the Yorn Agreement and the Tennman Agreement, the " **Tennman
Agreements** "), such portion of the Closing Total Consideration or Aggregate
Consideration Surplus payable to any of the Tennman Parties with respect to
any Accelerated Equity (as defined in the applicable Tennman Agreements) shall
be placed in an escrow account in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Tennman Agreements (any agreement(s) with respect to such escrow account shall
be provided to the Purchaser for its review and comment prior to finalization,
and any such final agreement(s) shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Purchaser).

 



 

(b) _Transfer of Ownership_. If any transfer of ownership of Company Units
(including all Company Units to be issued upon the vesting of Restricted Units
and all Company Units to be issued upon the exercise (including the deemed
exercise) of Company Warrants) is not registered in the books or ledger of the
Company, or if any portion of the cash amounts are to be disbursed pursuant to
_Section 2.7_ to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Company
Units (including all Company Units to be issued upon the vesting of Restricted
Units and all Company Units to be issued upon the exercise (including the
deemed exercise) of Company Warrants) are registered in the books or ledger of
the Company, it will be a condition of the payment or delivery thereof that
such Company Units shall be properly transferred (in each case, accompanied by
all documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent) and that the Person
requesting such exchange will have paid to the Paying Agent or the Purchaser
or any agent designated by them any transfer or other Taxes required by reason
of the payment of cash

 



      
 

 



 

amounts in exchange of Company Units (without interest) in any name other than
that of the registered holder of such Company Units or established to the
satisfaction of the Purchaser or any agent designated by it that such Tax has
been paid or is not payable.

 



 

(c) _No Liability_. Any portion of the Closing Total Consideration held by the
Paying Agent, the Purchaser or the Company which remains undistributed to the
former Members after the one (1) year anniversary of the Effective Time shall,
at the request of the Purchaser, be delivered to the Purchaser, and any such
Members shall thereafter look only to the Purchaser, but only as a general
creditor thereof, for payment hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , until the
remaining Payment Fund is delivered to the Purchaser, any Members remedy for
any claim for any portion of such undistributed funds shall be against the
Paying Agent and not against the Surviving Company or the Purchaser and the
Surviving Company and the Purchaser shall not have any liability for such
undistributed funds prior to delivery of such funds to the Purchaser from the
Paying Agent other than with respect to the Purchasers continuing obligation
to enforce its rights under the agreement with the Paying Agent to ensure that
the Per Unit Closing Consideration is paid to holders of Company Units in
accordance with _Article II_. If any payment hereunder with respect to
Company Units (including all Company Units to be issued upon the vesting of
Restricted Units and all Company Units to be issued upon the exercise
(including the deemed exercise) of Company Warrants) has not been claimed
prior to five (5) years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such
earlier date on which the corresponding portion of the Closing Total
Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority), any cash payable in respect of such Company Units
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Purchaser, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
2.9_, neither the Paying Agent, nor the Surviving Company or the Purchaser,
nor any other party hereto shall be liable to a former Member for any amount
properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

 



 

(d) _No Further Rights in Company Units_. Subject to the payment of the
Closing Total Consideration, the Aggregate Consideration Deficit (if any) and
the aggregate Escrow Distribution Funds (if any) to the Paying Agent, the
Members shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to their Company Units (including all Company Units to be issued
upon the vesting of Restricted Units and all Company Units to be issued upon
the exercise (including the deemed exercise) of Company Warrants), and there
shall be no further registration of transfer on the records of the Surviving
Company of Company Units. If, after the Effective Time, non-certificated
Company Units represented by book entry are presented to the Surviving Company
for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
_Section 2.9_.

of its reasonable consent to the form of such notice, the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to deliver such notice to all the Members within
five (5) Business Days of such consent.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Closing, upon receipt of the Founder Approval and Member
Consents representing the Required Approvals, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be treated as an "Approved Sale" pursuant to Section 3.05
of the Operating Agreement and the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to exercise and fully enforce the Drag Along Rights with
respect to the Company Units as provided pursuant to the terms of Section 3.05
of the Operating Agreement by giving timely written notice to each holder of
Company Units party thereto and complying with all other applicable provisions
therein (such notice, and the notices required to be delivered by the Company

necessary under the Operating Agreement to enforce the Drag Along Rights in
order to cause each Member that does not deliver a Member Consent to adopt
this Agreement as part of the Required Approvals to execute and deliver a
Letter of Transmittal (if any) and Member Consent and transfer such Company
Units represented by book entry in accordance with _Section 2.9_.

 



 

(e) The Member Notices, including any amendments or supplements thereto, shall
be subject to prior reasonable review and comment by the Purchaser which
comments the Company shall consider in good faith.

Agent) to the accounts specified by the Escrow Agent;

 



 

(v) pay, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Member

payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amount as is
required to be deducted or withheld pursuant to any provision of applicable
Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to
the appropriate Tax Authority, the amount so deducted or withheld shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
recipient in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. The
parties shall cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the
imposition of any such required deduction or withholding.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser will prepare, or
cause to be prepared, and deliver to the Member Representative (i) an
unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the Reference Time (the " **Closing Balance Sheet** ") and (ii) an unaudited
statement (such statement, together with the Closing Balance Sheet, the "
**Adjustment Statement** "), which shall set forth the Purchasers good faith
calculation of, certified by a senior executive officer of the Purchaser and
measured as of the Reference Time: (i) the aggregate amount of the
Indebtedness; (ii) the Transaction Expenses; (iii) the unpaid portion of the
2016 Bonus Amount; (iv) the Cash; (v) the Working Capital (the " **Closing
Working Capital Amount** ") and the corresponding Closing Working Capital
Adjustment Amount; and (vi) the resulting calculation of the Closing Total
Consideration (such calculation of the Closing Total Consideration, the "
**Adjusted Closing Total Consideration** "). The Adjustment Statement will be
prepared, and the Adjusted Closing Total Consideration and all components
therein will be determined, in a manner consistent with the definitions set
forth herein based on the Companys books and records and other information
available at the time, and as calculated using the Accounting Principles (
_provided_ , that for, the avoidance of doubt, the Adjustment Statement (i)
shall be based exclusively on the facts and circumstances as they exist as of
the Reference Time and (ii) shall entirely disregard (x) any and all effects
on the Company and its Subsidiaries (including the assets and liabilities of
the Company and its Subsidiaries) as a

 



      
 

 



 

result of the Proposed Transaction (for the avoidance of doubt, other than
with respect to the calculation of the Transaction Expenses included in the
Adjusted Closing Total Consideration) or of any financing or refinancing
arrangements entered into at any time by the Purchaser or any other
transaction entered into by the Purchaser in connection with the consummation
of the Proposed Transaction, and (y) any of the plans, transactions, fundings,
payments or changes which the Purchaser initiates or makes or causes to be
initiated or made on or after the Closing with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries or their business or assets, or any facts or circumstances that
are unique or particular to the Purchaser or any of its assets or
liabilities). For the avoidance of doubt, the calculations pursuant to this
_Section 3.3_ are solely to measure differences between the Closing Total
Consideration and the Adjusted Closing Total Consideration, and are not
intended to permit the introduction of new accounting methodologies,
principles, conventions, policies and procedures. If the Purchaser fails to
timely prepare and deliver the Adjustment Statement, then, at the election of
the Member Representative, the Closing Total Consideration shall be final and
binding upon and not appealable or subject to further review by the parties.

 



 

(b) Upon receipt from the Purchaser, the Member Representative shall have 30
days to review the Adjustment Statement (the " **Review Period** ");
_provided_ that the Member Representative has had at least ten (10) days to
review any papers or documents reasonably requested by the Member
Representative or its Representatives prior to the tenth (10th) day of the
Review Period; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event that the Purchaser
does not, or does not cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, make
available to the Member Representative and its Representatives documents,
information or personnel pursuant to this _Section 3.3(b)_ prior to the
twentieth (20th) day of the Review Period, the Review Period shall be extended
by one (1) day for each additional day required for the Purchaser, the Company
and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to fully respond to such request. At the
Member Representatives request, the Purchaser (i) shall reasonably cooperate
and assist, and shall cause its representatives to assist, the Member
Representative and its representatives in the review of the Adjustment
Statement and (ii) shall provide the Member Representative and its
representatives with any information reasonably requested by them in
connection with their review of the Adjustment Statement. If the Member
Representative disagrees with the Purchasers computation of the Adjusted
Closing Total Consideration (or any component thereof), the Member
Representative shall, on or prior to the last day of the Review Period,
deliver a written notice to the Purchaser (the " **Notice of Objection** "),
which sets forth its specific objections to the Purchasers calculation of the
Adjusted Closing Total Consideration and any component thereof; _provided_
that the Notice of Objection shall include only objections based on (A) non-
compliance with the standards set forth in this Agreement (including in the
definition of Working Capital for the calculation of the Adjusted Closing
Total Consideration (or any component thereof) and (B) mathematical errors in
the computation of the Adjusted Closing Total Consideration (or any component
thereof). Any Notice of Objection shall specify those items or amounts with
which the Member Representative disagrees, together with a reasonably detailed
written explanation of the reasons for disagreement with each such item or
amount, and, to the extent reasonably calculable, shall set forth the Member
Representatives calculation of the Adjusted Closing Total Consideration (and
all components thereof) based on such objections. To the extent not
specifically set forth in a Notice of Objection delivered during the Review
Period, the Member Representative and the members of the Company shall be
deemed to have agreed with the Purchasers calculation of all

 



      
 

 



 

other items and amounts contained in the Adjustment Statement and neither
party may thereafter dispute any item or amount not set forth in the Notice of
Objection.

 



 

(c) Unless the Member Representative delivers the Notice of Objection to the
Purchaser within the Review Period, the Member Representative and the members
of the Company shall be deemed to have accepted the Purchasers calculation of
the Adjusted Closing Total Consideration (and the components thereof) and the
Adjustment Statement shall be final, conclusive and binding from and after the
conclusion of the Review Period (as may be extended pursuant to this _Section
3.3_). If the Member Representative delivers the Notice of Objection to the
Purchaser within the Review Period, the Purchaser and the Member
Representative shall, during the 20 days following such delivery or any
mutually agreed extension thereof, use their commercially reasonable efforts
to reach agreement on the disputed items and amounts in order to determine the
amount of the Adjusted Closing Total Consideration and all such discussions
will (unless otherwise agreed by the Purchaser and the Member Representative)
be governed by Rule 408 of the United States Federal Rules of Evidence. If, at
the end of such period or any mutually agreed extension thereof, the Purchaser
and the Member Representative are unable to resolve their disagreements, they
shall jointly retain and refer their disagreements to the Independent Expert.
The Purchaser and the Member Representative shall instruct the Independent
Expert promptly to review this _Section 3.3_ and to determine solely with
respect to the disputed items and amounts so submitted whether and to what
extent, if any, the Adjusted Closing Total Consideration set forth in the
Adjustment Statement requires adjustment. The Independent Expert shall base
its determination solely on written submissions by the Purchaser and the
Member Representative and not on an independent review. Neither the Member
Representative nor the Purchaser may have _ex parte_ conversations or meetings
with the Independent Expert (other than conversations or meetings solely
involving the submission of a request for documents or information by the
Independent Expert to such party) without the prior consent of the other
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Neither the
Purchaser nor the Member Representative will disclose to the Independent
Expert, and the Independent Expert will not consider for any purpose, any
settlement discussions or settlement offer made by or on behalf of the
Purchaser or the Member Representative, unless otherwise agreed by the
Purchaser and the Member Representative. As promptly as practicable, but in no
event later than 30 days after its retention, the Independent Expert shall
deliver to the Purchaser and the Member Representative a written report which
sets forth its resolution of the disputed items and amounts and its
calculation of the Adjusted Closing Total Consideration; _provided_ that the
Independent Expert may not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest
value for such item claimed by either party. Each of the Purchaser and the
Member Representative shall be provided copies of all materials provided by
the other to the Independent Expert in connection with the determination
process concurrently with the delivery of such materials of the Independent
Expert (subject, in the case of accountants working papers, to the execution
of a customary work paper access agreement). The Independent Expert shall have
exclusive jurisdiction over, and resort to the Independent Expert as provided
in this _Section 3.3_ shall be the only recourse and remedy of the parties
against one another with respect to, any disputes arising out of or relating
to the adjustments pursuant to this _Section 3.3_. The decision of the
Independent Expert shall be final, conclusive and binding on and not
appealable or subject to further review by the parties (absent manifest error
or fraud). The costs and expenses of the Independent Expert shall be allocated
between the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Member Representative, on the
other hand,

 



      
 

 



 

based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not
awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested by such party, as
determined by the Independent Expert. The Purchaser and the Member
Representative agree to execute, if requested by the Independent Expert, a
commercially reasonable engagement letter, including customary indemnities in
favor of the Independent Expert.

 



 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " **Final Closing Total
Consideration** " means the Adjusted Closing Total Consideration (x) as shown
in the Adjustment Statement delivered by the Purchaser to the Member
Representative pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)_, if no Notice of Objection with
respect thereto is timely delivered by the Member Representative to the
Purchaser or (y) if a Notice of Objection is so delivered, (A) as agreed by
the Purchaser and the Member Representative pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_ or
(B) in the absence of such agreement, as shown in the Independent Experts
report delivered pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_ and (ii) the " **Final Closing
Statement** " shall mean (x) the Adjustment Statement delivered by the
Purchaser to the Member Representative pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)_, if no
Notice of Objection with respect thereto is timely delivered by the Member
Representative to the Purchaser or (y) if a Notice of Objection is so
delivered, (A) as agreed by the Purchaser and the Member Representative
pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_ or (B) in the absence of such agreement, as
shown in the Independent Experts report delivered pursuant to _Section
3.3(c)_. Within three (3) Business Days after the Final Closing Total
Consideration has been finally determined pursuant to this _Section 3.3(d)_ :

 



 

(i) if the Final Closing Total Consideration is less than the Closing Total
Consideration set forth in the Closing Statement (such amount, the "
**Aggregate Consideration Deficit** "), then the Member Representative and the
Purchaser shall execute and cause a Joint Instruction (as defined in the
Escrow Agreement) to be delivered to the Escrow Agent, which Joint Instruction
shall direct the Escrow Agent to make a payment out of the Escrow Fund to the
Purchaser in an amount equal to the Aggregate Consideration Deficit; or

 



 

(ii) if the Final Closing Total Consideration is greater than the Closing
Total Consideration set forth in the Closing Statement (such amount, the "
**Aggregate Consideration Surplus** "), then:

 



 

(A) the Purchaser shall deposit an amount in cash equal to the Aggregate
Consideration Surplus into an account with the Paying Agent (the "
**Additional Consideration Payment Fund** ") and, upon such deposit, the
Purchaser shall be deemed to have satisfied its obligation to pay the
Aggregate Consideration Surplus and shall in no event have any liability to
any party (including any Member) for the payment of the Aggregate
Consideration Surplus other than with respect to the Purchasers continuing
obligation to enforce its rights under the agreement with the Paying Agent to
ensure that the applicable portion of the Aggregate Consideration Surplus is
paid to holders of Company Units in accordance with _Article II_; and

 



 

(B) the Member Representative shall (1) deliver to the Paying Agent a schedule
with respect to the payment of the Per Unit

 



       
 

 



 

Consideration Surplus to the holders of the Company Units and (2) instruct the
Paying Agent to, upon receipt of the Aggregate Consideration Surplus from the
Purchaser, pay to each holder of Company Units (in accordance with the payment
instructions set forth in the Letter of Transmittal previously submitted by
such holder of Company Units (unless such holder of Company Units shall have
previously provided updated payment instructions)) their respective portion of
the Aggregate Consideration Surplus as set forth on the schedule delivered by
the Member Representative pursuant to this _Section 3.3(d)(ii)(B)_ (which
payment shall be deemed to satisfy such holder of Company Units rights to
receive the Per Unit Consideration Surplus other than with respect to the
Purchasers continuing obligation to enforce its rights under the agreement
with the Paying Agent to ensure that the Per Unit Consideration Surplus is
paid to holders of Company Units in accordance with _Article II_). No
interest will be paid or will accrue on any payment to be made under this
_Section 3.3(d)(ii)(B)_.

 



 

(e) Any rights accruing to a party under this _Section 3.3_ shall be in
addition to and independent of the rights to indemnification under _Article
IX_. Any payments made to any party under this _Section 3.3_ shall not be
subject to or be included in any calculations made in respect of, or subject
to any limitations set forth in, _Section 9.2_ and _Section 9.3_ to the
extent that such payments would be duplicative.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Escrow_.

 



 

(a) At the Closing, the Purchaser and the Member Representative shall enter
into an escrow agreement in form and substance mutually satisfactory to the
Purchaser and the Company subject to any modifications thereto required by the
Escrow Agent or reasonably agreed by the parties in good faith (the " **Escrow
Agreement** "), pursuant to which the Purchaser will deposit an amount equal
to $85,000,000 (the " **Escrow Amount** ") with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.
serving as the escrow agent (the " **Escrow Agent** "). The Escrow Amount
shall be available to the Purchaser to satisfy any amounts owed to the
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement (including (i) payments to be made to the
Purchaser pursuant to _Section 3.3_, (ii) payments to be made to the
Purchaser pursuant to _Article IX_ and (iii) any other payment owed to the
Purchaser under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements).

 



 

(b) In accordance with, and subject to, the provisions of the Escrow
Agreement, (i) on the Escrow Release Date (and on any date after the Escrow
Release Date in which the Remaining Escrow Funds exceed zero), the Purchaser
and the Member Representative shall take all action required by the Escrow
Agreement to cause the Escrow Agent to deposit into an account with the Paying
Agent (the " **Escrow Distribution Funds** ") an amount in cash equal to the
Remaining Escrow Funds. Upon any such deposit of the Escrow Distribution
Funds, the Member Representative shall (1) deliver to the Paying Agent an
allocation schedule (which shall be prepared in accordance with _Section
2.6(b)_) with respect to the payment of the Per Unit Escrow Distribution
Amount to the holders of the Company Units and (2) instruct the Paying Agent
to, upon receipt of the Escrow Distribution Funds from the Escrow Agent and
the allocation schedule from Member Representative, pay to each holder of
Company Units (in

 



      
 

 



 

accordance with the payment instructions set forth in the Letter of
Transmittal previously submitted by such holder of Company Units (unless such
holder of Company Units shall have subsequently provided updated payment
instructions)) their respective portion of the Per Unit Escrow Distribution
Amount as set forth on the allocation schedule (which payments shall be deemed
to satisfy such holder of Company Units rights to receive the Per Unit Escrow
Distribution Amount other than with respect to the Purchasers continuing
obligation to enforce its rights under the agreement with the Paying Agent to
ensure that the Per Unit Escrow Distribution Amount is paid to holders of
Company Units in accordance with _Article II_). No interest will be paid or
will accrue on any payment to be made under this _Section 3.4(b)._

 



 

(c) Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, the parties shall treat
any payments made to the Purchaser from the Escrow Amount as an adjustment to
the consideration payable under this Agreement.

Letter or Financing Agreements with respect to (i) any actual or potential

the Purchaser and Merger Sub are willing and able to (and actually do)

of this Agreement.

Financing Agreements and the consummation of the Debt Financing by the
Purchaser does not and the performance of the Debt Commitment Letter and/or
the Financing Agreements shall not, (i) conflict with or violate any provision
of the Purchasers Governing Documents or (ii) require any consent, approval,
amendment or other modification to Purchasers existing revolving facility,
existing senior unsecured notes and indebtedness of the Purchaser or any
guarantor in a committed or outstanding principal amount in excess of
$100,000,000, each after giving pro forma effect to the Proposed Transactions.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Solvency_. Neither the Purchaser nor Merger Sub is entering into
this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or
future creditors of the Company. Each of the Purchaser and Merger Sub is
Solvent as of the date of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

Assuming (a) that the representations and warranties set forth in _Article
IV_ are true and correct as of the date hereof and as if given on the Closing
Date (disregarding for these purposes any references to "Company Material
Adverse Effect", "materiality" or similar qualification contained in such
representations and warranties) and (b) the satisfaction of the conditions in
_Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_, the Surviving Company, shall, after giving
effect to the Proposed Transaction, including the payment of the aggregate
Closing Total Consideration, the payment of all other amounts required to be
paid in connection with the consummation of the Proposed Transaction and the
payment of all related fees and expenses, be Solvent at the Closing. As used
in this _Section 5.6_, the term " **Solvent** " means, with respect to any
Person on a particular date, that on such date, (a) the sum of the assets, at
a fair valuation of the Purchaser (and, after the Closing, the Surviving
Company) (on a consolidated basis) and each of them (on a stand-alone basis)
shall exceed their debts, (b) each of the Purchaser (and, after the Closing,
the Surviving Company) (on a consolidated basis) and each of them (on a stand-
alone basis) has not incurred and does not intend to incur and does not
believe that it shall incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as
such debts mature and (c) each of the Purchaser (and, after the Closing, the
Surviving Company) (on a consolidated basis) and each of them (on a stand-
alone basis) has sufficient capital and liquidity with which to conduct its
business at the Closing. For purposes of this _Section 5.6_, "debt" means any
liability on a claim and "claim" means any (a) right to payment, whether or
not such a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed,
contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable,
secured or unsecured and (b) any right to an equitable remedy for breach of
performance if such breach gives rise to a payment, whether or not such right
to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured,
unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured or unsecured.

 



 

Section 5.7 _No Ownership of Company Units_. Except for 445,501 Company Units
owned by an Affiliate of the Purchaser, neither the Purchaser nor Merger Sub
owns any amount of Company Units that would cause a Takeover Statute to apply
to this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Ownership; No Prior Activities and Agreements_. Merger Sub is a
Subsidiary of the Purchaser and the Purchaser owns beneficially and of record
all of the outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub. Except for obligations
incurred in connection with its incorporation or organization or the
negotiation and consummation of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, neither the Purchaser nor Merger Sub has incurred any
liability or engaged in any business or activity of any type or kind
whatsoever or entered into any agreement or arrangement with any Person.

 



 

Section 5.9 _No Vote Required_. No vote of the holders of any class or series
of capital stock of the Purchaser is necessary to approve this Agreement or to
consummate the Proposed Transaction. The Purchaser shall deliver, promptly
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement (but in no event more
than six (6) hours after such execution and delivery), evidence of Motts LLP
causing Merger Sub to approve and adopt the Merger, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

party shall make any offer, acceptance or counter-offer to or otherwise engage

of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries) to take or cause to be taken any and all
actions necessary, proper or advisable to avoid, eliminate and resolve any and
all impediments under the HSR Act, any antitrust Law or trade regulation Law
that may be asserted by the FTC, the Antitrust Division of the Department of

Subsidiaries) or of the assets, properties or businesses to be acquired

assets or rights or interests, or their freedom of action with respect to the

indirectly, solicit, initiate, consider, facilitate, encourage or accept or
furnish to any other Person any information with respect to, any other
proposals from any Person relating to any acquisition

 



      
 

 



 

or purchase of all or any of the Company Units or all or any material amount
of the assets of the Company (other than the sale of inventory in the Ordinary
Course of Business). The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions, conversations, negotiations and other
communications with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any of the
foregoing and shall provide prompt written notice to the Purchaser of any
solicitations, discussions, conversations, negotiations and other
communications with any Person, arising after the execution and delivery of

than the sale of inventory in the Ordinary Course of Business), including
copies of any written communications related thereto. At the request of the
Purchaser, the Company shall request that any Person provided with
confidential information related to the Company or its business in connection
with a proposal related to any acquisition or purchase of all or any of the
Company Units or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, shall
request such Person to return or destroy such confidential information.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Confidentiality_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
following the date of this Agreement, regardless of whether this Agreement is
terminated, the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms. In furtherance of the foregoing, subject
to _Section 11.1_, each of the Company, the Purchaser and Merger Sub agree
not to, directly or indirectly, issue or make any statement or communication
to any third party (other than its legal, accounting, and financial advisors
that are bound by confidentiality restrictions) regarding the existence or
subject matter of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the terms of this Agreement, the Closing Total Consideration, any
claim or dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement, or the
interpretation, making, performance, breach or termination hereof and the
reasons therefor) without the consent of the other parties hereto; _provided_
, _however_ , any party may make any public disclosure it believes in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) is required by
applicable Law or pursuant to any listing agreement with or the listing rules
of any national securities exchange or stock or trading market, including
filing a copy of this Agreement (in any such case the party making the
announcement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the
other party in advance as to its form, content and timing including advance
copies of any such proposed disclosure, and the disclosing party shall
reasonably consider comments made with respect thereto by such other party or
its Representatives).

 



 

Section 6.6 _Employees and Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) For a period of at least twelve (12) months following the Closing Date (or
if shorter, during the period of employment), the Purchaser shall provide each
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who is employed as of
immediately prior to the Closing (each a " **Company Employee** " and,
collectively, the " **Company Employees** "), for such time within such twelve
(12) month period as the Company Employee remains employed by the Purchaser,
the Company or any of their Affiliates, with (i) a base salary or hourly base
wage rate and a cash bonus opportunity that are, in the aggregate with respect
to each such Company Employee, at least equal to the base salary or hourly
wage rate and cash bonus opportunity provided to the Company Employee
immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) other employee benefits that are, in
the aggregate with respect to each such Company Employee, no less favorable
than the employee benefits provided to the Company Employee immediately prior
to

 



      
 

 



 

the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 6.6(a)_
shall limit the right of the Company, the Purchaser or their affiliates, and
the Company, the Purchaser or their affiliates (as applicable) shall have the
right, terminate the employment of any Company Employee for any reason
following the Closing.

 



 

(b) The Company shall not take any action prior to the Closing that would
require the Purchaser and its Affiliates (including, following the Closing,
the Company and its Subsidiaries) to pay to any Company Employee (pursuant to
the terms of an applicable Benefit Plan or otherwise) any annual cash bonus or
other cash incentive compensation with respect to the 2017 fiscal year ("
**2017 Bonuses** ") that exceeds the aggregate amount of all annual cash bonus
or other cash incentive compensation actually paid, including the employers
portion of any employment Taxes, to such Company Employee with respect to the
2016 fiscal year (" **2016 Bonuses** "), and to the extent that the Company
takes any such action prior to the Closing, the actual amount of any such
excess bonus payment that is actually paid (less the value of any
corresponding deduction for Taxes as determined by Purchaser in good faith
after consultation with the Member Representative) shall be deemed to be a
Transaction Expense. Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement to
the contrary, the Company may, prior to the Closing with the prior written
consent of the Purchaser, (i) set annual bonus target amounts for Company
Employees relating to 2017 Bonuses that are no greater than the annual bonus
target amounts set for such Company Employees in respect of 2016 Bonuses (or
for any newly hired Company Employee not eligible for a 2016 Bonus, in an
amount no greater than that set for similarly situated Company Employees) and
(ii) set performance goals relating to 2017 Bonuses that are substantially
similar to the performance goals set with respect to 2016 Bonuses, and to the
extent that the achievement of such performance goals, as determined by the
Purchaser, results in 2017 Bonuses that exceed 2016 Bonuses with respect to
any Company Employee, such excess amount shall not be deemed to be a
Transaction Expense.

 



 

(c) The Purchaser shall provide each Company Employee with full credit for
such Company Employees service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective predecessors prior to the Closing for all purposes, including
for purposes of eligibility, vesting and determination of the level of
benefits (but not for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit
pension plan) under any benefit plan sponsored or maintained by the Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates in which such Company Employee is eligible to
participate on or following the Closing Date (each, a " **Purchaser Plan** ");
provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent
that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. With respect
to each Purchaser Plan that is a health or welfare plan, the Purchaser shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) waive any limitation on health and
welfare coverage of such Company Employees due to pre-existing conditions,
waiting periods, active employment requirements and requirements to show
evidence of good health and (ii) credit each such Company Employee with all
deductible payments, co-payments and co-insurance paid by such Company
Employee under any Benefit Plan prior to the Closing during the year in which
the Closing occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to which any such
Company Employee has satisfied any applicable deductible and whether such
Company Employee has reached the out-of-pocket maximum for such year.

 



 

(d) Nothing in this _Section 6.6_ shall be treated as an amendment of, or
undertaking to amend, any Benefit Plan or any other benefit plan, program,
agreement or

 



      
 

 



 

arrangement. The provisions of this _Section 6.6_ are solely for the benefit
of the respective parties to this Agreement and nothing in this _Section
6.6_, express or implied, shall confer upon any Company Employee, or legal
representative or beneficiary thereof or any other Person, any rights or
remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment for any
specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever
under this Agreement or a right in any employee or beneficiary thereof or
other Person under a Benefit Plan that such employee or beneficiary or other
Person would not otherwise have under the terms of that Benefit Plan.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Access to Properties, Notification; Books and Records_.

 



 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of termination of this
Agreement or the Closing, the Company shall give the Purchaser reasonable
access, during normal business hours and after reasonable advance written
notice, to all properties, books, records and key management personnel of or
pertaining to the Company as the Purchaser may reasonably request; _provided_
, _however_ , that (a) the foregoing shall not either (i) materially interfere
with the day-to-day operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a
risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or (ii) include any sampling or testing for or regarding any
environmental matters without the Companys prior written consent, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (b) the Company may
restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the
extent that (i) any applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or
otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information; (ii) access to
such documents or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving
any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other privilege
applicable to such documents or information; (iii) access would result in the
disclosure of any trade secrets of third Persons or (iv) such documents or
information are reasonably pertinent to any adverse legal proceeding between
the Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Purchaser and its
Affiliates, on the other hand. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
Section 6.19(d) of this Agreement, nothing in this _Section 6.7_ will be
construed to require the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives to prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals,
opinions or other information. Any access to the properties of the Company and
its Subsidiaries will be subject to the Companys reasonable security measures
and insurance requirements and will not include the right to perform invasive
testing. Any information disclosed shall be subject to the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement. In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between

(provided that the Purchaser may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
which had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, or
otherwise so long as such amendment does not (w) reduce the aggregate amount
of the committed financing from that contemplated in the Debt Commitment
Letter (except to the extent that such reduction does not impair the
Purchasers ability to pay the amounts due hereunder), (x) impose new or
additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner that would
adversely impact in any material respect the ability of the Purchaser and
Merger Sub to obtain the Debt Financing (including by making any such
conditions or other contingencies less likely to be satisfied) or (y) amend
other terms in the case of this clause (y) in a manner that would otherwise
materially adversely impact the ability of the Purchaser to timely consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby); (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to the Purchaser to obtaining the Debt Financing set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter that are within its control (including by
paying any commitment, engagement, or placement or other fees that become due

with respect to, alternative financing from the same or alternative sources
(the " **Alternative Financing** "), on terms not less favorable, in any
material respect, with respect to conditionality and enforceability, when
taken as a whole, than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter to the
Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Company, in an amount sufficient to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or replace any unavailable
portion of the Debt Financing), and to obtain a new financing commitment
letter (including any associated engagement letter and related fee letter)
with respect to such Alternative Financing (collectively, the " **New Debt
Commitment Letter** "), copies of which shall be promptly provided to the
Company (with customary redactions with respect to the fee letter). In the
event any Alternative Financing is obtained and a New Debt Commitment Letter
is entered into in accordance with this _Section 6.19(b)_, (i) any reference
in this Agreement to "Debt Financing" or the "Financing" shall mean the debt
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to
clause (ii) below, and (ii) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt
Commitment Letter" (or defined terms that use such phrase) shall be deemed to
include the Debt Commitment Letter (and any related Fee Letter) to the extent

the case may be, at the time in question and any New Debt Commitment Letter
(and any related new Fee Letter) to the extent then in effect.

becomes aware, (B) of the receipt or delivery of any notice or other
communication, in each case from any Person with respect to (x) any actual or
potential breach of any provisions of the Debt Commitment Letters or Financing
Agreements by the Purchaser or Merger Sub, or any default, termination or
repudiation by any party to any of Debt Commitment Letter or Financing
Agreements or other agreements relating to the Debt Financing or (y) any
dispute or disagreement between or among parties to any of the Debt Commitment
Letter or Financing Agreements with respect to the obligation to fund the Debt
Financing or the amount of the Debt Financing to be funded at the Closing and
(C) if at any time for any reason the Purchaser believes that it will not be
able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions, in the manner or from the sources, contemplated by any of the Debt
Commitment Letter or Financing Agreements

 



      
 

 



 

or will be unable to obtain Alternative Financing. The Purchaser shall

attorney granted by each Member to the Member Representative and the other
powers, immunities and rights to indemnification granted to the Representative
Group hereunder shall be (i) deemed coupled with an interest and all authority
conferred hereby shall be irrevocable whether by death or incapacity of any
such Member or the occurrence of any other event or events and shall be
binding on any

 



      
 

 



 

successor thereto, and (ii) shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any
Member of the whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in the Escrow
Fund. All actions taken by the Member Representative under this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement or the Representative Engagement Agreement shall be binding
upon each Member and such Members successors as if expressly confirmed and
ratified in writing by such Member, and all defenses which may be available to
any Member to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the Member
Representative taken in good faith under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
or the Member Representative Engagement Agreement are waived.

 



 

(b) The Member Representative may resign at any time, and may be removed or
replaced by the vote of the Advisory Group and providing prompt written notice
to the Purchaser. The immunities and rights to indemnification shall survive
the resignation or removal of the Member Representative or any member of the
Advisory Group and the Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement. Certain Members have entered into an engagement
agreement (the " **Representative Engagement Agreement** ") with the Member
Representative to provide direction to the Member Representative in connection
with its services under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the
Representative Engagement Agreement (such Members, including their individual
representatives, collectively hereinafter referred to as the " **Advisory
Group** "). Neither the Member Representative nor its members, managers,
directors, officers, contractors, agents and employees nor any member of the
Advisory Group (collectively, the " **Representative Group** "), shall be
liable to any Member for any action or failure to act in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Member Representatives responsibilities
hereunder, under the Escrow Agreement or under the Representative Engagement
Agreement, unless and only to the extent such action or failure to act
constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Members shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Representative Group from and against
any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, costs, expenses
(including reasonable and documented fees, disbursements and costs of counsel
and other skilled professionals and in connection with seeking recovery from
insurers), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement (collectively, the "
**Representative Expenses**") incurred without gross negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of the Member Representative and arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties hereunder,
under the Escrow Agreement or under the Representative Engagement Agreement;
_provided_ , that in the event it is finally adjudicated that a Representative
Expense or any portion thereof was primarily caused by the gross negligence,
willful misconduct or bad faith of the Member Representative, the Member
Representative will reimburse the Members the amount of such indemnified
Representative Expense attributable to such gross negligence, willful
misconduct or bad faith. Such Representative Expenses may be recovered first,
from the Expense Fund, second, from any distribution of the Escrow Fund
otherwise distributable to the Members at the time of distribution, and third,
directly from the Members.

 



 

(c) The Members acknowledge that the Member Representative shall not be
required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial
liability in the exercise or performance of any of its powers, rights, duties
or privileges or pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Furthermore, the Member
Representative shall not be required to take any action unless the Member
Representative has been provided with funds, security or indemnities which, in
its determination, are sufficient to protect the Member Representative against
the costs, expenses and liabilities

 



      
 

 



 

which may be incurred by the Member Representative in performing such actions.
The Member Representative shall be entitled to: (i) rely upon the Closing
Statement, (ii) rely upon any signature believed by it to be genuine, and
(iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has proper authorization to sign on
behalf of the applicable Member or other party.

 



 

(d) Upon the Closing, Purchaser shall wire to the Member Representative
USD$200,000 (the " **Expense Fund Amount** "). The Expense Fund Amount shall
be held by the Member Representative in the Expense Fund. The Member
Representative is not providing any investment supervision, recommendations or
advice and shall have no responsibility or liability for any loss of principal
of the Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Member Representative is not acting as a withholding agent or
in any similar capacity in connection with the Expense Fund, and has no tax
reporting or income distribution obligations. The Members will not receive any
interest on the Expense Fund and assign to the Member Representative any such
interest. Subject to Advisory Group approval, the Member Representative may
contribute funds to the Expense Fund from any consideration otherwise
distributable to the Members from the Escrow Fund otherwise distributable to
the Members at the time of distribution. As soon as reasonably determined by
the Member Representative that the Expense Fund is no longer required to be
withheld, the Member Representative shall distribute the remaining Expense
Fund (if any) to the Escrow Agent for further distribution to the Members to
be distributed to the Members based on the percentage of such Members portion
of the Expense Fund as set forth on the Closing Statement.

 



 

(e) Neither the Purchaser nor, following the Closing, the Surviving Company,
shall have any liability to, any obligation to indemnify, or pay any costs or
expenses of the Member Representative and shall have no obligation to pay or
fund the Expense Fund other than the Expense Fund Amount to be paid at the
Closing.

 



 

Section 6.21 _Representation and Warranty Insurance_

 



 

(a) The Company agrees that following the date of this Agreement, until the
earlier of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms or
the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do or cause to be done, all things
reasonably necessary to assist the Purchaser, including by making available
due diligence material reasonably requested by the Purchaser or its
Representatives, in obtaining an insurance policy or policies, to be issued at
or prior to the Closing by an insurance carrier selected by the Purchaser
(which insurance carrier shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company) in the
name and for the benefit of the Purchaser Indemnitees, covering certain
potential Losses for which any Purchaser Indemnitee may be entitled to
indemnification pursuant _Section 9.2_, with a policy limit of
USD$133,500,000 (the " **Policy Limit** ") and with retention equal to the
USD$93,500,000 (the " **R andW Insurance Policy**") and the Company shall pay
the cost of the premium and the underwriting fees incurred or to be incurred
in connection with procuring the RandW Insurance Policy, provided, that the
Company shall in no event be liable for any amount in respect of such fees in
excess of USD$3,000,000 and the Purchaser shall be solely liable for any
amounts in excess of USD$3,000,000 (such costs and fees, the " **R andW
Insurance Fees**").

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions reasonably necessary to obtain the
RandW Insurance Policy as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of
this Agreement and to satisfy as promptly as practicable thereafter any
conditions to the issuance and effectiveness of the RandW Insurance Policy;
_provided_ , that, in the event the RandW Insurance Policy is not available on
reasonable and customary terms, the Purchaser shall have no obligation to
obtain such policy.

 **ARTICLE VIII _ 
TERMINATION_**

 



 

Section 8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:

 



 

(a) by either the Company or the Purchaser if the Closing has not occurred by
the six month anniversary of the date hereof (the " **Outside Date** ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this

any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of or has resulted in,
the failure of the Closing to occur by this date;

 



 

(b) by either the Company or the Purchaser in the event that any Governmental
Authority has enacted, issued, enforced or entered into any statute, rule,
regulation, injunction or other order (which the parties hereto shall use all

(c) by the Purchaser if the Company shall have breached in any material
respect any of its representations and warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement, which breach (i) cannot be cured by the Outside
Date and (ii) would result in any of the conditions in _Section 7.2_ not
being satisfied by the Outside Date, _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Purchaser may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)_
if it is then in material breach of any representation, warranty of covenant
contained in this Agreement;

 



 

(d) by the Purchaser if the Company has not delivered to the Purchaser the

within six (6) hours after the execution and delivery of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchasers right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)_ will expire on the earlier of (i)

terminate first arose and (ii) the delivery to the Purchaser of the Founder
Approval and the Member Consents evidencing the Required Approvals;

 



      
 

 



 

(e) by the Company if either the Purchaser or Merger Sub shall have breached
in any material respect any of its representations and warranties, covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach (i) cannot be cured by
the Outside Date and (ii) which would result in any of the conditions in
_Section 7.3_ not being satisfied by the Outside Date, _provided_ , _however_
, that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.1(e)_ if it is then in material breach of any representation, warranty of
covenant contained in this Agreement;

 



 

(f) by the Company if (i) all conditions in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_
have been satisfied or waived (if permissible) in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but each of which is capable of being satisfied at
the date of termination) as of the date of Closing, (ii) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed in writing that all conditions in _Section 7.3_ have
been satisfied or waived (if permissible) in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but each of which is capable of being satisfied at
the date of termination) as of the date of Closing, (iii) the Marketing Period
has ended, (iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed by written notice to the
Purchaser that it is (and the Company in fact is) ready, willing and able to
consummate the Closing during the three (3) Business Day period following the

consummate the Closing on the third (3rd) Business Day following the delivery
of the notice from the Company described in clause (v) of this _Section
8.1(f)_; or

 



 

(g) by the mutual written consent of the Company and the Purchaser.

 



 

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1_
shall give written notice of such termination to the other party in accordance
with _Section 11.5_, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such
termination is effected and such notice shall be effective in accordance with
_Section 11.5_.

 



 

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement under _Section 8.1_ by
written notice to the other parties, this Agreement shall become void and
there shall be no liability on the part of any party to this Agreement except
that (a) nothing in this Agreement shall relieve (x) any party to this
Agreement from liability for any willful or intentional material breach by
such party of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, (y) the Purchaser of
any liability for any material breach of its obligations pursuant to _Section
6.3_ of this Agreement or (z) the Purchaser of any liability or damage to the
Company resulting from a failure by the Purchaser to consummate the Proposed
Transaction if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_ (or
is terminated in another manner at a time when the Agreement could have been
terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_) and (b) _Article XI_ and the
agreements of the Purchaser and the Company contained in _Section 6.5_, this
_Section 8.2_ and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive termination of
the Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, no breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant contained herein or in any certificate delivered pursuant
to this Agreement shall give rise to any right on the part of the Purchaser,
Merger Sub or the Company, after the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Agreement is terminated by
the Purchaser pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ or at a time when the Purchaser
could have terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_, then
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement but without limiting the
right of the Purchaser to an injunction, specific performance or other non-
monetary equitable relief in accordance with _Section 11.3_, the Purchaser
shall have the right to require the Company to pay, and if so elected, the
Company agrees to pay immediately to the Purchaser, as liquidated damages in
connection with such termination, an amount equal to USD$40,000,000 by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Purchaser. The parties acknowledge that (i) the agreements contained in this
_Section 8.2(b)_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement, (ii) the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement
under circumstances where such fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of
accurate calculation and therefore, such fee payable pursuant to this _Section
8.2(b)_ is not a penalty but rather constitutes liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate the Purchaser for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (iii) without the agreements contained in this _Section 8.2(b)_,
the parties would not have entered into this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX _ 
SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION AND REMEDIES_**

 



 

Section 9.1 _Survival_.

 



 

(a) The representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, shall survive the Closing for a period of twelve (12)
months following the Closing Date. Following the expiration of the applicable
survival period in the immediately preceding sentence, such representations
and warranties and any claim for indemnification brought by the Purchaser or
the Member Representative, as applicable, on account thereof shall terminate,
except for pending Claims and pending Purchaser Claims brought on account
thereof prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period, or Claims
resulting from instances of fraud (which shall not be subject to the foregoing
survival periods).

 



 

(b) The covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements shall survive the Closing until 60 days following the expiration of
any applicable statute of limitations; _provided_ , _however_ , that any

for indemnification brought by the Purchaser or the Member Representative, as
applicable, on account thereof shall terminate, except for pending Claims and
pending Purchaser Claims brought on account thereof prior to the expiration of
the applicable survival period, or Claims resulting from instances of fraud
(which shall not be subject to the foregoing survival periods).

 



 

(c) The Specified Indemnities shall survive the Closing for a period of twelve
(12) months following the Closing Date. Following the expiration of the
applicable survival period in the immediately preceding sentence, such
Specified Indemnities and any claim for

 



      
 

 



 

indemnification brought by the Purchaser on account thereof shall terminate,
except for pending Purchaser Claims brought on account thereof prior to the
expiration of the applicable survival period.

 



 

Section 9.2 _Indemnification by the Members_ (a).

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, subject to the limitations set forth herein
(including the provisions of _Section 9.1_), the Members shall indemnify and
defend the Purchaser and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Company) and their respective stockholders, members, managers, officers,
directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns (the " **Purchaser
Indemnitees** ") against, and shall hold them harmless from, any and all
losses, damages, claims (including third party claims), charges, liabilities,
obligations, actions, suits, proceedings, interest, penalties, Taxes, costs
and expenses (including legal, consultant, accounting and other professional
fees, costs of sampling, testing, investigation, removal, treatment and
remediation of contamination and fees and costs incurred in enforcing rights
under this Agreement) (collectively, " **Losses** ") resulting from, arising
out of, or incurred by any Purchaser Indemnitee in connection with, or
otherwise with respect to (i) any inaccuracy or breach of any representation
or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement, any of the Ancillary
Agreements or any certificate or other document furnished or to be furnished
to the Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (without regard and without giving effect to, for the purposes of
determining the amount of any such Losses, any "materiality", "Material
Adverse Effect" or similar qualification, in each case contained in any such
representation or warranty); (ii) any breach by the Company of any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements
(without regard and without giving effect to, for the purposes of determining

similar qualification, in each case contained in any such covenant or
agreement); (iii) any Transaction Expenses; (iv) any Indebtedness of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (v) any Pre-Closing Taxes and any Tax
detriment resulting from any election, effective on or before the Closing
Date, to treat the Company or Littles, LLC as a corporation for U.S. federal
income tax purposes (other than any such election made by or at the direction
of the Purchaser or its Affiliates); (vi) any Liability of the Company to the
holders of the Company Units related to the allocation of the Closing Total
Consideration pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including any claim by

Consideration or that such Person owns or has the right to additional Company
Units (including pursuant to the claims set forth on _Section 4.3(a)_ of the
Disclosure Letter); and (vii) any Action between the Member Representative and
the holders of Company Units or the Paying Agent and the holders of Company
Units related to the transactions contemplated in this Agreement (the matters
set forth in clauses (iii) through (vii) of this _Section 9.2(a)_ the "
**Specified Indemnities** ").

 



 

(b) The Members shall not be liable for any Losses pursuant to _Section
9.2(a)(i)_ (other than Losses related to Fundamental Representations) unless
and until the aggregate amount of all Losses incurred by the Purchaser
Indemnitees under _Section 9.2(a)_ exceeds USD$8,500,000 (the "
**Deductible** "), in which event the Members shall be liable for all Losses
in excess of the Deductible, _provided_ , that Members shall only be liable
for any individual Loss or group of related Losses in excess of USD$50,000 and
if such amount is not exceeded, none of the Losses with respect to such items
or matters shall count towards satisfying

 



      
 

 



 

the Deductible (such Loss or Losses, a " **Qualifying Loss** "). The
cumulative indemnification obligations of the Members under _Section
9.2(a)(i)_ (other than Losses related to Fundamental Representations) shall in
no event exceed USD$85,000,000 (the " **Cap** "). The foregoing limitations
shall not apply in the case of willful breach or fraud and shall not limit the
indemnification otherwise available under other provisions of _Section
9.2(a)_, _provided_ , _however_ , that other than with respect to instances of
fraud (in each case, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), no
Member shall have any liability under this Agreement or otherwise be
responsible for indemnification under this Agreement, including under _Section
9.2(a)_, in excess of a maximum aggregate amount equal to the portion of the
Closing Total Consideration actually received by such Member.

 



 

(c) The right of any Purchaser Indemnitee to indemnification for any
recoverable Losses under this Agreement shall be recovered only as follows;
(i) first from the funds then held in the Escrow Fund, if any, (ii) second,
following the release or exhaustion of the Escrow Fund, from, and in
accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the RandW Insurance
Policy (and, if applicable, any limitations set forth in the RandW Insurance
Policy), to the extent then available and such Losses are recoverable
thereunder, and (iii) third, and solely to the extent that (A) Losses have
been recovered by the Purchaser Indemnitees under the RandW Insurance Policy in
an amount equal to the Policy Limit, (B) the RandW Insurance Policy is not
obtained at the Closing or (C) the Losses at issue are not covered by the
terms of the RandW Insurance Policy, from the Members, severally and not
jointly, to the extent applicable and subject, in each case, to the
limitations set forth in this _Article IX_.

 



 

Section 9.3 _Indemnification by the Purchaser_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, subject to the limitations set forth herein,
the Purchaser shall indemnify and defend the holders of the Company Units and
their respective stockholders, members, managers, officers, directors,
employees, agents, successors and assigns (the " **Company Indemnitees** ")
against, and shall hold them harmless from, any and all Losses resulting from,
arising out of, or incurred by any Company Indemnitee in connection with, or
otherwise with respect to (i) any inaccuracy or breach of any representation
or warranty made by the Purchaser in this Agreement, any of the Ancillary
Agreements or any certificate or other document furnished or to be furnished
to the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (without regard and without giving effect to, for the purposes of
determining the amount of any such Losses, any "materiality", "Material
Adverse Effect" or similar qualification, in each case contained in any such
representation or warranty); and (ii) any breach by the Purchaser of any
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Agreements (without regard and without giving effect to, for the purposes of
determining the amount of any such Losses, any "materiality", "Material
Adverse Effect" or similar qualification, in each case contained in any such
covenant or agreement).

 



 

(b) The Purchaser shall not be liable for any Losses pursuant to _Section
9.3(a)(i)_ unless and until the aggregate amount of all Losses incurred by the
Company Indemnitees under _Section 9.3(a)_ exceeds the Deductible provided
that the Purchaser shall only be liable for Qualifying Losses. The cumulative
indemnification obligations of the Purchaser under _Section 9.3(a)(i)_ shall
in no event exceed the Cap. The foregoing limitations shall not

 



      
 

 



 

apply in the case of willful breach or fraud and shall not limit the
indemnification otherwise available under other provisions of _Section
9.3(a)_.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
claim for indemnification that a Company Indemnitee may have under this
_Article IX_ may only be brought by the Member Representative and not by any
individual holder of Company Units or former member of the Company.

 



 

Section 9.4 _Limitations on Indemnification Payments_.

 



 

(a) The Purchaser Indemnitees right to indemnification pursuant to _Section
9.2(a)_ on account of any Losses shall be reduced by all insurance proceeds
(net of any costs of investigation of the underlying claim and of collection)
actually received by the Purchaser Indemnitees. The Purchaser shall, and shall
cause the Purchaser Indemnitees to, use reasonable efforts to claim and
recover any Losses suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitees under all such
insurance policies. The Purchaser Indemnitees shall remit to the Member
Representative for the benefit of the Members any such insurance proceeds that
are paid to the Purchaser Indemnitees with respect to Losses for which the
Purchaser Indemnitees have been previously compensated pursuant to _Section
9.2(a)_, but only to the extent that the Purchaser Indemnitees remain fully
compensated with respect to all Losses.

 



 

(b) The Purchaser Indemnitees and Company Indemnitees rights to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ and _Section 9.3(a)_ on account
of any Losses shall be reduced by the value of any Tax benefit actually and
currently realized by the respective indemnitees by reason of such Loss, as
determined in good faith by such Indemnitee, taking into account any
offsetting detriment and only taking into account actual and current Tax
benefits realized in the year of such Losses.

 



 

(c) The Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ for exemplary or punitive damages (except to the
extent such damages are actually recovered by a third party against a
Purchaser Indemnitee).

 



 

(d) The Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ for Losses to the extent that any Purchaser
Indemnitee has been compensated therefor pursuant to _Section 3.3_.

 



 

(e) The Purchaser Indemnitees right to indemnification pursuant to _Section
9.2(a)_ on account of any Losses shall be reduced by the amount of any
specific reserve or accrual reflected in the Final Closing Statement.

 



 

(f) No Purchaser Indemnitee shall be entitled to be compensated more than once
for the same Loss.

 



 

(g) Each Purchaser Indemnitee shall take commercially reasonable steps to
mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance that would
reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) No Indemnitor shall be liable under this _Article IX_ for any Losses
based on or arising out of any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the
representations and warranties of such Indemnitor contained in _Article IV_
or _Article V_ of this Agreement if the Indemnitee had actual knowledge of
such inaccuracy or breach at or before the date hereof and failed to disclose
such inaccuracy or breach to the Indemnitor at or before the date hereof;
_provided_ that for the Purchaser to have actual knowledge of an inaccuracy or
breach, an executive officer of the Purchaser must have actual knowledge as of
the date hereof (i) of the facts underlying such breach as of the date hereof
and (ii) that such facts constituted a breach of a specific representation or
warranty set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

(i) The Purchaser Indemnitees shall not have the right to indemnification
under this Agreement for any Losses are based on or relate to Taxes: (1)
resulting from transactions or actions taken by the Purchaser, the Company or
any of their respective Affiliates after the Closing outside of the ordinary
course of business that are not specifically contemplated by this Agreement;
(2) attributable to or arising in any Post-Closing Tax Period or Post-Closing
Straddle Period; or (3) that result in whole or in part from the Purchasers
breach of any of the covenants contained in _Article X_.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 



 

(a) _Indemnification Procedure for Third Party Claims_. In the event that an
Indemnitee receives notice of the assertion of any claim or the commencement
of any Action by a third party in respect of which indemnity may be sought
under the provisions of this _Article IX_ (a " **Third Party Claim** "), the
Indemnitee shall promptly notify the Indemnitor of such Third Party Claim;
_provided_ that the failure or delay in notifying the Indemnitor of such Third
Party Claim will not relieve the Indemnitor of any Liabilities it may have to
the Indemnitee, except and only to the extent that such failure or delay
causes actual harm to the Indemnitor with respect to such Third Party Claim.
The Indemnitee shall have the right, exercisable by written notice to the
Indemnitor within twenty (20) days of delivery of the notice of such Third
Party Claim, and subject to the consent rights of the applicable insurer under
the terms of the RandW Insurance Policy, to defend, conduct and control the
defense of the Third Party Claim (" **Third Party Defense** ") with counsel of
its choice (which counsel must be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitor) at
the expense of the Indemnitor; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnitor
shall have the right, at its expense, to participate in (but not control) such
Third Party Defense. The Indemnitee shall conduct the Third Party Defense
actively and diligently and defend such claim in a manner that is commercially
reasonable, and the Indemnitor will provide reasonable cooperation in the
Third Party Defense. The Indemnitee shall have the right to consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third
Party Claim in any manner and on such terms as it may deem appropriate without
the consent of the Indemnitor so long as such settlement includes, as a
condition to any settlement or other resolution, a complete and irrevocable
release of the Indemnitees from all liability in respect of such Third Party
Claim from the third party claimant; _provided_ , _however_ , the Indemnitee
shall not enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim
without the consent of the Indemnitor (not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) if the amount of such settlement is more than double the amount then
available in the Escrow Fund (without taking into account any other Claims
made against amounts in the Escrow Fund); _provided further_ that the amount
of any settlement made or entry of any judgment consented to by the Indemnitee
without the consent of the Indemnitor

 



      
 

 



 

(not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall not be determinative of the
validity of the claim.

 



 

(b) _Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims_. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Indemnitee has actual knowledge of any claim
that it has under _Section 9.2(a)_ or _Section 9.3(a)_, as the case may be,
that may result in a Loss (a " **Claim** "), the Indemnitee shall give written
notice thereof (a " **Claims Notice** ") to the Indemnitor. The Claim Notice
shall set forth the amount, if known, or, if not known, an estimate of the
foreseeable maximum amount of claimed Losses (which estimate shall not be
conclusive of or limit the final amount of such Losses) and a description of
the basis for such Claim. The Indemnitor will have 30 days from receipt of
such Claim Notice to dispute the Claim (a " **Claims Response** "). If the
Indemnitor does not give notice to the Indemnitee that it disputes such Claim
within 30 days after its receipt of the Claim Notice, the Claim specified in
such Claim Notice will be conclusively deemed a Loss subject to
indemnification hereunder. If the Indemnitor delivers a Claim Response within
the 30 days after its receipt of the Claim Notice indicating that it disputes
one or more of the matters identified in the Claims Notice, then the Purchaser
and the Member Representative shall promptly meet and use their reasonable
efforts to settle the dispute. If the Purchaser and the Member Representative
are unable to reach agreement within thirty (30) days after the delivery of
the Claims Response, then either the Purchaser or the Member Representative
may resort to other legal remedies, subject to the limitations set forth in
this _Article IX_. For all purposes of this _Article IX_ (including those
pertaining to disputes under _Section 9.5(a)_ and this _Section 9.5(b)_),
the Purchaser and the Member Representative shall cooperate with and make
available to the other party and its respective Representatives all
information, records and data, and shall permit reasonable access, during
normal business hours and upon advance written notice, to its facilities and
personnel, as may be reasonably required in connection with the resolution of
such disputes.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Interest on Losses_. Any and all Losses hereunder shall bear
interest from the date incurred until paid at the "prime rate" as published in
_The Wall Street Journal_ , Eastern Edition on the date such Loss was
incurred.

 



 

Section 9.7 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Claims_. Except as otherwise
required by applicable Law, the parties shall treat any indemnification
payment made hereunder as an adjustment to the consideration payable under
this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. The Purchasers and Merger Subs sole and
exclusive remedy (a) for a breach of any representation or warranty made by
the Company herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (b) for a
breach of any covenant made by the Company herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and required to be performed by the Company, shall, in either
case, be limited to (i) prior to the Closing, the Purchasers right to
terminate this Agreement to the extent permitted pursuant to _Article VIII_,
in which case the Company shall not have any liability except to the extent
expressly provided in _Section 8.2_, (ii) following the Closing, except for
those matters resolved pursuant to _Section 3.3_, the indemnification rights
under this _Article IX_ (other than claims of, or causes of action arising
from fraud) or (iii) the Purchasers right to seek a court to order specific
performance of the Companys obligations pursuant to _Section 11.3_.

 



      
 

 

 ** **

 

 **ARTICLE X _ 
TAX MATTERS_**

 



 

Section 10.1 _Transfer Taxes_. The Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Member
Representative (on behalf of the Members), on the other hand, each shall
timely pay, or cause to be timely paid, 50% of all Transfer Taxes incurred in
connection with the consummation of the Proposed Transaction. The Company, the
Purchaser and the Member Representative shall cooperate in the filing of any
Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes.

 



 

Section 10.2 _Filing of Tax Returns_. The Member Representative shall prepare
or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the
Company (including IRS Form 1065) for taxable periods ending on or prior to
the Closing Date and the Purchaser shall prepare all other Tax Returns
required to be filed by the Company or its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date
(including for Straddle Periods)(the Member Representative or the Purchaser,
respectively, with respect to any such Tax Return it prepares or causes to be
prepared, the " **Preparing Party** ," and with respect to any such Tax Return
prepared by the other party, the " **Reviewing Party** "). Any such Tax
Return, for a Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date or any Straddle
Period, shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice and shall
not include any election to be subject to the Revised Partnership Tax Audit
Procedures, including by way of an election under Section 301.9100-22T of the
Treasury Regulations (unless otherwise required by Law). The Preparing Party
shall provide any Tax Return that it prepares or causes to be prepared
(together with schedules, statements and, to the extent requested by the
Reviewing Party, supporting documentation) to the Reviewing Party at least
forty-five (45) days prior to the due date (including extensions) of such Tax
Return. If the Reviewing Party objects to any item on any such Tax Return, it
shall, within ten (10) Business Days after delivery of such Tax Return, notify
the Preparing Party in writing that it so objects, specifying with
particularity any such item and stating the specific factual or legal basis
for any such objection. If a notice of objection shall be duly delivered, the
Preparing Party and the Reviewing Party shall negotiate in good faith and use
their reasonable best efforts to resolve such items. If the Preparing Party
and the Reviewing Party are unable to reach such agreement within ten days
after receipt by the Preparing Party of such notice, the disputed items shall
be resolved by a nationally recognized accounting firm selected by the
Purchaser and reasonably acceptable to the Member Representative (the " **Tax
Referee** ") and any determination by the Tax Referee shall be final. The Tax
Referee shall resolve any disputed items within twenty (20) days of having the
item referred to it pursuant to such procedures as it may require. If the Tax
Referee is unable to resolve any disputed items before the due date for such
Tax Return, the Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by the Preparing Party
and then amended to reflect the Tax Referees resolution. The costs, fees and
expenses of the Tax Referee shall be borne equally by the Purchaser and the
Member Representative (on behalf of the Members). The parties hereby
acknowledge and agree that, except as required by Law, any Tax deductions
arising from (1) expenses paid by the Company in connection with consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (2) the payment of any
Transaction Expenses or amounts that would constitute Transaction Expenses if
unpaid prior to or at the Closing; to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
shall be reported as deductible by the Company in any pre-Closing taxable
period.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 10.3 _Intended Tax Treatment; Allocation of Consideration_.

 



 

(a) It is the intent of the Purchaser, the Company, its Subsidiaries and each
Member that the exchange by the Members of the Company Units for the Merger
Consideration be treated as a taxable sale of partnership interests by such
Members, and an acquisition of assets of the Company by the Purchaser
consistent with Revenue Ruling 99-6.(the intended U.S. federal Income Tax
treatment described in this sentence, the " **Intended Tax Treatment** "), and
no such party shall take any action inconsistent with such intent unless
required by applicable Law. The parties hereto shall prepare all applicable
income Tax Returns and shall take all income Tax positions in a manner
consistent with the Intended Tax Treatment unless otherwise required by
applicable Law.

 



 

(b) The Purchaser shall deliver a proposed allocation of the consideration
reflected by the Merger Consideration (together with Liabilities treated as
assumed for Tax purposes and other capitalized costs) to the Member
Representative not later than one-hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing
Date. If the Member Representative and the Purchaser agree upon such proposed
allocation, then such proposed allocation shall become the final allocation
(the " **Final Allocation** "). If the Member Representative raises any
objections in respect of the proposed allocation, then the Member
Representative and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such
objections, and if they are able to reach agreement, such resolved allocation
shall become the Final Allocation, and the Purchaser, the Company and the
Members shall report and file all Tax Returns in all respects and for all
purposes consistent with such Final Allocation. If the Member Representative
and the Purchaser are unable to reach agreement, then there shall be no Final
Allocation and each of Purchaser and the Member Representative shall be free
to allocate consideration as it determines in its discretion. If there is a
Final Allocation, and after the proposed allocation becomes the Final
Allocation, any event occurs that will result in an adjustment of the adjusted
Merger Consideration (including any indemnity payments pursuant to this
Agreement), then the Purchaser and the Representative shall amend the Final
Allocation accordingly.

 



 

Section 10.4 _Straddle Periods_. In the case of Taxes that are payable with
respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of any such Taxes that are treated
as Pre-Closing Taxes for purposes of this Agreement shall be:

 



 

(a) in the case of Taxes other than property or similar ad valorem Taxes,
deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the taxable year ended
with the Closing Date; and

 



 

(b) in the case of property or similar ad valorem Taxes, deemed to be the
amount of such Taxes for the entire period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the period ending on the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire period.

 



 

Section 10.5 _Post-Closing Access_. The Purchaser and the Member
Representative (on behalf of the Members), respectively, shall provide the
Member Representative and the Purchaser, respectively, with such information
and records, and make such of its officers, directors, employees and agents
available, as may reasonably be requested by

 



      
 

 



 

the Member Representative and the Purchaser, respectively, in connection with
the preparation of any Tax Return or the conduct of any audit or other
proceedings or matters relating to Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries
(or any of its current or prior, direct or indirect members or Subsidiaries).
Subject to Section 9.4, to the extent applicable, the Purchaser and the Member
Representative (on behalf of the Members), shall keep the Member
Representative and the Purchaser, respectively, informed as to conduct of any
audit or other proceeding related to Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and respond to reasonable inquiries from the
Member Representative and the Purchaser, respectively, regarding any such
proceeding.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XI _ 
MISCELLANEOUS_**

 



 

Section 11.1 _Announcements_.

 



 

(a) The parties hereto shall consult with each other before issuing press
releases or otherwise making any public statements or communicating with the
employees of the Company with respect to this Agreement or the Proposed
Transaction and the parties hereto shall not issue any such press release or
public statement without the prior approval of the other party (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 



 

(b) The restriction in _Section 11.1(a)_ shall not apply (i) to the extent
the public announcement is required by Law or any Governmental Authority or
pursuant to any listing agreement with or the listing rules of any national
securities exchange or stock or trading market, including filing a copy of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of this clause
_(b)(i)_ hereof the party making the announcement shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to consult with the other party in advance as to its form,
content and timing, including providing advance copies of any such
announcement, and the party issuing such announcement shall reasonably
consider any comments made by the other party or its Representatives with
respect thereto; (ii) in the event of a dispute between the parties relating
to the matters set forth in this Agreement; or (iii) to disclosures otherwise
expressly permitted hereunder.

 



 

Section 11.2 _Assignment_. This Agreement and the rights and obligations
hereunder may not be assigned unless (a) such assignment is consented to in
writing by both the Purchaser and the Company or (b) the Purchaser assigns its
rights, in whole or in part, to a direct or indirect wholly owned Affiliate of
the Purchaser, but in the case of clause (b) hereof, no such assignment shall
(x) relieve the Purchaser of its obligations under this Agreement, including
the obligation to pay the Closing Total Consideration by means of delivery of
the cash funds as set forth herein, or (y) be permitted to the extent such
assignment increases the amount of withholding permitted to be made pursuant
to _Section 3.2_. This Agreement and all the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

Section 11.3 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 6.19(g)_, the parties
hereby acknowledge and agree that the failure of any party to perform its
agreements and covenants

 



      
 

 



 

hereunder, including its failure to take all actions as are necessary on its
part to consummate the Proposed Transaction shall cause irreparable injury to
the other parties, for which damages, even if available, shall not be an
adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party hereby consents to the granting of
injunctive relief by any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent breaches,
or threatened breaches, of this Agreement, to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof and to compel performance of such partys obligations
(including the taking of such actions as are required of such party to
consummate the Proposed Transaction), in each case, without proof of actual
damages, this being in addition to any other remedy to which any party is
entitled under this Agreement. The parties further agree to waive any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond or other indemnity in
connection with any such remedy and that such remedy shall be in addition to
any other remedy to which a party is entitled at law or in equity. The parties
further agree that (x) by seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section
11.3_, a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form
of relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement, including
monetary damages in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in
the event that the remedies provided for in this _Section 11.3_ are not
available or otherwise are not granted and (y) nothing contained in this
_Section 11.3_ shall require any party to institute any proceeding for (or
limit any partys right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance
under this _Section 11.3_ before exercising any termination right under
_Section 8.1_ (and pursuing damages after such termination) nor shall the
commencement of any action pursuant to this _Section 11.3_ or anything
contained in this _Section 11.3_ restrict or limit any partys right to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Section 8.1_ or
pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or
thereafter.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 11.3(a)_ to the contrary, it is
acknowledged and agreed that the Company shall be entitled to obtain specific
performance to cause the Purchaser to consummate the Proposed Transaction only
in the event that: (i) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and
_Section 7.2_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, provided that such conditions are
reasonably capable of being satisfied), (ii) the date on which the Purchaser
is required to close pursuant to _Section 2.2_ shall have occurred and the
Marketing Period has ended, and (iii) the Debt Financing has been funded in
accordance with the terms thereof, or is available for funding in accordance
with the terms thereof assuming satisfaction by the Purchaser and Merger Sub
of the conditions precedent thereto under their control.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if prior to
the Outside Date any party initiates a legal proceeding to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement, then the Outside Date will be automatically
extended by (A) the amount of time during which such legal proceeding is
pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days, or (B) such other time period
established by the court presiding over such legal proceeding.

 



 

Section 11.4 _Costs and Expenses_. Subject to this _Section 11.4_ and except
as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Company, on the one hand and the
Purchaser, on the other hand, shall each be responsible for their own costs,
charges and other expenses incurred in connection with the Proposed
Transaction.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 11.5 _Notices_.

 



 

(a) All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and
shall be deemed given if delivered personally or by commercial delivery
service, or sent via email or telecopy to the parties at the following
addresses, emails or telecopy numbers (or at such other address or telecopy
numbers for a party as shall be specified by like notice) _provided_ that

_Section 11.5_ and (ii) either (A) a duplicate copy of such email or telecopy
notice is promptly given by one of the other methods described in this
_Section 11.5_ or (B) the receiving party delivers a written confirmation of

(b) Any notice received at the addressees location on any Business Day after
5:00 p.m., addressees local time, or on any day that is not a Business Day
will be deemed to have been received at 9:00 a.m., addressees local time, on
the next Business Day. From time to time, any party may provide notice to the
other parties of a change in its address or fax number through a notice given
in accordance with this _Section 11.5_, except that notice of any change to
the address or any of the other details specified in or pursuant to this
_Section 11.5_ will not be deemed to have been received until, and will be
deemed to have been received upon, the later of the date (i) specified in such
notice; or (ii) that is five (5) Business Days after such notice would
otherwise be deemed to have been received pursuant to this _Section 11.5_.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The failure to provide notice in accordance with the required timing, if
any, set forth herein shall affect the rights of the party providing such
notice only to the extent that such delay actually prejudices the rights of
the party receiving such notice.

 



 

Section 11.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements set forth the entire agreement among
the parties in respect of the Merger and supersedes any prior agreement
(whether oral or written) relating to the Proposed Transaction among the
parties or any of their respective Affiliates and shall supersede all prior
agreements and undertakings, written or oral, with respect thereto, other than
any Confidentiality Agreement to the extent not in conflict with this
Agreement, and shall be interpreted without reference to any prior drafts
hereof. No party or any of its Affiliates shall have any claim or remedy in
respect of any statement, representation, warranty or undertaking, made by or
on behalf of the other party or any of its Affiliates in relation to the
Proposed Transaction which is not expressly set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.7 _Waivers_. No failure or delay by a party in exercising any right
or remedy provided by Law or under this Agreement shall impair such right or
remedy or operate or be construed as a waiver or variation of it or preclude
its exercise at any subsequent time and no single or partial exercise of any
such right or remedy shall preclude any further exercise of it or the exercise
of any other remedy.

 



 

Section 11.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
separate counterparts (including by means of facsimile or portable document
format (.pdf)), each of which is an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 



 

Section 11.9 _Amendments_. Prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of the party against whom enforcement is sought. For
purposes of resolution of disputes and other matters arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the Merger between any Members and the Purchaser
or the Surviving Company after the Effective Time, it is understood that the
Member Representative shall have the authority to bind all of the Members. No
amendment or modification of _Section 6.19_, _Section 11.3_, _Section
11.11_ and _Section 11.13_, and this _Section 11.9_, the definitions of
"Debt Financing Sources" or "Debt Financing Providers" (or any other provision
of this Agreement to the extent modification, amendment or waiver of such
provision would modify the substance of the foregoing as it applies to any
Debt Financing Source) may be made without the written consent of the Debt
Financing Sources.

 



 

Section 11.10 _Severability_. Each of the provisions of this Agreement is
severable. If any such provision is held to be or becomes invalid or
unenforceable in any respect under the Law of any jurisdiction, it shall have
no effect in that respect and the parties shall use all reasonable efforts to

Section 11.14 _Privilege; Counsel_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree, on their own behalf
and on behalf of their managers, directors, members, partners, officers,
employees and Affiliates, and each of their successors and assigns (all such
parties, the " **Waiving Parties** "), that Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and
Flom LLP (or any successor) (" **Skadden** ") and Lowenstein Sandler LLP may
represent any or all Members of the Company or any manager, director, member,
partner, officer, employee or Affiliate of the Members, in each case, in
connection with any dispute, litigation, claim, proceeding or obligation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including under any agreements
contemplated by this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby (any such representation, the " **Post-Closing Representation** ")
notwithstanding its representation (or any continued representation) of the
Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries, and each of Purchaser, Merger Sub and
the Company on behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties hereby consents
thereto and irrevocably waives (and will not assert) any conflict of interest
or any objection arising therefrom or relating thereto. Purchaser, Merger Sub
and the Company acknowledge that the foregoing provision applies whether or
not Skadden or Lowenstein Sandler LLP provides legal services to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) Skadden and Lowenstein Sandler LLP have been engaged by the Company to
represent it in connection with the Proposed Transaction. Each of Purchaser,
Merger Sub and the Surviving Company, for itself and the Waiving Parties,
hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all communications between or
among the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, the Members and
their counsel, including Skadden and Lowenstein Sandler LLP, made in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and
performance under, or any dispute or proceeding arising out of or relating to,
this Agreement, any agreements contemplated by this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including the Proposed
Transaction), or any matter relating to any of the foregoing, are privileged
communications between the Members and such counsel (notwithstanding that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries participated or was provided such
communications nor that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is also a
client of such counsel) and from and after the Closing neither Purchaser,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Company, any Subsidiary of the Surviving Company,
nor any Person purporting to act on behalf of or through Purchaser, Merger Sub
or the Surviving Company or any of the Waiving Parties, will seek to obtain
the same by any process. From and after the Closing, each of Purchaser, Merger
Sub and the Surviving Company, on behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties,
waives and will not assert any attorney-client privilege with respect to any
communication between Skadden or Lowenstein Sandler LLP and the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any Member occurring prior to the Closing in connection with
this Agreement, any of the agreements contemplated hereby, any of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Proposed Transaction), or any
Post-Closing Representation and the expectation of client confidence belongs
to the Company and shall be

 



      
 

 



 

controlled by the Company and shall not pass to or be claimed by the
Purchaser, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Affiliates.

 



 

(c) The Purchaser (on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates) further
understands and agrees that the parties have each undertaken reasonable
efforts to prevent the disclosure of confidential or attorney-client
privileged information. Notwithstanding those efforts, the Purchaser (on its
behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates) further understands and agrees that
the consummation of the Proposed Transaction may result in the inadvertent
disclosure of information that may be confidential and/or subject to a claim
of privilege. The Purchaser (on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates)
further understands and agrees that any disclosure of information that may be
confidential and/or subject to a claim of privilege shall not prejudice or
otherwise constitute a waiver of any claim of privilege. The Purchaser (on its
behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates) agrees to use reasonable best efforts
to return promptly any inadvertently disclosed information to the appropriate
Person upon becoming aware of its existence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that a dispute arises between the Purchaser, the Surviving Company
or any of their respective Affiliates and a third party other than a party to
this Agreement after the Closing, the Surviving Company may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications
by Skadden or Lowenstein Sandler LLP to such third party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Surviving Company may not waive such privilege without
the prior written consent of the Member Representative. Skadden and Lowenstein
Sandler LLP shall be third party beneficiaries for purposes of this _Section
11.14_.

 



 

Section 11.15 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement may only be brought against the entities that are expressly named as
parties hereto and then only with respect to the specific obligations set
forth herein with respect to such party. Except to the extent a named party to
this Agreement (and then only to the extent of the specific obligations
undertaken by such named party in this Agreement and not otherwise), no past,
present or future manager, director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, unitholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of any party
hereto shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of any
party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or
by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby.

or substantially all of the Companys assets (such transaction, a " _Sale_ "),
then each Member shall be deemed to have voted for and provided any applicable
consent to such Sale.
