engagement letter. Each of Purchaser and Seller shall pay one-half (1/2) of
the fees and expenses of the Inventory Firms. The Pre-Closing Date Coal
Inventory shall be adjusted to the Closing Date to reflect changes in such
Pre-Closing Date Coal Inventory from the date of the Inventory Firms
calculation through the Closing based on the operating records of the Company.

(c) No more than forty-five (45) days following the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall prepare and deliver to Seller the following (collectively, the "
_Preliminary Statement_ "):

Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (before giving effect to the Closing),
based on the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet (the " _Preliminary Cash

Date (before giving effect to the Closing), based on the Preliminary Closing

reasons therefor in reasonable detail.

 



19 (e) In connection with Sellers review of the Preliminary Statement, Seller
and its Representatives shall have reasonable access, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable notice, to all relevant work papers, schedules,
memoranda and other documents prepared by Purchaser or its Representatives
(subject to customary indemnification agreements with respect to work papers
of Purchasers independent accountants that may be requested by such

Purchaser and any other information that Seller or its Representatives
reasonably request, and Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller and its
Representatives in connection therewith.

(f) In the event that Seller shall deliver a Dispute Notice to Purchaser,

Seller shall mutually agree in writing) of Sellers delivery of such Dispute
Notice, such dispute shall be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, and
such determination shall be final and binding on the parties. With respect to
any disputed amount, the Independent Accounting Firms determination shall
not be higher than the highest amount proposed by Seller or Purchaser, nor
lower than the lowest amount proposed by Seller or Purchaser. Any expenses
relating to the engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm in respect of
its services pursuant to this Section 2.3(f) shall be paid by Purchaser, on
the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, based on the percentage that the
amount actually contested but not awarded to Purchaser or Seller,
respectively, bears to the amount actually contested by Purchaser and Seller.
The Independent Accounting Firm shall be instructed to use reasonable best
efforts to perform its services within thirty (30) days of submission of the
Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Cash Amount and the
Preliminary Net Working Capital to it and, in any case, as promptly as

Amount, by the amount of such excess, or (B) decreased, if the Estimated Cash

(ii) (A) increased, if the Final Net Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Net
Working Capital, by the amount of such excess, or (B) decreased, if the
Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds the Final Net Working Capital, by the
amount of such excess.

(h) Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, shall, within five (5) Business
Days after the determination of the Final Cash Amount and the Final Net
Working Capital pursuant to this Section 2.3, make payment to the other by
wire transfer in immediately available funds of the amount payable by
Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, in an amount equal to the Final
Closing Adjustment, together with interest thereon from the Closing Date to
the date of payment at a floating rate equal to the U.S. dollar prime rate
per annum, as quoted by The Wall Street Journal, from time to time during such
period (less any non-resident withholding Tax payable in respect of such
interest). Such interest shall be calculated based on a year of 365 days and
the number of days elapsed since the Closing Date.

Purchaser disputes the amount of any applicable Contingent Payment or

Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute as

shortfall can be carried over to calendar years 2016 and 2017 (but not 2018),
(ii) to the extent the 2016 Contingent Payment, not taking into account any
shortfall from calendar year 2015, is less than $10,000,000, such shortfall

it is currently (a) ineligible to receive additional surface mining permits or
(b) under investigation to determine whether its eligibility to receive such
permits should be revoked, i.e., "permit blocked." As used in this Section
3.11(d), "own," "control," "owned" or "controlled" shall be defined as set

Environmental Laws (collectively, the " _Bonds_ "). Except for increases in
the amount of Bonds that may be required in the Ordinary Course of Business in
connection with mid-term reviews of the Coal Mining Permits, the Bonds are

"), that together with the Company would be deemed a "single employer" within
the meaning of section 4001(b) of ERISA, or to which Seller, the Company or an
ERISA Affiliate is party, that, in any such case, is for the benefit of any
employee or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Plans_ "). Section 3.16(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule indicates which of the Plans are sponsored or maintained by the

Department of Labor and other governmental filings in each case with respect
to the Company Plans.

 

(c) No Liability under Title IV or section 302 of ERISA has been incurred by
Seller, the Company or any ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in
full, and no condition exists that presents a material risk to the Company or
any ERISA Affiliate of incurring any such Liability, other than Liability for
premiums due to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. No Title IV Plan
or any trust established thereunder has incurred any "accumulated funding
deficiency" (as defined in section 302 of ERISA and section 412 of the Code),
whether or not waived. No Title IV Plan is a "multiemployer pension plan," as
defined in section 3(37) of ERISA, nor is any Title IV Plan a plan described
in section 4063(a) of ERISA.

(d) Except as specifically provided in the documents described in this
Section 3.16 and delivered to Purchaser, or as otherwise described in Section
3.16(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, there are no amendments,
modifications, extensions, changes in benefits or benefit structures, or
other alterations that are currently in effect or that Seller or the Company
have undertaken to become effective in the future to any of the Plans.

 

(e) Each of the Company Plans has been executed, managed and administered in
material compliance with all applicable Laws, including but not limited to
the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code, and the regulations promulgated
thereunder.

(f) Except as set forth in Section 3.16(f) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
no Plan provides medical, surgical, hospitalization, death or similar benefits
(whether or not insured) for employees or former employees of the Company or
any Subsidiary thereof for periods extending beyond their retirement,
disability or other termination of service, other than coverage mandated by
applicable Law.

(g) Seller and the Company have fully complied with the notice and
continuation requirements of Parts 6 and 7 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA
and section 4980B of the Code, and the regulations thereunder, whether
proposed or final (" _COBRA_ ").

(h) To the Knowledge of Seller, neither Seller, the Company, any ERISA
Affiliate nor any other fiduciary (as that term is defined in section 3(21)
of ERISA) with respect to any of the Plans has any material Liability for any
breach of any fiduciary duties under ERISA.

 



39 (i) Seller, the Company and any ERISA Affiliate have not, with respect to any
of the Plans, nor has any administrator of any of the Plans, the related
trusts or any trustee thereof, engaged in any prohibited transaction which
could reasonably be expected to subject the Company, any of its Subsidiaries,
any of the Plans, any administrator, any trustee or any party dealing with
any of the Plans or any such trusts, to a tax or penalty on prohibited
transactions imposed by ERISA, the Code, or to any other Liability under ERISA
or the Code.

 

(j) Each Plan that is intended to be tax qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code is so qualified and has received or is covered by a favorable
determination or opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service, and any
trusts intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under the Code are
so exempt and, to the Knowledge of Seller, no facts or circumstances have
occurred that would reasonably be expected to result in the loss of such
qualification or exemption, or the imposition of any Liability, penalty or Tax
under ERISA or the Code.

 

(k) Except as set forth in Section 3.16(k) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
none of the Plans which are employee pension benefit plans nor any of the
related trusts have been terminated and no event or condition has occurred
which presents a material risk of termination. No Liability to the PBGC has
been incurred with respect to any of the Title IV Plans; there have been
no reportable events (as described in section 4043(c) of ERISA); and no event
or condition has occurred which presents a material risk of termination of any
of the Title IV Plans by the PBGC.

 

(l) No Plan is, as of the date of the most recent financial statements
prepared for each such Plan, considered an "at risk" plan within the meaning
of Section 430 of the Code or Section 303 of ERISA. The actuarial present
value of all accrued deferred compensation entitlements of employees and
former employees of the Company, its Subsidiaries and any ERISA Affiliates
(and their respective beneficiaries) other than entitlements accrued pursuant
to funded retirement plans subject to the provisions of section 412 of the
Code are fully reflected on the Financial Statements.

 

(m) None of the employee pension benefit plans is, and neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates has within the ten-year period
prior to the date of this Agreement contributed to, a "multiemployer plan," as
that term is defined in section 3(37) of ERISA (as particularly amended by The
Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980).

 

(n) Neither Seller nor the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA

standing in each of the jurisdictions in which the ownership, operation or
leasing of its properties and assets and the conduct of its business requires

Documents each constitute valid and binding obligations of Purchaser,
enforceable against Purchaser in accordance with their respective terms,

ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents.

Section 4.5 _Legal Proceedings_. There are no material Actions pending or, to
the knowledge of Purchaser, threatened against Purchaser or its Affiliates,

52 Section 5.2 _Employment Matters_.

 

(a) Purchaser and Seller agree that, within three days after signing this
Agreement, Seller shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to issue
notices, pursuant to the WARN Act, in substantially the forms attached hereto
as _Exhibit 5.2(a)_ , to all employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as
well as all applicable federal, state and local authorities. On the Closing
Date, Seller shall provide a list of the name and site of employment of any
and all employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who have experienced an
employment loss or layoff, as defined under the WARN Act, within ninety (90)
days prior to the Closing Date.

(b) Purchaser and Seller agree to cooperate with one another to determine
within thirty (30) days following the date of this Agreement or such date
that Purchaser and Seller shall otherwise agree, the number of employees that
Purchaser will require at each work site following the Closing for purposes of
ongoing staffing requirements based on the operational needs of Purchaser
and, likewise, the number of such employees that will no longer be required by
Purchaser for such purposes. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence to the
contrary, the Purchaser shall make the final determination as to the number
of employees required for ongoing staffing requirements. Seller shall cause
the Company and its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of such number of
employees at least fourteen (14) days prior to the Closing, but in no event,
unless Seller agrees otherwise, less than sixty (60) days following the
notices provided under (a). All employees employed by the Company and its
Subsidiaries on the Closing Date are hereinafter referred to as the " _Company
Employees_ ". Prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to have paid to the Company Employees any and all amounts
attributable to accrued vacation, personal days, sick days, paid-time off,
bonuses and for any other time or payments for which such Company Employees
may be entitled, such that upon the Closing Date the Company Employees will
not be entitled to any further compensation or paid time off of any nature
whatsoever from the Company or its Subsidiaries attributable to the Plans,
Contracts, policies, practices and programs in existence prior to the Closing.
During the two-year period following the Closing, Purchaser shall, or shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, provide to each Company Employee who is employed
by Purchaser or any Subsidiary of Purchaser, for so long as such Company
Employee remains so employed during such two-year period, compensation and
employee benefits that, with respect to each such Company Employee, are no
less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation and benefits provided
to similarly situated employees of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries.

(c) Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries (including, without
limitation, the Company and its Subsidiaries) to give each Company Employee
credit for such Company Employees service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility and vesting (including for purposes
of vacation) under any benefit plans maintained by Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries which are generally made available by Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries following the Closing to employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries and in which a Company Employee participates; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the
same period of service.

 



53 (d) Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries (including, without
limitation, the Company and its Subsidiaries) to, (i) waive any preexisting
condition limitations otherwise applicable to Company Employees and their
eligible dependents under any plan of Purchaser or any Subsidiary of Purchaser
that provides health benefits in which Company Employees may be eligible to
participate following the Closing, other than any limitations that were in
effect with respect to such employees as of the Closing under the analogous
Plan, (ii) credit any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums
incurred by the Company Employees and their eligible dependents under the
health plans in which they participated immediately prior to the Closing
during the portion of the calendar year prior to the Closing in satisfying
any deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums under the health plans
of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries in which they are eligible to
participate after the Closing in the same calendar year in which such
deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums were incurred and (iii) to
the extent permitted under a benefit plan maintained by Purchaser or its
Subsidiaries, waive any waiting period limitation that would otherwise be
applicable to a Company Employee and his or her eligible dependents on or
after the Closing, in each case to the extent such Company Employee or
eligible dependent had satisfied any similar limitation under an analogous
Plan prior to the Closing.

 

(e) The Company has entered into Retention and Contingent Separation
Agreements with the individuals set forth in Section 5.2(e) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the " _Retention and Contingent Separation
Agreements_ "). Seller hereby agrees that (i) prior to Closing, Seller shall
use its reasonable best efforts to terminate the Retention and Contingent
Separation Agreements so that no obligations shall exist under such Retention
and Contingent Separation Agreements on or after the Closing and (ii) Seller
shall be responsible for, and prior to the Closing shall have made,
each payment and offered any continuation of benefits required under any
Retention and Contingent Separation Agreement.

(f) Seller acknowledges and agrees that Seller has disclosed accurate
actuarial estimates of Black Lung Liabilities in Section 5.2(f) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, and that such estimates are subject to change. Purchaser
agrees that it shall assume all Black Lung Liabilities and all Black Lung
Claims arising thereunder, regardless of whether such Liabilities or claims,
or the events or circumstances giving rise to such Liabilities or claims,
whether filed or unfiled, pending or not pending, arise or are pending prior
to, on or after the Closing by or on behalf of any current or former employee
of the Company or its Subsidiaries who performs or at any time performed
services for the Business, any dependents or heirs of any such employees or
any other person or entity who asserts a claim derived from such persons. From
and following the Closing, Purchaser agrees that neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates shall retain or incur any Liability with respect to Black
Lung Claims or Black Lung Liabilities made or incurred by any current or
former employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who performs or at any time
performed services for the Business, any dependents or heirs of any such
employees or any other person or entity who asserts a claim derived from such
persons, regardless of when the events or circumstances giving rise to such
Liabilities or claims arose. Seller agrees that the Company

 



54  shall retain the Black Lung Benefits Trust and all assets thereunder. If
Purchaser is not already registered with the Department of Labor as a
guarantor with respect to Black Lung Liabilities and if Purchaser intends to
be self-insured regarding such Liabilities, Purchaser shall so register with
the Department of Labor.

(g) Seller acknowledges and agrees that Seller has disclosed accurate
actuarial estimates of the post-employment Liabilities, other than any such
estimates related to long-term disability Liabilities, in Section 5.2(g) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, and that such estimates are subject to
change. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, or shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, take all actions necessary to terminate and cease all post-
employment benefits payable, or to become payable, to employees or former
employees, and their dependents, of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
including providing all employees, former employees and their dependents with
written notice of such termination and cessation, such termination and
cessation to become effective prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company will pay all such benefit claims through the run out period.
To the extent such post-employment benefits cannot be terminated and ceased
prior to the Closing as to all employees, former employees and their
dependents for whatever reason, Seller shall retain the obligations,
Liabilities and Costs associated with such post-employment benefits and shall
indemnify Purchaser, the Company and its Subsidiaries for any and all costs
associated with such benefits.

(h) Seller shall be solely responsible for, and hereby assumes all Liabilities
and Costs whatsoever with respect to, and shall indemnify and defend
Purchaser, the Company and its Subsidiaries against, and hold Purchaser, the
Company and its Subsidiaries harmless from any and all Losses with respect to
Sellers, the Companys or its Subsidiaries termination of the employment of
any and all employees pursuant to Section 5.2(b) of this Agreement, including
but not limited to any Liabilities and Costs arising under federal, state or
local statute (including, without limitation, Title VII of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act of 1990, the Equal Pay Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act
of 1990, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, Executive Order
11246 and all other statutes regulating the terms and conditions of
employment), regulation or ordinance, under the common law or in equity
(including any claims for wrongful discharge or otherwise), or under any
policy, agreement, understanding or promise, written or oral, formal or
informal, between the Company and any of its Subsidiaries and such employee,
except with respect to any workers compensation or unemployment claims, which
claims shall be assumed by Purchaser as provided hereunder.

(i) At the option of Seller, which decision shall be communicated to Purchaser
within five days of this Agreement, Seller may, prior to the Closing,
transfer the TECO Coal Medical Plan to, and cause it to be sponsored and
maintained by, any Affiliate of Seller other than the Company or its
Subsidiaries. Other than as set forth in Section 2.5(k), in the event Seller
transfers the TECO Coal Medical Plan as contemplated by this Section 5.2(i),
after the Closing, the Company shall fund the claims payment account as
directed by the third party 

 



55  administrator for claims incurred under the TECO Coal Medical Plan prior to
the Closing which are not covered under any stop-loss coverage in effect for
the TECO Coal Medical Plan for employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and their eligible dependents and former employees and their eligible
dependents who were receiving retiree health care benefits. As otherwise
provided in the Agreement, the Purchaser, the Company and its Subsidiaries
will not reimburse the Seller or its Affiliate for any claims or obligations
under the TECO Coal Medical Plan related to or incurred under COBRA
continuation coverage for qualifying events that occur prior to the Closing.

 

(j) The provisions of this Section 5.2 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no employee or former employee of the Company
or any Subsidiary thereof or any other individual associated therewith shall
be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement,
and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Plan or Company
Plan for any purpose. The parties acknowledge and agree that nothing
contained in this Agreement, including in this Section 5.2, shall require
Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof (including, after the Closing Date, the
Company and its Subsidiaries) to maintain the employment of any employee of
the Company or any Subsidiary thereof.

Section 5.3 _Publicity_. Purchaser and Seller shall consult with each other
with respect to any press release or public announcement pertaining to the
execution of this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make
any such public announcement prior to such consultation, except as may be
required by Law or by any applicable listing agreement with a national
securities exchange or national market system as determined in the good faith
judgment of the party proposing to make such release.

 

Section 5.4 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Purchaser and its Representatives shall treat all
materials and information obtained in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby as confidential in accordance with the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement. The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement
are hereby incorporated herein by reference. If this Agreement is, for
any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect as provided in Section 7.2.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, except as otherwise required by applicable
Law, Purchaser shall, and shall cause each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries to, keep confidential all proprietary or nonpublic
information regarding Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) of which any of Purchaser, the Company or the Subsidiaries of
the Company may be aware. Notwithstanding the foregoing, confidential
information shall not include information that becomes generally available to
the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the receiving party or
its Representatives in violation of the terms hereof.

 



56 (c) From and after the Closing, except as otherwise required by applicable
Law, Seller shall keep confidential all proprietary or nonpublic information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
confidential information shall not include information that becomes generally
available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the
receiving party or its Representatives in violation of the terms hereof.

Section 5.5  _Access to Information_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to afford Purchaser and its
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice, to the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices
and other facilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to their books
and records, and shall furnish Purchaser with available financial, operating
and other data and information with respect to the business and properties of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as Purchaser may reasonably request. From and
after the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to
afford Seller and its Representatives reasonable access, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the officers, employees, agents,
properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and to their books and records to the extent reasonably required by Seller
in connection with any investigation, audit, litigation, other Action or any
other legitimate business purpose including reviewing Purchasers books and
records that relate to the sale of Excess Coal Inventory. In exercising its
rights hereunder, each of Purchaser and Seller shall (and shall cause each of
its Representatives to) conduct itself so as not to materially interfere in
the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Seller
acknowledges and agrees that any contact by Seller or its Representatives
with officers, employees or agents of the Company or its Subsidiaries after
Closing shall be arranged and supervised by Representatives of Purchaser,
unless Purchaser otherwise expressly consents in writing with respect to any
specific unsupervised contact.

Section 5.6 _Permitting_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall create an ownership and control file
with all applicable Governmental Entities necessary to facilitate the
approval, by all applicable Governmental Entities, of the change of ownership
and control of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to the Coal
Mining Permits and Environmental Permits as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Permit Approvals_ ") and
shall assume primary responsibility (with the cooperation and assistance of
Seller and its consultants and representatives) for preparing and assembling
drafts of all Applications (as defined in Section 5.6(b) below) and other
documentation to be submitted to the applicable Governmental Entities in
connection with the Permit Approvals.

 

(b) Unless otherwise agreed upon, in writing, by the parties hereto, within
thirty (30) Business Days following the Closing, (i) Purchaser and Seller
shall execute and deliver to Purchaser, and Seller shall obtain and deliver to
Purchaser the signatures of all contract miners used by the Company or its
Subsidiaries on, all necessary applications and such other 

 



57  forms as may be required by applicable Governmental Entities in connection
with obtaining the Permit Approvals and, to the extent required, to designate
Purchaser or its Affiliates as an "operator" under the Coal Mining Permits or
Environmental Permits (the " _Applications_ "), and (ii) Seller shall obtain
and deliver to Purchaser a fully executed consent from each Person that has
granted a dwelling distance waiver with respect to the Coal Mining Permits or
the Environmental Permits, to the extent required by applicable Law. Unless
otherwise agreed upon, in writing, by the parties hereto, Purchaser shall file
the Applications with the applicable Governmental Entities within fifteen
(15) Business Days after receipt of executed and fully completed Applications.
Any and all necessary filing fees for the Applications, the cost of
advertising the filing of the Applications and any and all costs payable to
any Governmental Entity in connection with the Applications shall be borne by
Purchaser; otherwise, each party will bear its own costs and expenses in
connection with obtaining the Permit Approvals and designating Purchaser as
an operator under the Coal Mining Permits or Environmental Permits, if
required.

(c) When the applicable Governmental Entities deem the Applications to be
technically acceptable and complete, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its
Affiliate to, post all bonds (or other appropriate collateral of a type
satisfactory to the appropriate Governmental Entities) necessary to obtain
the Permit Approvals and cause a full and complete release of Sellers and its
Affiliates bonds once the Permit Approvals are obtained. Seller and its
Affiliates shall leave in place currently posted surety bonds related to
the Coal Mining Permits and Environmental Permits until the Permit Approvals
have been obtained. However, if after twelve (12) months from the Closing Date
any of the Permit Approvals have not been obtained, Purchaser shall, if
permitted by the applicable Governmental Entities, replace (at Purchasers
sole cost and expense) all of Sellers and its Affiliates remaining bonds
relating to such Coal Mining Permits and Environmental Permits with respect to
which the Permit Approvals have not been obtained within thirty (30) days of
the end of the 12-month period.

(d) Purchaser shall take all commercially reasonable steps necessary to
ensure that, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Permit Approvals are
obtained, all bonds of Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company and
its Subsidiaries), all deposits, letters of credit or collateral posted as
security by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) and any cash bonds or letters of credit posted by Seller or its
Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) directly with the
applicable Governmental Entity in connection with the Coal Mining Permits and
Environmental Permits shall be refunded in full and/or returned to Seller
and/or its Affiliates, as appropriate.

 

(e) Purchaser agrees to diligently prosecute the Application process
contemplated hereby for the Permit Approvals. Without obtaining the
prior written approval of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), Purchaser agrees that it shall not seek in
any of the Applications to change any condition of mining or reclamation
obligation established in the Coal Mining Permits or Environmental Permits
(other than the identity of the operator) or delete or add property to the
Coal Mining Permits, if the

 



58  effect of such request or modification thereto would delay or otherwise
hinder obtaining prompt approval of the Applications or the release of any
bonds or other security of Seller or its Affiliates, except, in each case,
(i) for actions ordered by an applicable Governmental Entity, (ii) as required
to abate or resolve any notice of non-compliance, (iii) as required in
connection with any mid-term review or renewal of any such Coal Mining
Permits or Environmental Permits, (iv) as required in connection with any
pending actions, or (v) as required in connection with similar permitting
developments. Purchaser and Seller agree to sign all documents reasonably
required by any Governmental Entity in connection with the Permit Approvals.
In the event of the denial of any Permit Approval by the appropriate
Governmental Entity, Purchaser shall, at Purchasers expense, until such
denial is reversed, use commercially reasonable efforts to diligently pursue
and exhaust all administrative and judicial remedies afforded to Purchaser in
the event of such denial.

 

(f) At the Closing, Seller shall execute and deliver to Purchaser a power of
attorney in a form reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser appointing Purchaser
to act as Sellers attorney-in-fact for all purposes related to obtaining
approval and/or filing notification of the change of control and/or obtaining
approval of the transfer of the Coal Mining Permits and Environmental Permits
to Purchaser contemplated hereby.

(g) During the Interim Period, subject to any required administrative consent
or approval and any other requirement of any Governmental Entity, Seller, to
the extent Seller has a legal right to do so, designates Purchaser and its
Affiliates as an operator under, and grants to Purchaser and its Affiliates
the right to immediately engage in mining operations and all other legally
permissible activities on the premises permitted under, the Coal Mining
Permits and Environmental Permits, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each Company Lease and the Coal Mining Permits and Environmental
Permits. With respect to such mining operations and other legally permissible
activities conducted by Purchaser, the Company and its Subsidiaries during the
Interim Period, Purchaser shall operate solely as an independent contractor
and not as an agent, employee, or servant of Seller. Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, (i) all of Purchasers post-Closing operations
pursuant to this subsection shall be at the sole cost, risk, liability
and expense of Purchaser and (ii) any benefit gained from such post-Closing
operations by Purchaser pursuant to this subsection shall likewise be for the
sole account and benefit of Purchaser.

 

(h) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to perform and remain responsible for all Liabilities and Costs
associated with the Coal Mining Permits and Environmental Permits and
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates and their
respective directors, officers, shareholders, employees, representatives
and other agents from any Losses or Costs incurred by them which arises,
during the Interim Period, out of the Coal Mining Permits and Environmental
Permits or the conduct of the Business; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither
Purchaser nor its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries)
shall be obligated to indemnify, reimburse, hold harmless or

 



59  otherwise be responsible for any premiums or other fees or costs associated
with Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries)
maintaining bonds or other collateral with respect to the Coal Mining Permits
or the Environmental Permits. During the Interim Period, Purchaser shall, to
the extent it is necessary for it to operate thereunder, operate under each
Coal Mining Permit and Environmental Permit in accordance with the terms of
such Coal Mining Permit and Environmental Permit and all applicable Laws and
shall comply, in all material respects, with all conditions and requirements
of, or pertaining to, the Coal Mining Permits and Environmental
Permits, including all requirements imposed by other permits and governmental
approvals granted in connection with the Coal Mining Permits and Environmental
Permits.

 

(i) During the Interim Period, Seller and its Representatives shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to the extent Purchaser has the legal right to
grant such right, to enter, during normal business hours, upon providing
reasonable notice and without unreasonably interfering in the operations of
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, onto the premises subject to the Coal Mining
Permits and Environmental Permits for the purpose of ascertaining the
condition and status of Purchasers, the Companys and its Subsidiaries
operations located on the premises subject to the Coal Mining Permits and
Environmental Permits and for any other lawful purpose reasonably necessary
to exercise its rights under this Agreement, including correcting, as
permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, any violations of any Laws
pertaining to the premises subject to the Coal Mining Permits and
Environmental Permits that have not been, and are not being, corrected by
Purchaser. Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith and shall grant, to the
extent it has the legal right to do so, Seller and its Representatives rights
of ingress and egress to permit Seller to exercise its rights under this
Agreement.

(j) During the Interim Period, Purchaser shall maintain insurance covering
the Business, its assets, or any Liabilities relating thereto under various
policies of general liability and other forms of insurance that are typical in
coverage and amount for entities engaged in the Business. Such
insurance shall be maintained with a reputable insurance company that
customarily insures risks in the coal industry. To the extent permitted under
the applicable insurance policies, Purchaser shall designate Seller as an
additional insured on all such policies and shall provide Seller with a
certificate of insurance or other proof reasonably satisfactory to Seller as
to such insurance coverage.

 

(k) If any notice of violation, non-compliance or similar occurrence is issued
with respect to operations under any Coal Mining Permit or Environmental
Permit during the Interim Period, Purchaser shall defend such violation, non-
compliance or similar occurrence and, if applicable, pay all fines associated
therewith, correct such violation, non-compliance or similar occurrence,
and perform all abatement measures required by any Governmental Entity.
During the Interim Period, if Seller receives a notice of violation or non-
compliance under or with respect to such Coal Mining Permit or Environmental
Permit, Seller will, promptly and in any event within two (2) Business Days
(or in the case of receipt of a cessation order, immediately),

 



60  give Purchaser notice thereof. Purchaser shall have a duty to defend any
violation or non-compliance and, if applicable, to pay all fines associated
therewith, to correct any violation or non-compliance and to perform all
abative measures required by any Governmental Entity. If Seller reasonably and
in good faith determines that Purchaser will not defend any violation or non-
compliance in a timely fashion, or Purchaser does not timely take all
necessary actions to correct or abate any violation or non-compliance, Seller
shall have the right (but not the obligation) to defend, correct and/or abate
the violation or non-compliance and Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for
all reasonable Costs incurred by Seller in defending, correcting or abating
such violation or non-compliance, including reasonable attorney fees. Seller
shall provide to Purchaser, within two (2) Business Days after receipt
thereof, copies of all monthly inspection sheets received from any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Coal Mining Permits or Environmental
Permits or the operations or activities conducted thereon.

 

(l) Seller and Purchaser agree to fully cooperate with each other, and to
cause their respective Affiliates, consultants and representatives to fully
cooperate, in all filings, including providing any additional information and
the preparation and execution of any additional documents, that may be
necessary to obtain the Permit Approvals.

 

Section 5.7 _Insurance_. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that all insurance
coverage for the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Business under policies
(including self-insurance policies and programs) of Seller and its Affiliates
(other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall terminate as of the
Closing and no claims may be brought thereunder by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries from and after the Closing for losses that occur after the
Closing. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall retain their rights under all such insurance coverage for all claims
filed thereunder prior to the Closing and the Company or its Subsidiaries may
bring claims under such policies (including self-insurance policies and
programs) that are occurrence-based policies for losses that occur prior to
the Closing if permitted under such policies; _provided_ , that such claims
shall be at the Companys or its Subsidiaries sole cost and expense
(including any applicable retentions or deductibles in connection with such
claims). With respect to any claims for such coverage, the Company or its
Subsidiaries shall control the claims process for any claim on which neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates (other than the Company or its Subsidiaries)
is a party, and shall be entitled to any proceeds payable on such claims. With
respect to any claims for such coverage on which either Seller or one or more
of its Affiliates (other than the Company or its Subsidiaries) is a
party, Seller shall control the claims process, but shall cooperate with the
Company and its Subsidiaries and allow them to participate in such process,
and the proceeds payable on any such claims shall be prorated among the
claimants based on the information submitted with respect thereto. Seller
shall not, and shall not permit its Affiliates to, terminate or modify any
insurance policies (including any self-insurance policies or programs), or any
provision thereof, to the extent that such policies, or provisions thereof,
provide coverage to the Company or its Subsidiaries for Losses arising out of
or relating to events occurring at or prior to the Closing. After the Closing

 



61  Date, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide any
cooperation needed for the Company or its Subsidiaries to utilize the coverage
provided by the insurance policies (including self-insurance policies and
programs) contemplated by this Section for Losses arising out of or relating
to events occurring prior to the Closing.

 

Section 5.8 _Indebtedness; Termination of Agreements_.

 

(a) At the Closing, Seller shall discharge (or cause to be extinguished or no
longer outstanding), or shall cause one of its Affiliates to discharge (or
otherwise cause to be extinguished or no longer outstanding), all Indebtedness
of (i) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) any other Person
guaranteed or secured by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective assets. It is understood and agreed by the parties that
none of Seller or its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries)
shall have any obligation under this Agreement to discharge, extinguish or
otherwise terminate, in whole or in part, any indemnities, performance bonds,
performance or lease guarantees, letters of credit, capital leases or other
leases or Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is party
or by which any of them is bound (other than the Contracts and Indebtedness
to be terminated or otherwise discharged pursuant to this Section 5.8(a), the
Terminating Contracts contemplated to be terminated pursuant to Section 5.8(b)
and the intercompany accounts contemplated to be settled pursuant to Section
5.8(c)).

(b) As of the Closing, except for those Contracts set forth in Section 5.8(b)
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, all Contracts between the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates
(other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), on the other hand (the "
_Terminating Contracts_ "), shall be terminated as between them and shall be
without any further force and effect, and there shall be no further
obligations of any of the relevant parties thereunder. Purchaser agrees to
take and to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to take, and Seller agrees
to take and to cause its Affiliates (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) to take, any action following the Closing that would be required
to give effect to the termination of the Terminating Contracts.

(c) Except as set forth in Section 5.8(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
all intercompany accounts, whether payables or receivables, between Seller
and any of its Affiliates (other than the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the Company and any of its Subsidiaries,
on the other hand, as of the Closing shall be settled (in cash or
through cash capital contributions, cash distributions, cancellations or
otherwise in the sole discretion of Seller, _provided_ that no such settlement
will involve the creation or distribution of any Liabilities or assets of the
Company or its Subsidiaries other than Current Assets or Current Liabilities)
at or prior to the Closing.

 



62 Section 5.9 _Release of Letters of Credit and Guarantees_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall attempt to obtain a substitute
letter of credit to replace in all respects each Letter of Credit and used
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from the beneficiary of such
Letter of Credit and deliver to Seller a full and unconditional release of all
of the obligations of Seller and its applicable Affiliates with respect to
such Letter of Credit (which release shall be reasonably acceptable to
Seller). In the event Purchaser is unable, as of the Closing, to obtain
substitute letters of credit to replace in all respects the Letters of Credit
and obtain and deliver releases with respect thereto in accordance with the
preceding sentence, Purchaser shall do so following the Closing and shall (i)
obtain and deliver to Seller at the Closing one or more letters of credit in
favor of Seller with an aggregate initial face amount equal to the aggregate
amount as may be necessary to secure the maximum potential exposure under such
continuing Letters of Credit, and otherwise on terms and conditions and from
financial institutions, which in each case are reasonably satisfactory to
Seller, (ii) indemnify and hold harmless each of Seller and its Affiliates
(other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) from and against any and all
Losses incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliates arising out or relating
to such Letters of Credit and (iii) not permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their Affiliates to (A) renew or extend the term of, (B)
increase the obligations under, or (C) transfer to another third party, any
loan, lease, Contract or other obligation for which Seller or any of its
Affiliates is or would reasonably be expected to be liable under such Letters
of Credit.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Purchaser (i) shall either (A) obtain a substitute
guaranty, indemnity agreement or similar instrument to replace in all
respects each Guarantee or (B) fully assume all obligations under each such
Guarantee and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from the
creditor or beneficiary of each such Guarantee and deliver to Seller a full
and unconditional release of all of the obligations of Seller and its
applicable Affiliates under each such Guarantee (which release shall be
reasonably acceptable to Seller). In the event Purchaser is unable, as of the
Closing, to obtain substitute guarantees, indemnity agreements or similar
instruments to replace in all respects the Guarantees (or assumed all
obligations thereunder) and obtain and deliver releases with respect thereto
in accordance with the preceding sentence, Purchaser shall continue to use
commercially reasonable efforts to do so following the Closing and shall (1)
indemnify and hold harmless each of Seller and its Affiliates (other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries) from and against any and all Losses incurred by
Seller or any of its Affiliates arising out or relating to such Guarantees and
(2) not permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their Affiliates to
(x) renew or extend the term of, (y) increase the obligations under, or (z)
transfer to another third party, any loan, lease, Contract or other obligation
for which Seller or any of its Affiliates is or would reasonably be expected
to be liable under such Guarantees. To the extent that Seller or any of its
Affiliates has performance obligations under any such Guarantee, Purchaser
shall (I) perform such obligations on behalf of Seller or such Affiliates or
(II) otherwise take such action as reasonably requested by Seller so as to
put Seller or such Affiliates in the same position as if Purchaser, and not
Seller or such Affiliates, had performed or was performing such obligations.

 



63 Section 5.10 _Support Services; Names_.

 

(a) Purchaser acknowledges that, prior to the Closing, the Company or its
Subsidiaries received from Seller or its Affiliates certain corporate and
other services and support, including general and administrative services,
audit services, legal services, human resources services, tax services,
finance services, cash management services, information technology services
and support and insurance and facilities-related support (collectively, the "
_Support Services_ "). Purchaser acknowledges that, except as expressly
provided in this Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement, the Support
Services cease as of the Closing and all agreements and arrangements in
respect thereof terminate as of the Closing, with no further obligation of any
party thereto.

 

(b) No later than twenty (20) days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to change their names and cause the
articles of organization (or equivalent organizational document), as
applicable, to be amended to remove any reference to "TECO" or any other name,
Trademark or service mark used by Seller or any of its Affiliates that is set
forth on Section 5.10(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. Following the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the
Company and its Subsidiaries) to, as soon as practicable, but in no event
later than 120 days following the Closing Date, cease to (i) make any use of
any names, Trademarks, or service marks that include (A) the terms "TECO" or
any other name, Trademark, or service mark used by Seller or any of its
Affiliates as set forth on Section 5.10(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
or (B) any names, Trademarks, or service marks containing or comprising the
foregoing, including any names, Trademarks, or service marks confusingly
similar thereto or dilutive thereof (collectively, the " _Marks_ "), and (ii)
hold themselves out as having any affiliation with Seller or any of its
Affiliates. In furtherance thereof, as soon as practicable but in no event
later than 120 days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) to, remove,
strike over or otherwise obliterate all Marks from all assets and other
materials, including any business cards, schedules, stationery, packaging
materials, displays, signs, promotional materials, manuals, forms, websites,
email, computer software and other materials and systems. Any use by Purchaser
or its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) of any of the
Marks as permitted in this Section 5.10(b) is subject to their compliance with
the quality control requirements and guidelines in effect for the Marks as of
the Closing Date. Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries) not to, use the Marks in a manner
that would be reasonably likely to reflect negatively on such name and Marks
or on Seller or its Affiliates. Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) to, indemnify and
hold harmless Seller and any of its Affiliates from and against any Losses
relating to or arising from any use by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries) of the Marks as permitted by
this Section 5.10(b) or otherwise.

 



64 Section 5.11 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns required to
be filed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date. Any such Tax Return (excluding
for these purposes Income Tax Returns) shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice (unless otherwise required by Law) and without a
change of any election or any accounting method. The Company shall file or
cause to be filed all such Tax Returns described in the preceding sentence and
shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns to
the extent such Taxes are reflected in the Net Working Capital. Any Taxes in
excess of the amount reflected in the Net Working Capital will be paid by
Seller.

(b) All Transfer Taxes (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with this Agreement shall be borne and paid by Seller when due.
Seller shall, at its expense, timely file any Tax Return or other document
with respect to such Taxes or fees (and Purchaser shall cooperate with
respect thereto as necessary).

(c) Seller shall have the right to control the conduct of any audit or
administrative or judicial proceeding with respect to any Taxes of, or any Tax
Return required to be filed by, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date.

 

(d) Except to the extent treated as a Liability in the calculation of Final
Net Working Capital, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties (as defined in Section 8.2(a)) from and against (i) any
Losses attributable to any breach or violation of, or failure to fully
perform, any covenant, agreement, undertaking or obligation in this Section
5.11; and (ii) all Income Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all
periods ending on or before the Closing Date; in each of the above cases,
together with any out of pocket fees and expenses (including attorneys
and accountants fees) incurred in connection therewith. Seller shall
reimburse Purchaser for any Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that are the responsibility of Seller pursuant to this Section 5.11 within ten
Business Days after payment of such Taxes by any of the Purchase Indemnified
Parties. Payments made pursuant to this Section 5.11(d) shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price unless otherwise required by Law.

 

(e) Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other partys request) promptly providing and in all
event within thirty (30) days of the request of the other party of records
and information reasonably relevant to the filings of any Tax Returns and to
any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Purchaser and Seller shall
retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the
Company or its Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before
the Closing Date until expiration of the statute of limitations (taking into
account any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods.

 



65 (f) Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall, without the prior written consent of
Seller, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, (i) make or change any
Tax election affecting a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date
of Seller or any of its Affiliates (including, before the Closing, the
Company and its Subsidiaries), (ii) amend, refile or otherwise modify (or
grant an extension of any applicable statute of limitations with respect to)
any Tax Return prepared by Seller or any of its Affiliates (including, before
the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) relating to a taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date, except as required by Law, (iii) carry
back any Tax loss or other Tax attribute from a taxable period ending after
the Closing Date to a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date or
(iv) take any action that results in any increased Tax liability (including a
reduction in a refund) or reduction of any Tax asset of any of the Company or
its Subsidiaries (or Seller or any of its Affiliates) in respect of a taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date, except as required by Law.

 

(g) Except in respect of the Conversions, without the prior written consent of
Purchaser, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, Seller (and, prior
to the Closing, the Company, its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives) shall not with respect to any Tax period ending on or before
the Closing Date, to the extent it may affect, or relate to, the Company or
its Subsidiaries, make, change or rescind any Tax election, amend any Tax
Return or take any position on any Tax Return, that would have the effect of
increasing the Tax Liability of Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries in
respect of any period commencing on or after the Closing Date. Seller agrees
hold harmless and indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the
Company and its Subsidiaries) against any increased Tax Liability of Purchaser
and its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) resulting
from Seller (and, prior to the Closing, the Company, its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives) making, changing or rescinding such Tax election,
amending such Tax Return or taking such position on a Tax Return. 

(h) If a refund of Taxes (to the extent not reflected on the Final Closing
Balance Sheet) (the " _Refund_ ") is received by or credited to the account
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of any taxable period or
portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause
such recipient to pay the amount of the Refund to Seller.

 

(i) Not more than sixty (60) days after the determination of the Final Closing
Adjustment, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a written statement
setting forth the allocation for U.S. federal income Tax purposes of the
Purchase Price and any Liabilities of the Company or its Subsidiaries, to the
extent relevant, among the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder (the " _Purchase Price Allocation_ "). Seller shall deliver to
Purchaser any

 



66  documentation reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with its
review of the Purchase Price Allocation. Purchaser and Seller shall endeavor
in good faith to agree on the Purchase Price Allocation. Unless otherwise
agreed among Purchaser and Seller, if Purchaser and Seller have not agreed on
the Purchase Price Allocation within ninety (90) days following the
determination of the Final Closing Adjustment, then any disputed matter(s)
will be finally and conclusively resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm,
as promptly as practicable, and such resolution(s) will be reflected in the
Purchase Price Allocation. Purchaser and Seller shall each use its reasonable
best efforts to furnish to the Independent Accounting Firm such work papers
and other documents and information pertaining to each disputed item as the
Independent Accounting Firm may request. Purchaser and Seller shall bear their
own expenses in the preparation and review of the Purchase Price Allocation,
except that the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
paid one-half by Purchaser and one-half by Seller. Purchaser and Seller shall
file all Tax Returns (including, but not limited to, IRS Form 8594)
consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation, and shall not take any position
inconsistent with the Purchase Price Allocation; _provided_ that the Purchase
Price Allocation shall be adjusted by any other subsequent payment made under
this Agreement that affects the Purchase Price for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes.

(j) Any and all existing Tax sharing agreements (whether written or not)
binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be terminated prior
to or as of the Closing Date. After such date, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries will have any further Liabilities thereunder.

(k) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the provision
of Section 3.14 and this Section 5.11 shall survive for the full period all
of applicable statues of limitations (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation
or extension thereof) plus 60 days.

 

(l) The indemnification provisions in Article VIII shall apply to this Section
5.11. To the extent that any obligation or responsibility pursuant to Article
VIII may overlap with an obligation or responsibility pursuant to this Section
5.11, the provisions of this Section 5.11 shall govern.

 

Section 5.12 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_.

 

(a) For a period of five (5) years commencing on the Closing Date (the "
_Restricted Period_ "), Seller shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, (i) engage in or assist others in
engaging in the Restricted Business in the Territory; (ii) have an interest in
any Person that engages directly or indirectly in the Restricted Business in
the Territory in any capacity, including as a partner, shareholder, member,
employee, principal, agent, trustee or consultant; or (iii) intentionally
interfere in any material respect with the business relationships (whether
formed prior to or after the date of this Agreement) between the Company and
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and customers or suppliers of the Company
and

 



67  its Subsidiaries, on the other hand. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller
may own, directly or indirectly, solely as an investment, securities of any
Person traded on any national securities exchange if Seller is not a
controlling Person of, or a member of a group which controls, such Person and
does not, directly or indirectly, own 5% or more of any class of securities of
such Person.

 

(b) During the Restricted Period, Seller shall not, and shall not permit any
of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, hire or solicit any employee of
the Company or its Subsidiaries or encourage any such employee to leave such
employment or hire any such employee who has left such employment, except
pursuant to a general solicitation which is not directed specifically to any
such employees; _provided_ , that nothing in this Section 5.12(b) shall
prevent Seller or any of its Affiliates from hiring (i) any employee whose
employment has been terminated by the Company, its Subsidiaries, or
Purchaser, (ii) after 365 days from the date of termination of employment,
any employee whose employment has been terminated by the employee, (iii) any
employee who responds to solicitation not specifically targeted at employees
of the Company or its Subsidiaries (including by a search firm or recruiting
agency) or (iv) any employee who initiates discussions regarding employment
without any solicitation by Seller or any of its Affiliates in violation of
this Agreement.

 

(c) During the Restricted Period, Seller shall not, and shall not permit any
of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, solicit or entice, or attempt
to solicit or entice, any clients or customers of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or potential clients or customers of the Company or its
Subsidiaries for purposes of diverting their business or services from the
Company or its Subsidiaries.

(d) Seller acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach of this Section
5.12 would give rise to irreparable harm to Purchaser, for which monetary
damages would not be an adequate remedy, and hereby agrees that in the event
of a breach or a threatened breach by Seller of any such obligations,
Purchaser shall, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that
may be available to it in respect of such breach, be entitled to equitable
relief, including a temporary restraining order, an injunction, specific
performance and any other relief that may be available from a court of
competent jurisdiction (without any requirement to post bond).

(e) Seller acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Section 5.12
are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Purchaser
and constitute a material inducement to Purchaser to enter into this Agreement
and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event
that any covenant contained in this Section 5.12 should ever be adjudicated
to exceed the time, geographic, product or service, or other limitations
permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then any court is expressly
empowered to reform such covenant, and such covenant shall be deemed
reformed, in such jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic, product or
service, or other limitations permitted

 



68  by applicable Law. The covenants contained in this Section 5.12 and each
provision hereof are severable and distinct covenants and provisions. The
invalidity or unenforceability of any such covenant or provision as written
shall not invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining covenants or
provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such covenant
or provision in any other jurisdiction.

Section 5.13 _Release_. From and after the Closing, Seller, on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates, hereby releases and forever discharges Purchaser,
the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries and each of their respective
Affiliates (collectively, the " _Purchaser Releasees_ ") from any and all
claims, demands, actions, Contracts and Liabilities and Costs whatsoever,
whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, both at Law and in equity,
which Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries)
now has, has ever had or may hereafter have against the respective Purchaser
Releasees arising prior to or contemporaneously with the Closing or on account
of or arising out of any matter, cause or event occurring contemporaneously
with or prior to the Closing, whether or not relating to claims pending on,
or asserted after, the Closing. From and after the Closing, Purchaser, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby releases and forever discharges
Seller, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective
Affiliates (collectively, the " _Seller Releasees_ ") from any and all
claims, demands, actions, Contracts and Liabilities and Costs whatsoever,
whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, both at Law and in equity,
which Company or its Affiliates now has, has ever had or may hereafter have
against the respective Seller Releasees arising prior to or contemporaneously
with the Closing or on account of or arising out of any matter, cause or event
occurring contemporaneously with or prior to the Closing, whether or not
relating to claims pending on, or asserted after, the Closing. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.13 shall in any way limit or
otherwise restrict any rights Seller may have against Purchaser or Purchaser
may have against Seller arising out of, relating to or in connection with this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby.

 

Section 5.14 _Financing_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing, including using
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect thereto and (ii) satisfy (or seek a waiver of) on
a timely basis all conditions within the control of Purchaser and required to
be satisfied by it, and otherwise comply with all terms applicable to
Purchaser, in such definitive agreements. Purchaser shall deliver to Seller
true and complete copies of all commitment letters pursuant to which any
lender or other financing source (each, a " _Financing Source_ ") shall have
committed to provide Purchaser with any portion of the Financing. Purchaser
shall keep Seller reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange
and secure the Financing.

 



69 (b) Seller shall, and shall cause the Company to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Purchaser and/or
the Financing Sources that is necessary and customary to assist Purchaser in
connection with Purchaser obtaining the Financing, including, to the extent
permitted by lessors or sub-lessors, as the case may be, the recording of
leases, sub-leases or memoranda thereof constituting the Material Leased Real
Property, _provided_ that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

Section 5.15 _Conversions to LLCs_. Not less than five (5) Business days prior
to the Closing date, Seller shall cause the Company and all of the
Subsidiaries of the Company to be converted from corporations to Kentucky
limited liability companies (the " _Conversions_ ") and Seller shall provide
Purchaser with evidence reasonably satisfactory thereof, together with a copy
of all documents, agreements and instruments executed in connection therewith.

Section 5.16  _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions herein provided, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause
to be taken all actions, to do or cause to be done and to assist and
cooperate with the other party in doing all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated hereby,
including (a) the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the obligations
of any of the parties, (b) the obtaining of applicable consents, waivers or
approvals of any Governmental Entities or third parties, (c) the defending of
any Actions challenging this Agreement or the performance of the obligations
hereunder and (d) the execution and delivery of such instruments, and the
taking of such other actions as the other party may reasonably require in
order to carry out the intent of this Agreement. Except as expressly set forth
in this Agreement, and notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Purchaser,
Seller, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates shall be obligated
to grant or expend anything of material value, or perform any extraordinary
service or other extraordinary actions, to obtain any applicable consent,
waiver or approval.

 

Section 5.17 _Further Assurances_. Following the Closing, each of the parties
hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute and
deliver such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances and
take such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the
provisions hereof and give effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 5.18 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing, Seller shall promptly notify
Purchaser in writing of:

 

(i) any fact, circumstance, event or action the existence, occurrence or
taking of which (A) has had, or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in

 



70  the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or (B) has resulted in, or would
reasonably be expected to result in, the failure of any of the conditions set
forth in ARTICLE VI to be satisfied; 

(ii) any written notice or other written communication from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(iii) any written notice or other written communication from any Governmental
Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

(iv) any Actions commenced or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting Seller, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have
been required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section 3.10 or that
challenges the validity or enforceability of this Agreement.

(b) Purchasers receipt of information pursuant to this Section 5.18 shall
not operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation, warranty or
agreement given or made by Seller in this Agreement (including Section 8.2)
and shall not be deemed to amend or supplement the Seller Disclosure
Schedule.

Section 5.19 _No Solicitation of Other Bids_.

 

(a) Seller shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its Affiliates
(including the Company or its Subsidiaries) or any of its or their
Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) encourage, solicit, initiate,
facilitate or continue inquiries regarding an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter
into discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to,
any Person concerning a possible Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into
any agreements or other instruments (whether or not binding) regarding an

terminated, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company) and all of
its and their Representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated,
all existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore
with respect to, or that could lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. For purposes
hereof, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any inquiry, proposal or offer

a merger, consolidation, liquidation, recapitalization, share exchange or
other business combination transaction involving the Company or its

other equity securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries; or (iii) the
sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of any significant portion of the
properties or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 



71 (b) Seller agrees that the rights and remedies for noncompliance with this
Section 5.19 shall include having such provision specifically enforced by any
court having equity jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that any
such breach or threatened breach shall cause irreparable injury to Purchaser
and that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy to Purchaser.

Section 5.20 _Excess Coal Inventory_. From the Closing Date until the date
the Excess Coal Inventory Value is paid in full, Purchaser shall, and shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries, after the Closing to use commercially
reasonable efforts to perform its and their respective obligations under any

(a) by mutual written consent of Purchaser and Seller;

 

(b) by Seller or Purchaser, by written notice to the other, if the Closing
shall not have occurred on or before December 31, 2014 (the " _Outside Date_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 7.1(b) shall not be available to such party if the failure of
such party to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall have been the
cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or
prior to such date;

(c) by Seller or Purchaser, by written notice to the other, if there shall be
a final and non-appealable Governmental Order in effect permanently
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 7.1(c) shall not be available to such party if
the failure of such party to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall
have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, such Governmental Order;

(d) by Purchaser if there shall have been (i) a breach of any of the
representations and warranties of Seller set forth in this Agreement, which
breach would cause the condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) not to be
satisfied, or (ii) a breach of any of the covenants or agreements on the part
of Seller set forth in this Agreement, which breach would cause the condition
set forth in Section 6.2(b) not to be satisfied (and, in the case of either
(i) or (ii) above, such breach is not cured within 30 days after receipt of
written notice thereof or is incapable of being cured by Seller by the
Outside Date); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 7.1(d) shall not be available to Purchaser if the
failure of Purchaser to fulfill any of its obligations under this Agreement
shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, such breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Seller; or

 



74 (e) by Seller if there shall have been (i) a breach of any of the
representations and warranties of Purchaser set forth in this Agreement,
which breach would cause the condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) not to be
satisfied, or (ii) a breach of any of the covenants or agreements on the part
of Purchaser set forth in this Agreement, which breach would cause the
condition set forth in Section 6.3(b) not to be satisfied (and, in the case of
either (i) or (ii) above, such breach is not cured within 30 days after
receipt of written notice thereof or is incapable of being cured by Purchaser
by the Outside Date); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 7.1(e) shall not be available to Seller if
the failure of Seller to fulfill any of its obligations under this Agreement
shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, such breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Purchaser.

 

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by a party pursuant to Section 7.1, written notice thereof shall
forthwith be given by the terminating party to the other party, and this
Agreement shall thereupon terminate and become void and have no effect, and

further action by the parties, except that the provisions of Section 5.4(a),
this Section 7.2 and Article IX shall survive the termination of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if such termination shall have been
caused by, or shall have resulted from, the willful and material breach by a
party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement, Seller, on the one hand, or Purchaser, on the other
hand, as the case may be, shall be fully liable for any and all Losses of the

Section 8.1 _Survival_.

 

(a) The representations and warranties contained in Article III and Article IV

following the Closing, after which time such representations and warranties
shall terminate and have no further force or effect (and no claim arising from

75 (b) All covenants and agreements contained herein shall survive the Closing
indefinitely or for the period explicitly specified therein.

(c) The period of time a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement

agreement. In the event notice of any claim for indemnification under this
Article VIII shall have been given within the applicable Survival Period (and
with reasonable specificity) and such claim has not been finally resolved by
the expiration of such Survival Period, the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements that are the subject of such claim shall survive with
respect to such claim until such claim is finally resolved.

Section 8.2 _Obligations of Seller_.

(a) Following the Closing, subject to the terms of this Article VIII, Seller
shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser, its Affiliates and their
respective directors and officers, shareholders, employees, representatives
and other agents (collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ ") from
and against any actual claims, Liabilities, losses, judgments, settlements,
damages, costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) (collectively, the " _Losses_ ") incurred by any Purchaser
Indemnified Party by reason of (i) any breach of any of the representations
or warranties of Seller contained in Article III (in each case, as of the
Closing Date, except to the extent such representations and warranties shall
have been expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of
such earlier date); (ii) any breach of or default in the performance of any
of the covenants or agreements of Seller contained in this Agreement; (iii)
the Excluded Liabilities; or (iv) any Liabilities or Costs of Seller or any of
its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) or the
businesses, Contracts, properties or other assets of Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), including
Liabilities or Costs arising or resulting from any guaranty, guarantee,
indemnity or similar obligation of the Company or its Subsidiaries with
respect to Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries and other than as provided in Section 5.9(a)).

 

(b) The obligation of Seller to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Party for
Losses in accordance with Section 8.2(a)(i) shall be subject to the following
limitations: (i) Seller shall not be required to provide indemnification to
any Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) unless the
aggregate amount of Losses incurred by all the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
in respect of all Claims against Seller for indemnification under Section
8.2(a)(i) (" _Purchaser Claims_ ") exceeds $1,000,000 (the " _Basket_ "),
_provided_ , that once the Basket has been exceeded, the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification for only the amount
in excess of the Basket, _provided_ _further_ that once the Basket has been
exceeded, no Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to make a claim
against Seller for indemnification under Section 8.2(a)(i) unless and until
the aggregate amount of Losses incurred

 



76  by such Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to the event or occurrence
giving rise to such Purchaser Claim exceeds $10,000; and (ii) in no event
shall the aggregate amount of Losses for which Seller is obligated to
indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i)
exceed 15% of the Purchase Price (the " _Ceiling_ "). Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, the limitations contained in this Section
8.2(b) shall not apply to Purchaser Claims under Section 8.2(a)(i) for breach
of representations or warranties contained in Section 3.1 (Corporate Status),
Section 3.2 (Authorization), Section 3.5 (Capital Structure), Section 3.14
(Taxes), and Section 3.25 (Brokers Fees).

Section 8.3 _Obligations of Purchaser_.

(a) Following the Closing, subject to the terms of this Article VIII,
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates and their
respective directors and officers, shareholders, employees, representatives
and other agents (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from and
against any Losses incurred by any Seller Indemnified Party by reason of (i)
any breach of any of the representations or warranties of Purchaser contained
in Article IV (in each case, as of the Closing Date, except to the extent such
representations and warranties shall have been expressly made as of an
earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date), (ii) any breach of or
default in the performance of any of the covenants or agreements of Purchaser
contained in this Agreement that by their terms are to be performed in whole
or in part, or which prohibit actions, subsequent to the Closing Date,
including without limitation Purchasers obligations under Section 5.2(a);
(iii) the conduct of the Business during the Interim Period, including by
reason of any actions or failures to act of Purchaser relating to the
Business, the Coal Mining Permits and Environmental Permits (including bonds
and other security therefor), the Owned Real Property, the Leased Real
Property and Purchasers mining operations or (iv) any Liabilities or Costs
of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (other than Liabilities or Costs of the

Subsidiaries that are not Excluded Liabilities and that arise from events,
circumstances, actions, or any failure to act prior to the Closing).

(b) The obligation of Purchaser to indemnify any Seller Indemnified Party for
Losses in accordance with Section 8.3(a)(i) shall be subject to the following
limitations: (i) Purchaser shall not be required to provide indemnification to
any Seller Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 8.3(a)(i) unless the
aggregate amount of Losses incurred by all the Seller Indemnified Parties in
respect of all claims against Purchaser for Indemnification under Section
6.3(a)(i) ("Seller Claims") exceeds the Basket, _provided_ , that once the
Basket has been exceeded, the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
indemnification for only the amount in excess of the Basket; and (iii) in no
event shall the aggregate amount of Losses for which Purchaser is obligated
to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 8.3(a)(i)
exceed the Ceiling.

 



77 Section 8.4 _Indemnification Procedures and Limitations_.

 

(a) In the event that any Action is commenced by a third party involving a
claim for which a party required to provide indemnification hereunder (an "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") may be liable to a party entitled to indemnification
(an " _Indemnified Party_ ") hereunder (an " _Asserted Liability_ "), the
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of
such Asserted Liability (the " _Claim Notice_ "); _provided_ , that no delay
on the part of the Indemnified Party in giving any such Claim Notice shall
relieve the Indemnifying Party of any indemnification obligation hereunder,
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such delay.
Any Claim Notice shall set forth, with as much specificity as is reasonably
practicable, the basis of the claim for the Losses, the section(s) of this
Agreement that form the basis for such claim, copies of all material written
materials relating to such claim and, to the extent reasonably practicable, a
reasonable estimate of the amount of the Losses that have been or may
be incurred by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party, upon giving
written notice to such Indemnified Party, will be entitled to assume the
defense of such Asserted Liability, in whole or in part, at its own cost, with
counsel of its own choosing and, in such an event, (i) the Indemnifying Party
will be entitled to prosecute, appeal, negotiate, resolve, settle, compromise,
arbitrate or otherwise pursue such Asserted Liability and (ii) the
Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation to indemnify or pay for or
reimburse any Indemnified Party for any attorneys fees, investigation costs
or litigation expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party after the assumption
of the defense of such Asserted Liability;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, settle, compromise, resolve or consent to the entry of any
judgment in respect of any Asserted Liability if any Indemnified Party is a
party to the applicable claim or has been actually threatened to be made a
party thereto unless such settlement, compromise, resolution or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all
liability arising out of such Asserted Liability and provides solely for
monetary relief to be satisfied by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying
Party undertakes to defend against such Asserted Liability, the Indemnified
Party shall: (i) fully cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel
in the investigation, defense and settlement thereof and (ii) have the right,
at its own cost and expense, to participate in the defense of any Asserted
Liability with counsel selected by it (and reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnifying Party) subject to the Indemnifying Partys right to control the
defense thereof. The fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be at the
expense of the Indemnified Party, _provided_ , that if in the reasonable
opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, (A) there are legal defenses
available to an Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to
those available to the Indemnifying Party; or (B) there exists a conflict of
interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot
be waived, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party in each jurisdiction for which
the Indemnified Party determines counsel is required. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to control, pay or
settle any Asserted Liability that the Indemnifying Party shall have
undertaken to defend, so long as the Indemnified Party shall also waive any
right to indemnification therefor by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying
Party

 



78  shall not be liable for any settlement of any Asserted Liability by an
Indemnified Party without the Indemnifying Partys written consent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon notice to the Indemnifying Party by the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the
defense or control of a Asserted Liability and shall pay the fees and expenses
of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party hereunder if (x) such Asserted
Liability relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding,
action, indictment, allegation or investigation, or (y) such Asserted
Liability seeks injunctive or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party, _provided_ that, in any such case, the party against which
the Asserted Liability is asserted hereunder shall have the right to retain
its own counsel (but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the
expense of such party) and participate in the defense of such Asserted
Liability, and the Indemnified Party shall not be liable for any settlement of
such Asserted Liability without its written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld).

 

(b) In calculating amounts payable to an Indemnified Party, the amount of any
indemnified Losses shall be determined without duplication of any other Loss
for which an indemnification claim has been made under any other
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement and shall be computed net of
(i) payments received or reasonably expected to be received by the Indemnified
Party under any insurance policy with respect to such Losses, (ii) any prior
or subsequent recovery by the Indemnified Party from any Person with respect
to such Losses and (iii) any net Tax benefit realized or reasonably expected
to be realized by the Indemnified Party with respect to such Losses. If an
Indemnified Party realizes a Tax benefit or receives an amount under insurance
coverage with respect to Losses sustained at any time subsequent to any
indemnification provided pursuant to this Article VIII, then such Indemnified
Party shall promptly reimburse the applicable Indemnifying Party for any
payment made by such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such
indemnification up to such amount realized or received by the Indemnified
Party.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall
any Indemnified Party be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article
VIII, or to make a claim for breach of any other provision of this Agreement
or to any other remedy at Law or in equity, (i) if such Indemnified Party has
expressly waived in writing the breach of or inaccuracy in a representation
or warranty or the failure to perform a covenant or agreement made by the
other party, which, for purposes of clarification, shall not include any
implied waiver resulting from the Closing or otherwise, (ii) with respect to
any Liability that was the subject of a dispute submitted to, and resolved by,
the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to Section 2.3(f) or that was
resolved by written agreement of the parties pursuant to Section 2.3(f)
or (iii) to the extent any Losses were attributable to such Indemnified
Partys own fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Indemnified
Party shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate any Losses upon and after
becoming aware of any facts, matters, failures or circumstances that would
reasonably be expected to result in any Losses that are indemnifiable
hereunder. In the event the Indemnified Party shall fail to take, or cause to
be taken, such reasonable steps, then notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Indemnifying Party shall not be

 



79  required to indemnify the Indemnified Party for that portion of Losses that
could reasonably have been expected to have been avoided if the Indemnified
Party had taken such commercially reasonable steps.

(d) To the extent that the Indemnifying Party makes any payment pursuant to
this Article VIII in respect of Losses for which the Indemnified Party or any
of its Affiliates have a right to recover against a third party (including an
insurance company), the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to the right of
the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates to seek and obtain recovery
from such third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Indemnifying Party
shall be prohibited from such subrogation, the Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates, as applicable, shall seek recovery from such third party on the
Indemnifying Partys behalf and pay any such recovery to the Indemnifying
Party.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall
Seller or Purchaser be liable under this Article VIII for any punitive,
incidental, indirect, treble, special or consequential damages.

 

(f) Any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall be
treated for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law.

(g) Except in the case of fraud or willful misconduct and except as set forth
in Section 5.4, Section 5.9 and Section 5.10(b), the remedies provided in
this Article VIII shall be deemed the sole and exclusive remedies of the
parties, from and after the Closing Date, with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall
not prevent or prohibit any party hereto from seeking specific performance,
injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy.

 

ARTICLE IX

this Agreement and all the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall be
entitled to assign this Agreement and its right hereunder, in whole or in
part, to any of its Affiliates without any consent from Seller, but Purchaser
shall not be relieved from any liability hereunder as a result of such
assignment.

Court of Chancery located in Wilmington, Delaware, to the extent such court
can assert jurisdiction over such judicial Action and otherwise in any
state court located in Wilmington, Delaware or the courts of the United
States located in Wilmington, Delaware. By executing and delivering this
Agreement, the parties irrevocably: (a) accept generally and unconditionally

in accordance with Section 9.4; and (d) agree that service as provided in
clause (c) above is sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction over such party
in any such Action in any such court, and otherwise constitutes effective

Section 9.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule, the Seller Disclosure Schedule and the Exhibits) and the
other Transaction Documents constitute the entire agreement between the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede
all prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings, both oral and

Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive and remain in effect until
expiration or termination thereof in accordance with its terms and this
Agreement.

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section,
Schedule or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article, Section, Schedule
or Exhibit of or to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.

(b) Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this

limitation."

reference shall be to a party or parties to this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated.

(d) Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms "hereof,"

(g) This Agreement was prepared jointly by the parties and no rule that it be

Section 9.9 _Seller Disclosure Schedule_. Although Seller will use its
reasonable best efforts to cross-reference applicable Sections of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule where appropriate, any matter disclosed in any Section of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed for all
purposes of this Agreement and all other Sections of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule to the extent that it is readily apparent that such disclosure is
applicable to such other Sections of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. The
inclusion of any information in any Section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment or otherwise imply
that such information is required to be listed in any Section of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule or that any such matter rises to a Material
Adverse Effect or is material to or outside the ordinary course of business
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Business (or that any such
matter is above any specified threshold). Matters reflected in the Seller

references in the Seller Disclosure Schedule to the enforceability of
agreements with third parties, the existence or non-existence of third-party
rights, the absence of breaches or defaults by third parties, or similar
matters or statements, are intended only to allocate rights and risks between
Purchaser and Seller and are not intended to be admissions against interests,
give rise to any inference or proof of accuracy, be admissible against any
party to this Agreement by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement,
or give rise to any claim or benefit to any Person who is not a party to this
Agreement. In addition, the disclosure of any matter in the Seller Disclosure
Schedule is not to be deemed an admission that such matter actually
constitutes non-compliance with, or a violation of, any Law, Permit or
Contract or other topic to which such disclosure is applicable. In no event
shall the disclosure of matters disclosed in the Seller Disclosure Schedule
or the Electronic Data Room be deemed or interpreted to broaden Sellers
