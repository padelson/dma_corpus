following the date upon which all Closing Conditions are satisfied or waived
in writing (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) in accordance with
_Article IX_ (other than those Closing Conditions that by their nature can
only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
those Closing Conditions at such time), or on such other date or at such
other time or place as the Parties may agree in writing. The date on which the

collectively by the holders of a majority of the Company Shares (the "Company
Appointee") promptly following the Agreement Date and in no event later than
ten (10) Business Days following the Agreement Date (such nominees, the "
_Post-Closing Board_ "). Buyer will take all necessary action to cause the
Buyer Board to nominate the Company Appointee for election to the Surviving

on the part of any party or the holders of any securities of Buyer or the
Company, the following shall occur:

  



  

(i) each Company Class A Share outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, other than any Excluded Share, will automatically be
canceled and the Buyer will issue as consideration therefor (1) a number of
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Buyer
Class A Common Stock equal to the Class A First Lien Exchange Ratio, subject
to adjustment in accordance with _Section 2.06(b)_ and (2) a number of
shares of Buyer Class C Common Stock equal to the Class C Exchange Ratio
(together, the "Per Class A Share Merger Consideration");

  



  

(ii) each Company Class B Share outstanding immediately prior to

each outstanding warrant to purchase Company Class B Shares will
automatically be canceled and retired and will cease to exist, and no
consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor;

  



  

   

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(v) each share of capital stock of Buyer issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding
following the consummation of the Merger; and

  



  

(vi) concurrently with the cancellation of Company Shares in
exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section
2.06(a)_, all Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and will cease to exist, and each
shareholder of the Company, other than a shareholder that owns Excluded
Shares, shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such
securities, except the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration.

  



  

(b) If, during the period from the date of this Agreement through
the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Buyer Common Stock are changed
into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split,
division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
combination of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, or if a stock dividend is declared by Buyer during such period,
then the Class A First Lien Exchange Ratio and the Class A Second Lien
Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate to provide the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action.
This _Section 2.06(b)_ shall not permit Buyer to take or refrain from taking
any action which it is obligated to take or refrain from taking pursuant to
_Section 5.11_.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
fractional shares of Buyer Class A Common Stock shall be issued in
connection with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such
fractional shares shall be issued. Any holder of Company Shares who would
otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Buyer Class A Common
Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Buyer Class A Common Stock
issuable to such holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share, be paid
in cash the dollar amount (rounded down to the nearest whole cent), after
deducting any required withholding Taxes, on a pro rata basis, without
interest, determined by multiplying (x) such fraction by (y) an amount equal
to the VWAP of shares of Buyer Class A Common Stock for the 20 Trading Days
prior to the date that is three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.
Payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Class A Common Stock
shall be made solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and
inconvenience to Buyer of issuing fractional shares of Buyer Class A Common
Stock and shall not represent separately bargained-for consideration.

  



  

(d) Immediately following the Effective Time, and without any
further action on the part of any Party or the holders of any securities of
Buyer or the Company, Buyer will redeem all of the shares of Buyer Class C
Common Stock issued to the holders of Company Class A Shares in connection
with the Merger (the "Class C Common Stock Redemption"), for an aggregate
redemption price of (i) the Class C Redemption Amount, to be distributed by
the Exchange Agent and (ii) indebtedness under the Existing Second Out Credit
Agreement, as amended by the Existing Second Out Credit Agreement Amendment,
in the aggregate principal amount equal to the sum of $20,000,000 to be
issued or caused to be issued by the Surviving Corporation or one of its
Subsidiaries, in each case, _pro rata_ among the holders of such shares of
Buyer Class C Common Stock issued in connection with the Merger. For the
avoidance of doubt, all of the shares of Class C Common Stock authorized by
the Buyer Second AandR Charter and issued to the holders of Company Class A
Shares pursuant to the Per Class A Share Merger Consideration will be
delivered to and held by the Exchange Agent immediately prior to the Class C
Common Stock Redemption and, with respect to each holder of Company Class A
Shares, upon the later of (x) the completion of the Class C Common Stock
Redemption or (y) delivery by such holder of a Letter of Transmittal in
accordance with _Section 2.09(c)_, such holder shall be entitled to
receive the portion of the Class C Common Stock Redemption consideration to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to this _Section 2.06(d)_.

the effect of prohibiting or impairing any business practice of Buyer or any
acquisition of property by Buyer or the conduct of business by Buyer as
currently conducted or as contemplated to be conducted as of the Closing

arrangement or action that limits in any respect such Person's or entity's
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any business,
products, rights, services, licenses, assets or properties of such Person or
entity or any of such entity's Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or any interest
therein and (y) Buyer to (and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall
not, without the prior written consent of Buyer) take any action with respect
to the assets of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in connection with
any sale, divestiture, license, disposition, restriction on, holding
separate, or other similar arrangement or action that limits in any respect
the Company's or such Company Subsidiary's, as applicable, freedom of action
with respect to, or its ability to retain, any business, products, rights,
services, licenses, assets or properties of the Company's or such Company
Subsidiary's, as applicable, or any interest therein, other than sale,
divestiture, license, disposition, restriction on, holding separate, or other

applicable) to distribute all of the equity interests it holds in Skillsoft
to the Surviving Corporation, in each case of such amendments or
modifications, with effect as of and subject to the occurrence of the Closing

its Subsidiaries shall not be required to take any action in respect of any
Debt Amendment until Buyer shall have provided the Company with drafts of the
material agreements required in connection with such Debt Amendment
(collectively, the  "Debt Amendment Documents"), including, to the extent
applicable, drafts of any proposed amendments to previously executed Debt
Amendment Documents. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to provide

connection with obtaining the Debt Amendments and subject to (x) any

other duties or (y) applicable law, executing any Debt Amendment Documents
necessary to obtain such Debt Amendment; __provided__ , that the effectiveness
of any such Debt Amendment Documents (or the amendments contemplated thereby)
shall be expressly conditioned on the Closing and subject to receipt of any
required Distribution Consent. Buyer shall promptly provide such information
as is reasonably requested by the Company.

  



  

(b) In connection with any Debt Amendment, Buyer may select one or
more arrangers and other agents to provide assistance in connection therewith

business combination involving the Company and one or more businesses or
assets. The Company acknowledges that it has read Buyer's final prospectus,
dated June 26, 2019, and other SEC Reports, the Buyer Organizational
Documents, and the Trust Agreement and understands that Buyer has established
the Trust Account described therein for the benefit of the Buyer Stockholders

initial public offering and private placements of its securities, and that
substantially all of these proceeds have been deposited in the Trust Account
for the benefit of its public stockholders. The Company further

2021, or, in the event of termination of this Agreement, another Business
Combination, is not consummated by July 1, 2021, or such later date as
approved by the Buyer Stockholders to complete a Business Combination, Buyer
will be obligated to return to the Buyer Stockholders the amounts being held
in the Trust Account. Accordingly, the Company (on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates) hereby waives any past, present or future claim of any kind
against, and any right to access, the Trust Account, any trustee of the Trust
Account and Buyer to collect from the Trust Account any monies that may be
owed to them by Buyer or any of its Affiliates for any reason whatsoever, and
will not seek recourse against the Trust Account at any time for any reason
whatsoever, including any willful breach of this Agreement. This _Section
5.10_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason.

or which is intended or is reasonably likely to give rise to or result in, any
offer, inquiry, proposal or indication of interest, written or oral relating
to (x) any Initial Business Combination or (y) any other Business Combination
that would reasonably be expected to (i) adversely impact the ability of

violate or otherwise breach the limitations set forth in _Section 5.11_, in
each case, other than with the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives (each, a "Business Combination
Proposal"); and provided, that Buyer shall provide the Company with written

Section 11.07. _Assignment_. This Agreement will be binding upon and

permitted assigns of the Parties. No Party may assign (whether by operation

contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this

estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure; _provided_ ,
that any such waiver shall be in a written instrument duly executed by the
waiving Party. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise, and no delay
in exercising, any right, power or remedy under this Agreement shall operate
as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such right,
power or remedy by such Party preclude any other or further exercise thereof
or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

Section 11.12. _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and any Action that may
be based upon, arise out of or relate or be incidental to any Transaction,
this Agreement, the negotiation, execution, performance or consummation of
the foregoing or the inducement of any Party to enter into the foregoing,
whether for breach of Contract, tortious conduct or otherwise, and whether now
existing or hereafter arising (each, a "Transaction Dispute"), will be
exclusively governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with
the internal Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any Law
that would cause the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware to be applied.

  



  

Section 11.13. _Dispute Resolution; Consent to Jurisdiction_.

  



  

(a) The Parties agree to unconditionally and irrevocably submit to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
(or, only if such court declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, then in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware
or, if jurisdiction is not then available in the United States District Court
for the District of Delaware (but only in such event), then in any Delaware
state court sitting in New Castle County) and any appellate court from any of
such courts, for the resolution of any Transaction Dispute. In that context,
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Party irrevocably
and unconditionally:

  



  

(i) submits for itself and its property to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts with respect to any Transaction Dispute and for
recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, and agrees
that all claims in respect of any Transaction Dispute shall be heard and
determined in such courts;

  



  

(ii) agrees that venue would be proper in such courts, and waives any
objection that it may now or hereafter have that any such court is
an improper or inconvenient forum for the resolution of any Transaction
Dispute; and

  



  

(iii) agrees that the mailing by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, to the Persons listed in _Section 11.03_ (as may be
updated from time to time in accordance with _Section 11.03_) of any process
required by any such court, will be effective service of process; _provided_
, _however_ , that nothing herein will be deemed to prevent a Party from
making service of process by any means authorized by the Laws of the State of
Delaware.

  



  

(b) The foregoing consent to jurisdiction will not constitute
submission to jurisdiction or general consent to service of process in
the State of Delaware for any purpose except with respect to any Transaction
Dispute.

  



  

Section 11.14. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. To the maximum extent permitted
by Law, each Party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right to
trial by jury in any forum in respect of any Transaction Dispute and
covenants that neither it nor any of its Affiliates or Representatives will
assert (whether as plaintiff, defendant or otherwise) any right to such trial
by jury. Each Party certifies and acknowledges that (a) such Party has
considered the implications of this waiver, (b) such Party makes this waiver
voluntarily and (c) such waiver constitutes a material inducement upon which
such Party is relying and will rely in entering into the this Agreement. Each
Party may file an original counterpart or a copy of this _Section 11.14_ with
any court as written evidence of the consent of each Party to the waiver of
its right to trial by jury.

  



  

   

 | 65| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 11.15. _Admissibility into Evidence_. All offers of compromise
or settlement among the Parties or their Representatives in connection with
the attempted resolution of any Transaction Dispute (a) shall be deemed to
have been delivered in furtherance of a Transaction Dispute settlement, (b)
shall be exempt from discovery and production and (c) shall not be admissible
into evidence (whether as an admission or otherwise) in any proceeding for
the resolution of the Transaction Dispute.

  



  

Section 11.16. _Remedies; Specific Performance_.

  



  

(a) Except to the extent set forth otherwise in this Agreement, all
remedies under this Agreement expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
Law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

  



  

(b) Each Party agrees that irreparable damage would occur and the
Parties would not have an adequate remedy at law if any provision of
this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is
otherwise breached. Accordingly, each Party agrees that the other Party will
be entitled to injunctive relief from time to time to prevent breaches of the
provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in each case (i) without the requirement of
posting any bond or other indemnity and (ii) in addition to any other remedy
to which it may be entitled, at law or in equity. Furthermore, each Party
agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy
of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches of this Agreement,
and to specifically enforce the terms of this Agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of such Party under this Agreement. Each Party
expressly disclaims that it is owed any duty not expressly set forth in this
Agreement, and waives and releases all tort claims and tort causes of action
that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 11.17. _Non-Recourse_. All claims, obligations, Liabilities,
Actions or causes of action (whether in Contract or in tort, in law or in
equity, or granted by statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise
under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution, or performance of this
Agreement (including any representation or warranty made in, in connection
with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement), may be made only against (and
are expressly limited to) the entities that are expressly identified as
parties hereto in the preamble to this Agreement or, if applicable, their
successors and assigns ("Contracting Parties"). No Person who is not a
Contracting Party, including any past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate,
agent, consultant, attorney, accountants or representative of, and any
financial advisor or lender to or other financing source of, any Contracting
Party, or any director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
manager, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, or representative of, and
any financial advisor or lender to or other financing source of, any of the
foregoing ("Nonparty Affiliates"), shall have any Liability (whether in
Contract or in tort, in law or in equity) for any claims, obligations,
Liabilities, Actions or causes of action arising under, out of, in connection
with, or related in any manner to this Agreement or based on, in respect of,
or by reason of this Agreement or their negotiation, execution, performance,
or breach; and, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, each Contracting
Party hereby waives and releases all such claims, obligations, Liabilities,
Actions and causes of action against any such Nonparty Affiliates. Nothing in
this Agreement shall create or be deemed to create any third party beneficiary
rights in any Person or entity not a party to this Agreement (it being
expressly agreed that the Nonparty Affiliates to whom this _Section
11.17_ applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 11.17_).

Section 11.18. _Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits_. The Disclosure
Schedules, Schedules and Exhibits attached to this Agreement shall be
construed with and as an integral part of this Agreement to the same extent
as if the same had been set forth verbatim herein. Any capitalized terms used
in any Exhibit or Schedule or in the Disclosure Schedules but not otherwise
defined therein shall be defined as set forth in this Agreement. The
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement are
made and given subject to the disclosures contained in the Disclosure
Schedules, and neither the Company nor any of their Affiliates shall be, or
deemed to be, in breach of any such representations and warranties (and no
claim shall lie in respect thereof) in respect of any such matter so
disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules. Any matter, information or item
disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules, under any specific representation or
warranty or Schedule or section thereof shall be deemed to be disclosed and
incorporated by reference in any other Schedule or section of the Disclosure
Schedule to the extent it is reasonably apparent from the face of such
disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other Schedule(s) or
section(s). The inclusion of any matter, information or item in the
Disclosure Schedules as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not
be deemed to constitute (a) an admission of any Liability by the Company or
its Affiliates to any third party, (b) an admission that any breach or
violation of applicable Laws or any contract or agreement to which the
Company or any of its Affiliates is a party exists or has actually occurred,
(c) an admission that such item is outside the ordinary course of business or
not consistent with past practice, or (d) otherwise imply an admission that
such item represents a material exception or material fact, event,
circumstance or that such item has had, or would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. The Disclosure Schedules have been arranged
for purposes of convenience in separately titled Schedules corresponding to
the Sections of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 11.19. _Provision Respecting Legal Representation_. Each Party
to this Agreement agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates
and Representatives, that Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP may serve as counsel to
the Company, on the one hand, and any Company Subsidiary, on the other hand,
in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of the
Transaction Agreements and the consummation of the Transactions, and that,
following consummation of the Transactions, Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP may
serve as counsel to either of the Company or any Affiliate or Representative
of either of the Company, in connection with any litigation, claim or
obligation arising out of or relating to the Transactions and the Transaction
Agreements notwithstanding such prior representation of any Company
Subsidiary and each Party consents thereto and waives any conflict of interest
arising therefrom, and each Party shall cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to consent to waive any conflict of interest arising
from such representation.

  



  

Section 11.20. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which when
taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Facsimiles,
e-mail transmission of .pdf signatures or other electronic copies
of signatures shall be deemed to be originals.

Affiliates and subsidiaries acting on its behalf not to and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives
acting on its or their respective behalf not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any
inquiries or requests for information with respect to, or the making of,
any inquiry regarding, or any proposal or offer that constitutes any, or
would reasonably be expected to result in or lead to, Alternative Proposal,
(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any negotiations
concerning, or provide access to its properties, books and records or any
confidential information or data to, any Person relating to any proposal,

recommend, any Alternative Proposal, (iv) execute or enter into, any letter
of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
confidentiality agreement, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, exchange

other similar agreement for or relating to any Alternative Proposal or (v)
resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing. The Shareholder agrees
that immediately following the execution of this Agreement it shall, and
shall cause each of its Affiliates and subsidiaries and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their Representatives acting on its
or their respective behalf to, cease any solicitations or negotiations with
any Person (other than the Parties and their respective Representatives acting

Alternative Proposal or any inquiry or request for information that would
reasonably be expected to lead to, or result in, an Alternative Proposal. The
Shareholder shall promptly notify (and in any event within three Business
Days), in writing, Acquiror of the receipt by the Shareholder in such capacity
of any written proposal or written offer that constitutes an Alternative
Proposal. " _Alternative Proposal_ " has the meaning ascribed to such term in
the Merger Agreement, and means any offer or proposal involving any third
party to, (A) issue, sell or otherwise transfer any interest in the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries or all or any material portion of its
or their assets, or (B) enter into any definitive agreement with respect to,
or otherwise effect, any Other Sale (as defined in the Amended and Restated
Articles of Incorporation of the Company, filed on August 27, 2020) other than
with Buyer or any of its Affiliates, recapitalization, refinancing, merger or
other similar transaction involving the Company or the Company Subsidiaries.
For the avoidance of doubt, any Transfer or purported Transfer of Covered
Shares that is permitted under the terms of Section 6(c) shall not constitute
an Alternative Proposal for the purposes of this Section 6(a).

  



  

   

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Company Actions_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, (i) the Shareholder shall not be responsible for the actions
of the Company or its board of directors (or any committee thereof), any
Subsidiary of the Company, or any officers, directors (in their capacity as
such), employees, professional advisors and other stockholders of any of the
foregoing (the " _Company Related Parties_ "), including with respect to any
of the matters contemplated by Section 6(a), (ii) the Shareholder makes no
representations or warranties with respect to the actions of any of the
Company Related Parties and (iii) any breach by the Company of its
obligations under Section 5.16(a) of the Merger Agreement shall not be
considered a breach of Section 6(a) (it being understood for the avoidance of
doubt that the Shareholder shall remain responsible for any breach by it or
its Representatives acting on its behalf (other than any such Representative
that is a Company Related Party) of Section 6(a)).

  



  

(c) _Transfers of Covered Shares_. Prior to the Termination Date,
the Shareholder hereby agrees not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
sell, transfer, pledge, encumber, assign, hedge, swap, convert or otherwise
dispose of (including by merger (including by conversion into securities or
other consideration), by tendering into any tender or exchange offer, by
testamentary disposition, by operation of Law or otherwise), either
voluntarily or involuntarily (collectively, " _Transfer_ "), or enter into any
Contract or option with respect to the Transfer of any of the Shareholder's
Covered Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall prohibit
any Transfer if, as a precondition to such Transfer, (i) the transferee agrees
in a writing, such writing to be substantially in the form of this Agreement
or otherwise reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to Acquiror, to
assume all of the obligations of the Shareholder under, and be bound by all of
the terms of, this Agreement, (ii) for any Transfer occurring between the
date hereof until the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, the
transferee is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of SEC Rule 501 of
Regulation D, as presently in effect, (iii) for any Transfer occurring
between the date hereof until the effectiveness of the Registration Statement,
upon completion of the contemplated Transfer, the transferee will be, and, to
the extent that the Shareholder continues to be a Beneficial Owner of the
Company's shares, the Shareholder will be, a Beneficial Owner of 5% or more
of the voting equity securities of the Company and (iv) the
contemplated Transfer will not prevent the transferee, and, to the extent
that the Shareholder continues to be a Beneficial Owner of the
Company's shares, the Shareholder, from being able to issue, execute and
deliver a Drag-Along Notice (as defined in the Shareholders' Agreement) or
render such Drag-Along Notice ineffective in any way; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that any Transfer permitted under this Section 6(c) shall relieve the
Shareholder of its obligations under this Agreement in respect of the
Covered Shares so Transferred. Any transferee permitted under the preceding
sentence shall hold the Covered Shares subject to all the provisions of this
Agreement and shall execute a joinder to the Shareholders' Agreement upon the
consummation of such Transfer. Any Transfer in violation of this Section 6(c)
with respect to the Shareholder's Covered Shares shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, be null and void _ab initio_. Upon the
consummation of any Transfer effected in compliance with this Section 6(c),
the shares so transferred shall cease to be Covered Shares of the Shareholder
(and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall at such time instead be "Covered
Shares" of such transferee pursuant to the terms of the transferee's written
agreement to assume all obligations of the Shareholder under, and be bound by
all of the terms of, this Agreement).

Shareholders' Agreement in respect of the Merger Approval Proposals and (iii)
as promptly as practicable following the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement under the Securities Act and in connection with the mailing of the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to the holders of Company Shares, issue,
execute and deliver a Drag-Along Notice to the Company in accordance with and
pursuant to Section 5(a)(ii) of the Shareholders' Agreement and enforce (and

16. _Governing Law and Venue; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action based upon,
arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the Laws of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg, without giving effect to
principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules
would require or permit the application of Laws of another jurisdiction.

  



  

(b) Any Action based upon, arising out of or related to this
Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be brought in
the District Court of the City of Luxembourg ( _Tribunal d\'arrondissement
de et a Luxembourg_), and each of the parties irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such court in any such Action, waives any
objection it may now or hereafter have to personal jurisdiction, venue or to
convenience of forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the Action shall
be heard and determined only in such court, and agrees not to bring any Action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby in any other court. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to
affect the right of any party to serve process in any manner permitted by
Law, or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against any other
party in any other jurisdiction, in each case, to enforce judgments obtained
in any Action brought pursuant to this Section 16.

  



  

   

 | 9| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND
ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

  



  

17. _Assignment; Successors_. Subject to Section 6(c), no party hereto shall assign this Agreement or any part hereof without the prior written consent of the other parties. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns. Any attempted assignment in violation of the terms of this Section 17 shall be null and void, _ab initio_.

  



  

18. _Trust Account Waiver_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Shareholder acknowledges that it has read the Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated June 26, 2019, by and between the Acquiror and Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, and understands that the Acquiror has established the trust account described therein (the " _Trust Account_ ") for the benefit of the Acquiror's public stockholders and that disbursements from the Trust Account are available only in the limited circumstances set forth therein. The Shareholder further acknowledges and agrees that the Acquiror's sole assets consist of the cash proceeds of the Acquiror's initial public offering and private placements of its securities, and that substantially all of these proceeds have been deposited in the Trust Account for the benefit of its public stockholders. Accordingly, the Shareholder (on behalf of itself and its affiliates) hereby waives any past, present or future claim of any kind against, and any right to access, the Trust Account, any trustee of the Trust Account and the Acquiror to collect from the Trust Account any monies that may be owed to them by the Acquiror or any of its affiliates for any reason whatsoever, and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account at any time for any reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, for any knowing and intentional material breach by any of the parties to this Support Agreement of any of its representations or warranties as set forth in this Support Agreement, or such party's material breach of any of its covenants or other agreements set forth in this Support Agreement, which material breach constitutes, or is a consequence of, a purposeful act or failure to act by such party with the knowledge that the taking of such act or failure to take such act would cause a material breach of this Support Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall or is intended to preclude any of the Shareholder's rights to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as contemplated by and in accordance with the Merger Agreement at the Effective Time. This Section 18 shall survive the termination of this Support Agreement for any reason.

  



  

19. _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties do not perform their obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Each of the Acquiror and of the Shareholder waives its right (if any) to claim the benefit of the provisions of article 1142 of the Luxembourg Civil Code and acknowledges and agrees that the other party shall be entitled to the remedy of specific performance ( _ex ecution en nature_) of its obligations under this Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 3, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they may otherwise be entitled to under this Agreement, and (b) the right to specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, none of the parties would have entered into this Agreement. Each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. The parties acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement and/or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 19 shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such injunction.

20. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The parties further agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any extent, held invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing this Agreement, they shall take any actions necessary to render the remaining provisions of this Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Law.

  



  

21. _Captions; Counterparts_. The captions in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not be considered a part of or affect the construction or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

  



  

22. _Interpretation and Construction_. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of like import used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The descriptive headings used herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

23. _Capacity as a Shareholder_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Shareholder signs this Agreement solely in the Shareholder's capacity as a stockholder of the Company, and not in any other capacity and this Agreement shall not limit or otherwise affect the actions of any affiliate, employee or designee of the Shareholder or any of its affiliates in his or her capacity, if applicable, as a lender, creditor, officer or director of the Company or any other Person.

---|--- 
  



  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

This letter (this " _Sponsor Agreement_ ") is being delivered to you in
accordance with that Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date
hereof, by and among Churchill Capital Corp II, a Delaware corporation (the "
_Acquiror_ "), Software Luxembourg Holding S.A., a public limited liability
company ( _soci ete anonyme_), incorporated and organized under the laws of
the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, having its registered office at 48, Boulevard
Grande-Duchesse Charlotte, L-1330 Luxembourg, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, and
registered with the Luxembourg Register of Commerce and Companies (Registre de
Commerce et des Societes, Luxembourg) under number B246188 (the " _Company_
"), and the other parties thereto (the " _Merger Agreement_ ") and the other
transactions relating thereto (the " _Business Combination_ ") and hereby
amends and restates in its entirety that certain letter, dated June 26, 2019,
from Churchill Sponsor II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "
_Sponsor_ "), and the undersigned individuals, each of whom is a member of the
Acquiror's board of directors and/or management team (each, an " _Insider_ "
and collectively, the " _Insiders_ "), to the Acquiror (the " _Prior Letter
Agreement_ "). Certain capitalized terms used herein are defined in paragraph
5 hereof. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have
the respective meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement.

  



  

The Sponsor is currently, and as of the Closing will be, the record owner of
all of the outstanding Founder Shares and outstanding Private Placement
Warrants, with the Sponsor's ownership as of the date hereof detailed on
_Schedule A_ hereto.

  



  

In order to induce the Company and Acquiror to enter into the Merger
Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Sponsor and each Insider
hereby agrees with the Acquiror and, at all times prior to any valid
termination of the Merger Agreement, the Company as follows:

  



  

1. The Sponsor and each Insider irrevocably agrees that it, he or she shall:

    



   | a.| vote any Common Stock and Founder Shares owned by it, him or her
(all such common stock, the " _Covered Shares_ ") in favor of the Business
Combination and each other proposal related to the Business Combination
included on the agenda for the special meeting of stockholders relating to
the Business Combination and any other special meeting of Acquiror's
stockholders called for the purpose of soliciting stockholder approval in
connection with the consummation of the Business Combination (each such
meeting, a " _Stockholders Meeting_ "); 
---|---|--- 
  



   | b.| when such Stockholders Meeting is held, appear at such meeting or
otherwise cause the Covered Shares to be counted as present thereat for the
purpose of establishing a quorum; 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | D-1| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | c.| vote (or execute and return an action by written consent), or
cause to be voted at such Stockholders Meeting, or validly execute and return
and cause such consent to be granted with respect to, all of such Covered
Shares against any Business Combination Proposal and any other action that
would reasonably be expected to materially impede, interfere with, delay,
postpone or adversely affect the Business Combination or any of the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or result in a breach of any
covenant, representation or warranty or other obligation or agreement of
Acquiror under the Merger Agreement or result in a breach of any covenant,
representation or warranty or other obligation or agreement of the Sponsor or
the Insiders contained in this Sponsor Agreement; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | d.| not redeem any Covered Shares owned by it, him or her in
connection with such stockholder approval. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Prior to any valid termination of the Merger Agreement, the Sponsor and each
Insider shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to
be done, all things reasonably necessary under Acquiror's organizational
documents and applicable Laws, or reasonably requested by Acquiror, to
consummate the Business Combination and the other transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth therein.

  



  

The obligations of the Sponsor specified in this paragraph 1 shall apply
whether or not the Business Combination or any action described above is
recommended by the board of directors of the Acquiror and whether or not the
board of directors of the Acquiror has effected a Buyer Change in
Recommendation.

  



  

2. The Sponsor and each Insider hereby agrees and acknowledges that: (i) Acquiror and, prior to any valid termination of the Merger Agreement, the Company would be irreparably injured in the event of a breach by the Sponsor or any Insider of its, his or her obligations under this Sponsor Agreement; (ii) monetary damages may not be an adequate remedy for such breach; (iii) the non-breaching party shall be entitled to seek an injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Sponsor Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy that such party may have in law or in equity; and (iv) the right to seek specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Sponsor Agreement and without that right, Acquiror and the Company would not have entered into this Sponsor Agreement.

  



  

3. (a) The Sponsor and each Insider agree that it, he or she shall not:

  



  

(i) Transfer any Founder Shares (or shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion thereof) until the earlier of (A) one year after the completion of
the Business Combination or (B) subsequent to the Business Combination, (x)
if the closing price of the Common Stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share
(as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations,
recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading
day period commencing at least 150 days after the Business Combination or (y)
the date on which the Acquiror completes a liquidation, merger, capital stock

Lock-up_ _Period_ "); or

  



  

(ii) Transfer any Private Placement Warrants (or shares of Common Stock

30 days after the completion of the Business Combination (the " _Private_
_Placement_ _Warrants_ _Lock-up_ _Period_ " and, together with the
Founder Shares Lock-up Period, the " _Lock-up_ _Periods_ ").

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions set forth in paragraphs 3(a)(i) and
3(a)(ii), Transfers of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and
shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon the exercise or conversion of
the Private Placement Warrants or the Founder Shares and that are held by the
Sponsor, any Insider or any of their permitted transferees (that have complied
with this paragraph 3(b)), are permitted (A) to the Acquiror's officers or
directors, any affiliates or family members of any of the Acquiror's
officers or directors, any members of the Sponsor, or any affiliates of the

individual; (D) in the case of an individual, transfers pursuant to a
qualified domestic relations order; (E) transfers by private sales or

at prices no greater than the price at which the securities were originally
purchased; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of clauses (A) through
(E), these permitted transferees must enter into a written agreement agreeing
to be bound by this Sponsor Agreement (x) prior to the consummation of the
Business Combination, with the Acquiror and the Company and (y) from and
after the consummation of the Business Combination, with the Acquiror.

  



  

   

 | D-2|

(c) The Sponsor and each Insider acknowledge and agree as follows:

  



  

(i) Section 4.3(b)(i) of Acquiror's amended and restated certificate of
incorporation (the " _Acquiror Charter_ ") provides that each share of Class
B Common Stock shall automatically convert into one share of Class A Common
Stock (the " _Initial Conversion Ratio_ ") at the time of the Business
Combination, and (B) Section 4.3(b)(ii) of the Acquiror Charter provides that
the Initial Conversion Ratio shall be adjusted (the " _Adjustment_ ") in the
event that additional shares of Common Stock are issued in excess of the
amounts offered in Acquiror's initial public offering of securities; and

  



  

(ii) as of and conditioned upon the Closing, the Sponsor and each Insider
hereby irrevocably relinquishes and waives any and all rights the Sponsor and
each Insider has or will have under Section 4.3(b)(ii) of the Acquiror
Charter to receive shares of Common Stock in excess of the number issuable at
the Initial Conversion Ratio upon conversion of the existing shares of Class B
Common Stock held by him, her or it, as applicable, in connection with the
Closing as a result of any Adjustment.

  



  

4. The Sponsor and each Insider has full right and power, without violating any agreement to which it is bound (including, without limitation, any non-competition or non-solicitation agreement with any employer or former employer), to enter into this Sponsor Agreement.

  



  

5. As used herein, (i) " _Beneficially Own_ " has the meaning ascribed to it in Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act; (ii) " _Founder Shares_ " shall mean the shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such shares in connection with the Closing; (iii) " _Private Placement Warrants_ " shall mean the warrants to purchase up to 15,800,000 shares of Common Stock of the Acquiror that the Sponsor purchased in a private placement that shall occur simultaneously with the consummation of the Public Offering; (iv) " _Common Stock_ " shall mean the Acquiror's Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share; and (v) " _Transfer_ " shall mean the (a) sale or assignment of, offer to sell, contract or agreement to sell, hypothecate, pledge, grant of any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of or agreement to dispose of, directly or indirectly, or establishment or increase of a put equivalent position or liquidation with respect to or decrease of a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder with respect to, any security, (b) entry into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any security, whether any such transaction is to be settled by delivery of such securities, in cash or otherwise, or (c) public announcement of any intention to effect any transaction specified in clause (a) or (b).

  



  

6. This Sponsor Agreement and the other agreements referenced herein constitute the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior understandings, agreements, or representations by or among the parties hereto, written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the subject matter hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, with respect to the Sponsor, each Insider and the Prior Letter Agreement. This Sponsor Agreement may not be changed, amended, modified or waived (other than to correct a typographical error) as to any particular provision, except by a written instrument executed by the Acquiror and the other parties charged with such change, amendment, modification or waiver, it being acknowledged and agreed that the Company's execution of such an instrument will not be required after any valid termination of the Merger Agreement.

7. No party hereto may, except as set forth herein, assign either this Sponsor Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder, other than in conjunction with transfers permitted by paragraph 3, without the prior written consent of the other parties (except that, following any valid termination of the Merger Agreement, no consent from the Company shall be required). Any purported assignment in violation of this paragraph shall be void and ineffectual and shall not operate to transfer or assign any interest or title to the purported assignee. This Sponsor Agreement shall be binding on the Sponsor, each Insider, the Acquiror and the Company and their respective successors, heirs, personal representatives and assigns and permitted transferees.

  



  

8. Nothing in this Sponsor Agreement shall be construed to confer upon, or give to, any person or corporation other than the parties hereto any right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Sponsor Agreement or of any covenant, condition, stipulation, promise or agreement hereof. All covenants, conditions, stipulations, promises and agreements contained in this Sponsor Agreement shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties hereto and their successors, heirs, personal representatives and assigns and permitted transferees.

  



  

9. This Sponsor Agreement may be executed in any number of original, electronic or facsimile counterparts and each of such counterparts shall for all purposes be deemed to be an original, and all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

  



  

10. This Sponsor Agreement shall be deemed severable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision hereof shall not affect the validity or enforceability of this Sponsor Agreement or of any other term or provision hereof.

directors identified by PubCo in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement (the " _Initial Directors_ ") and (y) from and after the first

(c) _Vacancies_. If a vacancy on the Board is caused by the death,
retirement, resignation or removal of any Sponsor Director and the Sponsor
would be entitled to cause PubCo to nominate a Sponsor Director in respect of

take all Necessary Action to cause the Board to fill such vacancy as promptly
as practicable (and in any event prior to the next meeting or action of the
Board or applicable committee) with an individual designated by the Sponsor.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 2.1(c)_,
the Sponsor shall not have the right to designate a replacement director, and
PubCo shall not be required to take any action to cause any vacancy to be
filled by any such designee, to the extent that appointment of such designee
to the Board would result in a number of directors designated by the Sponsor
in excess of the number of directors that the Sponsor is then entitled to
cause PubCo to nominate for membership on the Board pursuant to _Section
2.1(b)_. Any such designated replacement who becomes a member of the Board
shall be deemed to be a Sponsor Director for all purposes under this
Agreement.

  



  

(d) _Committees_. In accordance with PubCo's Organizational
Documents, (i) the Board shall establish and maintain committees of the
Board for (x) Audit, (y) Compensation and (z) Nominating and Corporate
Governance, and (ii) the Board may from time to time by resolution establish

the Sponsor agrees with PubCo to take, all Necessary Action to have at least
one (1) Sponsor Director appointed to serve on each committee of the Board.

Director serves as a director of PubCo, (i) PubCo shall provide such
Sponsor Director with the same expense reimbursement, benefits, indemnity,
exculpation and other arrangements provided to the other directors of PubCo,
including, but not limited to: (A) coverage under directors' and officers'
insurance policies maintained by PubCo or any of its subsidiaries and (B) any
reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with their attendance at meetings of the Board and any committees
thereof, including travel, lodging and meal expenses and (ii) PubCo shall not
amend, alter or repeal any right to indemnification, advancement of expenses
or exculpation provided in the Organizational Documents, indemnification
agreement or otherwise that covers or benefits any Sponsor Director (except to

indemnification, advancement of expenses or exculpation rights than permitted
prior thereto).

Section 2.2 _PubCo Cooperation_. PubCo shall (and shall cause its
subsidiaries to) cooperate in facilitating the nomination and designation
rights described in Section 2.1(a), including (i) taking all Necessary Action
to nominate each Sponsor Director as part of the slate that is included in
any proxy statement (or similar document) of PubCo in respect of any Board
Election Meeting (other than, if applicable, when no Sponsor Director is
allocated to the class of directors to be elected at such meeting), (ii)
providing the highest level of support for the election of each such Sponsor
Director as PubCo provides to any other individual standing for election as a
director as part of PubCo's slate of nominees, (iii) not nominating for any

import in or relating to this Stockholders Agreement or any document to be

Section 3.7 _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial; Jurisdiction_.
The Law of the State of Delaware shall govern (a) all Actions, claims or
matters related to or arising from this Stockholders Agreement (including any
tort or non-contractual claims) and (b) any questions concerning the
construction, interpretation, validity and enforceability of this Stockholders
Agreement, and the performance of the obligations imposed by this
Stockholders Agreement, in each case without giving effect to any choice of
law or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware
or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Law of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. EACH PARTY TO THIS STOCKHOLDERS
AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION
BROUGHT TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN OR AMONG ANY OF THE PARTIES (WHETHER
ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, CONNECTED WITH,
RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THIS STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT, THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE
RELATIONSHIPS ESTABLISHED AMONG THE PARTIES UNDER THIS STOCKHOLDERS
AGREEMENT. THE PARTIES FURTHER WARRANT AND REPRESENT THAT EACH HAS REVIEWED
THIS WAIVER WITH SUCH PARTY'S LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT EACH KNOWINGLY AND
VOLUNTARILY WAIVES SUCH PARTY'S JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH
LEGAL COUNSEL. Each of the Parties submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, only if such court lacks
jurisdiction, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware
(as applicable, the " _Delaware Court_ ") and the courts of appeal therefrom
in any Action arising out of or relating to this Stockholders Agreement,
agrees that all claims in respect of the Action shall be heard and determined
only in the Delaware Court agrees not to bring any Action arising out of
or relating to this Stockholders Agreement in any other courts. Each Party
irrevocably consents to the service of process in any such Action by the
mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to
such Party, at its address for notices as provided in _Section 3.6_ of this
Stockholders Agreement, such service to become effective ten (10) days after
such mailing, or in any other manner permitted by applicable Law. Each Party
hereby irrevocably waives any objection to such service of process and
further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any Action
commenced hereunder or under any other documents contemplated hereby that
such service of process was in any way invalid or ineffective. To the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the Parties hereby irrevocably
waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any Action arising out of or relating to this Stockholders Agreement in the
Delaware Court and hereby further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead
or claim that the Delaware Court is not a convenient forum for any such
Action. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any Action so brought
shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by Law or at equity, in any jurisdiction.

Section 3.8 _Specific Performance_. Each Party hereby agrees and
acknowledges that money damages and remedies at law would not be a sufficient
remedy if the Parties fail to comply with any of the obligations imposed on
them by this Stockholders Agreement and that, in the event of any such
failure, an aggrieved Party will be irreparably damaged and will not have an
adequate remedy at Law. Any such Party shall, therefore, be entitled (in
addition to any other remedy to which such Party may be entitled at Law or in
equity) to injunctive relief, including specific performance, to enforce such
obligations, without the posting of any bond, and if any Action should be
brought in equity to enforce any of the provisions of this Stockholders
Agreement, none of the Parties shall raise the defense that there is an
adequate remedy at Law.

  



  

Section 3.9 _Other Business Opportunities_.

  



  

(a) The Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) each of the Sponsor and the

respective limited partners, non-managing members or other similar direct or
indirect investors) and the Sponsor Directors (collectively, the " _Covered
Persons_ ") has the right to, and shall have no duty (fiduciary, contractual
or otherwise) not to, directly or indirectly engage in and possess interests
in other business ventures of every type and description, including
those engaged in the same or similar business activities or lines of business
as PubCo or any of its subsidiaries or deemed to be competing with PubCo or
any of its subsidiaries, on its own account, or in partnership with, or as an
employee, officer, director or shareholder of any other Person, with no
obligation to offer to PubCo or any of its subsidiaries the right to
participate therein; (ii) each of the Covered Persons may invest in, or
provide services to, any Person that directly or indirectly competes with
PubCo or any of its subsidiaries; and (iii) in the event that any of the
Covered Persons acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter that
may be a corporate or other business opportunity for PubCo or any of its
subsidiaries, such Person shall have no duty (fiduciary, contractual or
otherwise) to communicate or present such corporate opportunity to PubCo or
any of its subsidiaries and, notwithstanding any provision of this
Stockholders Agreement to the contrary, shall not be liable to PubCo or any of
its subsidiaries for breach of any duty (fiduciary, contractual or otherwise)
by reason of the fact that such Person, directly or indirectly, pursues or
acquires such opportunity for itself, directs such opportunity to another
Person or does not present such opportunity to PubCo or any of its
subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge that this
paragraph is intended to disclaim and renounce, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, any right of PubCo or any of its subsidiaries
with respect to the matters set forth herein, and this paragraph shall be
construed to effect such disclaimer and renunciation to the fullest
extent permitted by law.

of interest between PubCo or any of its subsidiaries, on the one hand,

Affiliates may act in its best interest and (B) none of the Sponsor, the
Founder Holder or any of their respective Affiliates or any Sponsor Director
acting in his or her capacity as a director shall be obligated (1) to reveal
to PubCo or any of its subsidiaries confidential information belonging to or
relating to the business of the Sponsor, the Founder Holder or any of their
respective Affiliates or (2) to take any action in its capacity as a direct or
indirect stockholder of PubCo, as the case may be, that prefers the interest
of PubCo or its subsidiaries over the interest of such Person in such
capacity; and

  



  

(iii) waives any claim or cause of action against the Sponsor, the
Founder Holder and any of their respective Affiliates, and any officer,
employee, agent or Affiliate of any such Person that may from time to time
arise in respect of a breach by any such person of any duty or obligation
disclaimed under _Section 3.9(b)(i)_ or _Section 3.9(b)(ii)_.

  



  

(c) Each of the parties hereto agrees that the waivers, limitations,
acknowledgments and agreements set forth in this _Section 3.9_ shall not
apply to any alleged claim or cause of action against any of the Sponsor or
the Founder Holder based upon the breach or nonperformance by such Person of
this Stockholders Agreement or any other agreement to which such Person is a
party.

thereto; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if, after such Registration Statement
has been declared effective, an offering of Registrable Securities in a
Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration is subsequently interfered with
by any stop order or injunction of the Commission, federal or state court or
any other governmental agency the Registration Statement with respect to such
Registration shall be deemed not to have been declared effective, unless and
until, (i) such stop order or injunction is removed, rescinded or otherwise
terminated, and (ii) a majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders
initiating such Demand Registration thereafter affirmatively elect to
continue with such Registration and accordingly notify the Company in writing,
but in no event later than five (5) days, of such election; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Company shall not be obligated or required to file
another Registration Statement until the Registration Statement that has been
previously filed with respect to a Registration pursuant to a Demand
Registration becomes effective or is subsequently terminated.

  



  

2.1.3 _Underwritten Offering_. Subject to the provisions of
_subsection 2.1.4_ and _Section 2.4_ hereof, if a majority-in-interest of
the Demanding Holders so advise the Company as part of their Demand
Registration that the offering of the Registrable Securities pursuant to such
Demand Registration shall be in the form of an Underwritten Offering, then the
right of such Demanding Holder and Requesting Holder (if any) to include its
Registrable Securities in such Registration shall be conditioned upon such
Holder's participation in such Underwritten Offering and the inclusion of
such Holder's Registrable Securities in such Underwritten Offering to the
extent provided herein. All such Holders proposing to distribute their
Registrable Securities through an Underwritten Offering under this
_subsection 2.1.3_ shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary
form with the Underwriter(s) selected for such Underwritten Offering by the
majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders initiating the Demand

2.1.4 _Reduction of Underwritten Offering_. If the managing
Underwriter or Underwriters in an Underwritten Registration pursuant to a
Demand Registration, in good faith, advises the Company, the Demanding
Holders and the Requesting Holders (if any) in writing that the dollar amount
or number of Registrable Securities that the Demanding Holders and the
Requesting Holders (if any) desire to sell, taken together with all other
Common Stock or other equity securities that the Company desires to sell and
the Common Stock, if any, as to which a Registration has been requested
pursuant to separate written contractual piggy-back registration rights
held by any other stockholders who desire to sell, exceeds the maximum dollar
amount or maximum number of equity securities that can be sold in the
Underwritten Offering without adversely affecting the proposed offering price,
the timing, the distribution method, or the probability of success of such
offering (such maximum dollar amount or maximum number of such securities, as
applicable, the " _Maximum Number of Securities_ "), then the Company shall
include in such Underwritten Offering, as follows: (i) first, the Registrable
Securities of the Demanding Holders and the Requesting Holders (if any) ( _pro
rata_ based on the respective number of Registrable Securities that each
Demanding Holder and Requesting Holder (if any) holds prior to
such Underwritten Registration) that can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Securities; (ii) second, to the extent that the Maximum
Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clause (i),
Common Stock or other equity securities for the account of other persons or
entities that the Company is obligated to register pursuant to separate
written contractual arrangements with such persons or entities and that can
be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and (iii)

reached under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), Common Stock or other

2.2 _Piggyback Registration_.

  



  

2.2.1 _Piggyback Rights_. If, at any time the Company proposes to
file a Registration Statement under the Securities Act with respect to
an offering of equity securities, or securities or other obligations
exercisable or exchangeable for, or convertible into equity securities, for
its own account or for the account of stockholders of the Company (or by the
Company and by the stockholders of the Company including, without limitation,
pursuant to _Section 2.1_ hereof), other than a Registration Statement
(or any registered offering with respect thereto) (i) filed in connection
with any employee stock option or other benefit plan, (ii) pursuant to a
Registration Statement on Form S-4 (or similar form that relates to a
transaction subject to Rule 145 under the Securities Act or any successor
rule thereto), (iii) for an offering of debt that is convertible into
equity securities of the Company, (iv) for a dividend reinvestment plan or
(v) for a rights offering, then the Company shall give written notice of such
proposed filing to all of the Holders of Registrable Securities as soon as
practicable but not less than three (3) Business Days before the anticipated
filing date of such Registration Statement or, in the case of an
Underwritten Offering pursuant to a Form S-3, the applicable "red herring"
prospectus or prospectus supplement, which notice shall (A) describe the
amount and type of securities to be included in such offering, the intended
method(s) of distribution, and the name of the proposed managing Underwriter
or Underwriters, if any, in such offering, and (B) offer to all of
the Holders of Registrable Securities the opportunity to register the sale of
such number of Registrable Securities as such Holders may request in writing
within five (5) Business Days after receipt of such written notice (such
Registration a " _Piggyback Registration_ "). Subject to _subsection 2.2.2_ ,
the Company shall, in good faith, cause such Registrable Securities to be
included in such Piggyback Registration and shall use its best efforts to
cause the managing Underwriter or Underwriters of a proposed Underwritten
Offering to permit the Registrable Securities requested by the Holders
pursuant to this _subsection 2.2.1_ to be included in a Piggyback
Registration on the same terms and conditions as any similar securities of the
Company included in such Registration and to permit the sale or other
disposition of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended
method(s) of distribution thereof. All such Holders proposing to distribute
their Registrable Securities through an Underwritten Offering under this
_subsection 2.2.1_ shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary
form with the Underwriter(s) selected for such Underwritten Offering by the
Company.

  



  

2.2.2 _Reduction of Piggyback Registration_. If the managing
Underwriter or Underwriters in an Underwritten Registration that is to be a
Piggyback Registration, in good faith, advises the Company and the Holders of
Registrable Securities participating in the Piggyback Registration in writing
that the dollar amount or number of shares of Common Stock that the Company
desires to sell, taken together with (i) the shares of Common Stock, if any,
as to which Registration has been demanded pursuant to separate written
contractual arrangements with persons or entities other than the Holders of
Registrable Securities hereunder, (ii) the Registrable Securities as to which
registration has been requested pursuant to _Section 2.2_ hereof, and (iii)
the shares of Common Stock, if any, as to which Registration has been
requested pursuant to separate written contractual piggy-back registration
rights of other stockholders of the Company, exceeds the Maximum Number of
Securities, then:

  



  

(a) If the Registration is undertaken for the Company's account,
the Company shall include in any such Registration (A) first, Common Stock or
other equity securities that the Company desires to sell, which can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and (B) second, to the
extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the
foregoing clause (A), the Registrable Securities of Holders exercising their
rights to register their Registrable Securities pursuant to  _subsection
2.2.1_ hereof and Common Stock, if any, as to which Registration has been
requested pursuant to written contractual piggy-back registration rights of
other stockholders of the Company ( _pro rata_ based on the respective number
of Registrable Securities that each stockholder holds prior to such
Underwritten Registration), which can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Securities;

  



  

   

 | F-8| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) If the Registration is pursuant to a request by persons or
entities other than the Holders of Registrable Securities, then the
Company shall include in any such Registration (A) first, Common Stock or
other equity securities, if any, of such requesting persons or entities,
other than the Holders of Registrable Securities, which can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (B) second, to the extent that
the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing
clause (A), the Registrable Securities of Holders exercising their rights to
register their Registrable Securities pursuant to _subsection 2.2.1 _ and
Common Stock or other equity securities for the account of other persons or
entities that the Company is obligated to register pursuant to separate
written contractual arrangements with such persons or entities ( _pro rata_
based on the respective number of Registrable Securities that each
stockholder holds prior to such Underwritten Registration), which can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and (C) third, to the
extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the
foregoing clauses (A) and (B), Common Stock or other equity securities that
the Company desires to sell, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Securities.

  



  

2.2.3 _Piggyback Registration Withdrawal_. Any Holder of
Registrable Securities shall have the right to withdraw from a Piggyback
Registration for any or no reason whatsoever upon written notification to the
Company and the Underwriter or Underwriters (if any) of his, her or its
intention to withdraw from such Piggyback Registration prior to the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement filed with the Commission with
respect to such Piggyback Registration. The Company (whether on its own good
faith determination or as the result of a request for withdrawal by persons
pursuant to separate written contractual obligations) may withdraw a
Registration Statement filed with the Commission in connection with a
Piggyback Registration at any time prior to the effectiveness of
such Registration Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Company shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses
incurred in connection with the Piggyback Registration prior to its withdrawal
under this _subsection 2.2.3_.

  



  

2.2.4 _Unlimited Piggyback Registration Rights_. For purposes of
clarity, any Registration effected pursuant to _Section 2.2_ hereof shall
not be counted as a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration effected
under _Section 2.1_ hereof.

  



  

2.3 _Registrations on Form S-3_. The Holders of Registrable
Securities may at any time, and from time to time, request in writing that
the Company, pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or any successor
rule promulgated thereafter by the Commission), register the resale of any or
all of their Registrable Securities on Form S-3 or any similar short form
registration statement that may be available at such time (" _Form S-3_").
Within three (3) Business Days of the Company's receipt of a written request
from a Holder or Holders of Registrable Securities for a Registration on Form
S-3, the Company shall promptly give written notice of the proposed
Registration on Form S-3 to all other Holders of Registrable Securities, and
each Holder of Registrable Securities who thereafter wishes to include all or
a portion of such Holder's Registrable Securities in such Registration on
Form S-3 shall so notify the Company, in writing, within ten (10) days after
the receipt by the Holder of the notice from the Company. As soon as
practicable thereafter, but not more than twelve (12) days after the
Company's initial receipt of such written request for a Registration on Form
S-3, the Company shall effect a Registration of all or such portion of such
Holder's Registrable Securities as are specified in such written request,
together with all or such portion of Registrable Securities of any other
Holder or Holders joining in such request as are specified in the
written notification given by such Holder or Holders; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Company shall not be obligated to effect any such Registration
pursuant to _Section 2.3_ hereof if (i) a Form S-3 is not available for such
offering; or (ii) the Holders of Registrable Securities, together with the
Holders of any other equity securities of the Company entitled to inclusion
in such Registration, propose to sell the Registrable Securities and such
other equity securities (if any) at any aggregate price to the public of less
than $5,000,000.

  



  

   

 | F-9| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

  



  

Any request for an Underwritten Offering pursuant to a Form S-3, including a
takedown from an existing Form S-3 filed pursuant to this _Section
2.3_, shall follow the procedures of _Section 2.1_ (including _subsection
2.1.4_ ) but shall not count against the number of long form Demand
Registrations that may be made pursuant to _subsection 2.1.1_ ; _provided_
that such Holders (a) reasonably expect aggregate gross proceeds in excess of
$25,000,000 from such Underwritten Offering or (b) reasonably expect to
sell all of the Registrable Securities they hold in such Underwritten
Offering but in no event for expected aggregate gross proceeds of less than
$10,000,000.

  



  

2.4 _Restrictions on Registration Rights_. If (A) during the
period starting with the date sixty (60) days prior to the Company's good
faith estimate of the date of the filing of, and ending on a date one hundred
and twenty (120) days after the effective date of a Company-initiated
Registration, the Company has initiated a Registration and _provided_ that the
Company has delivered written notice regarding such Registration to the
Holders prior to receipt of a Demand Registration pursuant to
_subsection 2.1.1_ and it continues to actively employ, in good faith, all
reasonable efforts to cause the applicable Registration Statement to become
effective; (B) the Holders have requested an Underwritten Registration and the
Company and the Holders are unable to obtain the commitment of underwriters
to firmly underwrite the offer; or (C) in the good faith judgment of the Board
such Registration would be seriously detrimental to the Company and the Board
concludes as a result that it is essential to defer the filing of such
Registration Statement at such time, then in each case the Company shall
furnish to such Holders a certificate signed by the Chairman of the Board
stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board it would be seriously
detrimental to the Company for such Registration Statement to be filed in the
near future and that it is therefore essential to defer the filing of such
Registration Statement. In such event, the Company shall have the right to
defer such filing for a period of not more than thirty (30) days; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Company shall not defer its obligation in this manner
more than once in any 12-month period. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, no Registration shall be effected or
permitted and no Registration Statement shall become effective, with respect
to any Registrable Securities held by any Holder of Founder Shares, until
after the expiration of the Founder Shares Lock-Up Period.

 | F-12| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

  



  

3.1.13 in the event of any Underwritten Offering, enter into and
perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and
customary form, with the managing Underwriter of such offering;

  



  

3.1.14 make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably

3.4 _Suspension of Sales; Adverse Disclosure_. Upon receipt of
written notice from the Company that a Registration Statement or
Prospectus contains a Misstatement, each of the Holders shall forthwith
discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities until he, she or it has
received copies of a supplemented or amended Prospectus correcting the
Misstatement (it being understood that the Company hereby covenants to
prepare and file such supplement or amendment as soon as practicable after the
time of such notice), or until he, she or it is advised in writing by the
Company that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed. If the filing, initial
effectiveness or continued use of a Registration Statement in respect of any
Registration at any time would require the Company to make an
Adverse Disclosure or would require the inclusion in such Registration
Statement of financial statements that are unavailable to the Company for
reasons beyond the Company's control, the Company may, upon giving prompt
written notice of such action to the Holders, delay the filing or initial
effectiveness of, or suspend use of, such Registration Statement for the
shortest period of time, but in no event more than thirty (30) days,
determined in good faith by the Company to be necessary for such purpose. In
the event the Company exercises its rights under the preceding sentence, the
Holders agree to suspend, immediately upon their receipt of the notice
referred to above, their use of the Prospectus relating to any Registration in
connection with any sale or offer to sell Registrable Securities. The Company
shall immediately notify the Holders of the expiration of any period during
which it exercised its rights under this _Section 3.4_.

  

  



  

3.5 _Reporting Obligations_. As long as any Holder shall own
Registrable Securities, the Company, at all times while it shall be a
reporting company under the Exchange Act, covenants to file timely (or obtain
extensions in respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period)
all reports required to be filed by the Company after the date hereof pursuant
to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The Company further covenants
that it shall take such further action as any Holder may reasonably request,
all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell
shares of Common Stock held by such Holder without registration under the
Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144
promulgated under the Securities Act (or any successor rule promulgated
thereafter by the Commission), including providing any legal opinions.

  



  

Article IV 
 INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION

  



  

4.1 _Indemnification_.

  



  

4.1.1 The Company agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by
law, each Holder of Registrable Securities, its officers and directors and
each person who controls such Holder (within the meaning of the Securities
Act) against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including
attorneys' fees) caused by (i) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of
material fact contained in any Registration Statement, Prospectus or
preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, (ii)
any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except
insofar as the same are caused by or contained in any information furnished in
writing to the Company by such Holder expressly for use therein, (iii) any
actions or inactions or proceedings in respect of the foregoing whether or
not such indemnified party is a party thereto or (iv) any registration or
qualification of securities under applicable blue sky laws (including any
failure to register or qualify securities under such laws where the Company
has affirmatively undertaken or agreed in writing that the Company will
undertake such registration or qualification). This indemnity shall be in
addition to any liability the Company may otherwise have. Such indemnity
shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by
or on behalf of such Holder or any indemnified party and shall survive the
transfer of such securities by such Holder. The Company shall indemnify the
Underwriters, their officers and directors and each person who controls such
Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as
provided in the foregoing with respect to the indemnification of the Holder.

  



  

   

 | F-14| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

  



  

4.1.2 In connection with any Registration Statement in which a
Holder of Registrable Securities is participating, such Holder shall
furnish to the Company in writing such information and affidavits as the
Company reasonably requests for use in connection with any such Registration
Statement or Prospectus and, to the extent permitted by law, shall indemnify
the Company, its directors and officers and agents and each person who
controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against any
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including without
limitation reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from any untrue statement
of material fact contained in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or
preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any
omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that such
untrue statement or omission is contained in any information or affidavit so
furnished in writing by such Holder expressly for use therein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the obligation to indemnify shall be several, not joint and
several, among such Holders of Registrable Securities, and the liability of
each such Holder of Registrable Securities shall be in proportion to and
limited to the net proceeds received by such Holder from the sale of
Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement. The Holders
of Registrable Securities shall indemnify the Underwriters, their officers,
directors and each person who controls such Underwriters (within the meaning
of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided in the foregoing with
respect to indemnification of the Company.

  



  

4.1.3 Any person entitled to indemnification herein shall (i) give
prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to
which it seeks indemnification ( _provided_ that the failure to give prompt
notice shall not impair any person's right to indemnification hereunder to
the extent such failure has not materially prejudiced the indemnifying party)
and (ii) unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of
interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with
respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of
such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If
such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any
liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its
consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).
An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the
defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of
more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party
with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any
indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified
party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim.
No indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified
party, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
which cannot be settled in all respects by the payment of money (and such
money is so paid by the indemnifying party pursuant to the terms of such
settlement) or which settlement does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a
release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation.

4.1.4 The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on
behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling person
of such indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities. The
Company and each Holder of Registrable Securities participating in an offering
also agrees to make such provisions as are reasonably requested by any
indemnified party for contribution to such party in the event the
Company's or such Holder's indemnification is unavailable for any reason.

  

  



  

4.1.5 If the indemnification provided under _Section 4.1_ hereof
from the indemnifying party is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless
an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities
and expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying the indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of
the indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference
to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission
to state a material fact, was made by, or relates to information supplied by,
such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the indemnifying party's
and indemnified party's relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the liability of any Holder under this _subsection 4.1.5 _ shall be limited
to the amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder in such offering
giving rise to such liability. The amount paid or payable by a party as a
result of the losses or other liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to
include, subject to the limitations set forth in _subsections 4.1.1_ ,
_4.1.2_ and _4.1.3_ above, any legal or other fees, charges or expenses
reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or
proceeding. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable
if contribution pursuant to this _subsection 4.1.5_ were determined by _pro
rata _ allocation or by any other method of allocation, which does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in this _subsection
4.1.5_. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution
pursuant to this _subsection 4.1.5_ from any person who was not guilty of
such fraudulent misrepresentation.

Churchill Capital Corp II (the " _Corporation_ "), a corporation organized
and existing under and by virtue of the General Corporation Law of the State

which the Corporation is authorized to issue is [●] shares, consisting of (a)
[●] shares of common stock, including (i) [●] shares of Class A common stock
(the " _Class A Common Stock_"), (ii) 20,000,000 shares of Class B common
stock (the " _Class B Common Stock_" and, together with the Class A

common stock (the " _Class C Common Stock_"), and (b) 1,000,000 shares of
preferred stock (the " _Preferred Stock_ ")."

  



  

3. Section 4.3(a)(i) of the Certificate of Incorporation is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

  



  

"(i) Except as otherwise required by law or this Amended and Restated
Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation and Section 9.9), the

with respect to the Corporation. For the avoidance of doubt, except as
otherwise required by applicable law, holders of Class C Common Stock shall
not be entitled to any voting power in respect of such shares."

  



  

4. Section 4.3(d) of the Certificate of Incorporation is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

  



  

"(d) _Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up of the Corporation_ _._ Subject
to applicable law, the rights, if any, of the holders of any

5. Section 4.3 of the Certificate of Incorporation is hereby amended by adding a new subparagraph (e) to the end thereof as follows:

  



  

"(e) _Repurchase of Class C Common Stock_. Immediately following

Plan of Merger, dated as of [●], 2020 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), by and
between Software Luxembourg Holding S.A. and the Corporation (the " _Class C
Repurchase Effective Time_"), the Corporation shall automatically and without
the need for any further action by the Corporation or any holder of shares of
Class C Common Stock, repurchase each share of Class C Common Stock then-
outstanding for an aggregate redemption price per share of Class C Common
Stock equal to (1) a cash purchase price equal to the quotient of (x)
$505,000,000 divided by (y) the number of shares of Class C Common Stock
then-outstanding (such amount, the " _Per Share Cash Repurchase Amount_ ")
_plus_  (2) indebtedness to be issued or caused to be issued by the
Corporation or one of its subsidiaries under the Existing Second Out Credit
Agreement, as amended by the Existing Second Out Credit Agreement Amendment
(in each case, as defined in the Merger Agreement), equal to the quotient of
(x) $20,000,000 divided by (y) the number of shares of Class C Common
Stok then-outstanding (such amount, the " _Per Share Debt Repurchase Amount_
" and, together with the Per Share Cash Repurchase Amount, the " _Per Share
Repurchase Amount_ "), in each case, pursuant to and subject to the terms
of the Merger Agreement (the " _Class C Repurchase_"). With respect to each
share of Class C Common Stock, upon payment by or on behalf of the
Corporation of the Per Share Repurchase Amount, such share of Class C Common
Stock shall cease to be outstanding as of the Class C Repurchase Effective
Time, any and all rights of holders of shares of Class C Common Stock shall
be extinguished and such shares of Class C Common Stock shall not be reissued,
sold or transferred. After the Class C Repurchase Effective Time, the
Corporation shall take all necessary action to cause the shares of Class
C Common Stock so repurchased to be retired and thereupon to file a
certificate of retirement in accordance with Section 243 of the DGCL."

  



  

6. The foregoing amendments were duly adopted in accordance with the provisions of Section 242 of the DGCL and shall become effective as of [●], Eastern time, on the date this Certificate of Amendment is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

  



  

7. All other provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation shall remain in full force and effect.

Merger Agreement (the " _Merger_ ") and pursuant to the Amended Certificate,
at the effective time of the Merger (i) all 17,250,000 shares of the Class
B common stock of the Corporation were converted into shares of Class A
common stock of the Corporation and (ii), immediately following the Effective
Time pursuant to the Class C Repurchase (as defined below), all 3,840,000
shares of the Class C common stock of the Corporation will be repurchased by
the Corporation, and, in each case, subsequently cease to be
outstanding, such that, as of the effectiveness of this Certificate of
Incorporation and the consummation of the Class C Repurchase, only Class A
common stock remains outstanding. All Class A common stock issued and
outstanding prior to the effectiveness of this Certificate of Incorporation
and all Class A common stock issued as part of, or in connection with, the

Each holder of record of Common Stock, as such, shall be entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held of record by such holder on all matters on which stockholders are entitled to vote generally, including the election or removal of directors.

Stock then-outstanding (such amount, the " _Per Share Repurchase Cash Amount_
") plus (2) indebtedness to be issued or caused to be issued by the
Corporation or one of its subsidiaries under the Existing Second Out Credit
Agreement, as amended by the Existing Second Out Credit Agreement Amendment
(in each case, as defined in the Merger Agreement), equal to the quotient of
(x) $20,000,000 divided by (y) the number of shares of Class C Common Stock

Agreement, dated as of October [●], 2020, by and among the Corporation and
the [PIPE Holder] (the " _Subscription Agreement_ "), no provision of Article
VI, Article VII, Article IX, Article X, Article XI and this Article V may be
altered, amended or repealed in any respect, nor may any provision or bylaw
inconsistent therewith be adopted, unless, in addition to any other vote
required by this Certificate of Incorporation or otherwise required by law,

B. The Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter,
amend, change, add to, rescind or repeal, in whole or in part, the bylaws of
the Corporation (as in effect from time to time, the " _Bylaws_ ") without the
assent or vote of the stockholders in any manner not inconsistent with the
laws of the State of Delaware or this Certificate of Incorporation, that
certain Stockholders Agreement of the Corporation, dated as of October [●],
2020, by and among the Corporation, Churchill Sponsor II LLC (the " _Sponsor_
"), the Founder Holder (as defined therein) and any other parties thereto from

Subscription Agreement. The affirmative vote of the holders of at least fifty
percent (50%) in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of stock of
the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class,
shall be required in order for the stockholders of the Corporation to amend,
alter, rescind, change, add or repeal, in whole or in part, any provision of

however_ , that no Bylaw hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall
invalidate any prior act of the Board of Directors that was valid at the time
of such act prior to the adoption of such Bylaw.

  



  

ARTICLE VI 
 BOARD OF DIRECTORS

  



  

A. Except as otherwise provided in this Certificate of
Incorporation or the DGCL, the business and affairs of the Corporation shall
be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors. Except as
otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, the
Subscription Agreement or any certificate of designation with respect to any
series of Preferred Stock, the total number of directors shall be determined
from time to time exclusively by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors;
_provided_ that any determination by the Board of Directors to increase or
decrease the total number of directors shall require the approval of fifty
percent (50%) of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is
present. The directors (other than those directors elected by the holders of
any series of Preferred Stock, voting separately as a series or together with
one or more other such series, as the case may be) shall be divided into
three classes designated Class I, Class II and Class III. Each class shall
consist, as nearly as possible, of one-third of the total number of such
directors. Class I directors shall initially serve for a term expiring
immediately following the Corporation's annual meeting of stockholders for the
calendar year ended December 31, 2021, Class II directors shall initially
serve for a term expiring immediately following the Corporation's annual
meeting of stockholders for the calendar year ended December 31, 2022 and
Class III directors shall initially serve for a term expiring immediately
following the Corporation's annual meeting of stockholders for the calendar
year ended December 31, 2023. Commencing with the annual meeting of
stockholders for the calendar year ended December 31, 2021, the directors of
the class to be elected at each annual meeting shall be elected for a three
year term. If the number of such directors is changed, any increase or
decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number
of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, and any such
additional director of any class elected to fill a newly created directorship
resulting from an increase in such class shall hold office for a term that
shall coincide with the remaining term of that class, but in no case shall a
decrease in the number of directors remove or shorten the term of any
incumbent director. Any such director shall hold office until the annual
meeting at which his or her term expires and until his or her successor shall
be elected and qualified, or his or her earlier death, resignation,
retirement, disqualification or removal from office. The Board of Directors is
authorized to assign members of the Board of Directors already in office to
their respective class.

  



  

   

5

 



    



  

B. Without limiting the rights of any party to the Stockholders
Agreement or the rights of any party to the Subscription Agreement, any newly-
created directorship on the Board of Directors that results from an increase
in the number of directors and any vacancy occurring in the Board of
Directors (whether by death, resignation, retirement, disqualification,
removal or other cause) may be filled solely and exclusively by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office, even if less
than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Any director elected to fill
a vacancy or newly created directorship shall hold office until the next
election of the class for which such director shall have been chosen and
until his or her successor shall be elected and qualified, or until his or
her earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal.

  



  

C. Without limiting the rights of any party to the Stockholders
Agreement or the rights of any party to the Subscription Agreement, any
or all of the directors (other than the directors elected by the holders of
any series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation, voting separately as a
series or together with one or more other such series, as the case may be) may
be removed at any time for cause by the affirmative vote of a majority in
voting power of all outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to
vote thereon, voting together as a single class.

  



  

D. Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless the
Bylaws shall so provide.

  



  

E. During any period when the holders of any series of Preferred
Stock have the right to elect additional directors, then upon
commencement and for the duration of the period during which such right
continues: (i) the then otherwise total authorized number of directors of the
Corporation shall automatically be increased by such specified number of
directors, and the holders of such Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect
the additional directors so provided for or fixed pursuant to the provisions
of such series of Preferred Stock, and (ii) each such additional director
shall serve until such director's successor shall have been duly elected and
qualified, or until such director's right to hold such office terminates
pursuant to said provisions, whichever occurs earlier, subject to his or her
earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal. Except as
otherwise provided by the Board of Directors in the resolution or resolutions
establishing such series, whenever the holders of any series of
Preferred Stock having such right to elect additional directors are divested
of such right pursuant to the provisions of such stock, the terms of office
of all such additional directors elected by the holders of such stock, or
elected to fill any vacancies resulting from the death, resignation,
disqualification or removal of such additional directors, shall forthwith
terminate (in which case each such director thereupon shall cease to be
qualified as, and shall cease to be, a director) and the total authorized
number of directors of the Corporation shall automatically be reduced
accordingly.

ARTICLE VII 
 LIMITATION OF DIRECTOR LIABILITY

  



  

A. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as it now exists or
may hereafter be amended, a director of the Corporation shall not be
personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages
for breach of fiduciary duty owed to the Corporation or its stockholders.

  



  

B. Neither the amendment nor repeal of this _Article VII_, nor
the adoption of any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation, nor, to
the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, any modification of law shall
eliminate, reduce or otherwise adversely affect any right or protection of a
current or former director of the Corporation existing at the time of such
amendment, repeal, adoption or modification.

  



  

ARTICLE VIII 
 ANNUAL AND SPECIAL MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

  



  

A. Except as otherwise required by law and subject to the rights of
the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, special meetings of
the stockholders of the Corporation for any purpose or purposes may be called
at any time only by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or the
Chairman of the Board of Directors, either on his or her own initiative or at
the request of stockholders that beneficially own at least twenty-five
percent (25%) in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of stock of
the Corporation.

  



  

B. An annual meeting of stockholders for the election of directors
to succeed those whose terms expire and for the transaction of such other
business as may properly come before the meeting, shall be held at such place,
if any, on such date, and at such time as shall be fixed exclusively by
resolution of the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof.

those in which the Corporation, directly or indirectly, may engage, and (iii)
members of the Board of Directors who are not employees of the Corporation ("
_Non-Employee Directors_ ") and their respective Affiliates, including (I)
any portfolio company in which they or any of their respective investment
fund Affiliates have made a debt or equity investment (and vice versa) or
(II) any of their respective limited partners, non-managing members or other
similar direct or indirect investors may now engage and may continue to
engage in the same or similar activities or related lines of business as those
in which the Corporation, directly or indirectly, may engage and/or other
business activities that overlap with or compete with those in which the
Corporation, directly or indirectly, may engage, the provisions of this
_Article IX _are set forth to regulate and define the conduct of certain
affairs of the Corporation with respect to certain classes or categories of
business opportunities as they may involve the Sponsor, the Founder Holder,
[PIPE Holder], any Non-Employee Directors or each of their respective
Affiliates and the powers, rights, duties and liabilities of the Corporation
and its directors, officers and stockholders in connection therewith.

B. None of (i) the Sponsor, (ii) the Founder Holder, (iii) [PIPE
Holder] or (iv) any Non-Employee Director (including any Non-Employee
Director who serves as an officer of the Corporation in both his or her
director and officer capacities) (the Persons (as defined below) identified
in (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above, and in each case, its, his or her
Affiliates, being referred to, collectively, as " _Identified Persons_ " and,
individually, as an " _Identified Person_ ") shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, have any duty to refrain from directly or indirectly (1)
engaging in and possessing interests in other business ventures of every type
and description, including those engaged in the same or similar business
activities or lines of business in which the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries now engages or proposes to engage or (2) competing with the
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, on its own account, or in partnership
with, or as an employee, officer, director or shareholder of any other
Person, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, no Identified Person

the Corporation for breach of any fiduciary duty solely by reason of the fact
that such Identified Person engages in any such activities. To the fullest
extent permitted from time to time by the laws of the State of Delaware, the
Corporation hereby renounces any interest or expectancy in, or right to be
offered an opportunity to participate in, any business opportunity that may
be a corporate opportunity for an Identified Person and the Corporation or any
of its Affiliates, except as provided in Section (C) of this _Article IX_.
Subject to said Section (C) of this _Article IX_, in the event that any
Identified Person acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter that
may be a corporate or other business opportunity for itself, herself or
himself, or any of its or his or her Affiliates, and the Corporation or any of
its Affiliates, such Identified Person shall, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, have no duty (fiduciary, contractual or otherwise) to communicate or
present such transaction or matter to the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries or stockholders, as the case may be and, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, shall not be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders
or to any subsidiary of the Corporation for breach of any duty (fiduciary,
contractual or otherwise) as a stockholder, director or officer of the
Corporation by reason of the fact that such Identified Person, directly or
indirectly, pursues or acquires such opportunity for itself, herself or
himself, directs such opportunity to another Person or does not present such
opportunity to the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or stockholders (or
its Affiliates).

C. The Corporation does not renounce its interest in any corporate
opportunity offered to any Non-Employee Director (including any Non-
Employee Director who serves as an officer of this Corporation) if such
opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely and exclusively in his
or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation and such
opportunity is one the Corporation is legally and contractually permitted to
undertake, and the provisions of _Section (B)_ of this _Article IX _shall
not apply to any such corporate opportunity. This _Section (C)_ of this
_Article IX_ shall not affect the Corporation's renunciation of such
corporate opportunity in this _Article IX_ or otherwise with respect to any
other Identified Person.

  



  

D. In addition to and notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this _Article IX_, a corporate opportunity shall not be deemed to be a
potential corporate opportunity for the Corporation if it is a business
opportunity that (i) the Corporation is neither financially or legally able,
nor contractually permitted to undertake, (ii) from its nature, is not in the
line of the Corporation's business or is of no practical advantage to the
Corporation or (iii) is one in which the Corporation has no interest or
reasonable expectancy.

  



  

E. For purposes of this _Article IX_, (i) " _Affiliate_ " shall

ARTICLE XI

  

INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

A. _Right to Indemnification_. Each person who was or is made a
party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a " _proceeding_ ")
(whether or not such proceeding is initiated by or in the right of the
Corporation), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was, or has agreed
to become, a director or an officer of the Corporation or, while a
director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving, or has agreed to
serve, at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee,
agent or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation or of
a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service
with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an " _indemnitee_
"), whether the basis of such proceeding is an alleged action or omission in
an official capacity as a director, officer, employee, agent or trustee or in
any other capacity (other than a personal capacity) while serving as a
director, officer, employee, agent or trustee, shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law,
as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such
amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to
provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation
to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss
(including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties
and amounts paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered
by or on behalf of such indemnitee in connection with such proceeding and
appeal therefrom (hereinafter an " _indemnification_ "); _provided, however,_
that, except as provided in _Section XI(C)_ with respect to proceedings to
enforce rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses or with respect
to any compulsory counterclaim brought by such indemnitee, the Corporation
shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part
thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors. Any reference to an
officer of the Corporation in this _Article XI_ shall be deemed to
refer exclusively to the Chief Executive Officer, Vice Chairman, President,
Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel and Secretary of the Corporation
appointed pursuant to the Bylaws, and to any Vice President, Assistant
Secretary, Assistant Treasurer, other officer of the Corporation appointed by
the Board of Directors pursuant to the Bylaws or other person designated by
the title of "Vice President" of the Corporation, and any reference to an
officer of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise shall be deemed to refer exclusively to an
officer appointed by the board of directors or equivalent governing body of
such other entity pursuant to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or
equivalent organizational documents of such other corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise.

  



  

   

13

 



    



  

B. _Right to Advancement of Expenses_. In addition to the right
to indemnification conferred in _Section XI(A)_, an indemnitee shall also
have the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred by the
indemnitee in appearing at, participating in or defending any such proceeding
in advance of its final disposition or in connection with a proceeding brought
to establish or enforce a right to indemnification or advancement of expenses
under this _Article XI_ (which shall be governed by  _Section XI(C)_)
(hereinafter an " _advancement of expenses_ "); _provided, however,_ that, if
the DGCL requires or in the case of an advance made in a proceeding brought
to establish or enforce a right to indemnification or advancement, an
advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a
director or officer of the Corporation (and not in any other capacity in
which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without
limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made solely upon
delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an " _undertaking_
"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if
it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there
is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a " _final adjudication_ ") that
such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified or entitled to advancement
of expenses under _Section XI(A)_ and _Section XI(B)_. As used in this
_Article XI_, "expenses" shall include all attorneys' fees, retainers, court
costs, transcript costs, fees of experts, witness fees, travel expenses,
duplicating costs, printing and binding costs, telephone charges, postage,
delivery service fees and all other disbursements or expenses of the types
customarily incurred in connection with prosecuting, defending, preparing to
prosecute or defend, investigating, participating, or being or preparing to be
a witness in a proceeding, or responding to, or objecting to, a request to
provide discovery in any proceeding. Expenses also shall include expenses
incurred in connection with any appeal resulting from any proceeding and any
federal, state, local or foreign taxes imposed on the indemnitee as a result
of the actual or deemed receipt of any payments under this Certificate of
Incorporation, including without limitation the premium, security for, and
other costs relating to any cost bond, supersede as bond, or other appeal bond
or its equivalent. Expenses, however, shall not include amounts paid in
settlement by indemnitee or the amount of judgments or fines against
indemnitee.

C. _Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit_. If a claim under _Section
XI(A)_ or _Section XI(B)_ is not paid in full by the Corporation within (i)
60 days after a written claim for indemnification has been received by the
Corporation or (ii) 20 days after a claim for an advancement of expenses has
been received by the Corporation, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter
bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim
for indemnification or to obtain advancement of expenses, as applicable. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, if successful in whole or in part in any
such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement
of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be
entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In
(i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification
hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to
an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) any suit
brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to
the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such
expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any
applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the
failure of the Corporation (including by its directors who are not parties to
such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or
its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of
such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the
circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation
(including by its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of
such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the
indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a
presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of
conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a
defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a
right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or
brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to
the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this
_Article XI_ or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.

  



  

D. _Indemnification Not Exclusive_.

  



  

1. The provision of indemnification to or the advancement of expenses and costs to any indemnitee under this _Article XI_, or the entitlement of any indemnitee to indemnification or advancement of expenses and costs under this _Article XI_, shall not limit or restrict in any way the power of the Corporation to indemnify or advance expenses and costs to such indemnitee in any other way permitted by law (common or statutory) or be deemed exclusive of, or invalidate, any right to which any indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses and costs may be entitled under any law (common or statutory), agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action or omission in such indemnitee's capacity as an officer, director, employee or agent of the Corporation and as to action or omission in any other capacity.

  



  

   

15

 



    



  

2. Given that certain jointly indemnifiable claims (as defined below) may arise due to the service of the indemnitee as a director or officer of the Corporation at the request of the indemnitee-related entities (as defined below), the Corporation shall be fully and primarily responsible for the payment to the indemnitee in respect of indemnification or advancement of expenses in connection with any such jointly indemnifiable claims, pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this _Article XI_, irrespective of any right of recovery the indemnitee may have from the indemnitee-related entities. Under no circumstance shall the Corporation be entitled to any right of subrogation or contribution by the indemnitee-related entities and no right of advancement or recovery the indemnitee may have from the indemnitee-related entities shall reduce or otherwise alter the rights of the indemnitee or the obligations of the Corporation hereunder. In the event that any of the indemnitee-related entities shall make any payment to the indemnitee in respect of indemnification or advancement of expenses with respect to any jointly indemnifiable claim, the indemnitee-related entity making such payment shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of the indemnitee against the Corporation, and the indemnitee shall execute all papers reasonably required and shall do all things that may be reasonably necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents as may be necessary to enable the indemnitee-related entities effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights. Each of the indemnitee-related entities shall be third-party beneficiaries with respect to this _Section XI(D)(2)_, entitled to enforce this _Section XI(D)(2)_.

  



  

For purposes of this _Section (D)(2)_ of  _Article XI_, the following terms
shall have the following meanings:

  



  

(i) The term " _indemnitee-related entities_ " means any
corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise (other than the Corporation or any
other corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture,
trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise for which the indemnitee has
agreed, on behalf of the Corporation or at the Corporation's request, to
serve as a director, officer, employee or agent and which service is covered
by the indemnity described herein) from whom an indemnitee may be entitled to
indemnification or advancement of expenses with respect to which, in whole or
in part, the Corporation may also have an indemnification or advancement
obligation.

  



  

(ii) The term "j _ointly indemnifiable claims_ " shall be broadly
construed and shall include, without limitation, any action, suit or
proceeding for which the indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification or
advancement of expenses from both the indemnitee-related entities and the
Corporation pursuant to Delaware law, any agreement or certificate of
incorporation, bylaws, partnership agreement, operating agreement,
certificate of formation, certificate of limited partnership or comparable
organizational documents of the Corporation or the indemnitee-related
entities, as applicable.

  



  

   

16

 



    



  

E. _Nature of Rights_. The rights conferred upon indemnitees in
this _Article XI _shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as
to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to
the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators. Any
amendment, alteration or repeal of this _Article XI_ that adversely
affects any right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective
only and shall not limit, eliminate, or impair any such right with respect to
any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or
omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal.

  



  

F. _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain
insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, limited
liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
(including any employee benefit plan) against any expense, liability or loss,
incurred by it or him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or
her status as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation,
whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person
against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

  



  

G. _Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation_.
The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board
of Directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of
expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of
the provisions of this _Article XI_ with respect to the indemnification and
advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.

  



  

H. _Partial Indemnification_. If an indemnitee is entitled under
any provision of this _Article XI_ to indemnification by the Corporation for
some or a portion of the expenses, liabilities and losses (including
attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and
amounts paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by or
on behalf of such indemnitee in connection with any proceeding and any appeal
therefrom but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the
Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify indemnitee for the portion of such
expenses, liabilities and losses to which indemnitee is entitled.

  



  

I. _Savings Clause_. If this _Article XI_ or any portion hereof
shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent
jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each
indemnitee as to any expenses, liabilities and losses in connection with any
proceeding, including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, to the
fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this _Article XI_ that
shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law.

  



  

J. _Amendment_. No amendment, termination or repeal of this
_Article XI_ or of the relevant provisions of the DGCL or any
other applicable laws shall affect or diminish in any way the rights of any
indemnitee to indemnification under the provisions hereof with respect to any
proceeding arising out of or relating to any actions, transactions or facts
occurring prior to the final adoption of such amendment, termination or
repeal.

reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
validity, legality and enforceability of such provision or provisions in any
other circumstance and of the remaining provisions in the Certificate of
Incorporation and the application of such provision or provisions to other

certain Stockholders Agreement of the Corporation, dated as of October [●],
2020, by and among the Corporation, Churchill Sponsor II LLC (the " _Sponsor_

otherwise modified from time to time, the " _Stockholders Agreement_ "), (b)
as provided in that certain Subscription Agreement, dated as of October [●],
2020, by and among the Corporation and [PIPE Holder] (the "

meeting (or any supplement thereto) delivered pursuant to _Section 2.04_,
(d) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or any authorized
committee thereof or (e) by any stockholder of the Corporation who (i) was a
stockholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this _Section
2.03_ was given, on the record date for the determination of stockholders of
the Corporation entitled to vote at the meeting, and at the time of the
meeting, (ii) is entitled to vote at the meeting and (iii) subject to _Section
2.03(C)(4)_ and  _Section 2.03(C)(5)_, complies with the notice procedures
set forth in these Bylaws as to such business or nomination.  _Section
2.03(A)(1)(e)_ shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make
nominations (other than pursuant to _Section 2.03(A)(1)(a)_) and _Section
2.03(A)(1)(b)_ or submit other business before an annual meeting of
stockholders (other than pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")).

  



  

(2) For nominations of persons for election to the Board of
Directors and the proposal of other business to be properly brought before an
annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to _Section 2.03(A)(1)(e)_, the
stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing and otherwise in
proper form in accordance with this _Section 2.03(A)(2)_ to the Secretary
of the Corporation (the " _Secretary_ "), and, in the case of business other
than nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors, such
other business must constitute a proper matter for stockholder action under
applicable law. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to
the Secretary not earlier than the Close of Business (as defined herein) on
the 120th calendar day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's
annual meeting nor later than the Close of Business on the 90th calendar day

for any new positions created by such increase, if it is received by the
Secretary of the Corporation not later than the Close of Business on the tenth
calendar day following the day on which such public announcement is first

only such business shall be conducted at an annual or special meeting of
stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this Section. Except as otherwise provided by law,

shall, in addition to making any other determination that may be appropriate
for the conduct of the meeting, have the power and duty to determine whether
a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting
was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures
set forth in these Bylaws and, if any proposed nomination or business is not
in compliance with these Bylaws, to declare that such defective proposal or
nomination shall be disregarded. The date and time of the opening and the
closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at
a meeting shall be announced at the meeting by the chairman of the meeting.
The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for
the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate.
Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted
by the Board of Directors, the chairman of the meeting shall have the right
and authority to convene and (for any or no reason) to recess and/or adjourn
the meeting, to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do

meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the
establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules

this _Section 2.03_, unless otherwise required by law, if the Noticing
Stockholder (or a qualified representative thereof) does not appear at the
annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present a
nomination or business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such
proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in
respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation. For purposes
of this _Section 2.03_, to be considered a qualified representative of the
Noticing Stockholder, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or
partner of such Noticing Stockholder or must be authorized by a
writing executed by such Noticing Stockholder or an electronic transmission
delivered by such Noticing Stockholder to act for such Noticing Stockholder
as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such
writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing
or electronic transmission, at the meeting of stockholders. Unless and to the
extent determined by the Board of Directors or the chairman of the meeting,

Section 2.04 _Notice of Meetings_. Whenever stockholders are required
or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a timely notice in writing

DGCL, of the meeting, which shall state the place, if any, date and time of
the meeting, the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders
and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such
meeting, the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at
the meeting, if such date is different from the record date for determining
stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, and, in the case of a special
meeting, the purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be mailed to or
transmitted electronically by the Secretary of the Corporation to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote thereat as of the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting. Unless
otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these

pursuant to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, each
stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled
to one vote for each share of stock held by such stockholder which has voting
power upon the matter in question. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a
meeting of stockholders or to express consent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such
stockholder by proxy in any manner provided by applicable law, but no such
proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless
the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it
states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with
an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder
may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and
voting in person or by delivering to the Secretary of the Corporation a
revocation of the proxy or a new proxy bearing a later date. Unless required
by the Certificate of Incorporation or applicable law, or determined by the
chairman of the meeting to be advisable, the vote on any question need not be
by ballot. On a vote by ballot, each ballot shall be signed by the
stockholder voting, or by such stockholder's proxy, if there be such proxy.
When a quorum is present or represented at any meeting, the vote of the
holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares of stock present in
person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matter
shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is
one upon which, by express provision of applicable law, of the rules or
regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation, of any
regulation applicable to the Corporation or its securities, of the Certificate
of Incorporation or of these Bylaws, a different vote is required, in which
case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such
question. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence and subject to the
Certificate of Incorporation, all elections of directors shall be determined
by a plurality of the votes cast in respect of the shares of stock present in
person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the
election of directors.

stockholders holding a majority in voting power of the shares of stock of the
Corporation, present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon,
shall have the power to adjourn the meeting from time to time without notice
other than announcement at the meeting until a quorum shall be present. Any
business may be transacted at the adjourned meeting that might have been
transacted at the meeting originally noticed. If the adjournment is for more
than 30 days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the
adjournment a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to
vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board of Directors shall fix as
the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of such
adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination
of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and shall give
notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote

remote communication:

  



  

(A) participate in a meeting of stockholders and

thereof. The Corporation may designate one or more persons as alternate
inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. In the event that no
inspector so appointed or designated is able to act at a meeting of
stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more
inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the
discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute
faithfully the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to
the best of his or her ability. The inspector or inspectors so appointed or
designated shall (i) ascertain the number of shares of capital stock of the
Corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share, (ii)
determine the shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented and the
number of votes entitled to be cast, in each case at the meeting and
the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all votes and ballots, (iv)
determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of
any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors and (v) certify
their determination of the number of shares of capital stock of the
Corporation represented and the number of votes entitled to be cast, in each
case at the meeting and such inspectors' count of all votes and ballots. Such
certification and report shall specify such other information as may be
required by law. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and
ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, the
inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by applicable law. No
person who is a candidate for an office at an election may serve as an
inspector at such election.

The shares of stock of the Corporation shall be uncertificated and shall not
be represented by certificates, except to the extent as may be required by
applicable law or as otherwise authorized by the Board of Directors.

  



  

If shares of stock of the Corporation shall be certificated, such
certificates shall be in such form as is consistent with the Certificate of
Incorporation and applicable law. Every holder of stock in the Corporation
represented by certificates shall be entitled to have a certificate signed
by, or in the name of the Corporation by, any two authorized officers of the
Corporation (it being understood that each of the Chief Executive Officer,
the Vice Chairman, the President, any Vice President, the Treasurer, any
Assistant Treasurer, the Secretary, and any Assistant Secretary of the
Corporation shall be an authorized officer for such purpose), certifying the
number and class of shares of stock of the Corporation owned by such holder.
Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. The Board
of Directors shall have the power to appoint one or more transfer agents
and/or registrars for the transfer or registration of certificates of stock
of any class, and may require stock certificates to be countersigned or
registered by one or more of such transfer agents and/or registrars. The name
of the holder of record of the shares represented thereby, with the number of
such shares and the date of issue, shall be entered on the books of the
Corporation. With respect to all uncertificated shares, the name of the
holder of record of such uncertificated shares represented, with the number of
such shares and the date of issue, shall be entered on the books of the
Corporation.

  



  

Section 5.02 _Shares Without Certificates_. If the Board of Directors
chooses to issue shares of stock without certificates, the Corporation,
if required by the DGCL, shall, within a reasonable time after the issue or
transfer of shares without certificates, send the stockholder a statement of
the information required by the DGCL. The Corporation may adopt a system of
issuance, recordation and transfer of its shares of stock by electronic or
other means not involving the issuance of certificates, provided that the use
of such system by the Corporation is permitted in accordance with applicable
law.

  



  

Section 5.03 _Transfer of Shares_. Shares of stock of the Corporation
shall be transferable upon its books by the holders thereof, in person or
by their duly authorized attorneys or legal representatives, upon surrender
to the Corporation by delivery thereof (to the extent evidenced by a physical
stock certificate) to the person in charge of the stock and transfer books and
ledgers. Certificates representing such shares, if any, shall be cancelled
and new certificates, if the shares are to be certificated, shall thereupon be
issued. Shares of capital stock of the Corporation that are not represented
by a certificate shall be transferred in accordance with any procedures
adopted by the Corporation or its agent and applicable law. A record shall be
made of each transfer. Whenever any transfer of shares shall be made for
collateral security, and not absolutely, it shall be so expressed in the entry
of the transfer if, when the certificates are presented, both the transferor
and transferee request the Corporation to do so. The Corporation shall have
power and authority to make such rules and regulations as it may deem
necessary or proper concerning the issue, transfer and registration of
certificates for shares of stock of the Corporation.

Section 5.04 _Lost, Stolen, Destroyed or Mutilated Certificates_. A new
certificate of stock or uncertificated shares may be issued in the place of
any certificate previously issued by the Corporation alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, and the Corporation may, in its discretion,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his or her
legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond, in such sum as the
Corporation may direct, in order to indemnify the Corporation against any
claims that may be made against it in connection therewith. A new certificate
or uncertificated shares of stock may be issued in the place of any
certificate previously issued by the Corporation that has become mutilated
upon the surrender by such owner of such mutilated certificate and, if
required by the Corporation, the posting of a bond by such owner in an amount
sufficient to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made
against it in connection therewith.

  



  

Section 5.05 _List of Stockholders Entitled To Vote_. The Corporation
shall prepare, at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders,
a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting (
_provided, however,_ if the record date for determining the stockholders
entitled to vote is less than ten days before the date of the meeting, the
list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day
before the meeting date), arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the
address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name
of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any
stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting at least ten days prior to
the meeting (a) on a reasonably accessible electronic network; _provided_
that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the
notice of meeting or (b) during ordinary business hours at the principal
place of business of the Corporation. In the event that the
Corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network,
the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is
available only to stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be
held at a place, then a list of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting
shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the
whole time thereof and may be examined by any stockholder who is present. If
the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the
list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the
whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and
the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice
of the meeting. Except as otherwise provided by law, the stock ledger shall
be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the
list of stockholders required by this _Section 5.05_ or to vote in person or
by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.

Section 5.06 _Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of
Record_.

  



  

(A) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders
entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof,
the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted
by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall, unless otherwise
required by law, not be more than 60 nor less than ten days before the date
of such meeting. If the Board of Directors so fixes a date, such date shall
also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at
such meeting unless the Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes
such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall
be the date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the
Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if
notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day
on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to
any adjournment of the meeting;  _provided, however,_ that the Board of
Directors may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled
to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the
record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the
same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders
entitled to vote in accordance herewith at the adjourned meeting.

  



  

(B) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders
entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution
or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of
any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other
lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date
shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date
is adopted, and which record date shall not be more than 60 days prior to
such action. If no such record date is fixed, the record date for determining
stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the
day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

  



  

(C) Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation,
in order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, and which record date shall not be more than ten days after the
date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the
Board of Directors. If no record date for determining stockholders entitled
to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting is fixed
by the Board of Directors, (i) when no prior action of the Board of Directors
is required by law, the record date for such purpose shall be the first date
on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed
to be taken is delivered to the Corporation in accordance with applicable
law, and (ii) if prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law,
the record date for such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day
on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior
action.

  



  

Section 5.07 _Registered Stockholders_. Prior to the surrender to
the Corporation of the certificate or certificates for a share or shares of
stock or notification to the Corporation of the transfer of uncertificated
shares with a request to record the transfer of such share or shares, the
Corporation may treat the registered owner of such share or shares as the
person entitled to receive dividends, to vote, to receive notifications and
otherwise to exercise all the rights and powers of an owner of such share or
shares. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Corporation shall not be
bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share
or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have
express or other notice thereof.

stockholder at such stockholder's address as it appears on the records of the
Corporation. Other forms of notice shall be deemed given as provided in the
DGCL. Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given
effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders may be given by
electronic transmission in the manner provided in Section 232 of the DGCL.

  



  

Section 6.02 _Waiver of Notice_. A written waiver of any notice, signed
by a stockholder or director, or waiver by electronic transmission by
such person, whether given before or after the time of the event for which
notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to the notice required to
be given to such person. Neither the business nor the purpose of any meeting
need be specified in such a waiver. Attendance at any meeting (in person or
by remote communication) shall constitute waiver of notice except attendance
for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened.

of Transmittal as paid to the person(s) in respect of which such withholding

By signing the enclosed Letter of Transmittal, you hereby represent and
warrant that the mailing address, wire transfer information or information
provided for special payment/delivery, as applicable, set forth in the
enclosed Letter of Transmittal is true, correct and complete
and, notwithstanding any limitations in the Merger Agreement, you hereby
agree to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, and their respective Affiliates, agents and Representatives from
any claims by any person, including you, as to the delivery of the Company
Shares (to the extent that the concept of "delivery" of the Company Shares is
applicable under the Laws of the State of Delaware, and it being understood
that the Luxembourg Companies' Law does not require a "delivery" of the
Company Shares in the context or as a result of the Merger) to such mailing
address or bank account or pursuant to such special payment/delivery
instructions, as applicable, of any amounts to be paid to you, or on your
behalf, in respect of your Company Shares (and, to the extent applicable, any

By signing the enclosed Letter of Transmittal, you understand that your
receipt of your applicable portion of the Merger Consideration (and, to the
extent applicable, any amount in respect of the Class C Common Stock
Redemption) shall be conditioned upon, and shall not occur unless and until,
the Exchange Agent has received the enclosed Letter of Transmittal, duly
completed and signed, together with all accompanying evidences of authority
in form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and any other required documents. By
signing the enclosed Letter of Transmittal, you agree that, to the extent
applicable, delivery of the Company Shares will be effected, and the risk of
loss and title to such Company Shares will pass, only upon proper delivery
thereof to the Exchange Agent. All questions as to validity, form and
eligibility of any transfer of Company Shares hereunder, to the extent
applicable, will be made by the reasonable determination of Buyer in
consultation with the Company (which may delegate power in whole or in part to
the Exchange Agent), which reasonable determination shall be final and
binding on all parties. The Exchange Agent shall promptly take reasonable
action to inform you of any defects that it is (in consultation with the
Company and Buyer) unwilling to waive and may, but shall not be required
to, take reasonable action to assist you to correct any such defects. You
hereby covenant and agree that upon request, you will execute, complete and
deliver any additional documents reasonably deemed by the Exchange Agent to be
necessary to complete the proper transfer of your Company Shares (and, to the
extent applicable, redemption of any Buyer Class C Common Stock immediately
thereafter) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement and this letter and the enclosed Letter of Transmittal.

  



  

If there is a conflict between any provision of this letter and/or the
enclosed Letter of Transmittal and a provision in the Merger Agreement, each
of this letter and/or the enclosed Letter of Transmittal and the Merger
Agreement is to be interpreted and construed, if possible, so as to avoid or
minimize such conflict, but to the extent, and only to the extent, of such
conflict, the provision of the Merger Agreement shall control unless
specifically provided otherwise therein.

  



  

You hereby acknowledge and agree that, subject to adjustment in accordance
with the Merger Agreement, (i) each of Buyer and the Surviving
Corporation can rely on the definition of each of (a) "Class A First Lien
Exchange Ratio", (b) "Class A Second Lien Exchange Ratio" and (c) "Class C
Exchange Ratio" as set forth on Exhibit A of the Merger Agreement as setting
forth an accurate formula for calculating the Per Share Merger Consideration
in the aggregate and shall have no liability for any errors or omissions
therein, (ii) you irrevocably waive and release and covenant not to sue
Buyer, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Affiliates
from any and all liabilities arising from or related to the allocation of the
Per Share Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable to you pursuant
to the Merger Agreement (other than with respect to any liability arising
from or related to you not receiving your applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration or any other amounts payable to you in accordance with the
Merger Agreement, in each case, following the satisfaction of all
applicable requirements set forth herein and in the Merger Agreement) and
(iii) in the event of a conflict between any provision of this letter and/or
the enclosed Letter of Transmittal and the Merger Agreement, the Merger
Agreement shall control unless specifically provided otherwise therein.

  



  

You hereby acknowledge and agree that by signing the enclosed Letter of
Transmittal, in connection with and contingent upon the consummation of the
Merger, you agree to, and consent to the termination in accordance with its
terms of, that certain Shareholders' Agreement, dated as of August 27, 2020
(the "Shareholders' Agreement"), by and among the Company and all

the Effective Time.

You hereby acknowledge and agree that during the period commencing on the
Closing Date and continuing to and including the date that is 180 days
following the Closing Date (the "Lock-Up Period"), you shall not Transfer any
Buyer Common Stock, or any securities convertible into, exchangeable for or
that represent the right to receive Buyer Common Stock, or any interest in any
of the foregoing, whether now owned or hereinafter acquired, are owned
directly by you (including holding as a custodian) or with respect to which
you have beneficial ownership within the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") (collectively, the
"covered shares"). For purposes of this paragraph, "Transfer" shall mean the
(a) sale or assignment of, offer to sell, contract or agreement to sell,
hypothecate, pledge, grant of any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of
or agreement to dispose of, directly or indirectly, or establishment or
increase of a put equivalent position or liquidation with respect to or
decrease of a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the
Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated
thereunder with respect to, any security, (b) entry into any swap or other
arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the
economic consequences of ownership of any security, whether any such
transaction is to be settled by delivery of such securities, in cash or
otherwise, or (c) public announcement of any intention to effect any
transaction specified in clause (a) or (b). The foregoing restriction is
expressly agreed to preclude you from engaging in any hedging or other
transaction which is designed to or which reasonably could be expected to
lead to or result in a sale or disposition of the covered shares even if such
covered shares would be disposed of by someone other than you. Such
prohibited hedging or other transactions would include, without limitation,
any short sale or any purchase, sale or grant of any right (including,
without limitation, any put or call option) with respect to any of the covered
shares or with respect to any security that includes, relates to, or derives
any significant part of its value from such covered shares. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, you may Transfer covered shares (i) by will or intestacy, (ii)
as a bona fide gift or gifts, including to charitable organizations, (iii) to
any trust, partnership, limited liability company or other entity for the
direct or indirect benefit of the undersigned or the immediate family of the
undersigned (for purposes of this paragraph, "immediate family" shall mean
any relationship by blood, current or former marriage or adoption, not more
remote than first cousin), (iv) to any immediate family member or other
dependent, (v) as a distribution to your limited partners, members or
stockholders, (vi) to your Affiliated investment fund or another Affiliated
entity you or your Affiliates control or manage, (vii) to a nominee or
custodian of a person to whom a disposition or transfer would be permissible
under clauses (i) through (vi) above, (viii) pursuant to an order or decree
of a governmental authority, (ix) pursuant to a bona fide third-party tender
offer, merger, consolidation or other similar transaction in each case made
to all holders of the covered shares involving a change of control
transaction (including negotiating and entering into an agreement providing
for any such transaction), provided that in the event that such tender offer,
merger, consolidation or other such transaction is not completed, your shares
of Buyer Common Stock shall remain subject to the provisions of this
paragraph, (x) to Buyer for the purpose of satisfying any withholding taxes
(including estimated taxes) due as a result of the exercise of any option to
purchase shares or the vesting of any restricted stock awards granted by
Buyer pursuant to employee benefit plans or arrangements which are set to
expire or automatically vest during the Lock-Up Period, in each case on a
"cashless" or "net exercise" basis, where any shares you receive upon any
such exercise or vesting will be subject to the terms of this paragraph, or
(xi) with the prior written consent of Buyer; provided that, in the case of
each transfer or distribution pursuant to clauses (ii) through (vii) above,
(I) each donee, trustee, distributee or transferee, as the case may be,
agrees to be bound in writing by the restrictions set forth in
this paragraph; and (II) any such transfer or distribution shall not involve
a disposition for value, other than with respect to any such transfer or
distribution for which the transferor or distributor receives (A) equity
interests of such transferee or (B) such transferee's interests in the
transferor. For the purpose of this paragraph, "Affiliate" shall mean, with
respect to any specified person, any person that, directly or indirectly,
controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such specified
person, through one or more intermediaries or otherwise. You hereby agree and
consent to the entry of stop transfer instructions with Buyer's transfer
agent and registrar against the transfer of the covered shares except in
compliance with the foregoing restrictions and to the addition of a legend to
your shares of Buyer Common Stock describing the foregoing restrictions.

yourself and your past, present or future heirs, executors, administrators,
predecessors-in-interest, successors, permitted assigns, equityholders,

ending at the Effective Time (collectively, the Released Matters"); provided,
that nothing contained herein shall constitute a release of claims or any
other matter other than the Released Matters. This paragraph is for the
benefit of the Released Parties and shall be enforceable by any of them
directly against the Releasing Parties.

  



  

To the extent you are entitled to dissent or exercise appraisal of your

forever waive all dissenter's and appraisal rights of such shares pursuant to
any applicable Law, (ii) withdraw any written objections to the Merger and/or
demands for appraisal, (iii) agree that the fair value of such shares is not
more than the consideration payable pursuant to the Merger, and (iv)
agree that the Company accept such withdrawal, if any, with respect to such
shares, including, but not limited to, any such rights granted pursuant to
any voting trust, shareholders agreement or other similar arrangement entered
into by you or the Releasing Parties.

  



  

You hereby acknowledge California Civil Code Section 1542 ("Section 1542")

said statutes and assume all risks for claims heretofore or hereinafter
arising, known or unknown, against any of the Released Parties relating to,

Company or any of its Affiliates or otherwise (including in respect of any
rights of contribution or indemnification)) with respect to any facts or
circumstances that existed on or prior to the Effective Time, whether known
or unknown, to you, except as expressly set forth in the immediately
preceding paragraph.

  



  

You hereby represent that you have not made any assignment or transfer of any
claim or other matter covered by the Released Matters and have not filed any
Action of any kind against any Released Party relating to any Released Matter,
and you hereby irrevocably covenant to refrain from, directly or indirectly,
asserting any claim, or commencing, instituting, or causing to be commenced or
instituted, any Action of any kind against any Released Party, based upon any
Released Matter. You hereby acknowledge and intend that this release shall be
effective as a bar to each and every one of the claims hereinabove mentioned,

in accordance with each and every express term or provision hereof, including
those (i) relating to any claims hereinabove mentioned or implied or (ii)
relating to unknown and unsuspected claims (notwithstanding any state statute
that expressly limits the effectiveness of a general release of unknown,
unsuspected and unanticipated claims).

No authority herein conferred or agreed to be conferred shall be affected by,
and all such authority shall survive, your death or incapacity. All
your obligations hereunder shall be binding upon your heirs, estates,
executors, administrators, personal representatives, successors and permitted
assigns. Nothing herein is intended to or will confer any rights or remedies

warranties, acknowledgements, agreements, waivers and covenants set forth in
this Letter of Transmittal will remain in full force and effect pursuant to

---|---|--- 
  



   | •| BOX G - Wire Instructions: To elect a bank wire transfer please
complete Box G in its entirety. A bank wire transfer, rather than payment by
check, will help to expedite your receipt of the funds. Please contact your
bank for questions regarding the appropriate bank routing number and account
number to be used. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | •| Important Tax Information: Under current U.S. federal income tax
laws, [●] (as payer) may be required under the backup withholding rules to
withhold a portion of the amount of any payments made to certain holders (or
other payees) pursuant to the Merger and the Class C Common Stock Redemption.
In order to avoid such backup withholding, if the person receiving payment
for the shares is a United States person (for U.S. federal income tax
purposes), such payee must timely complete and sign the enclosed IRS Form W-9
to certify the payee's correct taxpayer identification number ("TIN") and to
certify that such payee is not subject to such backup withholding, or must
otherwise establish a basis for exemption from backup withholding (currently
imposed at a rate of 24%). Certain holders or other payees (including, among
others, corporations and tax-exempt organizations) are not subject to these
backup withholding and reporting requirements. Exempt payees should
furnish their TIN, provide the applicable codes in the box labeled
"Exemptions," and sign, date and send the IRS Form W-9 to the Exchange Agent.
A holder or other payee who is a foreign individual or a foreign entity should
complete, sign, and submit to [●] the appropriate IRS Form W-8 (instead of an
IRS Form W-9), signed under penalties of perjury, attesting to such person's
exempt status. Holders and other payees are urged to consult their own tax
advisors to determine whether they are exempt from or otherwise not subject
to backup withholding. The appropriate IRS Form W-8 may be obtained from
the Exchange Agent or from the IRS. Additional copies of IRS Form W-9 are
available from the IRS by calling 1-800-TAX-FORM (1-800-829-3676) or from the
IRS website at _www.irs.gov_. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

If a stockholder or payee is a citizen or individual resident of the United
States, the TIN is generally his or her social security number. If the
Exchange Agent is not provided with the correct TIN, a $50 penalty may be
imposed by the IRS and/or payments made with respect to shares exchanged
pursuant to the Merger and the Class C Common Stock Redemption may be subject
to backup withholding. Failure to comply truthfully with the backup
withholding requirements, if done willfully, may also result in the imposition
of criminal and/or civil fines and penalties. See IRS Form W-9 attached
hereto for additional information.

  



  

If backup withholding applies, [●] is required to withhold on any payments
made to the holder or other payee. Backup withholding is not an additional
tax. A holder or payee subject to the backup withholding rules will be
allowed a credit of the amount withheld against such holder's U.S. federal
income tax liability, and, if backup withholding results in an overpayment of
tax, such holder may be entitled to a refund, provided the requisite
information is correctly furnished to the IRS in a timely manner.

  



   | •| Deficient Presentments: If you request a registration change that
is not in proper form, the required documentation will be requested from you
and this will delay processing of any funds.
