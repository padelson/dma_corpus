(ii)At any time prior to the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the
Sale Hearing, Buyer may, by written notice to Parent, remove any Contract that
previously has been designated as an Assumed Contract on Annex B, such
Contract shall thereafter be an Excluded Asset. For the avoidance of doubt,
there shall be no adjustment to the Initial Purchase Price or the Final
Purchase Price as a result of any such removal.



(iii)At any time prior to the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the
Sale Hearing, Buyer may, by written notice to Parent, designate any Contract

such Contract by Sellers in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code.



(iv)Parent, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the preparation of
the Initial Annex B as contemplated by Section 2(c)(i) above or, as
applicable, after the designation by Buyer of any additional Contracts as
Assumed Contracts in accordance with Section 2(c)(iii) hereof, shall (and

with such assumption and assignment of all Assumed Contracts to be effective
as of the Closing Date. Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate in the foregoing.



(v)In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer
will provide all necessary information regarding Buyer, as well as a financial
commitment of performance by Buyer with respect to the Assumed Contracts from
and after the Closing, to demonstrate adequate assurance of future performance
of the Assumed Contracts so that all Assumed Contracts can be assumed and
assigned by Sellers to Buyer at or prior to the Closing in accordance with the
provisions of section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and this Agreement.

of Contracts, with respect to any Contracts which may not be disclosed to

and agreed to by Buyer and Parent no later than the date that the Bidding
Procedures Order is entered by the Bankruptcy Court), as well any Contracts
that were otherwise undisclosed to Buyer prior to the Sale Hearing (the
"Undisclosed Contracts") but which are, in each case, disclosed to Buyer prior
to the Closing, Buyer may, by written notice to Parent not later than ten (10)
days prior to the Closing, to the extent any such Contract has not previously
been (A) designated as an Assumed Contract on Annex B or (B) rejected by
Sellers, designate such Post-Sale Hearing Contract or Undisclosed Contract as
a Contract to be assumed and assigned hereunder, and upon receipt of any such
notice, Annex B shall be amended and modified accordingly to include such
Contract as an Assumed Contract. Thereafter, Parent shall (and shall cause the
Selling Affiliates to) use commercially reasonable efforts to effect the
assumption of such Contract by Sellers and assignment thereof to Buyer in
accordance 

with the Bankruptcy Code upon Closing. Further, with respect to any Contract
that is not disclosed or otherwise made known to Buyer until after Closing,
but if known would have been assumed by Sellers and assigned to Buyer as part
of Buyer\'s acquisition of the Acquired Assets, Parent shall, upon notice from

efforts to effect the assumption of such Contract by Sellers and assignment
thereof to Buyer provided that (A) such Contracts have not been previously

Cure Amounts with respect thereto, and (C) the Chapter 11 Cases have not yet

be set forth on such statement; provided, that, if Parent and Buyer are not

this Section 2(d), but not, for the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of
Section 2(e).

with all accrued investment income or interest thereon, to be delivered to

books and records of the Business, as the case may be, and any other document
or information reasonably requested by Parent, and necessary in order to allow
Parent and its Representatives to verify the accuracy of the determination by
Buyer of the Buyer\'s Proposed Calculations. To the extent the calculation of

result in a Purchase Price Adjustment that is less than the amount of the
Working Capital Escrow Deposit, Parent and Buyer shall promptly (and in any
event within three (3) Business Days) following delivery of Buyer\'s Proposed
Calculations, instruct the Escrow Agent to immediately release to Parent an
amount equal to the excess of the Working Capital Escrow Deposit over the

Statement.

Calculations by written notice of objection (the "Notice of Objection")

binding. A Notice of Objection under this Section 2(e)(ii) shall set forth in
reasonable detail Parent\'s alternative calculations of (i) the Closing
Working Capital and the Working Capital Adjustment calculated by reference
thereto and (ii) a recalculation of the Final Purchase Price based on such
amounts. To the extent the recalculation of the Final Purchase Price included
in Parent\'s Notice of Objection would result in a Purchase Price Adjustment
in favor of Buyer, Parent and Buyer shall promptly (and in any event within
three (3) Business Days) following delivery of Parent\'s Notice of Objection,
instruct the Escrow Agent to immediately release the amount of such agreed
Purchase Price Adjustment to Buyer in a manner consistent with Section
2(e)(iv).



(iii)If Parent delivers a Notice of Objection to Buyer within the thirty (30)
day period referred to in Section 2(e)(ii), then any element of the Buyer\'s
Proposed Calculations that is not in dispute on the date such Notice of
Objection is given shall be treated as final and binding, and any dispute (all

resolution of such Disputed Amounts shall be submitted to the Independent
Accountant.



(B)Parent and Buyer shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Independent Accountant to render a decision in accordance with this
Section 2(e)(iii) along with a statement of reasons therefor within thirty
(30) days of the submission of the Disputed Amounts, or a reasonable time

Accountant shall be final and binding upon each Party and the decision of the
Independent Accountant shall constitute an arbitral award that is final,
binding and non-appealable and upon which a judgment may be entered by a court
having jurisdiction thereover.



(C)The Final Purchase Price shall be recalculated based upon the final
determination (or deemed determination) of the Independent Accountant with
respect to the Disputed Amounts and the Final Purchase Price, as so
recalculated, shall be deemed to be final and binding.



(D)If Parent and Buyer submit any Disputed Amounts to the Independent
Accountant for resolution, Parent and Buyer shall each pay their own costs and
expenses incurred under this Section 2(e)(iii). 

Parent shall be responsible for that fraction of the fees and costs of the
Independent Accountant where (1) the numerator of such fraction is the
absolute value of the difference between Parent\'s aggregate position with
respect to the Final Purchase Price and the Final Purchase Price as
recalculated based upon the Independent Accountant\'s final determination with
respect to the Disputed Amounts and (2) the denominator of such fraction is
the absolute value of the difference between Parent\'s aggregate position with
respect to the Final Purchase Price and Buyer\'s aggregate position with
respect to the Final Purchase Price, and Buyer shall be responsible for the
remainder of such fees and costs.



(E)The Independent Accountant shall act as an arbitrator to determine, based
upon the provisions of this Section 2(e)(iii), only the Disputed Amounts and
the determination of each amount of the Disputed Amounts shall be made in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2(e)(i). The Independent
Accountant shall choose an amount that equals, or falls between, the position
of Parent and/or the position of Buyer with respect to each Disputed Amount.



(iv)Upon the determination, in accordance with Section 2(e)(ii) or 2(e)(iii)
of the Final Purchase Price, Parent or Buyer, as the case may be, shall make,
or instruct the Escrow Agent to make, as applicable, the payment required by
this Section 2(e)(iv). The amount payable pursuant to this Section 2(e)(iv) is
referred to herein as the "Purchase Price Adjustment" and shall be treated as
an adjustment to the purchase price for federal, state, local and foreign
income Tax purposes:



(A)If the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Initial Purchase Price,
then Buyer shall pay to Parent for the account of Parent the difference
between the Final Purchase Price and the Initial Purchase Price within three
(3) Business Days of the determination of the Final Purchase Price, such
Purchase Price Adjustment to be paid by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by Parent in writing to Buyer promptly after
the final determination of the Final Purchase Price.



(B)If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Initial Purchase Price, then
the Parties shall take all necessary actions under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement (including the provision of the joint written instructions
required thereunder) to cause the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer for the account
of Buyer out of the Working Capital Escrow Deposit the difference between the
Initial Purchase Price and the Final Purchase Price within three (3) Business
Days of the determination of the Final Purchase Price, such Purchase Price
Adjustment to be paid to Buyer in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement. To the extent that the difference between the Initial Purchase
Price and the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Working Capital Escrow Deposit,
Parent shall pay to Buyer for the account of Buyer the amount of such excess
within three (3) Business Days of the determination of the Final Purchase
Price by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by Buyer in writing to Parent promptly after the final determination of the
Final Purchase Price.



(C)The Parties shall take all necessary actions under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement (including the provision of the joint written instructions
required thereunder) to cause the Escrow Agent to promptly (but in any event
within six (6) Business Days of the determination of the Final Purchase Price)
release to Parent any remaining amount of the (1) Working Capital Escrow
Deposit, less the amount, if any, payable to Buyer pursuant to Section
2(e)(iv)(B) and (2) the Transfer Tax Escrow.

of this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to Section 7(a)(ix) as it
relates to Buyer\'s obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign or
transfer and shall not affect the assignment or transfer 

of any Acquired Asset if (i) an attempted assignment thereof, without the
approval, authorization or consent of, or granting or issuance of any license
or permit by, any third party thereto would constitute a breach thereof or in
any way adversely affect the rights of Buyer thereunder and (ii) the
Bankruptcy Court shall not have entered a Final Order providing that such
consent is not required (each such action, a "Necessary Consent"). In such

promptly as reasonably practicable, any Necessary Consent with respect to any
such Acquired Asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder
for the assignment thereof to Buyer as Buyer may reasonably request. If such
Necessary Consent is not obtained, or if an attempted assignment thereof would
be ineffective, would adversely affect the rights of any Seller thereunder or

cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement, to the extent feasible and at
no expense to such Seller, under which Buyer would obtain the benefits and
assume the obligations thereunder in accordance with this Agreement, including
subcontracting, sub-licensing, or sub-leasing to Buyer, or under which such
Seller would enforce for the benefit of Buyer with Buyer assuming such
Seller\'s obligations and any and all rights of such Seller against a third
party thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, except as provided in Section 8(c)
hereof, and subject to Section 7(a)(ix) as it relates to Buyer\'s obligation
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in the event
Sellers fail to obtain any Necessary Consents, Sellers shall not have any

been breached by Parent.

of Parent, has any reason to believe, that any such supplier will not provide
such services or sell such raw materials, supplies, merchandise and other
goods to the Business at any time after the Closing on terms and conditions
materially similar to those used in its current sales to the Sellers, subject
only to general and customary price increases or decreases and the effects of

its terms, Parent shall not, and shall cause the Selling Affiliates and its
and their respective Representatives not to, and shall use its commercially

of funded indebtedness and their respective Representatives not to (it being
understood that Parent has no power or ability to control or otherwise direct
the actions of its other Affiliates, equity holders and holders of funded
indebtedness and their respective Affiliates) directly or indirectly, (A)
solicit, initiate, encourage, facilitate, respond to, or take any other action
designed to solicit an agreement or understanding with any person (other than
Buyer and its Affiliates and Representatives) concerning any transaction (or
series of transactions) involving the direct or indirect sale, transfer or
other disposition of any Acquired Assets (including through the sale of a
majority of the outstanding equity interests of, or any merger of
consolidation with, any Seller, or pursuant to any plan of reorganization or
liquation, or other financial and/or corporate restructuring of any Seller, or
any similar transaction involving any or all of the Sellers) or any other
transaction involving any Seller or Acquired Assets that could reasonably be
expected to materially impede, interfere with or delay the consummation of, or
materially alter the anticipated economic consequences of, the transactions
contemplated hereby (an "Alternative Transaction"), (B) enter into
negotiations with respect to, or execute, any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement related to an Alternative
Transaction, or (C) furnish non-public information to any person or entity
with respect to an Alternative Transaction. Following entry of the Bidding
Procedures Order, other than pursuant to and in compliance with the terms and
conditions of the Bidding Procedures Order, in no event may Parent or its
Selling Affiliates (or any of their respective Representatives) initiate
contact with, or solicit or encourage submission of any inquiries, proposals
or offers by, any Person (other than Buyer and its Affiliates, agents and
Representatives) with respect to an Alternative Transaction or accept an offer
or proposal from any Person (other than Buyer and its Affiliates, agents and
Representatives) with respect to an Alternative Transaction.



(ii)If an Auction is conducted, and Buyer is not the prevailing party at the
conclusion of such Auction (such prevailing party, the "Successful Bidder"),
Buyer shall be required to serve as the back-up bidder if Buyer is the next
highest or otherwise best bidder at the Auction (such party that is the next
highest or otherwise best bidder at the Auction, the "Back-Up Bidder") and, if
Buyer is the Back-Up Bidder, Buyer shall, notwithstanding Section 8(a)(x), be
required to keep its bid to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement (as the same
may be improved upon by Buyer in the Auction) open and irrevocable until the
expiration of the Outside Back-Up Date, whereupon, except as provided in the
immediately succeeding sentence, and absent Buyer\'s written agreement to
extend the Outside Back-Up Date, this Agreement shall be deemed terminated
pursuant to Section 8(a)(x) and Buyer shall be immediately entitled to the
Expense Reimbursement and Break-Up Fee, all to be paid in accordance with the
terms and conditions of Section 8(c). Notwithstanding the foregoing, following
the Auction, if the Successful Bidder fails to consummate the applicable
Alternative Transaction prior to the expiration of the Outside Back-Up Date as
a result of a breach or failure to perform on the part of such Successful
Bidder, and Parent provides notice to Buyer in writing of such failure before
the expiration of the Outside Back-Up Date, then, if Buyer is the Back-Up
Bidder, this Agreement shall not be deemed terminated pursuant to Section
8(a)(x) and Buyer will be deemed to have the new prevailing bid, and Sellers
will be authorized, without further order of the Bankruptcy Court, to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement (as the same may be improved upon by
Buyer in the Auction) with Buyer; provided, however, for the avoidance of
doubt, in addition to, and not in lieu of, Buyer\'s rights pursuant to Section
8 (including Buyer\'s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8(a)(iv) or Section 8(a)(x) and to receive all applicable remedies pursuant to
Section 8(c)), in the event that this Agreement is thereafter terminated by
Buyer pursuant to Section 8(a)(ii) (solely as a result of the conditions set
forth in Sections 7(a)(iii) or (viii) becoming incapable of fulfillment other
than as a result of a breach by Buyer), Parent shall (and shall cause the
Selling Affiliates to), within two (2) Business Days after such termination,
pay to Buyer the Expense Reimbursement.



(e) Notice of Developments. To the extent legally permissible, from the
Agreement Date until the Closing, each of Parent and Buyer will give prompt
written notice (the "Development Notice") to the other Party of (i) the
existence of any fact or circumstance, or the occurrence of any event, which
could be reasonably likely to cause a condition to a Party\'s obligations to
consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement as set forth in
Section 7, not to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, and (ii) the
receipt of any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (such
occurrence, event, or circumstance, including the reasonably foreseeable
consequences thereof, a "Development"); provided, however, that the delivery
of any Development Notice pursuant to this Section 5(e) shall not be deemed to
amend or supplement this Agreement, and the failure to deliver any Development
Notice shall not constitute a waiver by any Party of any right or condition to
the consummation of the 

transactions contemplated in this Agreement. If the notifying Party certifies
(the "Development Certification") to the receiving Party that such Development
has caused or will cause a condition to the receiving Party\'s obligations to
consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement as set forth in
Section 7 not to be satisfied, and that the receiving party is therefore
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the applicable provisions of
Section 8 without any Liability whatsoever (which, for the avoidance of doubt,
means that with respect to Buyer, if Buyer were to terminate following receipt
of a Development Notice, Buyer would be entitled to retain the Deposit) and
the receiving Party fails to exercise its right to terminate this Agreement
within the period of thirty (30) Business Days referred to in Section 8(a)(ii)
or Section 8(a)(iii), as applicable, the Development Notice will be deemed to
have amended the Disclosure Schedules, to have qualified the representations
and warranties of such Party, and to have cured any misrepresentation or
breach of warranty that otherwise might have existed hereunder by reason of
the Development, provided, however, that notwithstanding any such amendment,
qualification or cure, the underlying Development included in such Development
Notice may still form the basis of a right to terminate pursuant to the
applicable provisions of Section 8 to the extent that additional occurrences,
events or circumstances exist or occur that, when taken together with the
Development described in such Development Notice, would give rise to a right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the applicable provisions of Section
8.



(f) Access.



(i)Prior to the Closing, Parent shall (and shall cause the Selling Affiliates
to), upon reasonable advance written request by Buyer, permit Buyer and its
Representatives to have reasonable access during normal business hours, and in
a manner so as not to interfere with normal business operations or violate any
Law, to all premises, properties, personnel, Records and Contracts of the
Business for the purpose of evaluating and reviewing the Business, the
Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities; provided, however, that, for
avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not require any Party to waive, or
take any action with the effect of waiving, its attorney-client privilege or
any confidentiality obligation to which it is bound with respect thereto or
take any action in violation of applicable Law. Except in response to a
request contemplated by the first sentence of this Section 5(f)(i), during the
period from the Agreement Date and ending on the Closing Date, Buyer shall
not, and shall cause its Representatives not to, contact any customers,
suppliers or licensors of the Business in connection with, or pertaining to,
the Business or any subject matter of this Agreement, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned.



(ii)All information obtained pursuant to Section 5(f)(i) shall be subject to
the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.



(g) Press Releases and Public Announcements. Prior to the Closing, no Party
shall issue any press release or make any public announcement relating to the
existence or subject matter of this Agreement without the prior written
approval of the other Parties; provided, however, that any Party may make any
public disclosure it believes in good faith is required by applicable Law
(including the Bankruptcy Code) or the rules of any stock exchange on which
such Party\'s securities are traded (provided that the disclosing Party shall
use all commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the non-disclosing
Party with respect to the text thereto prior to making the disclosure).



(h) Bankruptcy Court Matters.



(i)This Agreement is subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court and the
consideration by Parent and the Bankruptcy Court of higher or better Competing
Bids. From and after the date of entry of the Bidding Procedures Order by the
Bankruptcy Court and until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) the conclusion of any bid
process described in the Bidding Procedures Order, Parent is permitted to (a)
cause their Representatives and Affiliates to initiate contact with, solicit
or encourage submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers by, any Person
(in addition to Buyer and its Affiliates, agents and Representatives) in
connection with any sale or other disposition of Parent, any Selling
Affiliate, the Acquired Assets and/or the Business and (b) respond to any
inquiries or offers to purchase all or any part of the Acquired Assets or the
Business and perform any and all other acts related thereto which are required
under the Bankruptcy Code or other Law, including supplying information
relating to the Business and the Assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries to
prospective buyers in accordance with the terms of the Bidding Procedures.



(ii)Parent shall (and shall cause the Selling Affiliates to) use commercially
reasonable efforts to pursue the entry of the Bidding Procedures Order and the
Sale Order. Parent shall (and shall cause the Selling Affiliates to) use
commercially reasonable efforts to comply (or obtain an order from the
Bankruptcy Court waiving compliance) with all requirements under the
applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Rules and the
Local Bankruptcy Rules in connection with obtaining approval of the Bidding
Procedures Order and the Sale Order. 



(iii)Buyer agrees that it will promptly take such actions as are reasonably
requested by Parent to assist in obtaining entry of the Bidding Procedures
Order, the Sale Order and any other order of the Bankruptcy Court reasonably
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including furnishing declarations, affidavits or other documents or
information for filing with the Bankruptcy Court for the purposes, among
others, of providing adequate assurance of future performance by Buyer with
respect to the Assumed Contracts, providing necessary assurances of
performance by Buyer under this Agreement and demonstrating that Buyer is a
"good faith" purchaser under section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code; provided,
however, in no event shall Buyer or Parent be required to agree to any
amendment of this Agreement.



(iv)As promptly as practicable following the execution of this Agreement (but
no later than Three (3) Business Days after the Agreement Date), Parent shall
(and shall cause the Selling Affiliates to) file the Sale Motion with the
Bankruptcy Court, including all supporting pages, and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to have the Bankruptcy Court enter the Bidding Procedures
Order within twenty-five (25) days from the Commencement Date, subject to the
availability of the Bankruptcy Court (and only to the extent permitted by the
relevant provisions of the Bankruptcy Rules and Local Bankruptcy Rules).



(v)Parent acknowledges and agrees that Buyer has expended considerable time
and expense in connection with this Agreement, and the negotiation thereof,
and the identification and quantification of Assets to be included in the
Acquired Assets. In consideration thereof, the Sale Motion shall include a
request from Sellers that the Bankruptcy Court approve the Expense
Reimbursement and Break-Up Fee, as set forth in Section 5(d) and Section 8(c)
hereof, as administrative priority expenses under sections 503(b) and
507(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code pursuant to the Bidding Procedures Order.



(vi)Parent shall (and shall cause the Selling Affiliates to) use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain entry by the Bankruptcy Court of the Sale Order
no later than sixty (60) days after the Commencement Date (or as soon
thereafter as the Bankruptcy Court\'s schedule permits in the event that
Sellers timely moved the Bankruptcy Court to enter the Sale Order by the
aforementioned deadline).



(vii)Parent shall (and shall cause the Selling Affiliates to) provide Buyer
with copies of all motions, applications, pleadings, notices, proposed orders
and other documents relating to the Acquired Assets, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated therein, at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
filing thereof with the Bankruptcy Court, unless the exigencies of time
prevent the period from being that long, so as to allow Buyer to provide
reasonable comments for incorporation into same.



(viii)In the event the Sale Order is appealed, Buyer shall, and, subject to
the Budget, Parent shall (and shall cause the Selling Affiliates to), use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to defend such appeal at
their own cost and expense.



(ix)Parent further covenants and agrees that, after the entry of the Sale
Order, the terms of any liquidation plan it submits to the Bankruptcy Court,
or any other court for confirmation or sanction, shall not conflict with,
supersede, abrogate, nullify or restrict the terms of this Agreement, or in
any way prevent or interfere with the consummation or performance of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



(i) Bulk Transfer Laws. Buyer acknowledges that Sellers will not comply with
the provisions of any bulk transfer laws of any jurisdiction in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and hereby waives all
claims related to the non-compliance therewith.



(j) Cure Amounts. Parent shall (and Parent shall cause the Selling Affiliates
to) transfer and assign all Assumed Contracts to Buyer or an Affiliate of
Buyer designated by Buyer, and Buyer or such designated Affiliate of Buyer
shall assume all Assumed Contracts from Sellers, as of the Closing Date
pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and the Sale Order. As promptly
as practicable following the Agreement Date, Buyer and Parent shall (and
Parent shall cause the Selling Affiliates to) use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate and determine the amounts required to cure all defaults
under each Assumed Contract so as to permit the assumption and assignment of
each such Assumed Contract pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (as ultimately
approved or determined by the Bankruptcy Court, the "Cure Amounts"). In
connection with the assignment and assumption of the Assumed Contracts, (a)
Parent shall (and Parent shall cause the Selling Affiliates to), pursuant to
the Sale Motion, or with respect to any Post-Sale Hearing Contracts or
Undisclosed Contracts, by separate motion to the Bankruptcy Court, move to
assume and assign to Buyer the Assumed Contracts and will provide notices
thereof to the Assumed Contract counterparties and all other parties in 

accordance with all applicable Bankruptcy Rules and Local Bankruptcy Rules,
(b) Buyer shall be liable for any Cure Amounts required under the Assumed
Contracts to extent of the Buyer Payable Cure Cap, which liability Buyer shall
satisfy by paying to Parent an amount equal to the Buyer Payable Cure Cap
pursuant to Section 2(g)(ii)(F)(2); provided, however, Sellers shall be liable
for all Cure Amounts to the extent that such Cure Amounts exceed the Buyer
Payable Cure Cap, and Sellers shall be responsible for paying all Cure
Amounts, either out of the Initial Purchase Price or the Buyer Payable Cure
Cap, provided that Sellers shall have no liability for or obligation to pay
any Cure Amounts with respect to any Contract (other than Contracts related to
the Media Related Payables) with any supplier of goods and services to the
Business, and (c) Buyer or its designated Affiliate shall be responsible for
demonstrating and establishing adequate assurance of future performance before
the Bankruptcy Court with respect to any of the Assumed Contracts. For the
avoidance of doubt, neither Buyer nor any Affiliate of Buyer shall have any
liability for any Cure Amounts related to any Assumed Contract except as
provided in this Section 5(j) or Section 2(c).



(k) Transition Real Property.



(i)With regard to any Owned Real Property that is not included in the Acquired
Owned Property as of the Closing Date, upon written notice from Buyer to
Parent delivered not later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing
(the "Real Estate Option Notice"), Buyer shall be entitled to designate any or
all of such Owned Real Property that Buyer elects to use and occupy subsequent
to the Closing in order to transition from such Owned Real Property (such
designated Owned Real Property being referred to as the "Transition Real
Property"). With respect to such Transition Real Property, the Real Estate
Option Notice shall set forth the name and/or address of the applicable
Transition Real Property and the term for which Buyer elects to use and occupy
such Transition Real Property subsequent to the Closing, provided, however,
that in all events the term for which Buyer shall be entitled to use any
Transition Real Property shall not exceed nine (9) months following the
Closing (each such term, as applicable, the "Owned Property Term").



(ii)With respect to any Transition Real Property designated as such by Buyer
in the Real Estate Option Notice, Buyer\'s and Sellers\' respective rights and
obligations in respect of such Transition Real Property shall be as set forth
in the Transition Services Agreement, which shall, among other things, provide
that (A) Buyer shall be granted a license for the exclusive use and occupancy
of the applicable Transition Real Property in the same general manner and for
the same general purposes as previously used by Sellers prior to the Closing
in connection with the operation of the Business, subject to the rights of
Sellers to market the Transition Real Property during the Owned Property Term,
and dispose of the Transition Real Property at any time following the Owned
Property Term, provided that such marketing does not unreasonably interfere
with Buyer\'s use of the Transition Real Property during the Owned Property
Term; (B) Sellers shall, at Buyer\'s sole cost and expense, continue to
maintain the applicable Transition Real Property in good working order during
the applicable Owned Property Term, subject to reasonable wear and tear,
provided that Buyer shall be liable for all reasonable, out of pocket, third
party costs and expenses actually incurred by Sellers in respect of such
Transition Real Property arising from Buyer\'s use and occupancy of such
Transition Real Property during such Owned Property Term; and (C) Sellers
shall not, during the Owned Property Term applicable to any such Transition
Real Property, sell, transfer, lease, encumber or otherwise interfere with
Buyer\'s use and occupancy of such Transition Real Property, or Buyer\'s
conduct of its business at such Transition Real Property; provided, that
Sellers have the right to market the Transition Real Property during the Owned
Property Term, and dispose of the Transition Real Property at any time
following the Owned Property Term, provided that such marketing does not
unreasonably interfere with Buyer\'s use of the Transition Real Property
during the Owned Property Term.



(iii)With regard to any Leased Real Property that is not included in the
Acquired Leased Property as of the Closing Date, upon written notice from
Buyer to Parent delivered not later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Closing (the "Leased Property Option Notice"), Buyer shall be entitled to
designate any or all of such Leased Real Property (except for any Leased Real
Property with respect to which (A) a Seller has been compelled to make a
determination to assume or reject the corresponding lease pursuant to section
365(d)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code and (B) the corresponding lease has been
deemed rejected pursuant to section 365(d)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code, provided
that the applicable Seller shall not support, and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to contest, any motion to compel such Seller to make a
determination to assume or reject the corresponding lease) that Buyer elects
to use and occupy subsequent to the Closing in order to transition from such
Leased Real Property (such designated Leased Real Property being referred to
as the "Transition Leased Property"); provided that Buyer shall be liable for
(1) all costs, claims, expenses, fees, and other payments resulting from
Sellers\' compliance with this Section 5(k)(iii) and (2) all reasonable costs
and expenses actually incurred by Sellers in respect of such Transition Leased
Property arising from Buyer\'s use and occupancy of such Transition Leased
Property. With respect to such Transition Leased Property, the Leased Property
Option Notice shall set forth the name and/or address of the applicable
Transition Leased Property and the term for which Buyer elects to use and
occupy such Transition Leased Property subsequent to the Closing, 

provided, however, that in all events the term for which Buyer shall be
entitled to use any Transition Leased Property shall not extend beyond the
earlier of (X) the nine (9) month anniversary of the Closing and (Y) the date
on which (1) the corresponding lease is rejected by the relevant Seller as a
result of such Seller being compelled to make a determination to assume or
reject the corresponding lease pursuant to section 365(d)(2) of the Bankruptcy
Code or (2) the corresponding Lease has been deemed rejected pursuant to
section 365(d)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code, provided, in each case, that the
applicable Seller shall not support, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to contest, any motion to compel such Seller to make a determination
to assume or reject the corresponding lease (each such term, as applicable,
the "Leased Property Term").



(iv)With respect to any Transition Leased Property designated as such by Buyer
in the Leased Property Option Notice (except for any Leased Real Property with
respect to which (A) a Seller has been compelled to make a determination to
assume or reject the corresponding lease pursuant to section 365(d)(2) of the
Bankruptcy Code and (B) the corresponding lease has been deemed rejected
pursuant to section 365(d)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code, provided that the
applicable Seller shall not support, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to contest, any motion to compel such Seller to make a determination
to assume or reject the corresponding lease), Buyer\'s and Sellers\'
respective rights and obligations in respect of such Transition Leased
Property shall be as set forth in the Transition Services Agreement, which
shall, among other things, provide that (A) Buyer has the exclusive right to
use and occupy the applicable Transition Leased Property in the same general
manner and for the same general purposes as previously used by Sellers prior
to the Closing in connection with the operation of the Business, subject to
the rights of Sellers to market the Transition Leased Property during the
Leased Property Term, and dispose of the Transitioned Leased Property at any
time following the Leased Property Term, provided that such marketing does not
unreasonably interfere with Buyer\'s use of the Transition Leased Property
during the Leased Property Term; (B) Buyer shall perform, on behalf of
Sellers, all obligations of Sellers under the applicable lease in respect of
each Transition Leased Property, including payment of all amounts and costs
and expenses for the applicable Leased Property Term in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the applicable lease; (C) Sellers shall not, during
the Leased Property Term applicable to any Transition Leased Property, seek to
terminate, otherwise assign or sublet, or reject the applicable lease in the
Chapter 11 Cases, and, with respect to the assumption and assignment of any
leases in respect of the Transition Leased Property, Parent shall (and shall
cause the Selling Affiliates to), at Buyer\'s request, seek any extension of
time to assume or reject any lease of any designated Transition Leased
Property available to Sellers under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code in
order to accommodate Buyer\'s use and occupancy of such Transition Leased
Property as provided herein and/or under the Transition Services Agreement,
including using commercially reasonable efforts to seek the consent of any
applicable landlord, to the extent required; provided, that Sellers have the
right to market the Transition Leased Property during the Leased Property
Term, and dispose of the Transition Leased Property at any time following the
Leased Property Term, provided that such marketing does not unreasonably
interfere with Buyer\'s use of the Transition Leased Property during the
Leased Property Term; and (D) Sellers shall not support, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to contest, any motion to reject any such
Transition Leased Property by the applicable landlord; provided that Buyer
shall be liable for (1) all costs, claims, expenses, fees, and other payments
resulting from Sellers\' compliance with the preceding clauses (A) through (D)
and (2) all reasonable, out of pocket, third party costs and expenses actually
incurred by Sellers in respect of such Transition Leased Property arising from
Buyer\'s use and occupancy of such Transition Leased Property.



(v)Promptly after the Agreement Date, Parent and Buyer shall negotiate in good
faith and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to finalize within
45 days following the Agreement Date, a transition services agreement between
Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other (the "Transition Services
Agreement"), in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Parent,
pursuant to which (A) Sellers shall provide Buyer such transition services,
including with respect to IT, systems, software, applications and other
functions, as may be reasonably required to complete an orderly transition of
the Business to Buyer with respect to, among other things, Buyer\'s and its
Affiliates\' use of the Transition Real Property and/or the Transition Leased
Property, and Buyer\'s exclusive right to subcontract work from such property,
including the facilities identified on Schedule 5(k)(v), and (B) Buyer shall
provide Sellers such transition services, including with respect to IT,
systems, software, applications and other functions, as may be reasonably
required for Sellers\' to perform their obligations pursuant to the
administration of the Chapter 11 Cases, all subject to customary limitations
of liability and indemnification provisions. Buyer and Sellers shall commit in
the Transition Services Agreement to provide any required services in the
ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice, and all such
services shall be billed to the recipient at the service provider\'s fully-
burdened cost.



(l) Title Commitment. To the extent that any of the following is within any
Seller\'s possession or control, Parent shall promptly furnish Buyer with a
copy: (i) a title policy or title commitment in respect of each Acquired Owned
Property, together with copies of all recorded documents referenced therein
(the "Title Documents"), and (ii) a copy of any ALTA/ACSM 

survey of each parcel of real property and Improvements thereon constituting
the Acquired Owned Property (the "Survey"). Buyer may determine, in its sole
discretion and at its sole cost and expense, to obtain updates of any such
Title Documents or Surveys for any Acquired Owned Property, or obtain any
Title Documents or Surveys for any Acquired Owned Property that Parent does
not have within its possession or control. Within ten (10) days following the
receipt of such documentation, Buyer shall deliver to Parent notice
("Objection Notice") of any objections Buyer may have to matters appearing on
the Survey or Title Documents in respect of any applicable Acquired Owned
Property which adversely affect title to any of the Acquired Owned Property.
Within ten (10) days after receipt by Parent of Buyer\'s Objection Notice,
Parent shall give Buyer written notice ("Parent\'s Title Response") of any
title objection set forth in an applicable Objection Notice that Parent elects
to cure or otherwise remove from record prior to Closing. No Seller shall have
any obligation to cure any title defect identified in the Objection Notice,
but if Parent elects, at its option, to cure or remove any matters identified
by Buyer in an applicable Objection Notice, Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cure or remove the same on or before Closing, at
Parent\'s sole cost and expense. If Buyer is not satisfied with Parent\'s
Title Response, then Buyer shall have the right to exclude the applicable
Acquired Owned Property from the Acquired Assets and add it to the Excluded
Assets. If Buyer does not within five (5) Business Days of receipt of
Parent\'s Title Response elect the remedy set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence, then all matters to which Buyer objected in the applicable
Objection Notice but which Parent did not agree to cure in the Parent\'s Title
Response shall be deemed waived by Buyer and the same shall constitute
Permitted Liens. From and after the Agreement Date until the earlier of
Closing or the termination hereof, Parent shall not take any action, or fail
to take any action, that would cause title to the Acquired Owned Property to
be subject to any title exceptions, other than the Permitted Liens.



(m) Disclosure Schedule; Supplementation and Amendment of Disclosure Schedule.
Parent may, at its option, include in the Disclosure Schedule items that are
not material in order to avoid any misunderstanding, and such inclusion, or
any references to dollar amounts, shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgement
or representation that such items are material, to establish any standard of
materiality or to define further the meaning of such terms for purposes of
this Agreement. Information provided in one Disclosure Schedule will suffice,
without repetition or cross reference, as a disclosure of such information in
any other Disclosure Schedule to which its relevance is readily apparent on
its face. Parent may, from time to time prior to or at the Closing by written
notice to Buyer, supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedule, and Parent shall
be obligated to supplement or amend Schedule 3(k)(i) of the Disclosure
Schedule to the extent necessary to include Material Contracts entered into
following the Agreement Date or Material Contracts existing as of the
Agreement Date that were inadvertently excluded from such schedule and updated
Cure Amounts; provided, however, that such supplements or amendments shall not
be deemed to have cured any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement, including for purposes of the
termination rights contained in this Agreement or of determining whether or
not the condition set forth in Section 7(a)(iii) has been satisfied.



(n) Regulatory Filings.



(i)Each of the Parties hereto shall, up until the Drop Dead Date, use all
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law and regulations (including the HSR Act) to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including all
necessary or appropriate waivers, consents and approvals to effect all
necessary registrations, filings and submissions and to lift any injunction or
other legal bar to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by the Drop Dead Date (and, in such case, to proceed with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as expeditiously as possible). In
furtherance of and without limiting the foregoing, if necessary, Buyer and
Parent shall (and Parent shall cause the Selling Affiliates to), up until the
Drop Dead Date, use reasonable best efforts to (1) make or cause to be made
all filings required of each of them or any of their respective Affiliates
under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions
contemplated herein as promptly as practicable after the Agreement Date, and
in any event prior to five (5) Business Days after the Agreement Date, (2)
comply at the earliest practicable date with any request under the HSR Act or
other Antitrust Laws for additional information, documents, or other materials
received by each of them or any of their respective subsidiaries from the
Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice (the "Antitrust Division") or any other
Governmental Entity in respect of such filings (3) cooperate with each other
in connection with any such filing or request (including, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, providing copies of all such documents to the
non-filing parties prior to filing and considering all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith) and in connection with
resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any of the FTC, the Antitrust
Division or other Governmental Entity under any Antitrust Laws with respect to
any such filing, and (4) not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or
enter into any agreement with the FTC or the Antitrust Division not to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with the
prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and (5) defend and resolve
any investigation or other inquiry of any Governmental Entity under all
applicable Regulatory Laws, including by defending against and contesting
administratively and in court any litigation or adverse determination
initiated or made by a Governmental Entity under 

any applicable Regulatory Law. Each Party acknowledges that its reasonable
best efforts under this Section 5(n)(i) requires that it use reasonable best
efforts to comply with any request under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws
for additional information, documents, or other materials that it or its
Affiliates receive from the FTC or Antitrust Division as soon as reasonably
practicable after the issuance of such request. Each Party shall promptly
inform the other parties hereto of any oral communication with, and provide
copies of written communications with, any Governmental Entity regarding any
filings made pursuant to this Section 5(n)(i).



(ii)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
will Buyer be obligated to propose, or agree to accept, any undertaking or
condition, to enter into any consent decree, to make any sale, divestiture or
disposition, to accept any operational restriction (including any requirement
to hold separate (including by trust or otherwise) any business, product lines
or Assets), or to take any other action that, in the reasonable judgment of
Buyer, could be expected to limit the right of Buyer to (A) own or retain all
of any portion of the Acquired Assets or any of Buyer\'s or any of its
Affiliates\' product lines or Assets, or (B) operate, own or retain the
Business or any of Buyer\'s or any of its Affiliates\' businesses. Parent
shall not (and shall not permit any of the Selling Affiliates to), without
Buyer\'s prior written consent in Buyer\'s sole discretion, consummate,
discuss or commit to any divestiture transaction, or alter, or discuss or
commit to alter, the Business or their commercial practices in any way, or
otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits Buyer\'s freedom of
action with respect to, or Buyer\'s ability to retain the full benefits of,
this Agreement or any of the Acquired Assets or businesses, product lines or
Assets of Buyer. Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of the Selling
Affiliates to, enter into or publicly announce an agreement or intention to
form a joint venture or acquire any Assets, business or company if any such
agreements or intentions, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably
be expected to cause the conditions set forth in Section 7(a)(vii) to fail to
be satisfied or would reasonably be expected to have the effect of preventing,
materially impairing, materially delaying or otherwise materially and
adversely affecting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.



(o) Casualty. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, any of
the Acquired Assets shall be destroyed or damaged in whole or in part by fire,
earthquake, flood, other casualty, or any other cause ("Casualty"), then the
Parties shall have the option to: (i) if such Acquired Assets are not Accounts
Receivable, Inventory or maintenance parts, consummate the sale of such
Acquired Assets on an "as-is" basis and reduce the Initial Purchase Price and
Final Purchase Price by (without double counting or further adjustment based
on corresponding changes to the Closing Working Capital) an amount agreed to
by Parent and Buyer following good faith, commercially reasonable
negotiations, or (ii) if the Parties are not able to agree on an appropriate
adjustment to the Initial Purchase Price and Final Purchase Price pursuant to
clause (i), terminate this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
If there is a Casualty involving Acquired Assets that consist of Accounts
Receivable, Inventory or maintenance parts, then the Sellers shall keep all
condemnation, insurance and other proceeds of such Casualty with respect to
such Acquired Assets without any adjustment to the Initial Purchase Price or
the Final Purchase Price (as applicable) except as provided in Sections 2(d)
and 2(e).



(p) Lenders. On the Agreement Date, simultaneous with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, Parent shall deliver to Buyer a Lock-Up Agreement
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer, duly executed by
Parent\'s secured lenders to the extent required therein (the "Sale Support
Agreement").



(q) Employee Compensation.



(i)To the extent that Sellers elect, or are legally required, to continue to
honor any bonus, severance and other compensation obligations (including all
change of control or similar retention obligations or any other payment
obligations arising pursuant to any Employee Benefit Plan) that existed prior
to the Commencement Date in respect of any Transferred Employees, all such
obligations (except to the extent of the Accrued Employee Obligations) shall
remain the sole obligation of Sellers and shall be paid and discharged as and
when payable pursuant to the terms and conditions of such obligations, subject
in all cases to all of Sellers\' rights pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code and
any orders issued in connection with the administration of the Chapter 11
Cases.



(ii)In addition to the amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section
5(q)(i), Sellers and their Affiliates shall formulate an incentive program as
soon as reasonably practicable following the Agreement Date reasonably
acceptable to Buyer and compliant with Section 503(c) of the Bankruptcy Code,
in an aggregate amount equal to the amount set forth on Schedule 5(q)(ii), or
such lesser aggregate amount agreed to by Buyer, for the benefit of those
Covered Employees reasonably acceptable to Buyer who are critical to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the transfer
of the Acquired Assets to Buyer, which amounts shall be paid by Sellers and
their Affiliates as and when payable pursuant to the terms and conditions of
such obligations, subject to approval of the Bankruptcy Court. Buyer and its
Affiliates shall formulate a complimentary incentive program, in the aggregate 

amount equal to the amount set forth on Schedule 5(q)(ii), or such lesser
aggregate amount agreed to by Parent, and all amounts payable thereunder shall
be paid and discharged as and when payable pursuant to the terms and
conditions of such incentive program, subject to customary terms and
conditions of such bonuses as shall be established by Buyer.



Section 6. Other Covenants.



(a) Cooperation; Further Assurances. To the extent permitted by Law, the
Parties shall cooperate with each other, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause their respective Controlled Affiliates and Representatives to
cooperate with each other, to provide an orderly transition of the Business
from Sellers to Buyer. On and after the Closing, until the conclusion of all
bankruptcy proceedings relating to the Chapter 11 Cases, upon reasonable
advance written request by Parent, Buyer will afford promptly to Parent and
its counsel, financial advisers and other agents reasonable access during
normal business hours, and in a manner so as not to interfere with normal
business operations or violate any Law, to its properties, books and records,
employees, auditors and counsel to the extent necessary for financial
reporting and accounting matters, employee benefits matters, the preparation
and filing of any Tax Returns, reports or forms, the defense of any Tax audit,
claim or assessment, the reconciliation of Claims in the Chapter 11 Case, the
preparation and confirmation of a plan in the Chapter 11 Case, other matters
relating to the winding-up of the Sellers\' estate and/or the closing of the
Chapter 11 Case, or any other reasonable business purpose related to the
Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities; provided, however, that, for
avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not require any Party to waive, or
take any action with the effect of waiving, its attorney-client privilege or
any confidentiality obligation to which it is bound with respect thereto or
take any action in violation of applicable Law. Following the Closing, Parent
will hold, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants,
advisors and agents to hold, in confidence, unless compelled to disclose by
judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of Law, all
confidential documents and information concerning Buyer or the Business
provided to them pursuant to this Section 6(a). Without limiting the
provisions of this Section 6(a), to the extent that Buyer or Parent discovers
any additional Assets or properties which should have been transferred or
assigned to Buyer as Acquired Assets but were not so transferred or assigned
at Closing, Buyer and Parent shall (and Parent shall cause the Selling
Affiliates to) cooperate and execute and deliver any instruments of transfer
or assignment necessary to transfer and assign such Asset or property to Buyer
without any adjustment to the Final Purchase Price and shall cooperate and
execute and deliver all conveyances, assumptions, notices, releases, and other
instruments as may be necessary to make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the provisions of this
Section 6(a), to the extent that Buyer or Parent discovers any Assets or
properties which are an Excluded Asset that were inadvertently or otherwise
mistakenly transferred or assigned to Buyer, Buyer and Parent shall (and
Parent shall cause the Selling Affiliates to) cooperate and execute and
deliver any instruments of transfer or assignment necessary to transfer and
assign such Asset or property back to Sellers.



(b) Litigation Support. Following the Closing, in the event and for so long as
any Party actively is contesting or defending against any Litigation commenced
by any non-Party with respect to (i) any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement or any Related Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation, circumstance,
status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident,
action, failure to act or transaction on or prior to the Closing Date
involving the Business, the other Party will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with the contesting or defending Party and its counsel in
the contest or defense, make available its personnel and provide such
testimony and access to its books and records as shall be reasonably necessary
in connection with the contest or defense, all at the sole cost and expense of
the contesting or defending Party and all subject to the terms and conditions
of the Transition Services Agreement; provided, however, that, for avoidance
of doubt, the foregoing shall not require any Party to waive, or take any
action with the effect of waiving, its attorney-client privilege with respect
thereto. As a condition to the cooperation required pursuant to this Section
6(b), the Party to provide such cooperation or assistance (the "Assisting
Party") may require the Party receiving such cooperation or assistance to
enter into a non-disclosure agreement reasonably satisfactory in form and
substance to the Assisting Party.



(c) Availability of Records. Subject to the terms and conditions of Section
6(a) and the Transition Services Agreement, to the extent legally permissible,
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide to Sellers and their respective
Representatives (after reasonable notice and during normal business hours and
without charge to Sellers) reasonable access to all Records included in the
Acquired Assets for periods prior to the Closing and shall preserve such
Records until the later of (A) six (6) years after the Closing Date, (B) the
required retention period required by any United States Law, (C) the
conclusion of all bankruptcy proceedings relating to the Chapter 11 Cases or
(D) in the case of Records relating to Taxes, the expiration of the statute of
limitations applicable to such Taxes. Such access shall include access to any
information in electronic form to the extent reasonably available. Buyer
acknowledges that Sellers have the right to retain originals or copies of all
Records included in the Acquired Assets for periods prior to the Closing.
Prior to destroying any Records included in the Acquired Assets for periods
prior to the Closing, Buyer shall notify Parent thirty (30) days in advance of
any such proposed destruction of its intent to destroy such Records, and Buyer
will permit Sellers to retain such Records.



(d) Satisfaction of Assumed Liabilities. Following the Closing, Buyer agrees
to pay, perform and discharge the Assumed Liabilities as they become due and
shall indemnify and hold Sellers harmless with respect to the Assumed
Liabilities.



(e) Employee Matters.



(i)Transferred Employees. No later than ten (10) days prior to the Closing,
but effective as of immediately following the Closing Date, Buyer shall offer
employment to those Covered Employees selected by Buyer in its sole
discretion, which offers shall be (A) on terms and conditions that provide
total compensation and benefits opportunities that are in the aggregate
substantially comparable to the compensation and benefits opportunities
(including with respect to any severance policies and incentive and equity-
based compensation programs) provided to either (1) similarly situated
employees of Buyer who are employed immediately prior to the Closing Date, or
(2) such Covered Employees as of immediately prior to the Closing Date, or (B)
on commercially reasonable market-based terms and conditions. Parent will use
commercially reasonable efforts to inform Covered Employees designated by
Buyer about the possibility of employment with Buyer, assist Buyer with
interviewing Covered Employees designated by Buyer and provide Buyer with
information regarding Covered Employees to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law. Any Covered Employee employed by a Seller immediately before
the Closing and who accepts such offer of employment with Buyer (or any
Affiliate of Buyer) and becomes an employee of Buyer (or any Affiliate of
Buyer) immediately following the Closing Date is referred to herein as a
"Transferred Employee." Parent and their Affiliates shall terminate for all
purposes the employment of all Covered Employees who agree to become
Transferred Employees, effective immediately after the Closing Date.



(ii)Service. Buyer shall grant all Transferred Employees credit after the
Closing for continuous service with Sellers or any of their respective
Affiliates and their respective predecessors prior to the Closing (to the
extent such service was recognized by Sellers, their respective Affiliates and
their corresponding Employee Benefit Plans) for purposes of participation and
determining the amount of severance benefits in the case of any Buyer Plan
that is a severance plan or program (if any). Buyer will cause to be waived
any waiting period and preexisting condition limitations applicable to
Transferred Employees under any group health plan maintained by Buyer or any
of its Affiliates in which such Transferred Employees are otherwise permitted
to participate, other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in
effect with respect to such Transferred Employees and that have not been
satisfied as of the Closing Date under any welfare plan maintained for the
Transferred Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date. Buyer will take
all commercially reasonable action necessary to ensure that, to the extent
permitted under applicable Buyer Plans, such Transferred Employees are given
full credit for all expenses and deductibles incurred under any group health
plan sponsored by Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates for the plan
year that includes the Closing Date for the purposes of satisfying the maximum
out-of-pocket expense limitations and deductibles under any group health plan
sponsored by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in which Transferred Employees
participate after the Closing Date.



(iii)Employee List. Parent shall promptly provide to Buyer an updated Employee
List that reflects employee terminations, new hires, changes in status, etc.,
as reasonably requested by Buyer.



(iv)Assumed Benefit Plans. Effective as of immediately following the Closing
Date, Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall assume the Assumed Benefit Plans
(and all assets, trusts, insurance policies, and funding media held or
maintained by any Assumed Benefit Plans), and the Parties shall cooperate with
each other to take all actions and execute and deliver all documents and
furnish all notices necessary to effectuate such assumption. The Parties agree
that Buyer and its Affiliates shall, pursuant to such assumption, only assume
Liability for benefits provided pursuant to the written terms and conditions
of the Assumed Benefit Plans as of the Closing Date and all other Liabilities
as of the Closing Date relating to the Assumed Benefit Plans shall be Excluded
Liabilities. For sake of clarity, Buyer and its Affiliates may, in their sole
discretion, amend, suspend or terminate any Assumed Benefit Plan at any time,
subject to the terms of the Assumed Benefit Plans.



(f) Tax Matters.



(i)Transfer Taxes. All Transfer Taxes that are not eliminated through the
application of the Bankruptcy Code shall be borne one-half by Buyer and one-
half by Parent. Parent and Buyer shall cooperate to timely prepare, and Buyer
shall file, any Tax Returns relating to such Transfer Taxes, including any
claim for exemption or exclusion from the application or imposition of any
Transfer Taxes, except to the extent Sellers are required by applicable Law to
file a Tax Return. With respect to any such Tax Returns required to be filed
by Sellers, Buyer shall pay to Sellers, not later than five (5) Business Days
before the due date for payment of such Transfer Taxes, an amount equal to
one-half of the Transfer Taxes shown on such Tax Return, and Parent shall,
following the filing thereof, provide Buyer 

with a copy of such Tax Return and a copy of a receipt showing payment of any
such Transfer Taxes. With respect to any such Tax Return required to be filed
by Buyer, Buyer shall provide Parent with a copy of such Tax Return and a copy
of a receipt showing payment of any such Transfer Taxes. To the extent not
otherwise paid by Parent, the Parties shall take all necessary actions under
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (including the provision of the joint
written instructions required thereunder) to permit Buyer to receive from the
Transfer Tax Escrow, prior to its distribution pursuant to Section 2(e)(iv),
the portion of Transfer Taxes that Parent is liable for pursuant to this
Section 6(f)(i).



(ii)Tax Returns. Parent will (and will cause the Selling Affiliates to)
prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax
Returns in respect of the Acquired Assets (other than any such Tax Return
relating to Transfer Taxes, which shall be governed by Section 6(f)(i)) that
are required to be filed (taking into account any applicable extensions) after
the Closing Date for any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date,
except to the extent Buyer is required by applicable Law to file such Tax
Return. Buyer will timely file, or cause to be timely filed, any Tax Return
that is prepared by Sellers with respect to the Acquired Assets pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence to the extent permitted by applicable Law.
Buyer will prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed,
all other Tax Returns required to be filed after the Closing Date in respect
of the Acquired Assets. Any Tax Return in respect of the Acquired Assets
required to be filed by Buyer in respect of a Straddle Period will be prepared
on a basis consistent with the past practices of the Sellers, and Buyer will
deliver to Parent for its approval, at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
due date for the filing of such Tax Return (taking into account any applicable
extensions), a statement setting forth the amount of Tax for which Sellers are
responsible pursuant to Section 6(f)(iv) and a copy of such Tax Return,
together with any additional information that Parent may request. No Tax
Return in respect of the Acquired Assets required to be filed by Buyer in
respect of a Straddle Period shall be filed with any Taxing Authority without
Parent\'s written consent. Any Tax Return relating to the Acquired Assets for
a Straddle Period will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be filed on
the basis that the relevant Tax period ended as of the close of business on
the Closing Date.



(iii)Payment of Taxes. Parent will (and will cause the Selling Affiliates to)
pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes due with respect to Tax Returns which
Sellers are obligated to prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed,
pursuant to Section 6(f)(ii). At least three (3) days prior to the due date
for a Tax Return prepared by Sellers and filed by Buyer for any Tax period
ending on or before the Closing Date pursuant to Section 6(f)(ii), Parent will
(and will cause the Selling Affiliates to) pay Buyer an amount equal to the
Taxes shown on such Tax Return. At least three (3) days prior to the due date
for a Tax Return for a Straddle Period, Parent will (and will cause the
Selling Affiliates to) pay its portion of the Taxes due with respect to such
Tax Return to Buyer, as determined in Section 6(f)(iv).



(iv)Straddle Period. Except as set forth in Section 6(f)(i) relating to
Transfer Taxes, (1) all periodic Taxes that are not based on income or
receipts (e.g., Property Taxes) due and payable with respect to the Acquired
Assets for a Straddle Period shall be apportioned between Buyer and Sellers
based on the number of days of such Straddle Period included in the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and the number of days of such Straddle Period included in
the Post-Closing Tax Period, and (2) all Taxes of the Acquired Assets due and
payable with respect to the Acquired Assets for a Straddle Period, other than
Taxes described in clause (1) of this sentence, will be computed as if such
Tax period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date. The Parties
agree that Sellers shall be liable for the proportionate amount of such Taxes
that is attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, and Buyer shall be liable
for the proportionate amount of such Taxes that is attributable to the Post-
Closing Tax Period, in each case, as determined under this Section 6(f)(iv).
All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall
be made in a manner that does not accelerate deductions or defer income.



(v)Allocation of Initial Purchase Price. The Parties agree that the Initial
Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities (plus other relevant items) will be
allocated among the Acquired Assets in a manner consistent with Section 1060
of the Code, the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and any other
applicable Tax laws (the "Allocation Laws"). Buyer will complete a draft
schedule (the "Allocation Schedule") allocating the Initial Purchase Price and
Assumed Liabilities (plus other relevant items) to the Acquired Assets and
provide a copy to Parent within one hundred seventeen (117) days after the
Closing Date. Unless Parent notifies Buyer in writing within thirty (30) days
after the receipt of the draft Allocation Schedule of any objections Parent
may have to the allocations set forth therein, Parent shall be deemed to have
agreed to the Allocation Schedule as prepared by Buyer. If Parent disputes any
portion of the Allocation Schedule in accordance with the preceding sentence,
the parties shall attempt to resolve any disagreement in good faith. If Parent
and Buyer do not agree on an alternative allocation in the ten (10) days
following the date Buyer received Parent\'s written notice, the parties shall
submit the dispute with respect to the Allocation Schedule on the next
Business Day to the Independent Accountant whose determination shall be final
and 

binding on all parties. The Parties agree that the fees, costs and expenses
incurred in connection therewith shall be shared in equal amounts by Parent
and Buyer; provided, however, Parent shall bear the full amount of fees, costs
and expenses if there are no material changes to the Allocation Schedule. The
Parties agree that Sellers and Buyer each shall report all Taxes and file all
Tax Returns consistent with the Allocation Schedule as finally determined
under this Section 6(f)(v). Parent and Buyer shall exchange completed forms
with respect to such Allocation Schedule (including IRS Form 8594) at least
thirty (30) days prior to the due date (subject to any applicable extensions)
for filing such forms and shall cooperate in the filing of any forms
(including IRS Form 8594) with respect to such Allocation Schedule, including
any amendments to such forms required with respect to any adjustment to the
Initial Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement.



(g) Recording of Intellectual Property Assignments. Buyer shall file and
record all assignments of Acquired Intellectual Property with the appropriate
Governmental Entities as promptly as practicable following the Closing.



(h) Wage Reporting. Following the Closing, Buyer and Sellers agree to utilize
or cause their respective Affiliates to utilize, the alternate procedure set
forth in Revenue Procedure 2004-53, 2004-2 C.B. 320 with respect to wage
reporting.



(i) Accounts Receivable/Collections. After the Closing, Parent shall permit,
and hereby authorizes, Buyer to collect, in the name of the Sellers, all
accounts receivable constituting part of the Acquired Assets and to endorse
with the name of the Sellers for deposit in Buyer\'s account any checks or
drafts received in payment thereof. Parent shall, and shall cause all Seller
Affiliates to, promptly deliver to Buyer any cash, checks or other property
that it may receive after the Closing in respect of any accounts receivable or
other Asset constituting part of the Acquired Assets.

(i)by mutual written consent of each of Parent and Buyer;



(ii)by Buyer, if any of the conditions to the obligations of Buyer and

Back-Up Date, then Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 8(a)(xvi) prior to the day that is three (3) Business Days
following the Outside Back-Up Date.

Agreement, whether so obtained before or after the execution hereof, to the
Party furnishing the same.



(c) Expense Reimbursement and Break-Up Fee.



(i)Parent shall (and shall cause the Selling Affiliates to), within two (2)
Business Days after any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
8(a)(iv) or Section 8(a)(x) reimburse Buyer for all of the reasonable out of
pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred or to be incurred by Buyer or its
Affiliates, including reasonable fees, costs and expenses of any professionals
(including financial advisors, outside legal counsel, accountants, experts and
consultants) retained by Buyer or its Affiliates in connection with or related
to the authorization, preparation, investigation, negotiation, execution and
performance of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Chapter 11 Cases and other judicial and regulatory proceedings related to
such transactions (such fees, costs and expenses, the "Reimbursable Expenses")
by payment of the Expense Reimbursement to Buyer in cash; provided that Buyer
shall present reasonable supporting documentation with respect to all costs,
fees and expenses for which it desires reimbursement and provided, further, in
no event shall Sellers be required to pay the Expense Reimbursement in an
amount greater than Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000) in
the aggregate. For the avoidance of doubt, if Parent terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8(a)(v), Buyer shall not be entitled to the Expense
Reimbursement, notwithstanding the fact that Sellers may enter into an
Alternative Transaction following the date of such termination, so long as
Parent shall not have been in breach of Section 5(d)(i) at the time of such
termination.



(ii)Parent shall (and shall cause the Selling Affiliates to) (A) after any
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8(a)(x), (x) within two (2)
Business Days after such termination, pay to Buyer out of the deposit received
in connection with an Alternative Transaction, a cash amount equal to one-half
of the Break-Up Fee and (y) upon the consummation of the Alternative
Transaction authorized by the Bankruptcy Court in connection with the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8(a)(x), pay to Buyer an
amount in cash equal to one-half of the Break-Up Fee, (B) within two (2)
Business Days after any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
8(a)(iv), pay to Buyer a cash amount equal to one-half of the Break-Up Fee,
solely to the extent that the breach or breaches of Parent that formed the
basis for such termination are each Willful Breaches and (C) after any
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8(a)(iv), pay to Buyer a
cash amount equal to one-half of the Break-Up Fee, solely to the extent (x)
that the portion of the Break-Up Fee contemplated by clause (B) of this
Section 8(c)(ii) has been, or was required to be, paid and (y) within twelve
(12) months after the date of such termination, Sellers enter into or
consummate an Alternative Transaction.



(iii)Parent acknowledges and agrees that (A) the payment of the Break-Up Fee
(or a portion thereof, as the case may be) and the Expense Reimbursement are
integral parts of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) in the
absence of Sellers\' obligations to make these payments, Buyer would not have
entered into this 

Agreement, (C) time is of the essence with respect to the payment of the
Break-Up Fee (or a portion thereof, as the case may be) and the Expense
Reimbursement and (D) the Break-Up Fee (or a portion thereof, as the case may
be) and the Expense Reimbursement shall constitute a super-priority,
administrative expense of the Sellers\' estates under Section 503(b)(1)(A) and
507(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code.



(d) Effect of Termination.



(i)If any Party terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8(a), then all
rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder shall terminate upon such
termination and shall become null and void (except that Section 1
(Definitions), Section 2(d)(iii) (Consideration), Section 5(g) (Press Releases
and Public Announcements), Section 9 (Limitations), Section 10

termination in accordance with their terms), and no Party shall have any
liability to any other Party hereunder except as expressly set forth in this
Section 8, Section 2(d)(iii), Section 5(d)(ii) or Section 10(w), and the

damages or otherwise in the event of a proper termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8(a).



(ii)If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8(a), (A) the
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive such termination, and nothing in
Section 8(b) or in this Section 8(d) shall relieve Buyer or Parent of their
respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, and (B) Buyer
agrees that all prohibitions in the Confidentiality Agreement shall be
extended to a period of three (3) years from the date of such termination.



(iii)Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, termination of this
Agreement shall not affect or modify Parent\'s agreement and obligation to pay
the Expense Reimbursement and Break-Up Fee subject to and in accordance with
the terms and conditions hereof; provided, however, the Expense Reimbursement
and Break-Up Fee are subject to Bankruptcy Court approval, which approval
shall be requested in the Sale Motion.



Section 9. Limitations.



(a) No Reliance. In connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer
has not relied upon, and Buyer expressly waives and releases Sellers and its
Affiliates from any Liability for any claims (excluding claims based upon
fraud or willful misconduct) relating to or arising from, any representation,
warranty, statement, advice, document, projection, or other information of any
type provided by Parent or its Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives, except for those representations and warranties expressly set
forth in Section 3. In deciding to enter into this Agreement, and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer has relied solely upon
its own knowledge, investigation, judgment and analysis (and that of its
Representatives) and not on any disclosure or representation made by, or any
duty to disclose on the part of, Parent or its Affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives, other than the express representations and
warranties of Parent set forth in Section 3.



(b) Limited Duties. Any and all duties and obligations which any Party may
have to any other Party with respect to or in connection with the Acquired
Assets, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby are limited to
those specifically set forth in this Agreement. Neither the duties nor
obligations of any Party, nor the rights of any Party, shall be expanded
beyond the terms of this Agreement on the basis of any legal or equitable
principle or on any other basis whatsoever. Neither any equitable or legal
principle nor any implied obligation of good faith or fair dealing nor any
other matter requires any Party to incur, suffer or perform any act, condition
or obligation contrary to the terms of this Agreement, whether or not existing
and whether foreseeable or unforeseeable. Each of the Parties acknowledges
that it would be unfair, and that it does not intend, to increase any of the
obligations of the other Party on the basis of any implied obligation or
otherwise.



(c) LIMITATION OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN SECTION 3, NONE OF
PARENT, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, SELLING AFFILIATES OR ANY OTHER PERSON IS MAKING ANY
OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, WRITTEN OR ORAL, STATUTORY, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, CONCERNING SELLERS, THEIR RESPECTIVE SUBSIDIARIES, THE ACQUIRED
ASSETS OR ASSUMED LIABILITIES AND IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT BUYER, WITH SUCH
EXCEPTIONS, TAKES THE ACQUIRED ASSETS "AS IS" AND "WHERE IS". BUYER
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NONE OF
PARENT, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, SELLING AFFILIATES OR ANY OTHER PERSON HAS MADE, AND
EACH OF PARENT, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND SELLING AFFILIATES HEREBY EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIMS AND NEGATES, AND BUYER HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES (EXCEPT WITH RESPECT
TO FRAUD AND WILLFUL MISCONDUCT), ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS,
IMPLIED, AT COMMON LAW, BY STATUTE OR OTHERWISE RELATING TO, AND BUYER HEREBY
EXPRESSLY WAIVES AND RELINQUISHES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS, CLAIMS AND CAUSES OF
ACTION AGAINST 

PARENT, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, SELLING AFFILIATES OR ANY OTHER PERSON AND THEIR
RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES AND EACH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES IN
CONNECTION WITH THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR MATERIALITY OF ANY INFORMATION,
DATA OR OTHER MATERIALS (WRITTEN OR ORAL) HERETOFORE FURNISHED TO BUYER OR ITS
REPRESENTATIVES BY OR ON BEHALF OF PARENT, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, SELLING
AFFILIATES OR ANY OTHER PERSON AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES OR ANY OF THEIR
RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT
COVERED BY THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN SECTION 3
AND EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO FRAUD AND WILLFUL MISCONDUCT. WITH RESPECT TO ANY
PROJECTION OR FORECAST DELIVERED ON BEHALF OF PARENT, ITS SUBSIDIARIES,
SELLING AFFILIATES OR ANY OTHER PERSON TO BUYER OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES, BUYER
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) THERE ARE UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN ATTEMPTING TO MAKE
SUCH PROJECTIONS AND FORECASTS, (II) IT IS FAMILIAR WITH SUCH UNCERTAINTIES,
(III) IT IS TAKING FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAKING ITS OWN EVALUATION OF THE
ADEQUACY AND ACCURACY OF ALL SUCH PROJECTIONS AND FORECASTS FURNISHED TO IT,
AND (IV) IT SHALL HAVE NO CLAIM AGAINST PARENT, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, SELLING
AFFILIATES OR ANY OTHER PERSON AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES OR THEIR
RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES WITH RESPECT THERETO.



(d) No Successor Liability. The Parties intend that, except where expressly
prohibited under applicable Law, upon the Closing, Buyer shall not be deemed
to: (i) be the successor of any Seller, (ii) have, de facto, or otherwise,
merged with or into any Seller, (iii) be a mere continuation or substantial
continuation of any Seller or the enterprise(s) of any Seller, or (iv) be
liable for any acts or omissions of any Seller in the conduct of the Business
or arising under or related to the Acquired Assets other than as set forth in
this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and except
as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Parties intend that Buyer shall
not be liable for any bankruptcy claims, other claims, written notices, causes
of action or Litigation against any Seller or any of any Seller\'s
predecessors or affiliates, and Buyer shall have no successor or vicarious
liability of any kind or character whether known or unknown as of the Closing
Date, whether now existing or hereafter arising, or whether fixed or
contingent, with respect to the Business, the Acquired Assets, the Excluded
Assets or the Excluded Liabilities or any other obligations of Sellers,
including, without limitation, Liabilities on account of any Taxes arising,
accruing or payable under, out of, in connection with, or in any way relating
to the operation of the Business or the Acquired Assets. The Parties agree
that the provisions substantially in the form of this Section 9(d) shall be
reflected in the Sale Order.



Section 10. Miscellaneous.



(a) Confidentiality. Buyer acknowledges that Information (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement) has been, and in the future will be, provided to it
in connection with this Agreement, including under Section 5(f)(i), and is
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of which are incorporated
herein by reference. Parent and Buyer agree that contemporaneously with the
filing of the Sale Motion, Parent shall file a separate motion with the
Bankruptcy Court seeking to file certain agreed upon schedules, annexes and
exhibits to this Agreement under seal to ensure the continued confidentiality
of such schedules, annexes and exhibits and the information set forth therein,
subject to Parent\'s ability to make such confidential information available
to prospective bidders. Specifically, this Agreement may be made available by
Parent to prospective bidders following entry of the Bidding Procedures Order
and such disclosure shall not be deemed to violate any confidentiality
obligations owing to Buyer, whether pursuant to this Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement or otherwise, provided that each such prospective
bidder enters into a confidentiality agreement in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Buyer with respect to the information contained in
this Agreement.



(b) Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement (including
Section 8(c)), Parent and the Selling Affiliates, on the one hand and Buyer,
on the other hand, shall bear their own expenses, including attorney\'s fees,
incurred in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and each other agreement, document and instrument contemplated by this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any action or
proceeding to interpret or enforce this Agreement, the prevailing Party in
such action or proceeding (i.e., the Party who, in light of the issues
contested or determined in the action or proceeding, was more successful)
shall be entitled to have and recover from the non-prevailing Party such costs
and expenses (including all court costs and reasonable attorneys\' fees) as
the prevailing Party may incur in the pursuit or defense thereof. Buyer and
Parent shall each be responsible for one-half of any HSR Act filing fees.



(c) Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Related Agreements and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the Parties
and supersede any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or
between the Parties, written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to
the subject matter hereof.



(d) Incorporation of Schedules and Exhibits. The Disclosure Schedules, Annexes
and Exhibits to this Agreement 

are incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof.



(e) Amendments and Waivers. No amendment of any provision of this Agreement
shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by each Party
except as expressly provided herein. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement
shall be construed as an implied amendment or agreement to amend or modify any
provision of this Agreement. No waiver by any Party of any default,
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether
intentional or not, shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and
signed by the Party making such waiver, nor shall such waiver be deemed to
extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach of
warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by
virtue of any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach of
warranty or covenant. No conditions, course of dealing or performance,
understanding or agreement purporting to modify, vary, explain or supplement
the terms or conditions of this Agreement shall be binding unless this
Agreement is amended or modified in writing pursuant to the first sentence of
this Section 10(e). Except where a specific period for action or inaction is
provided herein, no delay on the part of any Party in exercising any right,
power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof.



(f) Succession and Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective successors
(including any trustee, receiver, manager, interim receiver or monitor or
similar officer appointed in respect of Sellers in the Chapter 11 Cases or in
any chapter 7 case into which the Chapter 11 Cases may be converted) and
permitted assigns. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval
of the other Parties.

(h) Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall in all aspects be
governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of New
York, without regard to any conflict of laws provision that would require the
application of the Law of any other jurisdiction other than the principles set
forth in Section 5-1401 of the General Obligations law of the State of New
York. For so long as Sellers are subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy
Court, the Parties irrevocably elect as the sole judicial forum for the
adjudication of any matters arising under or in connection with this
Agreement, the Related Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of, the Bankruptcy Court.
After Sellers are no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy
Court or if the Bankruptcy Court is unwilling or unable to hear any matter
arising under or in connection with this Agreement, the Related Agreements or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, such matter shall be brought
in the courts in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware in and for
New Castle County (the "Chancery Court"), and in the event that the Chancery
Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction as to a matter arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, in any state or federal court of the State of
Delaware located in New Castle County. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that
any action instituted by it arising out of or relating to this Agreement will
be instituted exclusively in one of the above specified courts. Each Party
waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any dispute or
action so brought, consents to service of process by mail and waives any
objection to venue in any such court. Each Party agrees that a final judgment
in any dispute or action so brought will be conclusive and may be enforced by
dispute or action on the judgment or in any other manner provided at law
(common, statutory or other) or in equity.



(i) Consent to Service of Process. Each of the Parties hereby consents to
process being served by any Party in any suit, action or proceeding by
delivery of a copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of Section 10(g).



(j) WAIVERS OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY
OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED IN THIS AGREEMENT.



(k) Specific Performance.



(i)Parent acknowledges and agrees that damages at law may be an inadequate
remedy for the breach of any of Parent\'s covenants, promises and agreements
contained in this Agreement, and, accordingly, Buyer shall be entitled to
injunctive relief with respect to any such breach, including without
limitation specific performance of such covenants, promises or agreements or
an order enjoining Sellers from any threatened, or from the continuation of
any actual, breach of the covenants, promises or agreements contained in this
Agreement. The rights set forth in this Section 10(k)(i) shall be in addition
to any other rights which Buyer may have at law or in equity pursuant to this
Agreement.



(ii)Solely with respect to the Specific Buyer Agreements, Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that damages at law may be an inadequate remedy for the breach of
any of the Specific Buyer Agreements contained in this Agreement, and,
accordingly, Parent shall be entitled to injunctive relief solely with respect
to any such breach of the Specific Buyer Agreements, including without
limitation specific performance of only such Specific Buyer Agreements or an
order enjoining Buyer from any threatened, or from the continuation of any
actual, breach of only the Specific Buyer Agreements. The rights set forth in
this Section 10(k)(ii) with respect to any Specific Buyer Agreements shall be
in addition to any other rights which Parent may have at law or in equity with
respect to such Specific Buyer Agreements pursuant to this Agreement.



(l) Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this
Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provisions of this Agreement. In the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction
to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or
eliminated only to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall
otherwise remain in full force and effect.



(m) Survival. The representations and warranties and the covenants required to
be performed prior to the Closing Date contained in this Agreement shall
terminate as of the Closing Date, and none of the parties shall have any
Liability to each other after the Closing for any breach thereof. The
covenants contained in this Agreement to be performed at or after the Closing
shall survive the Closing until fully performed in accordance with their
respective terms, and each party hereto shall be liable to the other after the
Closing for any breach thereof. 



(n) No Third Party Beneficiaries. Other than with respect to the Selling
Affiliates under Section 6(d) and Section 6(f), this Agreement shall not
confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. For avoidance of doubt, and
without limitation, the Parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions
contained in Sections 5(q) and 6(e) of this Agreement with respect to
employees are included for the sole benefit of the respective Parties and
shall not create any right (i) in any other Person, including any employees,
former employees, any participant in any Employee Benefit Plan or any
beneficiary thereof or (ii) to continued employment with Sellers or Buyer.

Entity (or any provision thereof) shall include all laws and such law,
statute, rule or regulation promulgated thereunder (or provision thereof),
including any successor thereto, as it may be amended from time to time. Any
reference herein to "dollars" or "$" shall mean United States dollars.



(p) Computation of Time. In computing any period of time prescribed by or
allowed with respect to any provision of this Agreement that relates to
Sellers or the Chapter 11 Cases, the provisions of rule 9006(a) of the Federal
Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure shall apply.



(q) Mutual Drafting. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement.



(r) Headings; Table of Contents. The Section headings and the table of
contents contained in this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

deemed an original.



(t) No Right of Set-Off. Except as it relates to the disposition of the
Deposit, the Working Capital Escrow Deposit and the Transfer Tax Escrow as
expressly set forth in this Agreement, Buyer for itself and for its
Affiliates, successors and assigns hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
waives any rights of set-off, netting, offset, recoupment, or similar rights
that Buyer or any of its Affiliates, successors and assigns has or may have
with respect to the payment of the Initial Purchase Price, the Final Purchase
Price or any other payments to be made by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement,
the Related Agreements or any other document or instrument delivered by Buyer
in connection herewith. The Working Capital Escrow Deposit shall be used
solely in connection with any required payment by Parent of a Purchase Price
Adjustment pursuant to Section 2(e)(iv), as provided in clause (B) of Section
2(e)(iv); in no event shall the Working Capital Escrow Deposit be used for any
other purpose or be subject to any offset or other claims in connection with
this Agreement or otherwise. The Transfer Tax Escrow shall be used solely in
connection with any required payment by Parent of a Purchase Price Adjustment
pursuant to Section 6(f)(i); in no event shall the Transfer Tax Escrow be used
for any other purpose or be subject to any offset or other claims in
connection with this Agreement or otherwise.



(u) Non-Disparagement. Buyer agrees to refrain from making any statements
about Sellers or any of their respective current and former employees,
officers or directors that would disparage or reflect unfavorably upon the
image or reputation of Sellers or any such employee, officer or director.
Parent agrees to (and shall cause the Selling Affiliates to) refrain from
making any statements about Buyer or any of its current and former employees,
officers or directors that would disparage or reflect unfavorably upon the
image or reputation of Buyer or any such employee, officer or director.



(v) Time of Essence. With regard to all dates and time periods set forth or
referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.



(w) Remedies.



(i)LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. IF THERE SHALL BE A BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION,
WARRANTY, OBLIGATION, COMMITMENT OR AGREEMENT MADE BY BUYER OR GUARANTOR, OR
ANY COVENANT REQUIRED TO BE PERFORMED BY BUYER OR GUARANTOR OR ANY OTHER
DEFAULT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT BY BUYER OR GUARANTOR PRIOR TO THE CLOSING,
PARENT\'S SOLE REMEDY SHALL BE TO TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT PURSUANT TO AND TO
THE EXTENT PROVIDED IN SECTION 8(a)(v) AND TO RECEIVE THE DEPOSIT AS DESCRIBED
IN SECTION 2(d)(iii)(b) AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. PARENT, GUARANTOR AND BUYER
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PARENT\'S DAMAGES WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE, AND THAT
THE DEPOSIT IS A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF PARENT\'S DAMAGES. PARENT, GUARANTOR
AND BUYER SPECIFICALLY FURTHER AGREE AFTER NEGOTIATION THAT THIS SECTION
10(w)(i) IS INTENDED TO AND DOES LIQUIDATE THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES DUE PARENT,
AND SHALL BE PARENT\'S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AGAINST BUYER AND GUARANTOR, BOTH AT
LAW AND IN EQUITY ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO A BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION,
WARRANTY, OBLIGATION, COMMITMENT OR AGREEMENT MADE BY BUYER OR GUARANTOR, OR
ANY COVENANT REQUIRED TO BE PERFORMED BY BUYER OR GUARANTOR PRIOR TO THE
CLOSING, THAT GIVES RISE TO A TERMINATION EVENT PURSUANT TO SECTION 8(a)(v)
AND PARENT HEREBY WAIVES ANY AND ALL OTHER DAMAGES (INCLUDING PUNITIVE,
CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES). THIS PROVISION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR
EACH OF THE PARTIES TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT,
IN THE EVENT OF A BREACH BY BUYER OR GUARANTOR OF ANY PROVISION OF THIS
AGREEMENT PARENT\'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT
PURSUANT TO AND TO THE EXTENT PROVIDED IN SECTION 8(a)(v) AND TO RECEIVE
LIQUIDATED DAMAGES AS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 10(w)(i). NOTWITHSTANDING THE
FOREGOING PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 10(w)(i), PARENT SHALL IN ALL INSTANCES
RETAIN ITS SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE RIGHTS AS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN SECTION
10(k)(ii).



(ii)The Parties acknowledge and agree that, in addition to the remedies
available to Buyer as set forth in Section 5(d)(ii), Section 8(c) and Section
10(k) and any other remedies available to Buyer under Law, upon a breach of
any representation or warranty made by Parent, or any covenant required to be
performed by Parent prior to the Closing, Buyer shall have the option to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to and to the extent permitted by Section
8(a)(iv) and to receive the return of the Deposit to the extent provided in
Section 2(d)(iii)(C).



(iii)If Buyer seeks to enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10(k)(i) and prevails in such action, then Buyer shall be
entitled to recover from Parent, in addition to the remedies provided in
Section 10(w)(ii), all costs incurred in connection with such action,
including reasonable legal fees, expenses and costs incurred at the trial
court, all appellate courts and during negotiations.



(iv)If Parent seeks to enforce any of the Specific Buyer Agreements pursuant
to Section 10(k)(ii) and prevails in such action, then Parent shall be
entitled to recover from Buyer all costs incurred in connection with such
action, including reasonable legal fees, expenses and costs incurred at the
trial court, all appellate courts and during negotiations.



(x) Guaranty.



(i) Subject to the conditions and limitations as set forth below, Guarantor
hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as principal
and not as surety, to Sellers the due and punctual payment and performance of
all obligations of Buyer under this Agreement, subject in all cases to all
rights of Buyer hereunder with respect to such obligations, including the
remedies available to Parent in the event of a breach of any such obligations
(the guaranty obligations under this Section 10(x), collectively, the
"Guarantied Obligations"). Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 10(x)
to the contrary, Guarantor shall have and may assert against Parent and the
Guarantied Obligations, and the Guarantied Obligations shall be subject to,
any claim, right, deduction, limitation or defense of any kind that Buyer may
have or may assert pursuant to the provisions of the Agreement, including
without limitation Section 10(w)(i).



(ii) Guarantor guarantees that the Guarantied Obligations will be duly and
punctually paid and fully and completely performed (in the case of
performance, as if Guarantor were the primary obligor) in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. If for any reason Buyer shall fail or be unable duly
and punctually to pay or fully and completely to perform any Guarantied
Obligation as and when the same shall become due or otherwise required, then 

Guarantor shall, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
forthwith duly and punctually pay or fully and completely perform such
Guarantied Obligation (in the case of performance, as if Guarantor was the
primary obligor), subject in all cases to Buyer\'s rights under this Agreement
with respect to such Guaranteed Obligations. Guarantor further agrees that
this Agreement, to the extent it requires the payment of money, constitutes a
guaranty of payment when due and not of collection and is in no way
conditioned or contingent upon any attempt to collect from Buyer, but is
subject to all terms and conditions of this Agreement.



(iii) Subject in all cases to Section 2(d)(iii)(B) and the fact that the
Deposit shall represent liquidated damages for Parent in certain instances,
Guarantor hereby unconditionally waives (A) any and all notices, including
promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance of this Agreement and any other
notice with respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations and this Agreement,
(B) any presentment, demand, performance, protest, notice of nonpayment as the
same pertains to Buyer, suit or the taking of other action by Parent against,
and any other notice to, Buyer, Guarantor or others with respect to any of the
Guarantied Obligations, (C) any right to require Parent to proceed against
Buyer, (D) any defense based upon an election of remedies by Parent, unless
the same would excuse performance by Buyer under this Agreement with respect
to any of the Guarantied Obligations and (E) any duty of Parent to advise
Guarantor of any information known to Parent regarding Buyer or its ability to
perform under this Agreement with respect to any of the Guarantied
Obligations. Parent may at any time, and from time to time, without notice to,
or consent of, Guarantor and without impairing or releasing the obligations of
Guarantor hereunder, with respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations, (1)
agree with Buyer or Guarantor to make any change in the terms of the
Guarantied Obligations, or (2) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights
against Buyer or Guarantor.



(iv) The provisions of this Section 10(x) shall continue to be effective or be
reinstated, as the case may be, if (A) at any time and to the extent that any
payment of any of the Guarantied Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be
returned by the payee thereof upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization
or similar event of Buyer or Guarantor, all as though such payment had not
been made, or (B) the obligations of Guarantor under this Section 10(x), with
respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations, are released in consideration of
a payment of money or transfer of property by Buyer or any other Person and to
the extent that such payment, transfer or grant is rescinded or must otherwise
be returned by the recipient thereof upon the insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or similar event of Buyer, Guarantor or such other Person, all
as though such payment, transfer or grant had not been made. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing in this Section 10(x) shall
be deemed to constitute a waiver of, or prevent Guarantor from asserting, any
valid defense that may be assertable by Buyer.
