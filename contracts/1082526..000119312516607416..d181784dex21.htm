ARTICLE III 

Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; Exchange of Certificates

 

3.1 _Merger Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, the holder of any capital stock of the Company or the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Company (a " _Share_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time other than (i) issued and outstanding Shares owned
directly by Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) Shares that are Dissenting Shares (as
hereinafter defined) and (iii) each Share that is held by any direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company (collectively, " _Excluded
Shares_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive $17.75 per Share in
cash (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "), without interest. At the
Effective Time, all of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall cease to
be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each
certificate and uncertificated interest formerly representing any of the
Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration for each such Share, without
interest, in accordance with this _Section 3.1_ and _Section 3.2_.

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor
and shall cease to exist, subject to the right of the record holder (the "
_Record Holder_ ") of any Dissenting Shares to receive the payment for such
Dissenting Shares pursuant to _Section 3.2(f)_.

 

(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation, and such shares shall constitute the sole
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



11 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a paying
agent (the " _Paying Agent_ "), which shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Company, for the payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration. Concurrently
with the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited,
with the Paying Agent for the benefit of the Record Holders of Shares (other
than Excluded Shares) a cash amount in immediately available funds necessary
for the Paying Agent to make payments under _Section 3.1(a)_ (such cash
amount being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). At the
request of Parent, concurrently with the Effective Time, the Company shall
deposit with the Paying Agent all or any portion of its available cash and
cash equivalents in order to satisfy Parents obligations pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence. The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange
Fund as directed by Parent solely in (i) direct obligations of the United
States of America, (ii) obligations for which the full faith and credit of the
United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal
and interest, (iii) commercial paper rated the highest quality by either
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, or (iv) a
combination of any of the foregoing. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts
in excess of the aggregate amounts payable under _Section 3.1(a)_ shall be
returned to Parent in accordance with  _Section 3.2(d)_. To the extent that
there are any losses with respect to any such investments, or the Exchange
Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Paying Agent
to make prompt cash payment under _Section 3.1(a)_ , Parent shall promptly
replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying
Agent to make payments required under _Section 3.1(a)_. 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each Record Holder of Shares (other than with
respect to Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal specifying that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
delivery of the certificates or transfer of the uncertificated Shares
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 3.2(e)_ ) to
the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in customary form and to
have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the certificates (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 3.2(e)_ ) or
transfer of the uncertificated Shares in exchange for the amount to which such
Record Holder is entitled as a result of the Merger pursuant to _Section
3.1(a)_. Upon delivery of such letter of transmittal by any Record Holder of
Shares (other than Excluded Shares), duly completed and duly executed in
accordance with its instructions, and the surrender to the Paying Agent of a
certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 3.2(e)_ ) or
transfer of uncertificated Shares, the holder thereof shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor a cash amount by check (less any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 3.2(g)_ equal to the product of (x) the
number of Shares represented by such certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 3.2(e)_ ) or uncertificated Shares
and (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the certificates or
uncertificated Shares. 

 



12 (c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time any certificated or uncertificated Share is presented to the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled
and, subject to compliance with the procedures set forth in _Section 3.2(b)_ ,
exchanged for the cash amount to which the Record Holder thereof is entitled
pursuant to this _Article III_  (less any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 3.2(g)_ ) to be paid by check or wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by such holder.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Subject to _Section 3.5_ , any portion of
the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that
remains unclaimed by the Record Holders of the Shares for one (1) year after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent. Any Record Holder of Shares
(other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this
_Article III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the amount
to which such Record Holder is entitled as a result of the Merger pursuant to
_Section 3.1(a)_ (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in  _Section
3.2(g)_ ), without any interest thereon.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be reasonably required by Parent
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to such certificate, the Paying
Agent will issue a check in the amount (less any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 3.2(g)_ ) equal to the product of (i) the number of
Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate and (ii) the
Per Share Merger Consideration.

 

(f) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, if required by DGCL (but only to the extent required thereby),
Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and that are held by holders of such shares who have not voted in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who have
properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with,
and who have complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_
") will not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled
to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance
with the provisions of such Section 262 unless and until any such holder fails
to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and
payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to
perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares
will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and have become
exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and Parent shall remain
liable for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration for such shares. At
the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the
DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence. The Company will give Parent
(x) notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisals, (y) the
opportunity to participate in all (but not control any) negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such notices and demands and (z) a reasonable 

 



13  opportunity to review, and shall consider in good faith all reasonable
comments, on any written document to be given to any third party or
Governmental Authority in connection therewith. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or settle, compromise, offer to settle or compromise, or
otherwise negotiate any such demands.

 

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ "), or any other
applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case
may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable
Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Record Holder of Shares in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

3.3 _Treatment of Outstanding Options and Restricted Stock Units_.

(a) _Options_. At the Effective Time and except as agreed between Parent and
any holder thereof, each outstanding and unexercised Company Option that is
vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or that vests solely as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (and
without any additional action by the Company, the Board of Directors of the
Company or a committee thereof other than action by the Board of Directors or
any committee thereof necessary to effectuate this _Section 3.3_ ; it being
acknowledged and agreed that such action shall in no event include
the acceleration of vesting of any Company Option) (each such Company Option,
a " _Vested Company Option_ ") shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the
holder thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total
number of Shares subject to such Vested Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per Share under such Vested Company
Option, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such
payment. At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is not a Vested
Company Option shall be cancelled and forfeited for no consideration.

(b) _Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, and except as agreed
between Parent and any holder thereof, each Company RSU that is vested as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time or that vests solely as a result of
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (and without any
additional action by the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company or a
committee thereof other than action by the Board of Directors of the Company
or any committee thereof necessary to effectuate this _Section 3.3_ ; it being
acknowledged and agreed that such action shall in no event include
the acceleration of vesting of any Company RSU) (each such Company RSU, a "
_Vested Company RSU_ ") shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder
thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, an amount in cash equal to

 



14  the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to such Vested Company
RSU and (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration, less applicable Taxes
required to be withheld with respect to such payment. At the Effective Time,
each Company RSU that is not a Vested Company RSU shall be cancelled and
forfeited for no consideration.

 

(c) _Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, and
except as agreed between Parent and any holder thereof, each outstanding
performance-based restricted stock unit issued by the Company under the Stock
Plans or otherwise (a " _Company PSU_ ") shall be cancelled and shall only
entitle the holder thereof to receive an amount in cash equal to the product
of (i) the total number of "Earned Units" as determined in accordance with the
change of control provisions of the applicable Performance-Based Restricted
Stock Unit Agreement (the " _PSU Agreement_ ") based upon actual performance
through the "Adjusted Performance Period"(as such specified terms are defined
in the applicable PSU Agreements) and (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration,
less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment
(such amounts the " _PSU Consideration_ "), which PSU Consideration shall vest
and be payable in accordance with the terms of the PSU Agreement underlying
the applicable Company PSU (and shall be subject to any service-based vesting
requirements set forth in such PSU Agreements). At the Effective Time, each
portion of a Company PSU that is not an Earned Unit shall be cancelled and
forfeited for no consideration.

 

(d) _Payment of Equity Incentive Amounts_. Parent will take all actions
necessary so that, at or as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid to each holder of Vested
Company Options and Vested Company RSUs the cash payment to which such holder
is entitled as determined in accordance with this _Section 3.3_  through the
Surviving Corporations or applicable Subsidiarys payroll, unless alternative
arrangements are specified by such holder, to the extent permitted thereby. In
the event that the Surviving Corporation has insufficient cash to make such
payment to each holder of Vested Company Options and Vested Company RSUs,
Parent shall pay such amounts or provide to the Surviving Corporation
sufficient cash to pay such amounts. Settlement and payment of amounts due for
Company PSUs, if any, shall be treated as set forth in the applicable PSU
Agreement and _Section 3.3(c)_ of this Agreement.

(e) _Company ESPP_. As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any
committee of the Board of Directors of the Company administering the SciQuest,
Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ")) shall adopt such
resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to provide that with
respect to the ESPP (i) participation following the date of this Agreement
shall be limited to those employees who participate on the date of this
Agreement, (ii) except to the extent necessary to maintain the status of the
ESPP as an "employee stock purchase plan" within the meaning of Section 423 of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, participants may not
increase their payroll deductions or purchase elections from those in effect
on the date of this Agreement, (iii) that the ESPP be suspended at the close
of the current offering period and no offering period shall be
commenced after the date of this Agreement unless the Merger is not
consummated, (iv) each participants outstanding right to purchase Shares
under the ESPP shall terminate on the day immediately prior to the day on
which the Effective Time occurs (if not earlier terminated pursuant to the
terms of the ESPP);

 



15   _provided_ that all amounts allocated to each participants account under
the ESPP as of such date shall thereupon be used to purchase from the Company
whole Shares at the applicable price determined under the terms of the ESPP
for the then outstanding offering periods using such date as the final
purchase date for each such offering period, and (v) the ESPP shall terminate
immediately prior to the day on which the Effective Time occurs (if not
earlier terminated by the Board of Directors).

(f) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Board of Directors of the Company and the Compensation Committee of the Board
of Directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt resolutions and shall
take such other appropriate actions to implement the provisions of  _Section
3.3_ and to terminate the Stock Plans at the Effective Time.

3.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer
tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

 

3.5 _No Liability_. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, none of
the parties to this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
will be liable to any stockholders of the Company or other Person in respect
of any cash properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 

ARTICLE IV

Except as set forth in (x) corresponding sections or subsections of the
disclosure letter delivered to Parent by the Company prior to
or simultaneously with entering into this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any
section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed
disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection to which the

examine or understand any underlying document or information)), and (y) any
Company Report filed with or furnished to the SEC pursuant to the Exchange
Act and publicly available at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date
hereof (excluding any disclosures set forth in any "risk factor" section or
market risk section, and in any section in such Company Reports to the extent
cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), the Company hereby
represents and warrants to the Buyer Parties that:

jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) as a foreign
corporation or other legal entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership,
leasing or operation of its assets or properties or the conduct of its
business requires such qualification, except where any such failure to be so
qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has made available to Parent prior to the date hereof
complete and correct copies of the certificates of incorporation and bylaws or

its Subsidiaries, each as amended to the date of this Agreement, and each as
so made available is in full force and effect on the date of this Agreement.

aggregate $130,797,685.34 of freely available cash and cash equivalents.

businesses only in accordance with the ordinary course of such businesses,
consistent with past practices, (b) no event or events have occurred that,

investigations or other proceedings (" _Proceedings_ ") pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that, if adversely determined, would individually or in the
aggregate reasonably be expected to result in liability in excess of $100,000,
or that otherwise sought or seek injunctive relief or other equitable remedy,
or that involve or involved the Companys or its Subsidiaries officers or
directors.

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 4.7(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,

4.8 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) All Benefit Plans are listed on _Section 4.8(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter. True and complete copies (or summaries for any Benefit Plan for which
a separate plan document does not exist) of all Benefit Plans listed on
_Section 4.8(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter have been made available to
Parent, and the Company has made available to Parent where applicable (i) the
most recently prepared actuarial report or financial statement, (ii) the most
recent summary plan description, and all material modifications thereto, (iii)

or approved nor have the Company or any of its Subsidiaries undertaken to
make any such amendments or to adopt or approve any new Benefit Plan.

(b) All U.S. Benefit Plans have been maintained in material compliance with
their terms and with ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Laws. Each U.S.
Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
and each trust intended to qualify under Section 501(a) of the Code, has
received a current favorable determination or opinion letter from the Internal
Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ "), such letter has not been revoked (nor has
revocation been threatened), and to the Knowledge of the Company, no
circumstances exist as of the date hereof that would reasonably result in the
loss of the qualification of such U.S. Benefit Plan under Section 401(a) of
the Code or such trust under Section 501(a) of the Code. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any
U.S. Benefit Plan that could subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
a Tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i)
of ERISA.

 



22 (c) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any other entity that,
together with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, is treated as a single
employer under Section 414 of the Code or Section 4001 of ERISA (each, a "
_Company ERISA Affiliate_ ") maintains or contributes or has within the past
six years maintained or contributed to an employee benefit plan that is
subject to subtitles C or D of Title IV of ERISA or Sections 412 or 430 of the
Code. There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that could
reasonably be expected to result in, any "Controlled Group Liability" (as
defined below) that could become a liability of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any Company ERISA Affiliate. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any
Company ERISA Affiliate, has engaged in any transaction described in Section
4069 or Section 4204 or 4212 of ERISA. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Controlled Group Liability_ " means any and all liabilities (i) under Title
IV of ERISA, (ii) under section 302 of ERISA, (iii) under Sections 412 and
4971 of the Code, (iv) as a result of a material failure to comply with the
continuation coverage requirements of section 601 et seq. of ERISA and
section 4980B of the Code, and (v) under corresponding or similar provisions
of foreign Laws.

(d) The Company, its Subsidiaries and each Company ERISA Affiliate do not
have, and have never had any obligation to contribute to any plan within the
meaning of ERISA Sections 3(37) and 4001(a)(3). The Company, its Subsidiaries
and each Company ERISA Affiliate do not and have never maintained or
sponsored a plan sponsored by more than one employer within the meaning of
ERISA Section 4063 or Code Section 413(c). None of Company, its Subsidiaries
nor any ERISA Affiliates has incurred any "withdrawal liability" (within the
meaning of Section 4201 of ERISA) that has not been satisfied in full.

(e) There is no (and during the past two years there has been no) material
Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened relating to
the Benefit Plans, other than routine claims for benefits. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has since the Applicable Date taken any action
to take corrective action or make a filing under any voluntary correction
program of the IRS, the U.S. Department of Labor or any other Governmental
Entity with respect to any Benefit Plan, and neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any Knowledge of any material plan defect that would
qualify for correction under any such program. None of the Benefit Plans
provides for medical, life or death benefits beyond termination of service or
retirement, other than pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, any similar state or local Law or any foreign Law.
The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has reserved the right to amend,
terminate or modify at any time all plans or arrangements subject to ERISA.
All required contributions have been timely made to the Benefit Plans and no
Benefit Plan has any unfunded liabilities that have not been properly accrued.

 

(f) Each Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and associated Treasury
Department guidance has (i) between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2008,
been operated in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code and
Notice 2005-01 and (ii) since January 1, 2009 (or such later 

 



23  date permitted under applicable guidance), been operated in compliance with,
and is in documentary compliance with, in all material respects, Section 409A
of the Code and IRS regulations and guidance thereunder. No compensation
payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been reportable as
nonqualified deferred compensation in the gross income of any individual or
entity, and subject to an additional tax, as a result of the operation of
Section 409A of the Code. All stock options granted by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to any current or former Service Provider have been granted
with a per share exercise or reference price at least equal to the
fair market value of the underlying stock on the date the option or stock
appreciation right was granted, within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code
and associated Treasury Department guidance.

 

(g) Except as expressly set forth in _Section 3.3_ of this Agreement, neither
the execution of this Agreement, the adoption of this Agreement by holders of
shares constituting the Company Requisite Vote nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in conjunction with any
other event, including any termination of employment or service) may
(i) entitle any current or former Service Provider to any compensation or
benefit, including without limitation severance pay (other than severance pay
required by any Law) or to any increase in any compensation or benefit,
including without limitation severance pay upon any termination of
employment, (ii) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or delivery of,
or increase in the amount or value of, any payment, right or benefit to any
current or former Service Provider or result in any limitation on the right
of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to amend, merge, terminate or
receive a reversion of assets from any Benefit Plan, or (iii) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting or exercisability, or result in any payment or
funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits
under, increase the amount payable or result in any other material obligation
pursuant to, any of the Benefit Plans. No Benefit Plan provides for the gross-
up or reimbursement of Taxes under Section 4999 or 409A of the Code or
otherwise. _Section 4.8(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth an
estimate of the amounts potentially payable to each Service Provider under any
Benefit Plan in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the adoption of this Agreement by holders of shares constituting the Company
Requisite Vote or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(either alone or in conjunction with any other event, including as a result
of a termination of employment or service), including specifically listing the
amount of any "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code and any gross-ups or reimbursement of Taxes under Section 4999 of
the Code that could become payable under any Benefit Plans. All Company
Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs can be cancelled by their terms in
accordance with _Section 3.3_.

 

(h) Each Service Provider who is classified by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, as having the status of an
independent contractor is properly so characterized.

(i) All Non-U.S. Benefit Plans have been maintained in compliance in all
material respects with their respective terms and applicable local Law. With
respect to each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan: (i) all employer and employee
contributions to each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan required by Law or by the terms of
such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan have been made, or, if applicable, accrued in
accordance with normal accounting practice, (ii) the fair market value of the
assets of each funded Non-U.S. Benefit Plan, the liability of each insurer for
any Non-U.S. 

 



24  Benefit Plan funded through insurance or the book reserve established for
any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is
sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued benefit obligations and any
liabilities or obligations incurred through the Closing Date, with respect to
all current or former participants in such plan according to the actuarial
assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine
employer contributions to such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan, and no transaction
contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance
obligations to be less than such benefit obligation, and (iii) each Non-U.S.
Benefit Plan required to be registered has been registered and has been
maintained in good standing with the applicable Governmental Entities and to
the Knowledge of the Company, no circumstances exist as of the date hereof
that would reasonably be expected to result in the loss of the good standing
of such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan. None of the Non-U.S. Benefit Plans is a
"registered pension plan" as defined in subsection 248(1) of the Income Tax
Act (Canada) which contains a "defined benefit provision" as defined in
subsection 147.1(1) of the Income Tax Act (Canada).

(j) No individuals are participating in (or are eligible to participate in)
any of the Non-U.S. Benefit Plans maintained in Canada, other than current or
former employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or officers or directors
of the Company or its Subsidiaries (and any spouses, dependents, survivors or
beneficiaries of such persons).

(k) All data necessary to administer each Benefit Plan is in the possession of
the Company, its Subsidiaries or their agents and is in a form which is
sufficient for the proper administration of the Benefit Plan in accordance
with its terms and applicable Law and such data is materially complete and
correct.

(a) Since the Applicable Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries have complied
with all applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws, statutes,
ordinances, common law, and any applicable rules, regulations, standards,
judgments, orders, writs, injunctions, decrees, arbitration awards, agency
requirements, licenses or permits of any Governmental Entity (collectively, "
_Laws_ ") in all material respects, and have timely filed all material
reports, registrations, notices and statements, together with any amendments
required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required to file

and assessments due and payable in connection therewith. Except as set forth
in _Section 4.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, since the Applicable
Date there have been no investigations or review by any Governmental Entity

of the Company, there are no such investigations or reviews pending or
threatened, and nor have the Company or any of its Subsidiaries received
written notice from any Governmental Entity stating an intention of such
Governmental Entity to conduct the same. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has obtained and is in compliance in all material respects with
all material permits, certifications, approvals, registrations, consents,
authorizations, franchises, variances, exemptions and orders issued or granted
by a Governmental Entity (" _Licenses_ ") necessary to conduct its business
as presently conducted. Since the Applicable Date, none of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries has received written notice that the Governmental Entity
or other Person issuing or authorizing any such License intends to terminate
or refuse to renew or reissue such License.

(b) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Companys
Knowledge, any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
representatives, consultants or agents for or on behalf of the Company or its

be in violation of any provision of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977
(the " _FCPA_ ") or other applicable anti-corruption laws in other countries

corporate funds for unlawful contributions, gifts, entertainment or unlawful
expenses relating to political activity; (iii) made, offered or authorized any
unlawful payment, or other thing of value, to foreign or domestic government
officials or employees; or (iv) made, offered or authorized any unlawful
bribe, rebate, payoff, influence payment, kickback or other similar unlawful
payment in violation of the FCPA or other applicable anticorruption laws.
Since the Applicable Date, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the
Company has conducted or initiated any internal investigation or made a
voluntary, directed or involuntary disclosure to any Governmental Entity with
respect to any alleged act or omission arising under or relating to any
noncompliance with the FCPA or other applicable anti-corruption laws in other

corporation or other legal entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership,
leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business

be expected to materially delay or materially impede the ability of the
applicable Buyer Party to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

5.2 _Corporate Authority_. The Buyer Parties have all requisite corporate or
similar power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate

applicable Buyer Party to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Buyer
Parties do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (i) a breach or
violation of, or a default under, the

 



37  certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Buyer Parties, (ii) with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or violation of, a termination
(or right of termination) or a default under, the creation or, acceleration

contemplated by this Agreement.

 

5.4 _Litigation_. There are no Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened against the Buyer Parties that, if adversely determined,

this Agreement. None of the Buyer Parties is a party to or subject to the
provisions of any material judgment, order, writ, injunction, settlement
agreement decree or award entered, issued or made by or with any Governmental
Entity.

 

5.5 _Financing_ _; Funds_.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company a true, complete and correct copy of
the executed equity commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof, among
Parent, the Company, Accel-KKR Capital Partners IV, LP, Accel-KKR Capital
Partners V, LP, Accel-KKR Capital Partners IV Strategic Fund, LP, and Accel-
KKR Capital Partners V Strategic Fund, LP (the " _Financing Commitment_ "),
pursuant to which each investor party thereto has committed, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth therein, to invest in Parent the cash amounts
set forth therein (the " _Financing_ ") for the purpose of funding in part
the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration.

(b) As of the date hereof, (i) the Financing Commitment and the terms of the
Financing have not been amended or modified prior to the date of this
Agreement; (ii) no such amendment or modification is contemplated; and (iii)
the commitment(s) contained therein have not been withdrawn, terminated or
rescinded in any respect. As of the date hereof, there are no other Contracts,
side letters or arrangements to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party relating
to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the
Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitment.
Other than as set forth in the Financing Commitment, there are no conditions
precedent related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full
amount of the Financing.

(c) As of the date hereof, the Financing Commitment is in full force and
effect and is the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Parent
and each of the other parties thereto subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred that would, or would
reasonably be expected to, constitute a breach or default (or with notice or
lapse of time or both would constitute a breach or default) under the
Financing

 



38  Commitment. As of the date hereof, Parent has no reason to believe that it
will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the
Financing to be satisfied by it, whether or not such term or condition is
contained in the Financing Commitment. Assuming the satisfaction of the
condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ and _(b)_ , the Financing, when funded
in accordance with the Financing Commitment, together with the cash on hand
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time, shall provide
Parent with cash proceeds on the Closing Date sufficient to make all payments
required to be made by Parent on the Closing Date pursuant to this Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, it shall not be a condition to Closing for Parent
or Merger Sub to obtain the Financing.

5.6  _Solvency_. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties
set forth in _Article IV_ , as of the Effective Time and immediately after
giving effect to the Merger (including the payment of all amounts payable
pursuant to  _Article II_ in connection with or as a result of the Merger and
all related fees and expenses of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries in connection therewith), (a) the amount of the "fair
saleable value" of the assets of each of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries will exceed (i) the value of all liabilities of the Surviving
Corporation and such Subsidiaries, including contingent and other liabilities;
and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of
each of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries on their existing debts
(including contingent liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured;
(b) each of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will not have an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged; and (c) each of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and
other liabilities, as they mature and become due. For purposes of the
foregoing, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation
of the businesses in which it is engaged" and "able to pay its
liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature"
means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations,
asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its
obligations as they become due. 

5.7 _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of
100 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, 100 of which are
validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of Merger Sub are owned by Parent, free and clear of all Liens, other
than transfer restrictions imposed under any federal or state securities
Laws. Merger Sub has not conducted any business prior to the date hereof and
has no assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those
incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent has not
conducted any business prior to the date hereof and has no assets, liabilities
or obligations of any nature other than the Financing Commitment, those
incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

5.8 _Brokers and Finders_. None of the Buyer Parties or any of their
Affiliates or any officers, directors or employees thereof has employed any
broker or finder or incurred any liability for any brokerage fees, commissions
or finders fees in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated in this Agreement.

 



39 5.9 _Delaware Law_. None of the Buyer Parties or any of their respective
Affiliates was an "interested stockholder" of the Company as such term is
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL (other than as a result of a transaction
approved by the Board of Directors of the Company as described in Section
203(a)(1) of the DGCL) at any time during the three year period immediately
preceding the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

5.10 _No Other Buyer Party Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties set forth in this _Article V_, no
representation or warranty of any kind whatsoever, express or implied, at Law
or in equity, is made or shall be deemed to have been made by or on behalf of
the Buyer Parties to the Company, and the Buyer Parties hereby disclaim any
such representation or warranty, whether by or on behalf thereof, and
notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to the Company, or any of their
Representatives or any other Person of any documentation or other information
by any of the Buyer Parties or any of their Representatives or any other
Person with respect to any one or more of the foregoing.

respect thereto until the Excluded Party Deadline (and thereafter the
provisions of _Section 6.2(b)_ , _Section 6.2(c)_ and _Section 6.2(e)_ shall
apply with respect to such Excluded Party). Promptly after the No-Shop Start
Date (and in any event no later than twenty-four (24) hours thereafter), the
Company shall provide to Parent the identity of each Excluded Party (including
the identities of all identified members of the group that constitutes such
Excluded Party) and copies of the latest version of such Acquisition Proposal

available confidential information pursuant to, and in accordance with,
_Section 6.2(c)_.

 

(c) _Conduct Following No-Shop Period Start Date_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, at any time following the No-Shop Period
Start Date and prior to the time, but not after, the Company Requisite Vote is
obtained, if the Company receives a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal
(or an amendment or modification thereto) from any Person that is
not withdrawn and that did not result from a breach of _Section 6.2(b)_ (for
the avoidance of doubt, receipt of an Acquisition Proposal from a Person or
group of Persons who were solicited during the Go-Shop Period, in and of
itself, shall not be deemed a breach of _Section 6.2(b)_), subject to
compliance with this _Section 6.2(c)_ , (i) the Company and its
Representatives may provide non-public information and data concerning the
Company and its Subsidiaries in response to a request therefor by such Person

information or data that has not been provided to Parent by the Company or its
Representatives (including pursuant to this _Section 6.2)_ prior to the No-
Shop Period Start Date unless such information or data is material and is as a
result of an

 



45  event, fact or circumstance occurring after the No-Shop Period Start Date
and the Company promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours
thereafter) provides to Parent any such non-public information or data that
the Company provides to such Person; (C) the Company and its Representatives
shall withhold such portions of the information and data to the extent
relating to any pricing or other matters that are highly sensitive or
competitive in nature from any Restricted Bidder, except to a Qualified
Bidder, in which case, such disclosure shall be subject to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement and pursuant to customary "clean-room" or
other appropriate procedures and (D) solely in the case of a Person who is or
was an Excluded Party or any other Person who received non-public information
or data concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries from the Company or its
Representatives during the Go-Shop Period (any such Person, a " _Prior
Participant_ "), unless prior to the fifth (5th) Business Day after receipt of
such Acquisition Proposal from such Prior Participant the Company notifies
Parent that it intends to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 6.2(e)_ to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with such
Prior Participant, the Company shall immediately cease providing any non-
public information and data concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries to
such Prior Participant and its Representatives (including terminating any
access such Prior Participant or its Representatives had to a data room) as of
11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on such fifth (5th) Business Day, and (ii) the
Company and its Representatives may engage or participate in any discussions
or negotiations with such Person, in each of (i) and (ii), if and only to the
extent that, prior to taking any action described in clause (i) or (ii) above,
(x) the Board of Directors of the Company (or an authorized committee
thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (y) the Board of
Directors of the Company (or an authorized committee thereof) has determined
in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a nationally-
recognized financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal; _provided_ , that the Company shall immediately (and in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent of any determination by the
Board of Directors of the Company (or an authorized committee thereof)
contemplated by this _Section 6.2(c)_ specifying that notice is given pursuant
to this _Section 6.2(c)_ ; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company and its
Representatives may contact such Person before making the determination set
forth in _Section 6.2(c)(ii)(x)_ and _(y)_ solely to clarify the terms and
conditions of such proposal, including to clarify whether such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and the extent of any diligence that
may be required by such Person, prior to making any such determination but
not, in any event, to negotiate such terms and conditions.

 

(d) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. Except
as expressly permitted pursuant to _Section 6.2(e)_ , _Section 6.2(f)_ or
_Section 6.2(g)_ , the Board of Directors of the Company and each committee
thereof shall not:

 

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation with respect to the Merger or approve, endorse or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or resolve to approve
or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (collectively, a " _Change
of Recommendation_ ");

 



46 (ii) authorize, cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
enter into any agreement, agreement in principle, letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, term sheet, Alternative Acquisition Agreement or
other similar agreement or document (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement) relating to or in connection with any Acquisition Proposal;

(iii) approve any transaction under, or any Person becoming an "interested
stockholder" under, Section 203 of DGCL or any similar action or omission
under any other applicable Takeover Statute; or

(iv) grant any waiver, amendment or release under, or take any other action
having a similar effect with respect to, any standstill, confidentiality or
similar agreement, except to the extent necessary to allow the counterparty
thereof to make a private Acquisition Proposal to the Board of Directors of
the Company in accordance with this Agreement.

(e) _Superior Proposal_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, prior to the time, but not after, the Company Requisite
Vote is obtained, the Board of Directors of the Company (or an authorized
committee thereof) may terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in
accordance with _Section 8.3(a)_ if (i) after the date hereof, the Company
receives a Superior Proposal that is not subject to due diligence, (ii) the
Board of Directors of the Company (or an authorized committee thereof)
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, (iii) the Company notifies Parent in writing, at least five
(5) Business Days in advance, that it intends to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ with respect to such Superior Proposal, which
notice shall specify the identity of the party who made such Superior Proposal
and all of the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal
and, unless previously delivered to Parent, attach the most current version
of such agreement; (iv) after providing such notice and prior to terminating
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ with respect to such Superior
Proposal, the Company shall negotiate in good faith on an exclusive basis
with Parent during such five (5)-Business Day period (to the extent that
Parent desires to negotiate) to make such revisions to the terms of this
Agreement and the Financing Commitment as would permit the Board of Directors
of the Company not to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ in
response to such Superior Proposal; and (v) the Board of Directors of the
Company (or an authorized committee thereof) shall have considered in good
faith any changes to this Agreement and the Financing Commitment and shall
have determined in good faith that such Superior Proposal would continue to
constitute a Superior Proposal that is not subject to due diligence if
such changes offered by Parent were to be given effect; _provided_ that in
the event that the Superior Proposal is thereafter modified by the party
making such Superior Proposal, the Company shall provide written notice of
such modified Superior Proposal to Parent and shall again comply with this
_Section 6.2(e)_ and provide Parent with an additional notice prior to
terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ (and shall do so for
each subsequent modification).

 

(f) _Intervening Event_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, prior to the time, but not after, the Company Requisite Vote is
obtained, the Board of Directors of the Company (or an authorized committee
thereof) may make a Change of Recommendation for a reason unrelated to an
Acquisition Proposal if: (i) the Board of Directors 

 



47  of the Company (or an authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel) that, in light of an Intervening
Event, failure to make a Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (ii) the Company has not breached
(and is not deemed to have breached) its obligations under _Section 6.2_ ,
_Section 6.3_ and _Section 6.4_ ; (iii) the Company notifies Parent in
writing, at least five (5) Business Days in advance, that it intends to effect
a Change of Recommendation in connection with such Intervening Event, which
notice shall specify the nature of the Intervening Event in reasonable
detail; (iv) after providing such notice and prior to making such Change of
Recommendation in connection with such Intervening Event, the Company shall
negotiate in good faith with Parent during such five (5)-Business Day period
(to the extent that Parent desires to negotiate) to make such revisions to
the terms of this Agreement and the Financing Commitment as would permit the
Board of Directors of the Company not to effect a Change of a Recommendation
in connection with such Intervening Event; and (v) the Board of Directors of
the Company (or an authorized committee thereof) shall have considered in good
faith any changes to this Agreement and the Financing Commitment and shall
have again determined in good faith that failure to effect a Change of
Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law if such changes offered by
Parent were to be given effect.

 

(g) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this _Section 6.2_
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the
Company (or an authorized committee thereof) from (i) taking and disclosing to
its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication
to stockholders), (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the
stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the stockholders of the
Company) or (iii) making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders that is
required by Law; _provided_ that any such disclosure under clause (i) or (ii)
shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation unless the Board of Directors
of the Company expressly and concurrently reaffirms the Company
Recommendation.

(h) _Notice_. From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company agrees
that it will promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours)
notify Parent if (i) any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal are received by it or any of their Representatives
indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity of the Person making
the proposal or offer and the material terms and conditions of any proposals
or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any proposals or offers
constituting Acquisition Proposals, including proposed agreements) and (ii)
any non-public information is requested from, or any discussions or
negotiations are sought to be initiated with, it or any of its Representatives
indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity of the Person
seeking such information or discussions or negotiations, and in each case,
thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status of any such
discussions or negotiations. In the event that any such party modifies
its Acquisition Proposal in any material respect, the Company shall notify
Parent within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of such modified
Acquisition Proposal of the fact that such Acquisition Proposal has been
modified and the terms of such modification (including, if applicable, copies
of any written documentation reflecting such modification).

(i) _Company Acknowledgement_. The Company agrees that any breach of this
_Section 6.2_ by any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.2_ by the Company for all
purposes of this Agreement.

 



48 6.3 _Proxy Filings; Information Supplied_. The Company shall prepare and file
with the SEC, as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, by June 13,
2016) after the date hereof, a proxy statement on Schedule 14A in preliminary
form (together with a letter to stockholders, notice of meeting and form of
proxy) relating to the Stockholders Meeting (collectively, including any
amendment or supplement thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). The Company
agrees that at the date of mailing to stockholders of the Company and at the
time of the Stockholders Meeting, (i) the Proxy Statement will comply in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder and (ii) none of the information supplied by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement will contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If, at any time
prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders, the
Company shall become aware of the occurrence of any event or other
circumstance relating to it or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective directors or officers, or the Merger, as to which an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement shall be required, the Company shall
promptly inform Parent and prepare and mail to its stockholders such
amendment or supplement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the
receipt of any and all comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement and of any request by the SEC for any amendment or supplement
thereto or for additional information and shall promptly provide to Parent
copies of all correspondence between the Company and/or any of its
Representatives and the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be
cleared by the SEC, including by promptly providing responses to the SEC with
respect to all comments received on the Proxy Statement from the SEC. The
Company shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed promptly (and
in any event, within two (2) Business Days) after the date the SEC staff
advises that it has no further comments thereon or otherwise the date that the
Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement; _provided_ , that
in furtherance thereof, the Company shall mail "broker search cards" in
accordance with Rule 14a-13 under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof and shall mail additional "broker search cards" as
needed in order to allow for the Proxy Statement to be timely mailed in
accordance with this sentence. The Buyer Parties agree that none of the
information supplied by any of them or any of their Affiliates for inclusion
in the Proxy Statement will contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary stated above, prior to filing or mailing of the Proxy Statement or
any other materials that constitute "proxy materials" or "solicitation
materials" or otherwise used for the "solicitation of proxies" (as such terms
are used or defined in Rules 14a-1 through 14a-17 under the Exchange Act) (or,
in each case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a
reasonable opportunity to review, and shall incorporate all reasonable
comments, on such document or response.

 



49 6.4 _Stockholders Meeting_. Subject to _Section 6.3_ , the Company will take,
in accordance with applicable Law and its certificate of incorporation and
bylaws, all action necessary to convene a meeting of Record Holders of Shares
(the " _Stockholders Meeting_ ") as promptly as practicable (and, in any
event, no later than twenty (20) Business Days) after the first date of
mailing of the initial Proxy Statement to consider and vote upon the adoption
of this Agreement; _provided_ , that except as Parent shall have otherwise
consented to in writing in advance, the adoption of this Agreement shall be
the only matter (other than procedural matters and matters that are required
by the Exchange Act or other applicable Law to be voted on by the Companys
stockholders in connection therewith) which the Company shall propose to be
acted on by the Companys stockholders at the Stockholders Meeting. Unless the
Company has effected a Change of Recommendation to the extent permitted by,
and in accordance with, _Section 6.2_ , the Company shall (a) include in the
Proxy Statement (i) the Company Recommendation, (ii) a disclosure relating to
the financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company (including the
amount of fees and other consideration that such financial advisor will
receive upon consummation of or as a result of the Merger, and the conditions
therefor), the fairness opinion rendered by such financial advisor to the
Board of Directors of the Company and the information that formed the basis
for rendering the fairness opinion, and (b) use reasonable best efforts, in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws and the rules of
Nasdaq, to solicit from its stockholders sufficient proxies in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement in order to obtain the Company Requisite Vote,
including engaging at its cost a nationally recognized proxy solicitor and,
upon Parents request, presenting materials (in a form reasonably agreed by
the parties hereto) that recommend this Agreement and the Merger to the
Companys stockholders and/or any firm providing proxy advisory services to
the Companys stockholders and, if necessary, requesting meetings with the
Companys stockholders (for purposes of obtaining their recommendation of the
adoption of this Agreement) and/or any firm providing proxy advisory services
to the Companys stockholders (for purposes of obtaining its recommendation of
the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement but subject to the
DGCL, unless and until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its
terms, the Companys obligation to call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Stockholders Meeting under this Agreement shall not be limited, or otherwise
affected, by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to the
Company of any Acquisition Proposal, and once established, the Company shall
not change the record date for the Stockholders Meeting or postpone or adjourn
the Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may adjourn, delay or postpone the
Stockholders Meeting an aggregate of one (1) time (for a period of not more
than thirty (30) calendar days but not past three (3) Business Days prior to
the Termination Date), and if requested by Parent the Company shall adjourn,
delay or postpone the Stockholders Meeting, in each case, if prior to such
adjournment, delay or postponement (but, in any event, no earlier than five
(5) days prior to the then scheduled date of the Stockholders Meeting) the
Company shall not have received an aggregate number of proxies voting for the
adoption of this Agreement, which have not been withdrawn, such that the
condition in _Section 7.1(a)_ will be satisfied at the Stockholders Meeting.
Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, on each of the last ten (10) Business
Days prior to the date of the Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall notify
Parent of the then-current aggregate tally of the proxies received by the
Company or its Representatives with respect to the Company Requisite Vote.
Parent shall, at the Stockholders Meeting, vote, or cause to be voted, all
Shares owned by Parent in favor of the approval and adoption of this
Agreement.

 



50 6.5 _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the
Company and the Buyer Parties shall cooperate with each other and use (and
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable
best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be
done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
this Agreement and applicable Laws to (i) consummate and make effective the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as

contemplated by this Agreement, under applicable Law. In furtherance of the
foregoing, the Company and Parent agree to file or cause to be filed the
initial notification with respect to the Merger required under the HSR Act no
later than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall
the Buyer Parties or any of their Affiliates be obligated in connection with
the receipt of any consent, approval, ruling or authorization from any
Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement, to propose or agree to
accept any undertaking or condition, to enter into any consent decree, to make
any divestiture or accept any operational restriction, or take or commit to
make payments (other than customary filing fees) or enter into any commercial
arrangement, or commit, or commit to take, any other action (A) the
effectiveness or consummation of which is not conditional on the consummation
of the Merger, or (B) that would reasonably be expected to result in a
material and adverse impact on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or the Buyer Parties and their Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time),
taken as a whole, or any of the Buyer Parties Affiliates.

(b) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable each will consult with the other on and consider in good
faith the views of the other in connection with, all of non-confidential
information relating to Buyer Parties or the Company, as the case may be, and
any of their respective Affiliates, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Company and
the Buyer Parties shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

(c) Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of any Governmental
Entity, the Company and the Buyer Parties each shall keep the other apprised
of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
the portions of any notices or other communications received 

 



51  by the Buyer Parties or the Company, as the case may be, from any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor Buyer Parties shall
nor shall they permit any of their Subsidiaries or Representatives to
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filings, investigation or other inquiry with respect to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby unless they consult with the other
parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity,
give the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

 

(d) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each
party hereto shall promptly notify the other party hereto of any written
notice or other written communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or
any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or that the consummation
of the Merger will accelerate any rights or obligations, or any request or
demand by such Person that the Company take certain actions or omit to take
certain actions in connection with the Merger.

 

6.6 _Access and Reports_. Subject to applicable Law, prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) (i) upon
reasonable prior written notice, afford Parents officers and other authorized
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, and in a
manner as shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations
of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof, to its employees, Representatives,
properties, books, contracts and records, (ii) furnish promptly to Parent all
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as may
reasonably be requested by Parent and (iii) furnish promptly to Parent any
unaudited monthly consolidated statements of operations for the Company and
its Subsidiaries prepared and provided to management or the Companys Board of
Directors; _provided_ that no investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.6_
shall affect or be deemed to modify or supplement any representation or
warranty made by the Company herein. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize any attorney-
client privilege or contravene any Law; and in any such event, the parties
hereto will use commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements. All such information provided pursuant to
this _Section 6.6_ shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement. Such rights of access explicitly exclude any Phase II environmental
investigations or any other intrusive or invasive sampling, including
subsurface testing of soil, surfacewater or groundwater at any Leased Real
Property. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the good faith conduct of a
due diligence review customary for an acquisition similar to the Merger shall
be deemed not to unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

6.7 _Stock Exchange De-listing_. Each of the parties agrees to cooperate with
each other in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to delist
the Companys securities from the Nasdaq and to terminate registration under
the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that such delisting and termination
shall not be effective until after the Effective Time.

 

6.8 _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a
joint press release of the Company and Parent and thereafter (unless and
until a Change of Recommendation

 



52  occurs in accordance with _Section 6.2_ ) the Company and the Buyer Parties
each shall consult with each other prior to issuing any press releases or
otherwise making public announcements with respect to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, subject to _Section
6.4_ , prior to making any filings with any third party or any Governmental
Entity (including any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation
service) with respect thereto, except as may be required by Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any national
securities exchange or interdealer quotation service or by the request of
any Governmental Entity.

6.9 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Until December 31, 2016, the Surviving Corporation shall provide all
individuals who are employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries on the
Closing Date (the " _Affected Employees_ "), while employed by the Company or
its Subsidiaries, with compensation and benefits that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits (including
target bonus and commission opportunities, but excluding equity compensation
incentives, severance payments and any compensation or benefits triggered in
whole or in part by the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby)
provided to the Affected Employees immediately prior to the date hereof.
Nothing contained in this _Section 6.9_ shall be deemed to (i) grant any
Affected Employee any right to continued employment after the Closing Date or
(ii) restrict or limit Parent and the Surviving Corporations right to
terminate any Affected Employee for any reason, including without cause.

(b) Parent shall cause any employee benefit plans of Parent and its
Subsidiaries (other than the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) in
which the Affected Employees are entitled to participate after the Closing
Date to take into account for purposes of eligibility, vesting, level of
benefits (but not for any purpose under any defined benefit pension plans or
plans providing for post-termination medical benefits), service by such
employees as if such service were with Parent or its Subsidiaries, to the
same extent such service was credited under an analogous Benefit Plan (except
to the extent that it would result in a duplication of benefits with respect
to the same period of service).

 

(c) Following the Closing Date, with respect to the Affected Employees and
their eligible dependents, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation, to the extent commercially reasonable, to: (i) waive any pre-
existing conditions to the extent required by Law and to the extent such pre-
existing conditions were waived under the existing plans of the Company as of
the date of this Agreement, (ii) provide credit for prior service with the
Company and its Affiliates as of the Closing Date for purposes of satisfying
any applicable waiting periods to the extent such credit would be recognized
for this purpose under the existing plans of the Company as of the date of
this Agreement, and (iii) give credit in the year in which the Closing Date
occurs for any copayments, deductibles and out-of-pocket limits paid by the
Affected Employee and eligible dependents in such year prior to the Closing
Date to the extent such amounts would be recognized for such purposes under
the existing plans of the Company as of the date of this Agreement.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.9_ , express or implied (i) shall be
construed to establish, amend, or modify any Benefit Plan or (ii) is intended
to confer upon any Person (including current or former Service Providers, or
dependents or beneficiaries of Service Providers) any rights as a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement.

 



53 6.10 _Expenses_. Except (a) as otherwise provided in _Section 8.5_ , (b) for
any filings fees associated with the notifications under the HSR Act in
respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (c) for any
transfer or similar Taxes (in the case of (b) and (c), which shall be borne
equally by Parent and the Company), whether or not the Merger is consummated,
all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
financing thereof (collectively, the " _Expenses_ ") shall be paid by the
party incurring such expense except, subject to the terms of this Agreement,
for Parents reimbursement and obligations pursuant to _Section 6.13_.

 

6.11 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, in the event of any threatened or
actual Proceeding, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including any
such Claim in which any individual who is now, or has been at any time prior
to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who is or
was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
director or officer of another Person (each an " _Indemnified Party_ "), is,
or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising
in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is
or was a director or officer of Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to
the Effective Time or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, whether asserted or arising before or after
the Effective Time, the parties shall cooperate and use their reasonable best
efforts to defend against and respond thereto. All rights to indemnification
and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as
provided in their respective certificates or articles of incorporation or
bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) shall survive the Merger
and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms,
and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six
years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of such individuals for acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that nothing in this sentence shall
require any amendment to the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or
comparable organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the individuals serving
as officers and directors of Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
to be covered for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time by the
directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained by Company (
_provided_ that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less
advantageous than such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time that were committed by such officers and
directors in their capacity as such; _provided,_ that in no event shall Parent
or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend annually in the aggregate

 



54  an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the
Company (which current amount is set forth in _Section 6.11(b)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter) for such insurance (the " _Insurance Amount_ ");
_provided_ , _further_ , that if Parent or the Surviving Corporation is unable
to maintain such policy (or such substitute policy) as a result of the
preceding proviso, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall obtain as much
comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, Parent may
direct the Company to purchase a six (6)-year prepaid "tail policy" that
provides coverage no less favorable than the coverage described above; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums for such "tail" policy
exceed the Insurance Amount, then Parent may direct the Company to obtain a
"tail" policy with the maximum coverage available for the Insurance Amount
applied over the term of such policy. In the event that the Company purchases
such a "tail" policy, the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
under this _Section 6.11(b)_ shall be deemed satisfied, _provided_ that the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to
honor the obligations thereunder pursuant to this _Section 6.11(b)_.

 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.11_ are intended to be for the benefit

and shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof.
The Company shall give Parent and its Representatives a reasonable opportunity
to review, and shall consider in good faith all reasonable comments, on any
written document to be given to any third party or Governmental Authority
in connection therewith. None of the Company or its Subsidiaries or
Representatives shall compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or
agree to compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding any such
stockholder litigation or consent to the same unless Parent shall have
consented in writing. After receipt of the Company Requisite Vote, the Company
shall (a) cooperate with Parent in connection with such Stockholder

the Company, subject to the requirements of any existing directors and
officers liability insurance policies.

equivalent or reinvest any short term investment in any security or other
investment or deposit that has a maturity date that is greater than the

_Section 8.2_ shall not be available to any party that has breached in

obligations under this Agreement in any manner that shall have been the
primary cause of, or the primary factor that resulted in, the failure of a
condition to the consummation of the Merger to have been satisfied on or
before the Termination Date; _provided further_ , _however_ , that, subject to
limitations set forth in the last sentence of _Section 6.5(a)_ , the

earlier of (i) thirty (30) days after written notice thereof is given by the
Company to Parent and (ii) the Termination Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company is not then in material breach of this Agreement.

8.4 _Termination by Parent_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
may be abandoned by written notice of Parent (on behalf of the Buyer Parties)
if:

(a) (i) the Board of Directors of the Company shall fail to recommend in the

; or

agreement made by the Company in this Agreement such that the conditions set

61  is not cured prior to the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days after written

Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer Parties are not then in
material breach of this Agreement.

8.5 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the
Merger pursuant to this _Article VIII_ , this Agreement shall become void and
of no effect with no liability to any Person on the part of any party hereto
(or of any of its Representatives or Affiliates); _provided_ , _however_ , and
notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, that (i) no such
termination shall relieve the Company of any liability to pay the Termination
Fee pursuant to this _Section 8.5_ , (ii) no such termination shall relieve
the Company, on the one hand, or the Buyer Parties, on the other hand, of
liability for any willful breach of this Agreement prior to termination; and
(iii) the agreements of the parties contained in _Section 6.10_ , the
indemnification and reimbursement provisions of _Section 6.13_ , this _Section
8.5_ , _Article IX_ and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the
termination of this Agreement (in the case of the Confidentiality Agreement,
subject to the terms thereof). For purposes of this Agreement, "willful
breach" shall mean any act or failure to act by any person with the actual
knowledge and intent that the taking of such act or the failure to take such
act would cause a breach of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the
failure of Parent or Merger Sub to cause the Merger and the Effective Time to
occur and to effect the Closing as and when required under this Agreement
shall be a willful breach of this Agreement.

 

(b) Without limiting _Section 8.5(a)_ , in the event that:

 

(i) (x) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ (before
obtaining the Company Requisite Vote), _Section 8.2(b)_  or _Section 8.4(b)_
(as a result of any willful breach), (y) any Person shall have made a _bona
fide_ Acquisition Proposal prior to such termination, and (z) within twelve
(12) months after such termination the Company shall have entered into an
agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or consummated any
Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ that for purposes of this clause (z) the
references to "20%" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall
be deemed to be references to "50%");

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.4(a)_ ;

 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_
; or

 

(iv) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.2(b)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.4(b)_ ;

then the Company shall:

(A) in the case of clause (i) above, promptly, but in no event later than
three (3) Business Days after the earlier of the date on which the Company
enters into an agreement with respect to or consummates the Acquisition
Proposal referred to in subclause (i)(z) above, pay Parent or its designee
the Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds;

 



62 (B) in the case of clause (ii) above, promptly but in no event later than
three (3) Business Days after the date of such termination, pay Parent or its
designee the Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds;

 

(C) in the case of clause (iii) above, immediately prior to or substantially
concurrently with such termination, pay Parent or its designee the
Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds; and

(D) in the case of each of clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above, promptly
but in no event later than three (3) Business Days after such termination, pay
Parent or its designee the Expense Reimbursement (to the extent not previously
paid) by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

 

(c) The Buyer Parties and the Company acknowledge that the agreements
contained in this _Section 8.5_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the
parties would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails
to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to _Section 8.5(b)_ , and, in order
to obtain such payment, the Buyer Parties commence a suit that results in a
judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in _Section 8.5(b)_ or
any portion thereof, the Company shall pay to the Buyer Parties their costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the prime
rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made through the date of payment. In no event shall the Company be required
to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(d) The parties hereto agree that payment of the Termination Fee and the
Expense Reimbursement shall be Parents and Merger Subs exclusive remedy for
any termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_ under
circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable under this _Section 8.5_
and is actually paid, and after such payment the Parent and Merger Sub shall
have no further recourse against the Company for, or as a result of, such
termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing limitations on
liability shall in no event limit Parents ability to seek recovery for
damages, or limit the amount of damages that Parent may recover, in connection
with a claim for a willful breach of _Section 6.2_ ,  _Section 6.3_ or
_Section 6.4_ occurring prior to the termination of this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the remedy of specific performance (including in the form
of an injunction) pursuant to _Section 9.5(c)_ shall not be available to
Parent or Merger Sub in the event this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with _Article VIII_ under circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable,
and is actually paid, under this _Section 8.5_.

PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS _SECTION 9.5_.

 

(c) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to
consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that the
parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the
parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that (x) the other party
has an adequate remedy at Law or (y) an award of specific performance is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction.

hereto), the Company Disclosure Letter and the Mutual Non-Disclosure
Agreement, dated as of March 3, 2015, between the Company and Accel-KKR
Company, LLC (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings,
representations and warranties both written and oral, among the parties, with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

(ii) for each of the Persons who are entitled to indemnification and/or
reimbursement of expenses pursuant to _Section 6.13(a)_ , (iii) for each of
the Persons whose liability is limited in accordance with _Section 8.5_ or
_Section 9.10_ , in each case, which such Persons shall be express third
party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to rely on and enforce,
_Sections 8.5(c)_ , _9.1_ , _9.5(b)_ , this _Section 9.8_ and _Section 9.10_ ,
as applicable, the Buyer Parties and the Company hereby agree that their
respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are
solely for the benefit of the other parties hereto, in accordance with and
subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to,
and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights
or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations
and warranties set forth herein. The parties hereto further agree that the
rights of third party beneficiaries under _Section 6.11_ shall not arise
unless and until the Effective Time occurs. The representations and warranties
in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and
are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in
accordance with _Section 9.3_ without notice or liability to any other Person.
In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may
represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with
particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 



67 9.9 _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of a party to take any action, such requirement shall
be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of that party to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action.

 

9.10 _Non-Recourse_. All claims, obligations, liabilities or causes of action
(whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute)
that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be
connected with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement (including any representation or
warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement)
may be made only against (and are those solely of) the entities that are
expressly identified as parties to this Agreement in the Preamble to
this Agreement. No other Person, including any director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,

shall have any liabilities (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in
equity, or granted by statute) for any claims, causes of action, obligations
or liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with or related in any
manner to this Agreement or based on, in respect of or by reason of this
Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance or breach.

 

9.11 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

9.12 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties and their successors and permitted assigns, but
neither this Agreement nor any rights, interests and obligations hereunder
shall be assigned by any party, in whole or in part (whether by operation of
Law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of each of the other
parties and any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall
be null and void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub may (i)
assign this Agreement (in whole or in part) to one of more of its Affiliates
( _provided_ that no assignment shall relieve Merger Sub or Parent of any of
its obligations under this Agreement) and (ii) collaterally assign any or all
of its rights, but not its obligations under this Agreement to any of its
sources of debt financing; _provided_ , _however_ , that such assignment will
not (i) affect the obligations of the parties to the Financing Commitment or
(ii) materially impede or delay the consummation of the Merger.

 



68 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
duly authorized officers of the parties hereto as of the date first written
above.
