(i) this Agreement has not been terminated in accordance with  _Article VIII_
, (ii) the Company is prepared (in accordance with _Section 1.02(b)_) to file
the Schedule 14D-9 on the same date as Purchaser commences the Offer and (iii)

event later than ten (10) Business Days after the Agreement Date, Purchaser
shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, commence the Offer within the
meaning of the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ "). The obligations of Purchaser to, and of Parent to
cause Purchaser to, accept for payment any Shares validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer are subject to the conditions set
forth in _Annex I_ (the " _Offer Conditions_ "). The Offer shall expire at
5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date that is twenty-one (21) Business
Days (determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act)
following the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act) of the Offer (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ "). For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Expiration Date_ " means the Initial Expiration
Date or, if the Initial Expiration Date has been extended pursuant to and in
accordance with this Agreement, the date and time to which the Offer has been
so extended.

(b) Parent and Purchaser expressly reserve the right to waive (where permitted
by applicable Law), in their sole discretion, in whole or in part, any of the
Offer Conditions, to increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes in
the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that without
the prior written consent of the Company, which consent may be withheld in
its sole discretion, or except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement,
neither Parent nor Purchaser shall (i) decrease the Offer Price, (ii) change
the form of consideration 

 



2  payable in the Offer, (iii) reduce the maximum number of Shares to be
purchased in the Offer, (iv) amend or waive the Minimum Condition, (v) add any
condition to the Offer not set forth in _Annex I_ , (vi) amend or modify any
of the Offer Conditions in a manner adverse to the holders of Shares, (vii)
waive the Offer Condition set forth in clause (b) of _Annex I_ or the Offer
Condition set forth in clause (c)(i) of _Annex I_ , (viii) extend the Offer
in a manner other than pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, (ix)
otherwise amend the Offer in any manner materially adverse to the holders of
Shares or (x) provide for a "subsequent offering period" (or any extension
thereof) in accordance with Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, (i) Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to,
extend the Offer for any period or periods required by (A) applicable Law, (B)
applicable rules, regulations, interpretations or positions of the SEC or its
staff or (C) any of the rules and regulations, including listing standards,
of NASDAQ or any other United States national securities exchange registered
under the Exchange Act on which the Company Common Stock is then traded, (ii)
if at the otherwise-scheduled Expiration Date any Offer Condition other than
the Minimum Condition is not satisfied or waived (if permitted hereunder),
Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, extend the Offer for one
or more successive periods of ten Business Days each, in order to permit
the satisfaction of all of the Offer Conditions; and (iii) if at the
otherwise-scheduled Expiration Date the Minimum Condition is not satisfied or
waived and Purchaser is not otherwise obligated to extend the Offer pursuant
to the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii), Purchaser may, and, if requested by the
Company in its sole discretion, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to, extend the Offer for one or more periods of ten (10) Business
Days each, it being agreed that Parent shall not, and shall not be required
to cause Purchaser to, extend the Offer pursuant to this clause (iii) on more
than two (2) occasions; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall Purchaser be required to extend the Offer beyond
the earlier to occur of (1) the date this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Article VIII_ or (2) the Outside Date; _provided_ _,_ _further_ , that the
foregoing clauses (ii) and (iii) of this _Section 1.01(c)_ shall not be
deemed to impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of
Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_.

 

(d) On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and this
Agreement, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, accept for
payment all Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer and
pay for all such shares as soon as practicable (in compliance with Rule
14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act) following the expiration of the
Offer (the time of such acceptance for payment, and payment for, Shares, the "
_Acceptance Time_ "). The Offer Price payable in respect of each Share validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net
to the seller in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law in accordance with _Section 2.02(e)_.

 

(e) Neither Parent nor Purchaser shall terminate or withdraw the Offer prior
to any scheduled Expiration Date unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to _Article VIII_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article
VIII_, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, promptly (and in
any event within one (1) Business Day), irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Purchaser, or
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_ prior to the purchase
of Shares in the Offer, Purchaser shall promptly return and shall cause any
depositary acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, in accordance with
applicable Law, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

 



3 (f) As promptly as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer,
Parent and Purchaser shall file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3
under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect
to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto,
the " _Schedule TO_ "). The Schedule TO shall contain an offer to purchase
(the " _Offer to Purchase_ "), a form of letter of transmittal, a form of
summary advertisement and other ancillary Offer documents and instruments, if
any, in respect of the Offer (collectively, together with any amendments and
supplements thereto and the Schedule TO, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent
and Purchaser shall take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents to
be disseminated to holders of Shares, as and to the extent required by
applicable Law. Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall promptly correct any information provided by such Party for
use in the Offer Documents, if and to the extent that it shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect or the Schedule TO or the other
Offer Documents contain any material omission therein, and Parent and
Purchaser shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the
Schedule TO and, as applicable, the other Offer Documents and to cause the
Schedule TO and the other Offer Documents as so amended and supplemented to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable Law. The Company and its legal counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the
Schedule TO and the Offer Documents before they are filed with the SEC, and
Parent and Purchaser shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to
any comments provided by the Company and its counsel hereunder, in each case,
so long as the Company Board has not effected an Adverse Recommendation
Change. Parent and Purchaser, so long as the Company Board has not
effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, shall as promptly as practicable
provide the Company and its counsel with a copy of any written comments or
telephonic notice of any oral comments that may be received from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Offer Documents or any amendment or supplement
thereto promptly after receipt thereof. Parent and Purchaser, so long as the
Company Board has not effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, shall respond
as promptly as practicable to any such SEC comments and shall consult with
the Company and its counsel prior to responding to any such comments, and
shall provide the Company and its counsel with a copy of any written responses
thereto (contemporaneously with delivery of the same to the SEC) and
telephonic notification of any oral responses thereto of Parent or Purchaser
or their counsel. Parent and Purchaser, so long as the Company Board has not
effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, agree to, prior to the filing of
any amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents with the SEC or
dissemination thereof to the holders of Shares, provide the Company and its
counsel reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such amendments,
supplements or responses, giving reasonable and good faith consideration to
any such comments.

(g) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser on a timely
basis the funds necessary to pay for any Shares that Purchaser becomes
obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

 



4 (h) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution occurring (or for which a record date is
established) after the Agreement Date and prior to the payment by Purchaser
for Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn in connection with the
Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that this sentence shall not be construed to
permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

SECTION 1.02 Company Actions.

 

(a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Transactions and
consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company
Board Recommendation, and the Company shall not withdraw or modify such
recommendation in any manner adverse to Purchaser or Parent except as set
forth in _Section 6.03(e)_.

 

(b) On the date the Schedule TO is filed with the SEC, the Company shall, in a
manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, file with the
SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to
the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto,
the " _Schedule 14D-9_") that shall reflect the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and, subject to _Section 6.03(e)_, contain the Company
Board Recommendation. The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be
disseminated to holders of Shares, as and to the extent required by applicable
Law. The Company shall use its best efforts to obtain the consent of the
Company Financial Advisor to permit the Company to include in the Schedule
14D-9, in its entirety, the Opinion, together with a summary thereof (which
summary shall comply with the provisions of Item 1015(b) of Regulation M-A
promulgated by the SEC). Except and to the extent otherwise expressly
permitted pursuant to _Section 6.03_, the Offer Documents and the Schedule
14D-9 shall contain the recommendation of the Company Board that the holders
of Shares accept the Offer and tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer, and
the Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of such
recommendation. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Purchaser, on the
other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by such Party
for use in the Schedule 14D-9, if and to the extent that it shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect or the Schedule 14D-9 contains any
material omission therein, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to
amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so
amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange
Act. Parent, Purchaser and their legal counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed
with the SEC, and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments provided by Parent and its counsel hereunder.
The Company shall as promptly as practicable provide Parent, Purchaser and
their legal counsel with a copy of any written comments or telephonic notice
of any oral comments that may be received from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 or any amendment or supplement thereto promptly
after receipt thereof. The Company shall respond as promptly as practicable to
any such SEC comments and shall consult with Parent and its counsel prior to
responding to any such comments, and shall provide Parent and its counsel with
a copy of any written responses thereto (contemporaneously with delivery of
the same to the SEC) and telephonic notification of any oral responses
thereto of the Company or its counsel. The Company agrees to, prior to the
filing of any amendment or supplement to the Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC or
dissemination thereof to the holders of Shares, provide Parent, Purchaser and

supplements or responses, giving reasonable and good faith consideration to
any such comments.

 



5 (c) Promptly after the Agreement Date (and in any event in sufficient time to
permit Purchaser to commence the Offer within the time period required by
_Section 1.01(a)_) and otherwise from time to time as requested by Purchaser
or its agents, the Company shall furnish or shall cause its transfer agent to

any other information in the Companys possession or control regarding the

mailing labels, security position listings and non-objecting beneficial owner
lists) and such other assistance as Purchaser or its agents may reasonably
request in communicating the Offer to the holders of Shares. Subject to the

amended as provided therein or by applicable Law, subject to the limitations
of _Section 6.04(b)_ and (ii) the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Purchaser as

or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company.

(d) If at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall
determine, in its sole discretion, or shall be advised, that any deeds, bills
of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other
actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Company its right, title or interest in,
to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company
or Purchaser acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Company as a result
of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this

conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on
behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and
things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and

assets in the Surviving Company or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

waiver of those conditions at the Closing), at the offices of Foley Hoag LLP,
155 Seaport Boulevard, Boston, Massachusetts 02210 or at such other place or

Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later time as is
specified in the Certificate of Merger and as is agreed to by the Company and
Parent in writing, being the " _Effective Time_ ") and shall make all other
filings or recordings required under the DGCL (if any).

governed by and effected under Section 251(h) of the DGCL, without a vote of

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

SECTION 2.01 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company
or the holders of any of the following securities:

(a) _Conversion of Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be canceled in accordance
with _Section 2.01(b)_ or Dissenting Shares (collectively, the " _Excluded
Shares_ "), shall be canceled and shall be converted automatically into the
right to receive the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable net
to the holder in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law. The Merger Consideration is payable in accordance
with _Section 2.02(b)_.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares_. Each Share
held in the treasury of the Company or owned by any direct or indirect wholly
owned Company Subsidiary and each Share owned by Purchaser, Parent or any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be canceled without any conversion thereof
and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

 

(c) _Shares of Purchaser_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Company.

 

SECTION 2.02 Exchange of Certificates.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank
or trust company approved in advance by the Company (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to act as paying agent (the "
_Paying Agent_ "), and enter into a paying agent agreement reasonably
acceptable to the Company with such Paying Agent for the payment of the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Article II_. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Company to
deposit, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Excluded Shares), cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration required to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_ (such cash
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose. The Payment Fund shall be invested by
the Paying Agent as directed by Parent

 



8  and at Parents sole risk. Earnings on the Payment Fund in excess of the
amounts payable to the holders of Shares pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_ shall
be the sole and exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Company and
shall be paid to Parent or the Surviving Company, as Parent directs.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause to be mailed to each person who was, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, a holder of record of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_: a letter of
transmittal (which shall be in such form as Parent and the Company may
reasonably agree and shall be prepared prior to the Closing and which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such
Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Shares to the Paying
Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the certificates
evidencing such Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ " and, together, the "
_Certificates_ ") or the non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ ") in exchange for the Merger Consideration which such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_. Upon (A)
surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to
the Paying Agent for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto or (B) receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message" in the case
of Book-Entry Shares, and, in each case, such other documents as may
customarily be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of Shares represented
by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to  _Section 2.01(a)_, and the Certificates so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the
Merger Consideration may be made to a person other than the person in whose
name the Certificates so surrendered are registered if the Certificates
representing such Shares shall be presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied
by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer or otherwise
be in proper form for transfer, and the person requesting such payment shall
pay any transfer or other Taxes required solely by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such
Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section 2.02_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed
at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
upon such surrender the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this _Article II_. No interest shall be paid or will
accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_. Any holder of Book-Entry
Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate to the Paying Agent to
receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to this _Article II_. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration
with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall be made only to the person in whose
name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

(c) _No Further Rights_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time, holders of Shares shall cease to have any rights as
stockholders of the Company, except as provided herein or by applicable Law.
On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
presented to the Paying Agent or Parent for any reason shall be canceled
against delivery of the Merger Consideration to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to  _Section 2.01(a)_.

 



9 (d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares)
one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Company, upon demand, and any holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares)
who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter
look only to Parent or the Surviving Company for, and Parent and the Surviving
Company shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for the Merger
Consideration. Any portion of the Payment Fund remaining unclaimed by holders
of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) as of a date which is immediately prior
to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Company free and clear of any claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto. Neither Parent nor the
Surviving Company shall be liable to any person in respect of any Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(e)  _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Company,
Purchaser and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Shares, Company Stock Options or Company RSUs such amounts as it is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under all applicable
federal, state or local Tax Laws and shall pay any such withheld amount over
to the appropriate Governmental Authority. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Company, Purchaser or Parent, as
the case may be, and properly paid to the appropriate Governmental Authority,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the Shares, Company Stock Options or Company
RSUs in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying
Agent, the Surviving Company, Purchaser or Parent, as the case may be. 

(f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, then upon (i) the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and (ii) if
required by the Surviving Company, the receipt by it of an indemnity bond in
form and substance and with surety reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving
Company, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_.

 

SECTION 2.03 Company Stock Options, Company RSUs.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option (each, a " _Company Stock
Option_ ") to purchase Shares granted under the Company Stock Plans (or
granted as an inducement award outside of a Company Stock Plan) that is
outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether or not vested or exercisable, shall become fully vested
and exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time and each restricted
stock unit (each, a " _Company RSU_ ") that is subject to a Company RSU award
granted under the Company Stock Plans and outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall become fully vested as of the Effective Time.

 



10 (b) Each Company Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of the
Effective Time and has an exercise price per Share that is less than the
Merger Consideration shall (subject to the provisions of this _Section 2.03_)
be canceled effective as of the Effective Time and converted into the right to
receive, within five (5) Business Days following the Closing, an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the amount by which the
Merger Consideration exceeds the applicable exercise price per Share of such
Company Stock Option, and (ii) the aggregate number of Shares issuable upon
exercise of such Company Stock Option. All such payments shall be subject to
all applicable federal, state and local Tax withholding requirements. Each
Company Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective
Time and has an exercise price per Share that is greater than the Merger
Consideration shall be canceled effective as of the Effective Time without the
payment of consideration and have no further force or effect. 

(c) Each Company RSU that vests in accordance with _Section 2.03(a)_ shall be
canceled effective as of the Effective Time and converted into the right to
receive, within five (5) Business Days following the Closing, an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration
and (ii) the aggregate number of vested Shares subject to such Company RSU.
All such payments shall be subject to all applicable federal, state and local
Tax withholding requirements.

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Agreement Date and in any
event prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if applicable, any
committee thereof administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such
resolutions or take such other actions that are necessary for the treatment
of the Company Stock Options and the Company RSUs pursuant to this _Section
2.03_, which resolutions shall also provide that such Company Stock Options
and Company RSUs, and each of the Company Stock Plans, shall terminate
conditioned upon, and effective as of, the Effective Time.

SECTION 2.04 Dissenting Shares.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held of record or
beneficially by a person who has not voted in favor of approval and adoption
of this Agreement and who is entitled to demand and properly exercises
dissenters rights with respect to such Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_
") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the
DGCL (the " _Dissenters Rights_ "), shall not be converted into or represent
the right to receive the Merger Consideration for such Dissenting Shares
but instead shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting
Shares in accordance with the Dissenters Rights; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or
lose the right to dissent under the Dissenters Rights, then the right of such
holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall
cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of
the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right
to receive, the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon.

 



11 (b) The Company shall provide prompt notice to Parent of any demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the
Company for Dissenters Rights with respect to any Shares, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without
the prior written consent of Purchaser, make any payment with respect to, or
settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or
agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

SECTION 2.05 Certain Adjustments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between
the Agreement Date and the Effective Time the outstanding Shares shall have
been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason
of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse
stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
any stock dividend or stock distribution occurring (or for which a record
date is established), then the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately
adjusted to provide the holders of Shares the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that this sentence shall not be construed to permit the Company to take any
action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk Factors" (other than any

own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted, except, in the case of each Company Subsidiary, where
the failure to be so validly existing and in good standing would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign legal entity to do
business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of
the assets and properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its

complete list of all the Subsidiaries of the Company (each a " _Company
Subsidiary_ "), together with the jurisdiction of organization of each Company

the price of the Shares, any shares of capital stock of any Company Subsidiary
or the value of all or any part of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (the
" _Equity Interests_ "), in each case, obligating the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to issue, sell or grant any such Equity Interests. All Shares
subject to issuance as aforesaid, upon issuance on the terms and conditions

to any stockholders agreement, voting trust agreement or registration rights
agreement relating to any Equity Interests or any other Contract relating to
disposition, voting or dividends with respect to any Equity Interests.

(e) Each outstanding Equity Interest of each Company Subsidiary that is held,
directly or indirectly, by the Company is duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable and was issued free of preemptive (or similar)

solicitation, discussions or negotiations with any person that may be ongoing
with respect to any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected
to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, and shall request the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information previously furnished to any person
in connection therewith in accordance with the terms of the applicable
confidentiality agreement and immediately terminate all physical and
electronic data room access previously granted to any such person, its
Affiliates or Representatives. The Company shall not, and shall cause each of
the Company Subsidiaries not to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any
provision of any existing standstill or confidentiality agreement to which it
or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party, and the Company shall, and
shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, enforce the provisions of any such
agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may grant a waiver of,
and shall not be obligated to enforce, any such provision (y) to the extent
required to permit a party to submit an Acquisition Proposal and (z) if the
Company Board (or any committee thereof) has determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to grant such waiver
could reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

 

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.03_, during the period
between the Agreement Date and the earlier of the Acceptance Time and the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company agrees
that it shall not and shall cause each Company Subsidiary and any of the
officers, directors or employees of it or any Company Subsidiary not to, and
shall instruct (and use its reasonable best efforts to cause) the other
Representatives of the Company not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate, facilitate or encourage any inquiries or the submission of any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would be reasonably
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in, continue or

 



36  otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any person
regarding any Acquisition Proposal, other than for the sole purpose of
informing such person of the provisions set forth in this _Section 6.03_,
(iii) furnish to any person any non-public information in connection with, or
for the purpose of initiating, facilitating or encouraging, any inquiries,
proposals or offers that constitute, or could be reasonably expected to lead
to, an Acquisition Proposal, (iv) otherwise initiate, facilitate or encourage
any effort or attempt to make an Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiries,
proposals or offers that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) execute or enter into any Acquisition Agreement;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may grant a
waiver, amendment or release under any confidentiality or standstill
agreement, solely to the extent necessary to allow a confidential Acquisition
Proposal to be made to the Company or the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) so long as (x) the Company Board has determined in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to grant such
waiver could reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law and (y) the Company promptly notifies Parent of
any such waiver, amendment or release;  _provided_ , further, that, prior to
the Acceptance Time, in response to a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal,
which Acquisition Proposal was not solicited by the Company and did not result
from a breach (or deemed breach within the meaning of _Section 6.03(h)_
below) of this _Section 6.03_, the Company may, subject to (A) the Company
Board (1) determining in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal is, or
could reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal and (2)
determining in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that its failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (B) the Company providing written
notice to Parent of the determination referenced in clause (A), and (C) the
Company receiving from such person an executed Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement, furnish information with respect to the Company to the person
making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement ( _provided_ that any such information
that is provided or made available to the person making such Acquisition
Proposal shall, to the extent not previously provided to Parent, be provided
or made available to Parent prior to or substantially concurrently with such
information being provided to such person making such Acquisition Proposal)
and participate in discussions or negotiations with such person and its
Representatives regarding such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall deliver
to Parent a copy of any executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
promptly following its execution.

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) (i) provide
Parent written notice of (A) the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or (B)
any inquiries, proposals or offers received by, or any discussions or
negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any Representatives of the Company concerning an
Acquisition Proposal and (ii) disclose to Parent the identity of such person
making, and an unredacted copy of, any such Acquisition Proposal or any such
inquiry, offer, proposal or request made in writing (or, if made orally, a
reasonably detailed description of such Acquisition Proposal or any such
inquiry, offer, proposal or request). The Company shall, promptly upon receipt
or delivery thereof (and in any event within 24 hours), provide Parent (and
its outside counsel) with copies of versions of definitive or other agreements
including schedules and exhibits thereto (which may be redacted to the extent
necessary to protect confidential information of the person making
such Acquisition Proposal) relating to such Acquisition Proposal, in each
case exchanged between the Company, on the one hand, and the person making

 



37  such Acquisition Proposal or any of its Representatives, on the other hand.
The Company shall promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, following a
determination by the Company Board (or any committee thereof) that an
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, notify Parent of such
determination.

(d) Except as expressly set forth in _Section 6.03(e)_, neither the Company
nor the Company Board (or any committee thereof), shall, and neither shall
publicly propose to: (i) withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent or Purchaser, the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into any Acquisition Agreement
or (iv) refrain from recommending against (and reaffirming the Company Board
Recommendation) any Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange
offer within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement thereof (any such
action, other than those set forth in the preceding clause (iii), an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the
Acceptance Time and so long as the Company is not in breach (or deemed breach
within the meaning of _Section 6.03(h)_ below) of this _Section 6.03_, the
Company Board may effect an Adverse Recommendation Change (and in respect of
the immediately following clause (x), cause the Company to terminate this
Agreement by written notice to Parent of such termination (so long as, prior
to, and as a condition to the effectiveness of, such termination, the Company
pays to Parent the Company Termination Fee)), if (x) the Company receives an
unsolicited, written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel) is a Superior Proposal and determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that its failure to take such
actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law
or (y) an Intervening Event occurs and as a result thereof the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that:

 

(i) prior to effecting such an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a
Superior Proposal, (A) the Company has notified Parent in writing that it
intends to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change, (B) the Company has
provided Parent a copy of all proposed definitive agreements (including all
financing documents, if applicable) with respect to such Superior Proposal
and all of the information that is specified in _Section 6.03(c)_ with
respect to such Superior Proposal, (C) if requested to do so by Parent, for a
period of five (5) calendar days following delivery of such notice, the
Company shall have discussed and negotiated in good faith, and shall have made
the Representatives of the Company available to discuss and negotiate in good
faith, with Parent and its Representatives, any bona fide proposed
modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (D) no
earlier than the end of such five (5) calendar day period, the Company Board
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor)
shall have determined in good faith, after considering the terms of any
proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by Parent during
such five (5) calendar day period, that such Superior Proposal still
constitutes a Superior Proposal and that the failure to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in connection therewith would be

 



38  inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being
understood and agreed that any change to the financial or other material terms
of a proposal that was previously the subject of a notice hereunder shall
require a new notice to Parent as provided above and require the Company to
again comply with the requirements of this _Section 6.03(e)(i)_) with respect
to any such new notice, but with respect to any such subsequent notices
references herein to a "five (5) calendar day period" shall be deemed
references to a "three (3) calendar day period"); and

 

(ii) prior to effecting such an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to
an Intervening Event, (A) the Company has notified Parent in writing that it
intends to effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change, describing in
reasonable detail the reasons for such Adverse Recommendation Change, (B) if
requested to do so by Parent, for a period of five (5) calendar days
following delivery of such notice, the Company shall have discussed and
negotiated in good faith, and shall have made the Representatives of the
Company available to discuss and negotiate in good faith, with Parent and
its Representatives any bona fide proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and (C) no earlier than the end of such five (5)
calendar day period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith,
after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this
Agreement proposed by Parent during such five (5) calendar day period and
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect
an Adverse Recommendation Change would still be inconsistent with the Company
Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement (including nothing contained in
_Section 6.08_) shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from issuing a
"stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act or taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position with
respect to a tender offer contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to the holders of Shares if the
Company Board determines (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that its failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that, in each case, any Adverse
Recommendation Change may only be made in accordance with _Section 6.03(e)_.
For the avoidance of doubt, neither a "stop, look and listen" communication
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act nor a factually accurate
public statement that describes the Companys receipt of an Acquisition
Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto (without
including a reaffirmation) shall not be deemed an Adverse Recommendation
Change.

 

(g) Except as set forth in _Section 8.03(e)_ with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal, for purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any oral or written proposal or offer for
a transaction or series of related transactions (other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) involving: (i) the purchase or other
acquisition by any person or "group" (as defined in or under Section 13(d) of
the Exchange 

 



39  Act), directly or indirectly, of more than twenty percent of the outstanding
Shares, or any tender offer or exchange offer by any person or "group" (as
defined in or under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) that, if consummated
in accordance with its terms, would result in such person or "group"
beneficially owning, directly or indirectly, more than twenty percent of the
outstanding Shares; (ii) a merger, consolidation, joint venture, business
combination, share exchange, recapitalization, or other similar transaction
involving the Company pursuant to which any person or group (or the
stockholders of any person or group) would beneficially own, directly or
indirectly, twenty percent or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock or
twenty percent or more of the voting power of the surviving entity in a merger
involving the Company or the resulting direct or indirect parent of
the Company or such surviving entity (or any securities convertible into, or
exchangeable for, securities representing such voting power); (iii) a sale,
transfer, acquisition or disposition, directly or indirectly, of more than
twenty percent of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (whether based on the fair market value,
revenue generation or net income), including in any such case through the
acquisition of one or more Subsidiaries owning such assets; or (iv) a
liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

(ii) " _Intervening Event_ " means any material event, circumstance, change,
effect, development or condition (other than an Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry, offer or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal) that was not known or reasonably foreseeable by the
Company Board as of the Agreement Date (or if known, the magnitude or
material consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable by the
Company Board as of the Agreement Date).

 

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
made by any person or group (other than Parent or Purchaser) after the
Agreement Date, which Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach (or
deemed breach within the meaning of _Section 6.03(h)_ below) of this _Section
6.03_, that (1) would result in such person or group (or in the case of a
direct merger between such person and the Company, the shareholders of such
person) acquiring, directly or indirectly, fifty percent or more of the
outstanding Shares or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (2) is on terms that the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel and after taking into account all the terms
and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal) are more favorable to the
Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than the Transactions
(taking into account any proposed amendment or modification proposed by Parent
pursuant to  _Section 6.03(e)(i)_) and (3) the Company Board determines
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is
reasonably capable of being consummated in accordance with its terms in a
reasonable period of time (as compared to the Transactions), taking into
account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects (including
certainty of closing, certainty of financing and the identity of the person
making the Acquisition Proposal) of such proposal. 

 



40 (h) Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that in the event any
Representative of the Company or any Company Subsidiary takes any action, on
behalf of the Company, which, if taken by the Company, would constitute a
breach of this _Section 6.03_, and the Company does not take reasonable
action to seek to cure such breach within two (2) Business Days of the
earlier of (x) the date on which the Company receives written notice from
Parent or Purchaser of such breach and (y) the date on which the Company
obtains Knowledge of such breach, then the Company shall be deemed to be in
breach of this _Section 6.03_.

SECTION 6.04 Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, to the
fullest extent permitted under the DGCL, honor and fulfill in all respects the
obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries under any and all
indemnification agreements between the Company or any Company Subsidiary and
any of their respective present or former directors and officers
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "). In addition, the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company shall contain provisions
no less favorable with respect to exculpation and indemnification than are
set forth in the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws, which provisions shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years
after the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely in any
material respect the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the
Effective Time, were directors or officers of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company shall to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify
and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against all costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and settlement amounts paid in connection with any Action
(whether arising before or after the Effective Time), whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or relating to any
action or omission in their capacity as a director or officer of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, occurring on or before the Effective Time, and to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, the Surviving Company shall pay all
expenses of each Indemnified Party in advance of the final disposition of any
such Action, subject to receipt of an undertaking to repay such advances if
it is ultimately determined in accordance with applicable Law that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification. In the event of any such
Action, (i) subject to the undertaking described in the previous sentence,
the Surviving Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
selected by the Indemnified Parties, promptly after statements therefor are
received, (ii) the Surviving Company shall not settle, compromise or consent
to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened Action to which an
Indemnified Party is a party (and in respect of which indemnification could be
sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement,
compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Party from all liability arising out of such Action or such Indemnified Party
otherwise consents, and (iii) the Surviving Company shall cooperate in the
defense of any such matter;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving
Company shall not be liable for any settlement effected without the Surviving
Companys written consent

 



41  (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
_provided_ _further_ that, in the event that any claim for indemnification is
asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification
in respect of such claim shall continue until the disposition of such claim.
The rights of each Indemnified Party under this _Section 6.04(b)_ shall be in
addition to any rights such person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of the Company
and the Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries, or under any Law or
under any indemnification agreement of any Indemnified Party with the Company
or any Company Subsidiary.

(c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company to maintain in effect a directors and officers liability
insurance policy covering those persons who are currently covered by the
Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy (a true and
complete copy of which has been previously made available to Parent) with
coverage in amount and scope at least as favorable, in the aggregate, to such
persons as the coverage under the Companys existing directors and officers
liability insurance policy; _provided_ , that in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Company be required to expend pursuant to this _Section 6.04(c)_
more than an amount per year equal to 250% of the annual premium currently
paid by the Company for such coverage; _provided_ _further_ that, if the
annual premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Company to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount. At Parents option, Parent
may purchase prior to the Effective Time a six-year prepaid "tail policy"
covering those persons who are currently covered by the Companys directors
and officers liability insurance policy, in which case Parent and the
Surviving Company shall be relieved of their obligations pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence; _provided_ , that if a prepaid policy has been
obtained prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Company to) maintain such policy in full force and
effect for its full term, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

 

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving company or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.04_.

 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 6.04_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, and his or
her heirs and Representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such
individual may have under any certificate of incorporation or bylaws, by
contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be
construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and
officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in
existence with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary for any of
their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood
and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section 6.04_ is
not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company under this _Section 6.04_
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
the rights of any Indemnified Party unless (x) such termination or
modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnified
Party shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it
being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.04_).

 



42 SECTION 6.05 Employee Benefits Matters.

 

(a) Parent hereby agrees that, for a period of 12 months immediately following
the Effective Time, it shall, or it shall cause the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries to, provide each employee of the Company and of each of the
Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (each, an " _Employee_ ") with
(i) a base salary, commissions and annual bonus that are substantially
comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided to such Employee as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits (excluding
equity-based compensation) that are substantially comparable, in the
aggregate, to those provided to (1) Employees by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or (2) similarly
situated employees of Parent or any of its Affiliates as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

(b) Employees shall receive credit for vesting and eligibility purposes under
any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or maintained
by Parent (but not for purposes of benefit accruals under a defined benefit
pension plan), the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries
under which each Employee may be eligible to participate on or after the
Effective Time to the same extent recognized by the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries under comparable Plans immediately prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that such crediting of service shall not
operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such benefit. Such
plan, program or arrangement shall credit each such Employee for service
accrued or deemed accrued on or prior to the Effective Time with the Company,
any Company Subsidiary and all Affiliates where service with the Affiliate
was credited under a comparable Plan of the Company prior to the Effective
Time.

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to be treated as an
amendment of any particular Plan, or to create any third-party beneficiary
rights in any Employee, any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or
any collective bargaining representative thereof. Nothing contained herein,
express or implied, shall alter or limit the ability of Parent or the
Surviving Company or any of their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time
assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them, or to terminate
the employment of any Employee.

 

SECTION 6.06 Further Action.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the Parties shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its
reasonable best efforts (subject to compliance with applicable Law) to
promptly take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to promptly do, or cause
to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate and
make effective the Transactions, including (i) using reasonable best efforts
to obtain from any Governmental Authority or any other third party any
authorizations, consents, Orders, approvals, licenses, permits or waivers
required to be obtained or made by any of the Parties or any of their

 



43  respective Subsidiaries in connection with the authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, as
promptly as practicable after the Agreement Date, (ii) making all necessary
filings, and thereafter making any other required submissions, with respect to
this Agreement and the Transactions required under (A) the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act, and any other applicable federal or state securities Laws,
(B) the HSR Act and any related governmental request thereunder, and (C) any
other applicable Law and (iii) executing or delivering any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out
the purposes of this Agreement. The Parties shall cooperate with each other in
connection with the making of all such filings and shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all information required for
any application or other filing to be made pursuant to the rules and
regulations of any applicable Law (including all information required to be
included in the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9) in connection with the
Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and the Company agree that
nothing contained in this _Section 6.06(a)_ shall modify or affect their
respective rights and responsibilities under _Section 6.06(b)_.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the Company
and Parent (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable) shall: (i)
promptly, but in no event later than ten Business Days after the Agreement
Date, file any and all notices, reports and other documents required to be
filed by such party under the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions;
and (ii) promptly make all filings, and use reasonable best efforts to timely
obtain all consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances and
approvals, and to cause the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting periods, as may be required under any other applicable Antitrust Laws
(to the extent required); (iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable provide
such information as may be requested by the U.S. Department of Justice (the "
_DOJ_ ") or the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") under the HSR Act or
by any other Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions, as
well as any information required to be submitted to comply with a request for
additional information in order to commence or end a statutory waiting
period; and (iv) promptly take, and cause its Affiliates to take, all
reasonable actions and steps requested or required by any Governmental
Authority as a condition to granting any consent, permit, authorization,
waiver, clearance and approvals, and to cause the prompt expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period and to resolve such objections,
if any, as the FTC and the DOJ, or other Governmental Authorities of any
other jurisdiction for which consents, permits, authorizations, waivers,
clearances, approvals and expirations or terminations of waiting periods are
required with respect to the Transactions; _provided_ that Parent, Purchaser,
any of their respective Affiliates, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
will only be required to take or commit to take any such action, or agree to
any such condition or restriction, if such action, commitment, agreement,
condition or restriction is binding on Parent, Purchaser, any of their
respective Affiliates, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, only in the
event the Closing occurs.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
6.06_, each Party shall: (i) give the other Parties prompt notice of the
making or commencement of any request, inquiry or Action by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Transactions; (ii) keep the other Parties
reasonably informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry or Action;
(iii) promptly inform the other Parties of any communication to or from the
FTC, DOJ or any other Governmental Authority to the extent regarding the
Transactions, or regarding any such

 



44  request, inquiry or Action, and provide a copy of all written
communications, correspondence, filings or communications between them or any
of their Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or
members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and
the Transactions; and (iv) pull and re-file any notice under the HSR Act only
if the other Parties agree. None of the Parties shall agree to participate in
any substantive meeting, telephone call or discussion with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any submissions, filings, investigation (including any
settlement of the investigation), Action or other inquiry relating to
the Transactions unless it consults with the other Parties in advance and, to
the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other Parties
the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting, telephone call or
discussion. Subject to applicable Law, in advance and to the extent
practicable, each of Parent or the Company, as the case may be, will consult
the other on all the information relating to Parent or the Company, as the
case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries that appear in any
filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or
any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions. The Parties
will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such
information and providing such assistance as the other Party may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of
any applicable waiting periods, including under the HSR Act; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that if review of any information would be material in connection
with any second request (or similar process) such information shall be
provided solely to those individuals acting as outside antitrust counsel for
the other Parties ( _provided_ that such counsel shall not disclose such
information to such other Parties and shall enter into a joint defense
agreement with the providing Party).

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Parent, after, to the extent practicable, prior consultation with the
Company, shall have the principal responsibility for devising and implementing
the strategy for obtaining any necessary antitrust, competition or investment
review clearances, including in connection with the determination of any
actions to be taken under _Section 6.06(b)_, and shall take the lead in all
meetings and communications with any Governmental Authority in connection with
obtaining any necessary antitrust, competition or investment review
clearances.

 

(e) Neither Parent nor Purchaser shall, nor shall they permit their respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, acquire or agree to acquire any rights,
assets, business, person or division thereof (through acquisition, license,
joint venture, collaboration or otherwise), if such acquisition, would
reasonably be expected to materially delay or materially and adversely affect
Parents or Purchasers ability to: (i) obtain the timely expiration or
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act or (ii) avoid the entry
of, the commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other Order
that would materially delay or prevent the consummation of the Transactions.

 

SECTION 6.07 Obligations of Parent and Purchaser. Parent hereby
unconditionally guarantees the due, prompt and faithful payment, performance
and discharge by Purchaser of, and the compliance by Purchaser with, all of
the covenants, agreements, obligations and undertakings of Purchaser under
this Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Parent
covenants and agrees to take all actions necessary or advisable to ensure
such payment, performance and discharge by Purchaser hereunder and agrees to

or the requirements of NASDAQ or Euronext Paris to issue a press release
relating to this Agreement or (ii) the Parties fail to agree on the text of a

except with respect to the matters described in, and subject to the
requirements of,  _Section 6.03_, _Section 8.01_ and _Section 8.03_, or in

with this Agreement or the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, except as set forth in _Section 2.02(b)_, each of Parent and
the Surviving Company agrees to assume liability for and pay any

transfer or gains and any similar Taxes, as well as any transfer, recording,

right to direct such defense; _provided_ , _however_ , that no settlement of
any such litigation shall be agreed to without Parents consent. Without
otherwise limiting the Indemnified Parties rights with regard to the right
to counsel, following the Effective Time, the Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to continue to retain Foley Hoag LLP or such other counsel selected

stockholder litigation.

 



46 SECTION 6.11 Takeover Laws. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition," "interested stockholder" or other anti-takeover Law is or may
become applicable to the Offer or the Merger or the other Transactions, the
Company and Company Board shall grant all such approvals and take all such
actions as are necessary or advisable so that such Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Law
on the Transactions.

SECTION 6.12 Notification of Certain Matters. At any time after the Agreement
Date, each of Parent and the Company shall give prompt notice to the other
(and will subsequently keep the other informed on a reasonably current basis
of any material developments related to such notice) (i) if, (A) with respect
to the Company, any fact, event or circumstance occurs or exists that has had
or would reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect, (B) with respect to Parent or Purchaser, any fact, event or
circumstance occurs or exists that has had or would reasonably be expected to
result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect, or (C) any fact, event or
circumstance occurs or exists that is reasonably likely to result in any of
the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ or _Annex I_ not being able to be
satisfied prior to the Outside Date or is reasonably likely to prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the Transactions; (ii) upon receipt of
any written notice to the receiving Party from any third person alleging
that the consent or approval of such third person is or may be required in
connection with the Transactions and the pursuit of such consent could (in the
good faith determination of such Party) reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the Transactions; or (iii) upon receipt
of any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority, NASDAQ
or Euronext Paris (or any other securities market) in connection with the
Transactions. No notice given by any Party pursuant to this _Section 6.12_
shall (x) limit or otherwise affect any of the representations, warranties,
covenants, obligations or conditions contained in this Agreement or (y) be
deemed to amend or supplement the Company Disclosure Schedule or constitute
an exception to any representation or warranty. The failure to comply with
this _Section 6.12_ will not constitute the failure of any condition set
forth in _Article VII_ or _Annex I_ to be satisfied unless the underlying
event would independently result in the failure of such a condition to be so
satisfied.

 

SECTION 6.13 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company
Board, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors, shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the
disposition of equity securities of the Company pursuant to this Agreement by
any individual who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act shall be an exempt transaction under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent permitted by applicable
Law.

perform any of the covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement,

Agreement.

 

SECTION 8.03 Fees and Expenses.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 8.03(b)_, all Expenses incurred in connection with

_Expenses_ ," as used in this Agreement, shall include all out-of-pocket

connection with or related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation,
execution and performance of this Agreement and the Transactions, and in the
case of Parent, with respect to its due diligence investigation of the Company

(iii) by (x) Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ or

disclosed or otherwise made public and (B) within twelve (12) months after
the Termination Date, the Company or any Company Subsidiary enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal which is
subsequently consummated or consummates any Acquisition Proposal (in each
case, whether or not such Acquisition Proposal is the same Acquisition
Proposal described in clause (A) above), then the Company shall pay Parent the
Company Termination Fee, which payment shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within one (1) Business Day of the consummation of
any Acquisition Proposal, in each case, as referred to in clause (B) above.

 

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, in the event this Agreement is terminated by
the Company for any reason at a time when Parent would have had the right to
terminate this Agreement, Parent shall be entitled to receipt of the Company
Termination Fee that would have been (or would have subsequently become)
payable had Parent terminated this Agreement at such time.

 

(c) If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.01(b)(i)_ or  _Section 8.01(b)(ii)_ (in the case of _Section
8.01(b)(ii)_, as a result of any Order, decree or ruling or action pursuant to
or arising under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law) and as of the
Termination Date, (i) Purchaser is not then required to accept for payment
validly tendered Shares pursuant to paragraph (b) of _Annex I_ and (ii) none
of the conditions specified in paragraph (c)(ii), (c)(iii) or (c)(iv) of
_Annex I_ shall have occurred and then be continuing, then Parent shall pay
the Company the amount of $24,000,000 (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ").

 



51 (d) The Company Termination Fee payable by the Company hereunder shall be paid
to Parent or its designee by the Company in immediately available funds: (i)
concurrently with a termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.01(d)(ii)_, (ii) prior to or concurrently with, and as a condition
to the effectiveness of, a termination of this Agreement by the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.01(c)(ii)_, (iii) within two (2) Business Days after a
termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)(i)_ or 
_Section 8.01(d)(iv)_. The payment to Parent or its designees of the Company
Termination Fee shall, subject always to _Section 8.02(b)_, be the sole and
exclusive remedy (other than in the event of a termination pursuant to 
_Section 8.01(d)(iii)_ or _Section 8.01(d)(iv)_ in the event of an
intentional breach by the Company) of Parent for any loss suffered by Parent
or Purchaser as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated
to the extent paid and upon such payment in accordance with this _Section
8.03_, the Company shall not have any further liability or obligation relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions. The Parent
Termination Fee payable by Parent hereunder shall be paid to the Company or
its designee by Parent in immediately available funds within two (2) Business
Days after a termination of this Agreement by either Party pursuant to
_Section 8.01(b)(i)_ or  _Section 8.01(b)(ii)_. In no event shall either of
the Company or Parent be required to pay the Company Termination Fee or the
Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, on more than one occasion.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Parties agree
that the payment of the Company Termination Fee, with respect to Parent, and
the Parent Termination Fee, with respect to the Company, shall, subject to
Section 8.02(b) and the second sentence of this  _Section 8.03(d)_, be the
sole and exclusive remedy available to the Parties with respect to the
termination of this Agreement and the failure of the Transactions to be
consummated. In the event that this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with _Section 8.01_ and any such payment becomes due and payable and is paid
by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, upon such payment in accordance
with this _Section 8.03_, such Party (and such Partys Affiliates and its
and their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders and
Representatives) shall have no further liability to the other Parties under
this Agreement.

 

(e) For purposes of _Section 8.03(b)(iii)_, Acquisition Proposal shall have
the meaning assigned to such term in  _Section 6.03(g)(i)_, except that
references to 20% in the definition thereof shall be deemed to be references
to 50%.

(f) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this
_Section 8.03_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without
these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if either of the Company or Parent fails to pay when due any
amount pursuant to this _Section 8.03_, then such Party shall (i) reimburse
the other Party for all Expenses incurred in connection with the collection of
such overdue amount and the enforcement by such other Party of its rights
under this _Section 8.03_, and (ii) pay such other Party interest on such
overdue amount from the date such payment was required to be made until the
date of payment at the prime lending rate as published in _The Wall Street
Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

SECTION 9.04 Interpretation and Rules of Construction.

 

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Annex, Exhibit, Article
or Section, such reference shall be to an Annex, Exhibit, Article or Section
of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, index of
defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. Documents, materials and information are deemed to have been "made
available" to Parent and Purchaser, if such documents, materials or
information were available for review by such person and its Representatives
through the electronic data room (the 

 



63  " _Data Room_ ") entitled "Project ESKIMO," which is hosted by Donnelley
Financial Solutions Venue (https://www.rrdvenue.com) in connection with the
Transactions or disclosed in a SEC Report filed and publicly available, in
each case, prior to the Agreement Date. The term "or" is not exclusive. The
word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a
subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if."
The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of such terms. Any agreement, instrument or Law
defined or referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or Law as from
time to time amended, modified or supplemented, unless otherwise specifically
indicated. References to a person are also to its successors and permitted
assigns. When calculating the period of time before which, within which or
following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this
Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such period
shall be excluded, and if the last day of such period is not a Business Day,
the period shall end on the immediately following Business Day. Unless
otherwise specifically indicated, all references to "dollars" and "$" will be
deemed references to the lawful money of the United States of America.
References to "days" shall mean "calendar days" unless expressly stated
otherwise. No specific provision, representation or warranty shall limit the
applicability of a more general provision, representation or warranty. It is
the intent of the Parties that each representation, warranty, covenant,
condition and agreement contained in this Agreement shall be given full,
separate, and independent effect and that such provisions are cumulative. The
phrase "ordinary course of business" shall be deemed to be followed by the
words "consistent with past practice" whether or not such words actually
follow such phrase. Any reference in this Agreement to a date or time shall be
deemed to be such date or time in the time zone in which Boston,
Massachusetts is located, unless otherwise specified.

(b) Each of the Parties has participated in the drafting and negotiation of
this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by all the
Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of this
Agreement.

SECTION 9.05 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order
that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

SECTION 9.06 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, taken together with the Company
Disclosure Schedule and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire
agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and supersedes all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and
oral, among the Parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof.

 



64 SECTION 9.07 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the
prior written consent of the other Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent and Purchaser may assign all or any of their rights and obligations
hereunder to any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent so long
as Parent continues to remain liable for all of such obligations as if no such
assignment had occurred. Any purported assignment without such consent shall
be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their
respective successors and assigns.

 

SECTION 9.08 Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is not intended to, and
shall not, confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder,
except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by the terms and provisions of
_Article VI_ and (b) from and after the Effective Time, the rights of holders
of Shares, Company Stock Options or Company RSUs to receive the consideration
pursuant to the Merger, as set forth in _Article II_.

SECTION 9.09 Remedies; Specific Performance. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. Each Party agrees that, in the
event of any breach or threatened breach by any other Party of any covenant or
obligation contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching Party shall be
entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether
in law or equity, including monetary damages, except as limited by _Section
8.03_) to (a) an Order of specific performance to enforce the observance and
performance of such covenant or obligation, and (b) an injunction restraining
such breach or threatened breach.

SECTION 9.10 Governing Law.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any applicable
principles of conflict of laws that would cause the Laws of another State to
otherwise govern this Agreement.

(b) The Parties agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce
any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the Transactions (whether brought by any Party or any of its
Affiliates or against any Party or any of its Affiliates) shall be heard and
determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction
over such Action, such Action shall be heard and determined exclusively in
the United States District Court for the District of Delaware; and _provided
further_ that if neither the Delaware Court of Chancery nor the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware has jurisdiction over such
Action, such Action shall be heard and determined in the Superior Court of the
State of Delaware. Consistent with the preceding sentence, each of the Parties
hereby (i) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the
purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by
any Party; (ii) agrees that service of process will be validly effected by
sending notice in accordance with _Section 9.02_; and (iii) irrevocably
waives and agrees not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in
any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the
jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is 

 



65  exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in
an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this
Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by any of the above
named courts. Process in any such Action may be served on any Party anywhere
in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court.
Without limiting the foregoing, each Party agrees that service of process on
such Party as provided in _Section 9.02_ shall be deemed effective service of
process on such Party.

OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER
AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND
THE TRANSACTIONS, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS

Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented, but only pursuant to an

Party or Parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
failure or delay of any Party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement
or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any right under this Agreement preclude any
other or further exercise of any rights hereunder.

SECTION 9.14 Company Disclosure Schedule. The Parties agree that any
reference in a particular Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed to be disclosed and incorporated by reference in each other Section of
the Company Disclosure Schedule to which such information reasonably relates
as though fully set forth in such other Section to the extent the
applicability and relevance of such information to such other Section is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure. Certain items and matters
may be listed in the Company Disclosure Schedule for informational purposes
only and may not be required to be listed therein

 



66  by the terms of this Agreement. In no event shall the listing of items or
matters in the Company Disclosure Schedule be deemed or interpreted to
broaden, or otherwise expand the scope of, the representations and warranties
or covenants contained in this Agreement. The mere inclusion of an item in the
Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty
(x) shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material
exception or material event, circumstance, change, effect, development or
condition or that such item would constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect
and (y) shall not be construed as an admission by the Company of any non-
compliance with, or violation of, any third party rights (including any
Intellectual Property rights) or any Law or Order of any Governmental
Authority, such disclosures having been made solely for the purposes of
creating exceptions to the representations and warranties made herein or of
disclosing any information required to be disclosed under this Agreement.
Without limiting the foregoing, no reference to or disclosure of a possible
breach or violation of any Contract, Law or Order shall be construed as an
admission or indication that a breach or violation exists or has actually
occurred.

SECTION 9.15 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission or other means of electronic
transmission, such as by electronic mail in "pdf" form) in counterparts, and
by the different Parties in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER

 

Capitalized terms used in this _Annex I_ and not defined in this _Annex I_
shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Agreement and Plan of
Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_ ") of which this _Annex I_ is a part.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer and in addition to
Purchasers rights to extend, amend or terminate the Offer in accordance with
the provisions of the Merger Agreement and applicable Law, Purchaser shall not
be required to accept for payment any validly tendered Shares and may delay
the acceptance for payment of any validly tendered Shares, if:

(a) the number of Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant
to the Offer, together with the number of Shares (if any) then beneficially
owned by Parent or Purchaser, in the aggregate, or with respect to which
Parent or Purchaser otherwise has, directly or indirectly, sole voting power,
does not equal at least one Share more than 50% of the Fully Diluted Shares
(excluding from the number of tendered Shares, but not from the outstanding
Shares, Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have
not yet been "received" (as such term is defined in Section 251(h)(6)(f) of
the DGCL)) (the " _Minimum Condition_ ");

 

(b) any waiting period under the HSR Act (and any extensions thereof)
applicable to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer and
the consummation of the Merger shall not have expired or been terminated, and
all applicable waiting periods under any other applicable Antitrust Laws shall
not have expired or been terminated and all applicable consents or approvals
required under any other applicable Antitrust Laws shall not have been
obtained;

(c) at any time on or after the Agreement Date and prior to the
Expiration Date, any of the following conditions have occurred and are
continuing at the Expiration Date:

(i) any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction in a Specified
Jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any
decision, injunction, decree, ruling, Law or Order that is in effect and has
the effect of making the Offer or the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting
the consummation of the Offer and the Merger;

(ii) (A) any representation or warranty of the Company contained in _Section
3.01(a)_, _Section 3.02_, _Section 3.04_, _Section 3.09(a)_, or _Section
3.24_ of the Merger Agreement shall fail to be true and correct as of
the Expiration Date (except to the extent such representation or warranty is
expressly made as of a particular date, in which case on and as of such date),
(B) any representation or warranty of the Company contained in _Section
3.03(b)_ or _Section 3.03(c)_ of the Merger Agreement shall fail to be true
and correct as of the Expiration Date (except to the extent such
representation or warranty is expressly made as of a particular date, in which
case on and as of such date), except for _de minimis_ deviations, or (C) any
other representation or warranty of the Company contained in the Merger
Agreement shall fail to be true and correct (without giving effect to any
qualifications as to "materiality" or "Company Material Adverse

 



1  Effect" set forth therein) as of the Expiration Date (except to the extent
such representation or warranty is expressly made as of a particular date, in
which case on and as of such date), except where the failure of such
representation or warranty of the Company to be so true and correct,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to result in, a Company Material Adverse Effect;

 

(iii) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform, in any material
respect, any obligation, agreement or covenant of the Company to be performed
or complied with by it under the Merger Agreement;

(iv) there shall have occurred since the Agreement Date a Company Material
Adverse Effect;

(v) Parent and Purchaser shall have failed to receive a certificate executed
by the Companys Chief Executive Officer or President on behalf of the
Company, dated as of the Expiration Date, to the effect that the conditions
set forth in paragraphs (c)(ii), (c)(iii) and (c)(iv) of this _Annex I_ have
not occurred; or

(vi) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its
terms.

 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Purchaser and
may be asserted by Parent or Purchaser regardless of the circumstances giving
rise to any such conditions and may be waived in writing (as permitted by
applicable Law) by Parent or Purchaser (except for the Minimum Condition) in
whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole
discretion, in each case subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement. Any
reference in this _Annex I_ or the Merger Agreement to a condition or
requirement being satisfied shall be deemed to be satisfied if such condition
or requirement is so waived in writing (where permitted by applicable Law).
