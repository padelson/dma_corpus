 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION

This Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (this "Agreement"), dated
as of November 25, 2015 (the "Execution Date"), is by and among Computer
Programs and Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), HHI Merger Sub
I, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
("Merger Sub"), HHI Merger Sub II, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Successor Sub"), Healthland Holding Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and AHR Holdings, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company, solely in its capacity as the representative of the
Company Securityholders (the "Securityholder Representative").

RECITALS

A. The respective Board of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub, Successor Sub and
the Company have each determined that it is advisable and in the best
interests of their respective corporations and their respective stockholders
for Parent to acquire the Company pursuant to a plan and series of integrated
transactions whereby (i) Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company (the
"First Step Merger") with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation
in the First Step Merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the
"First Step Surviving Corporation") and (ii) immediately after the First Step
Merger, the First Step Surviving Corporation shall merge with and into
Successor Sub (the "Second Step Merger" and, together with the First Step
Merger, the "Integrated Mergers") with Successor Sub continuing as the
surviving entity in the Second Step Merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent (the "Surviving Entity"), upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein.

B. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Integrated
Mergers shall be treated as a single integrated transaction, as described in
Revenue Ruling 2001‑46, 2001‑2 C.B. 321, and shall qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

C. The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board") has (i)
approved this Agreement, the Integrated Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the "Transactions"), and (ii)
determined, subject to the terms of this Agreement, to recommend that the
Company Stockholders adopt and approve this Agreement and approve the
Integrated Mergers.

D. As an inducement to Parent entering into this Agreement, each of the
Principal Stockholder, Francisco Partners II, L.P. and Francisco Partners
Parallel Fund II, L.P. is entering into a Support Agreement substantially in
the form of Exhibit B (the "Support Agreement") simultaneously with the
execution of this Agreement.

E. As an inducement to Parent entering into this agreement, promptly following
the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall obtain the irrevocable
adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Integrated Mergers pursuant to
an Action by Written Consent (the "Stockholder Written Consent") signed by the
Principal Stockholder, which shall constitute the Company Stockholder AGREEMENT

The Parties, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the First
Step Merger Effective Time and as part of an integrated transaction and plan
of merger with the Second Step Merger, the First Step Merger shall be
consummated, whereby Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company,
whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the

to be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware pending consummation of
the Second Step Merger.

Section 2.2 The Second Step Merger. Immediately following the First Step

Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Second Step Merger
Effective Time, the Second Step Merger shall be consummated, whereby the First
Step Surviving Corporation shall be merged with and into Successor Sub,
whereupon the separate corporate of the First Step Surviving Corporation shall
cease, and the Successor Sub shall continue its corporate existence as the

Step Merger other than the completion of the First Step Merger.

Section 2.3 Closing; First Step Merger Effective Time; Second Step Merger
Effective Time. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Parties shall
cause (i) the First Step Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of
merger (the "First Step Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL
(the time specified in the First Step Certificate of Merger being the "First
Step Merger Effective Time") and (ii) the Second Step Merger to be consummated
by filing a certificate of merger (the "Second Step Certificate of Merger")
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the

as practicable on or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
each of the Parties, but in any event, no later than three (3) Business Days

been satisfied or waived (other than conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied on the Closing Date, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (if
legally permissible) of such conditions) or at such other time, date and
location as the Parties hereto agree in writing (the "Closing"). The Second
Step Merger Effective Time will occur immediately after the First Step Merger
Effective Time. Unless the context otherwise requires, the term "Agreement" as used
herein refers collectively to this Agreement (as the same may be amended from
time to time in accordance with the terms hereof), the First Step Certificate

case, the satisfaction or waiver (if legally permissible) of the conditions to
the Closing set forth in Article VII (other than conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied on the Closing Date, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver (if legally permissible) of such conditions). All
Transactions that are to occur on and as of the Closing Date are to be deemed
to have occurred simultaneously as of the Closing, except with respect to the

the First Step Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the First Step Merger and
without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of
any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

(i) Conversion of Company Capital Stock:

(A) each share of Series A Preferred Stock (other than any Series A Preferred
Stock to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.8(i)(ii)) will be cancelled and
extinguished and be converted automatically into the right to receive the Per
Share Cash Liquidation Preference and the Per Share Stock Liquidation
Preference; and

(B) each share of Company Common Stock (other than any Company Common Stock to
be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.8(i)(ii) and other than with respect to
Dissenting Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Step
Merger Effective Time will be converted automatically into the right to
receive the Per Share Common Cash Consideration and the Per Share Common Stock
Consideration.

(ii) Cancellation of Treasury Shares. Each share of Company Capital Stock held
by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly‑owned Subsidiary of the
Company immediately prior to the First Step Merger Effective Time shall be
cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and without payment
of any cash consideration.

(iii) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the First Step Merger Effective Time shall be
converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the First Step Surviving
Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the First Step Merger Effective
Time shall evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the First
Step Surviving Corporation.

(iv) No Restrictions. Nothing in this Section 2.8 shall be construed to limit
any restrictions that may arise under other provisions of this Agreement on
actions of any Company Entity or the Company Stockholders that would cause any
change in the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock on or after the
Execution Date, including as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split), merger,
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, subdivision or other similar
transaction, or any stock dividend thereon.

(v) Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares
of CPSI Common Stock will be issued upon the surrender for exchange of shares
of Company Capital Stock, but in lieu thereof each holder of Company Capital
Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of CPSI Common
Stock upon surrender for exchange of Company Capital Stock (after aggregating
all fractional shares of CPSI Common Stock to be received by such holder)
shall receive an amount of cash (rounded up to the nearest whole cent),
without interest, equal to the product of such fraction and the CPSI Share
Price. Payment shall occur as soon as practicable after the determination of
the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to each former holder of Company
Capital Stock with respect to any fractional shares and following compliance
with the surrender and payment procedures set forth in Section 2.10 and in the
Letter of Transmittal. No dividend or distribution with respect to CPSI Common
Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional shares and such
fractional share interest shall not entitle the owner thereof to any rights of
a stockholder of Parent.

(b) Effect of the Second Step Merger on the Capital Stock of the First Step
Surviving Corporation. At the Second Step Merger Effective Time, by virtue of
the Second Step Merger and without any action on the part of the First Step
Surviving Corporation or Successor Sub, (i) each share of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of Successor Sub issued and outstanding immediately

common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Entity, and (ii)
each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the First Step
Surviving Corporation shall be cancelled and shall not be converted into
shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Entity.
Immediately after the completion of the Second Step Merger, Parent shall own
all of the issued and outstanding common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
the Surviving Entity.

Section 2.9 Vested Company Stock Options.

(a) Vested Company Stock Options. At the First Step Merger Effective Time,
each Vested Company Stock Option shall be converted into and become (A) a
right to receive, for each share of Company Common Stock covered by the Vested
Company Stock Option, a cash payment equal to the Per Share Common Cash
Consideration minus the product of (i) the Cash Ratio multiplied by (ii) the
per share exercise price of the Vested Company Stock Option (such payment, the
"Option Cash Payment"), and (B) an option with respect to CPSI Common Stock
(each such option covering shares of CPSI Common Stock, an "Assumed Option").
Each Assumed Option shall have terms and conditions identical to the terms and
conditions of the related Vested Company Stock Option except that: (i) Parent
and its compensation committee (the "Parent Compensation Committee") shall be
substituted for the Company and the Company Board with respect to
administration of the Assumed Options; (ii) each Assumed Option may be
exercised solely for shares of CPSI Common Stock; (iii) the number of shares
of CPSI Common Stock subject to an Assumed Option shall be equal to (x) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the related Vested Company
Stock Option immediately prior to the First Step Merger Effective Time
multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio, and rounding down to the nearest whole
share; and (iv) the per share exercise price of an Assumed Option shall be
equal to (x) (A) the per share exercise price under the related Vested Company
Stock Option multiplied by (B) the Stock Ratio divided by (y) the Exchange
Ratio, and rounding up to the nearest whole cent. The shares of CPSI Common
Stock covered by Assumed Options shall be covered by an active Form S‑8
Registration Statement effective no later than immediately following the First Step Merger Effective
Time. Option Cash Payments shall be delivered to the applicable holder of
Company Options through payroll no later than the second regularly scheduled
Company payroll date following the Closing Date.

(b) Unvested Options. At the First Step Merger Effective Time, each Unvested
Company Stock Option shall be cancelled and terminated for no consideration.

Section 2.10 Exchange of Certificates.

(a) Designation of Exchange Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund. The Parties agree
to appoint the Exchange Agent for the purpose of distributing the portion of
the Cash Consideration and the Transaction Shares payable to the holders of
Company Capital Stock. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit (from and after the First
Step Merger Effective Time) of the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock,
for distribution and exchange, in accordance with this Section 2.10, the
Exchange Agent Agreement and the Letter of Transmittal, through the Exchange
Agent, (i) certificated and legended (with the legend set forth in Section
2.10(vii)) shares representing the Transaction Shares, minus a number of
Transaction Shares equal to the Escrow Shares, in each case, issuable to the
holders of Company Capital Stock, and (ii) cash sufficient to pay the
Estimated Cash Consideration, minus an amount of cash equal to the Escrow Cash
and the Representative Expense Fund, in each case, payable to the holders of
Company Capital Stock. All Transaction Shares and cash deposited with the
Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 2.10(i) shall herewith be referred to
as the "Exchange Fund."

(b) Prior to the First Step Merger Effective Time, the Company shall send, or
at the Company's request, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to promptly
send, to each Person who was, immediately prior to the First Step Merger
Effective Time, a holder of record of shares of Company Capital Stock entitled
to receive distribution of a portion of the Cash Consideration and the
Transaction Shares a customary letter of transmittal in the form mutually
agreed to by Parent and the Securityholder Representative (the "Letter of
Transmittal") and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the certificates representing the shares of Company Capital Stock
("Certificates") to the Exchange Agent) for use in such payment.

(c) If any portion of the Exchange Fund is to be distributed to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it
shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii)
the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.

(d) The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed immediately upon
the First Step Merger Effective Time and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Capital Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the First Step Merger Effective Time
thereafter on the records of the Company. If, after the First Step Merger
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange
Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and converted into the right to
receive only the portion of the Cash Consideration and Transaction Shares
provided for the shares of Company Capital Stock represented by such
Certificates, and in accordance with and subject to the procedures set forth,
in this Article II.

(e) Any portion of the Cash Consideration or the Transaction Shares made
available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 2.10 that remains
unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock twelve (12) months
after the First Step Merger Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or
otherwise on the instruction of Parent, and any such holder who has not
exchanged shares of Company Capital Stock for a portion of the Cash
Consideration and Transaction Shares provided for such shares of Company
Capital Stock in accordance with this Section 2.10 prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to Parent for distribution of such portion of Cash
Consideration and Transaction Shares, in respect of such shares without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to
any holder of shares of Company Capital Stock for any amounts paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Legal
Requirements. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company
Capital Stock immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to
the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the property of Parent
free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

(f) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to the
Transaction Shares with a record date after the First Step Merger Effective
Time, and no payment in lieu of fractional shares, will be paid to the holders
of any unsurrendered Certificates with respect to the Transaction Shares
issuable upon surrender thereof until the holder of such Certificates shall
surrender such Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.10,
the Exchange Agent Agreement and the Letter of Transmittal.

(g) The certificates representing the Transaction Shares to be issued and
delivered hereunder shall bear the following legend:

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY
STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION. THEY MAY NOT BE SOLD OR OFFERED FOR SALE IN THE
ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT AS TO THE SECURITIES UNDER SUCH
ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION OR
AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH ACT AND SUCH LAWS. THE ISSUER
OF THESE SHARES MAY REQUIRE AN OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO
THE ISSUER THAT SUCH OFFER, SALE OR OTHER TRANSFER OTHERWISE COMPLIES WITH THE
SECURITIES ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OR OTHER
JURISDICTION." In the event that any such Transaction Shares cease to be Restricted Shares,
Parent shall, upon the written request of the holder thereof, issue or cause
to be issued to such holder a new certificate representing such Transaction
Shares without the legend required by the foregoing.

(h) Subject to the terms and conditions of the Investor Agreement, during the
time that any such Transaction Shares are Restricted Shares, a holder of such
shares shall not transfer (including through a distribution in kind to any
limited partners of such holder or otherwise to any Beneficial Owner) such
Transaction Shares without first delivering to Parent a written opinion of
counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, delivered by
a nationally recognized counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent, that such
transfer is being effected in a transaction exempt from registration under the
Securities Act and otherwise complies with any applicable securities Legal
Requirements of any state or other jurisdiction. Any transferee of a holder of
Transaction Shares acquired hereby shall take such Transaction Shares subject
to the restrictions set forth herein.

(i) Upon the later of the First Step Merger Effective Time and surrender of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with a Letter of Transmittal duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required by the Letter of Transmittal or pursuant to the
instructions thereto (the "Required Documentation"), the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent
shall instruct the Exchange Agent to distribute in exchange therefor as
promptly as practicable after delivery by the holder of the Required
Documentation, the portion of the Cash Consideration and Transaction Shares
such Certificate is converted into pursuant to the provisions of Section
2.8(a)(i), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the Principal Stockholder provides the Exchange
Agent the Required Documentation no later than the close of business on the
date one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to distribute in exchange for such Certificate the Cash
Consideration and Transaction Shares distributable in exchange for such
Certificate pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Except with respect to
Dissenting Shares, until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.10,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the First Step Merger
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
portion of the Cash Consideration and Transaction Shares into which the shares
of Company Capital Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate have been
converted pursuant to Section 2.8(i)(i). No interest shall be paid or accrue
on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

(j) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent or, after the Second Step Merger Effective Time, the
Surviving Entity; provided, that (i) no such investment shall relieve Parent
or the Exchange Agent from making the payments required by this Section 2.10,
and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the
Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company Capital Stock in the
amount of such losses, (ii) no such investment shall have maturities that
could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement and
(iii) such investments shall be in short‑term obligations of the United States
of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by
the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States of America. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be payable to the
Surviving Entity or Parent, as directed by Parent.

(k) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the portion of the
Cash Consideration and Transaction Shares to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this Section 2.10.

Section 2.11 Dissenting Shares.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Capital Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the First Step
Merger Effective Time and that are held by Company Stockholders who shall have
not voted in favor of the Integrated Mergers and who shall have demanded
properly in writing appraisal for such shares of Company Capital Stock in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the "Dissenting
Shares") shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the
consideration distributable in respect of such shares in accordance with
Section 2.8. Such Company Stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of
the appraised value of such shares of Company Capital Stock by them in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all
Dissenting Shares held by Company Stockholders who shall have failed to
perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to
appraisal of such shares of Company Capital Stock under such Section 262 of
the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have
become exchangeable for, as of the First Step Merger Effective Time, the right
to receive the consideration distributable in respect of such shares in
accordance with Section 2.8(a)(i), without any interest thereon, upon
surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.10.

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii)
the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

Section 2.12 Payments at Closing.

(a) At the Closing, Parent shall:

(i) deposit with the Exchange Agent (A) the Estimated Cash Consideration,

books and records used in preparing the Estimated Closing Statement.

(b) As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Securityholder
Representative a statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth Parent's
good faith calculation of (i) Net Working Capital, (ii) Closing Cash, (iii)
Closing Indebtedness, (iv) Closing Transaction Expenses, and (v) Final Cash
Consideration. During the thirty (30) day period immediately following the
delivery of the Closing Statement by Parent to the Securityholder
Representative (the "Objection Period"), Parent shall provide the
Securityholder Representative and its Representatives with a reasonable
opportunity, in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the
businesses and operations of Parent and its Affiliates (including the Company
Entities), to review any books and records used in preparing the Closing
Statement.

(c) If, prior to 11:59 p.m. (Central Time) on the last day of the Objection
Period (the "Objection Deadline"), the Securityholder Representative has not
given Parent written notice of any good faith objection to the Closing
Statement or any component thereof specifying in reasonable detail the nature
and basis of such objection, as well as the specific matters in dispute (the
"Disputed Matters") and the amount of any proposed adjustments (an "Objection
Notice"), then the Closing Statement and all components thereof are to be
deemed final and are to be binding and conclusive on the Parties for all
purposes under this Agreement and not subject to further dispute or challenge.

(d) If, prior to the Objection Deadline, the Securityholder Representative has
given Parent an Objection Notice, then Parent and the Securityholder
Representative shall in good faith attempt to resolve the Disputed Matters
(and, for avoidance of doubt, all other matters with respect to, and all other
components of, the Closing Statement are to be binding and conclusive on the
Parties for all purposes under this Agreement and not subject to further
dispute or challenge). If Parent and the Securityholder Representative fail to
resolve all of the Disputed Matters within thirty (30) days following Parent's
receipt of such Objection Notice, then Parent and the Securityholder
Representative shall submit the Disputed Matters remaining in dispute (and
only such Disputed Matters, as all other matters with respect to, and all
other components of, the Closing Statement (including those Disputed Matters
resolved by Parent and the Securityholder Representative in accordance with
the immediately preceding sentence) are to be binding and conclusive on the
Parties for all purposes under this Agreement and not subject to further
dispute or challenge) to the Independent Accounting Firm for resolution in
accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement. If
Disputed Matters are submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm for
resolution in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, (i) Parent
and the Securityholder Representative shall furnish, or cause to be furnished,
to the Independent Accounting Firm such work papers and other documents and
information relating to such Disputed Matters as the Independent Accounting
Firm requests and as are available to such Party or such Party's
Representatives and Parent and the Securityholder Representative are to be
afforded the opportunity to present to the Independent Accounting Firm any
material relating to such Disputed Matters, (ii) Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall instruct the
Independent Accounting Firm to deliver the Independent Accounting Firm's
determination in a written notice to Parent and the Securityholder
Representative within thirty (30) days of the submission to the Independent
Accounting Firm of such Disputed Matters, and such determination is to be
final, binding and conclusive on the Parties for all purposes under this
Agreement and not subject to further dispute or challenge and is to be used in
the calculation of the Final Net Working Capital and the determination of the
Final Closing Cash, Final Closing Indebtedness and Final Closing Transaction
Expenses, as applicable, and (iii) the fees and expenses of the Independent
Accounting Firm are to be allocated and payable by Parent, on the one hand,
and the Company Securityholders, on the other hand, in proportion to the
amounts by which the proposals of Parent and the Securityholder
Representative, respectively, differed from the Independent Accounting Firm's
final determination of such Disputed Matters, and Parent and the
Securityholder Representative shall instruct the Independent Accounting Firm
to determine such proportions in the Independent Accounting Firm's final
determination; provided, however, that the fees and expenses owed to the
Independent Accounting Firm by the Company Securityholders shall be paid
through the release to Parent of cash from the Representative Expense Fund by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by
Parent; provided further, if the then current balance of the Representative
Expense Fund is insufficient to cover the entire amount payable to Parent
pursuant to this Section 2.14(v), then the Principal Stockholder shall
promptly pay the unpaid portion of such amount by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account designated by Parent.

(e) If the Final Cash Consideration exceeds the Estimated Cash Consideration,
then, within two (2) Business Days of the final determination of the Final
Cash Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.14, Parent shall pay to
the Exchange Agent, on behalf of the Company Securityholders, an amount in
cash equal to such excess by wire transfer of immediately available funds and
the Exchange Agent shall pay such amount to the Company Securityholders, in
accordance with each Company Securityholder's Pro Rata Share. If the Estimated
Cash Consideration exceeds the Final Cash Consideration, then, within two (2)
Business Days of the final determination of the Final Cash Consideration in
accordance with this Section 2.14, the Securityholder Representative shall
release from the Representative Expense Fund by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account designated by Parent an amount in cash equal to
the amount by which Estimated Cash Consideration exceeds the Final Cash
Consideration; provided, however, if the then current balance of the
Representative Expense Fund is insufficient to cover the entire amount payable
to Parent pursuant to this Section 2.14(v), then the Principal Stockholder
shall promptly pay the unpaid portion of such amount by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated by Parent.

(f) The Estimated Closing Statement and the Closing Statement, as well as all
estimates, calculations and determinations therein, are to be prepared and
calculated on a consolidated basis for the Company Entities using the
accounting principles, practices, classifications, procedures, policies and
methods set forth on Annex A (the "Accounting Principles"). An example
calculation of Net Working Capital using the Accounting Principles is also set
forth on Annex A (the "Form Working Capital Statement"). (g) The Parties shall treat each payment made under this Section 2.14 as an
adjustment to the Aggregate Merger Consideration for Tax purposes, unless (i)
a final determination (which includes the execution of a Form 870‑AD or
successor form) with respect to any such payment causes such payment not to be
treated as an adjustment to the Aggregate Merger Consideration for Tax
purposes or (ii) as otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements.

Section 2.15 Tax Withholding. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Parent is entitled to deduct and withhold from any portion of
the Option Cash Payment or other payment payable by Parent to a holder of
Company Options pursuant to this Agreement such amounts that are required to
be deducted and withheld under the Code or any other Legal Requirement with
respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted and withheld, such amounts are to be deemed for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding were made.

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THE COMPANY

Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company represents

licensed to do business and is in good standing in all jurisdictions where the

Entities is qualified and licensed to do business is set forth on Schedule
3.1(a) to the Company Disclosure Letter.

(b) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 44,129,781 shares

Section 3.2 Authority; No Conflict.

(a) This Agreement has been duly and validly executed by the Company, and this

of each of the documents and instruments to be delivered by the Company at the
Closing pursuant to Section 2.13(a) (collectively, the "Company Closing

authorization, execution and delivery by the other party or Parties thereto, if applicable) will

the requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and
the Company Closing Documents to which it is a party and to perform its

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents by the Company nor the consummation or performance of
any of the Transactions by the Company will, directly or indirectly, (i)
contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any provision

be construed to require, Parent, Merger Sub, Successor Sub or any of their
Affiliates to (and the Company shall not, and the Company shall cause each of
the other Company Entities not to, without the prior written consent of
Parent, Merger Sub and Successor Sub (such consent to be given in Parent's,
Merger Sub's and Successor Sub's sole discretion)) agree to (i) any sale,

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Debt Financing
on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitment,

waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger
Sub in the Debt Financing Commitment, (iii) enter into definitive agreements
with respect thereto on terms and conditions not less favorable to Parent and
Merger Sub with respect to conditions than the terms and conditions (including
the flex provisions) contained in the Debt Financing Commitment, subject to
any amendments, supplements or modifications thereto permitted by Section
5.8(ii) (the "Definitive Agreements"), (iv) consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing
and (v) if all conditions contained in the Debt Financing Commitment have been
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied by actions to be taken at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), enforce its rights contained in
the Debt Financing Commitment or cause the Lenders to comply with their
respective obligations to fund on the Closing Date the Debt Financing required
to consummate the Transactions (provided, that nothing in the foregoing shall
require Parent to initiate or pursue any action, suit or proceeding against
any Debt Financing Source). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent shall give the Company prompt notice: (A) of any material breach or
default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or
default) by any party to any Debt Financing Commitment or Definitive Agreement
of which Parent becomes aware or (B) of the receipt of any written notice or
other written communication from any Person with respect to any (1) actual or
potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any Debt
Financing Commitment or any Definitive Agreement related to the Debt Financing
or any provisions of the Debt Financing Commitment or any Definitive Agreement
or (2) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any
Debt Financing Commitment or any Definitive Agreement, that, in each case,

Parent shall provide any information available to it that is reasonably
requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause
(A) or (B) of the immediately preceding sentence.

(b) Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of Company: (A) permit
any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy
under, the Debt Financing Commitment (subject to the "flex" provisions thereof
as in effect on the Execution Date) if such amendment, modification, waiver or
remedy (w) adds new (or adversely modifies any existing) conditions to the
consummation of all or any portion of the Debt Financing, (x) reduces the
amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be
paid in respect of the Debt Financing or original issue discount in respect of
the Debt Financing), (y) adversely affects the ability of Parent to enforce
its rights against other parties to the Debt Financing Commitment as so
amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, relative to the ability
of Parent to enforce its rights against such other parties to the Debt
Financing Commitment as in effect on the Execution Date or (z) would otherwise
reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement (provided that, for the avoidance
of doubt, Parent may amend the Debt Financing Commitment Debt to add lenders,
lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have
not executed the Debt Financing Commitment as of the Execution Date if the
addition of such additional parties, individually or in the aggregate, does
not add new (or adversely modify any existing) conditions to the consummation
of the Debt Financing). For purposes of this Agreement, references to "Debt
Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitment as permitted to be amended, supplemented, modified, waived or
replaced by this Section 5.8(b) and provided, further, any reference herein to
"Debt Financing" shall include any alternative mezzanine debt financing or
bank financing used to finance, in whole or in part, the Transaction (but in
no event shall any such alternative financing extend, toll or otherwise affect
the Marketing Period). Parent shall deliver to Company copies of any such
amendment, modification, waiver or replacement promptly after its execution
and delivery. (c) [Reserved]

(d) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall, and the Company shall cause
each of the other Company Entities and all of their respective Representatives
to, at Parent's sole expense, provide such cooperation (including with respect
to timeliness) in connection with the Debt Financing as reasonably requested
in writing by Parent or any of its Representatives, including:

(i) assisting in preparation for and participation in marketing efforts
(including a reasonable number of lender meetings and calls), drafting
sessions, rating agency presentations, road shows and due diligence sessions
(including accounting due diligence sessions) and sessions with prospective
lenders and ratings agencies;

(ii) assisting Parent and the Debt Financing Sources in the preparation of
customary offering documents, bank information memoranda and similar marketing
documents for the Debt Financing;

(iii) (A) as promptly as reasonably practicable furnishing Parent and the Debt

the Company Entities as of and for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2014,
(2) the unaudited consolidated balance sheets, income statements, and cash
flow statements of the Company Entities as of and for the fiscal quarter
ending September 30, 2015 and, if later, for the most recent fiscal quarter

information that is customarily provided by a target included in or necessary
for the preparation of Required Marketing Materials (as defined in the Debt
Financing Commitment) and reasonably requested by the Parent on or before the
date that is two (2) days after Execution Date) (Section 3.8(d)(i), (ii) and
(iii), collectively, the "Required Information") and (B) periodically updating
any Required Information provided to Parent as may be necessary so that such
Required Information is (x) Compliant and (y) meets the applicable
requirements set forth in the definition of "Required Information";

(iv) using reasonable best efforts to provide historical and background
information related to the Company Entities available to Company to Parent in
connection with the preparation by the Parent of pro forma financial
information and financial statements to the extent required by SEC rules and

contrary, neither the Company Entities nor any of their respective
Representatives shall be responsible in any manner for information relating to
the proposed debt or equity capitalization that is required for such pro forma
financial information or in respect of any such pro forma financial
information, providing any information other than available historical and
background information related to the Company Entities;

(v) assisting Parent with any guaranty documents, pledge and security
documents, other definitive financing documents, or other certificates,
customary (e.g., local counsel) legal opinions or documents as may be
reasonably requested by Parent and otherwise facilitating the guarantying of
the Debt Financing by any Company Entity or pledging of collateral by any
Company Entity (including (x) cooperation in connection with the pay-off of existing Indebtedness to the extent contemplated by this
Agreement and the release of related Encumbrances and termination of security
interests, including obtaining mutually acceptable payoff letters, lien
releases and instruments of discharge or releases to be delivered at the
Closing and (y) cooperation in connection with Parent's efforts to obtain any
required environmental assessments and title insurance in connection with the
Debt Financing); and

(vi) providing at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date all
documentation and other information as is required by applicable "know your
customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations including the USA
PATRIOT Act to the extent requested at least five (5) Business Days prior to
the anticipated Closing Date.

(e) Solely in connection with any offering materials, bank information
memoranda and other customary marketing materials related to the syndication
of the Debt Financing (to the extent the Debt Financing is syndicated), the
Company hereby consents, and shall cause each of the other Company Entities to
consent, to the use of their logos, trademarks and service Marks; provided
that such logos, trademarks and service Marks are used solely in a manner that
is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company
Entities or any of their Affiliates or their reputation or goodwill. The
Company (and the Company shall cause each of the Company Entities to) hereby
further authorizes the Lender to download copies of the Company's and each of
the Company Entities' logos from their respective websites and post copies
thereof on SyndTrak® or similar workspace and use the logos on any
confidential information memoranda, presentations and other marketing
materials prepared in connection with the syndication of the Debt Financing.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.8, (i) none of
the Company Entities or any of their Affiliates will be required to pay any
commitment or other similar fee in connection with the financing contemplated
by the Debt Financing or make any other payment or provide or agree to provide
any indemnity in connection with the Debt Financing or any of the foregoing,
(ii) no obligation of the Company Entities or any of their Representatives
shall be effective until the Closing, (iii) none of the Company Entities or
any of their Affiliates or respective Representatives shall be required (A) to
take any actions to the extent such actions would interfere in any material
respect with the ongoing business or operations of the Company Entities, or
(B) take any action that would conflict with or violate any Governance
Documents or Constitutive Documents of the Company Entities or any applicable
Law. None of the Company, its Affiliates or any Persons that are directors or
managers of the Company or their Affiliates shall be required to pass any
resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the Debt Financing. Parent
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company Entities and their respective
Representatives and Affiliates from and against, and shall pay and reimburse
the Company Entities and their respective Representatives and Affiliates for,
any and all losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, any of them in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing, any action taken by
them at the request of the Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Section 5.8,
and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than written
information provided by the Company Entities and their respective
Representatives). (g) If Company at any time in good faith believes that it has delivered the
Required Information in accordance with Section 5.8(iv)(iii), it may (but is
under no obligation to) deliver to Parent a written notice to such effect, in
which case the Company shall be deemed to have delivered the Required
Information unless Parent in good faith reasonably believes the Company has
not completed the delivery of the Required Information and delivers to the
Company within two (2) Business Days a written notice describing in reasonable
detail what information that constitutes Required Information has not yet been
delivered.

(h) Parent acknowledges and agrees that in no event shall the obtaining of the
Debt Financing by the Parent or any of its Affiliates be a condition to the
Closing or any of the Parent's other obligations under this Agreement.

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the First Step Merger Effective Time,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity to, indemnify and hold
harmless all current and former directors and officers of the Company Entities
(each, an "Indemnitee") against any claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, fines, fees, costs or expenses, including reasonable attorneys'
fees and disbursements incurred in connection with any Proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining
to the fact that the Indemnitee is or was a director or officer of the Company
Entities, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the First Step
Merger Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the applicable Company
Entity, or Parent, as the case may be, would have been permitted, under the
DGCL, indemnification agreements existing on the Execution Date or the
Governance Documents or the Constitutive Documents of such Company Entity in
effect on the Execution Date, to indemnify such Indemnitee (and the Surviving
Entity shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted
under the DGCL, indemnification agreements existing on the Execution Date or
the Governance Documents or the Constitutive Documents of such Company Entity
in effect on the Execution Date).

(b) At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase a "tail" policy or
policies providing extended reporting period coverage under the existing
directors' and officers' insurance policies for the Company Entities (the
"Tail Policy") covering claims asserted within six (6) years after the Closing
Date arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Closing
(including consummation of the Transactions) and the premium for the Tail
Policy is to be a Transaction Expense. The Tail Policy (or endorsements
thereto) is to name as insured thereunder all current and former directors,
managers and officers of the Company Entities.

(c) For a period of six (6) years following the Closing Date, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Company Entities to, maintain in effect in the
Constitutive Documents and/or Governance Documents of the Company Entities
provisions with respect to limitation of liability and indemnification of
current or former directors, managers, officers and employees and the
advancement of expenses incurred substantially similar to those contained in
the Constitutive Documents and/or Governance Documents, as applicable,
immediately prior to the Closing, except as otherwise required by applicable
Legal Requirements. (d) The provisions of this Section 5.9 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee and each party entitled to
insurance coverage under this Section 5.9, respectively, and his or her heirs
and legal representatives, which shall be deemed as third party beneficiaries
under this Agreement, and shall be in addition to, and shall not impair, any
other rights an Indemnitee may have under the Constitutive Documents and/or
Governance Documents of the Surviving Entity or any of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, under applicable Legal Requirements or indemnification agreements
existing on the Execution Date. Parent shall ensure that the Surviving
Corporation complies with all of its obligations under this Section 5.9 and
Parent hereby guaranties all such obligations of the Surviving Entity under
this Section 5.9. If Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or mergers into any Person and is

shall cause each of the other Company Entities to, terminate those Benefit
Plans, Insurance Policies (or replacement Insurance Policies) and Contracts

deliver to the Company Stockholders that did not execute the Stockholder
Written Consent (a) a copy of such Stockholder Written Consent and (b) the
notice required pursuant to Section 228 of the DGCL (the "Stockholder
Notice"). Nothing contained in this Section 5.12 shall be deemed to prohibit
the Company from making any required disclosure to the Company Stockholders
if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, failure to so disclose
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Company
Stockholders under applicable Law. Section 5.13 Rycan Transaction. Immediately prior to the First Step Merger
Effective Time, the Company shall consummate and complete the Rycan
Transaction.

Section 5.14 Consideration Spreadsheet. The Company shall prepare and deliver

ARTICLE VI

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

Section 6.1 Tax Returns.

(a) Parent shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Tax Returns for the
Company Entities that are required to be filed after the Closing Date. Parent
shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, such Tax Returns consistently with the
past practice of the Company Entities in Filing their Tax Returns, except as
otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements. Parent shall provide the
Securityholder Representative with a draft of any Tax Return (including
relevant work papers) that relates to a Pre‑Closing Tax Period (including a
Straddle Period) at least twenty (20) days prior to the due date for the
Filing of such Tax Return. Subject to the immediately following sentence,
Parent shall permit the Securityholder Representative to review, comment on
and approve in writing (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) each such Tax Return prior to finalizing such Tax Return. Subject to Article VIII, including
Section 8.2(d), Parent shall timely file, or cause to be timely filed, with
the applicable Governmental Authority, each such Tax Return.

(b) The determination of the Taxes of the Company Entities for the portion of
the Straddle Period ending on and including, and the portion of the Straddle
Period beginning after, the Closing Date is to be determined by assuming that
the Straddle Period consisted of two (2) taxable years or periods, one of
which ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other of which began at
the beginning of the day immediately following the Closing Date, and items of
income, gain, deduction, loss or credit, and any apportionment factors of the
Company Entities for the Straddle Period, are to be allocated between such two
(2) taxable years or periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming
that the books of the Company Entities were closed at the close of the Closing
Date. However, (i) exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on
an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, and (ii) periodic
Taxes, such as real and personal property Taxes, are to be apportioned ratably
between such periods on a daily basis.

(c) The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the requesting Party, in connection with the preparation and
Filing of all Tax Returns. Such cooperation shall include the retention and
(upon the other Party's request) the provision of records and information that
are reasonably relevant to any such matter and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. Parent and the Company Entities shall (i)
retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to such
entities and relating to any Pre‑Closing Tax Period until the expiration of
the statute of limitations of the relevant Pre‑Closing Tax Period (and any
extension thereof), and to abide by all record retention agreements entered
into with any Governmental Authority, and (ii) give the Securityholder
Representative written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding
any such books and records and, if the Securityholder Representative so
requests, the Company Entity and Parent shall allow the Securityholder
Representative to take possession of such books and records.

Section 6.2 Amended Tax Returns and Carrybacks. Without the prior written
consent of the Securityholder Representative, unless expressly required by
applicable Legal Requirements, Parent shall not (a) cause or permit any
amendment of any Tax Return of the Company Entities for any Pre‑Closing Tax
Period, (b) enter into any voluntary disclosure Tax program, agreement or
arrangement or (c) cause or permit any carryback of any Tax attributes from
any Post‑Closing Tax Period to any Pre‑Closing Tax Period.

Section 6.3 Tax Claims.

(a) Parent shall promptly notify the Securityholder Representative in writing
upon receipt of any notice of any pending or threatened claim, audit, notice
of deficiency, examination, assessment, or any other proceeding (collectively
a "Tax Claim") which may affect any Tax Liability for which the Company
Stockholders may be liable pursuant to Section 8.2(d).

(b) The Securityholder Representative shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to (i) represent the interests of the applicable Company Entity in
any Tax Claim relating solely to any Pre‑Closing Tax Period for which the Company Stockholders will be solely
liable and (ii) employ counsel of its choice in connection therewith;
provided, however, that with respect to any such Tax Claim, (x) Parent shall
have the right, directly or through its designated representatives, to review
in advance and comment upon all submissions made in the course of such Tax
Claim and otherwise participate in such Tax Claim and (y) to the extent that
the settlement of the Tax Claim may adversely impact the Tax Liability of
Parent or any of the Company Entities in a Post‑Closing Tax Period, such Tax
Claim shall not be settled or otherwise disposed of without obtaining the
prior written consent of Parent.

(c) Parent shall control any Tax Claim in respect of any Straddle Period and
any Post‑Closing Tax Period; provided, however, that with respect to any Tax
Claim in respect of a Straddle Period, the Securityholder Representative shall
have the right, directly or through their designated representatives, to
review in advance and comment upon all submissions made in the course of such
Tax Claim and otherwise participate at its own expense in such Tax Claim, and
none of Parent or any of its Affiliates shall settle or otherwise dispose of
any such Tax Claim without obtaining the prior written consent of the
Securityholder Representative.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Section
6.3 shall control with respect to any Tax Claim.

Section 6.4 Tax Refunds. Any refund or credit of Taxes of the Company Entities
(including interest thereon) paid with respect to any Pre‑Closing Tax Period
(a "Pre‑Closing Tax Refund"), shall be for the account of the Company
Securityholders, except to the extent that (a) such refund arises as the
result of a carryback of a loss or credit incurred by a Company Entity in a
Post‑Closing Tax Period or (b) such refund is included as an asset in the
calculation of the Final Net Working Capital. Pre‑Closing Tax Refunds shall be
paid over to the Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the Company
Securityholders), net of any reasonable, out‑of‑pocket costs and expenses to
Parent and its Affiliates (including the Company Entities) attributable to the
obtaining and receipt of such Pre‑Closing Tax Refunds. Parent shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to the Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the
Company Securityholders) any amount to which the Company Securityholders are
entitled pursuant to the foregoing sentence within fifteen (15) Business Days
of the receipt of the applicable Pre‑Closing Tax Refund by Parent, the Company
Entities or any of their respective Affiliates. To the extent any Pre‑Closing
Tax Refund is subsequently disallowed or required to be returned to the
applicable Governmental Authority, the Company shall promptly return an amount
equal to the increase in the actual cash‑tax liabilities of Parent, the
Company Entities or any of their respective Affiliates, as the case may be,
arising from such disallowance (plus any interest in respect of such amounts
owed to the applicable Governmental Authority) to Parent. At the request and
expense of the Securityholder Representative, Parent shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, cooperate in obtaining any Pre‑Closing Tax Refund that the
Securityholder Representative reasonably believes should be available,
including through Filing amended Tax Returns with the applicable Governmental
Authorities. For purposes of this Section 6.4, where it is necessary to
apportion a refund or credit between the Company Securityholders and Parent
for a Straddle Period, such refund, credit or similar benefit shall be
apportioned between Company Securityholders and Parent as provided in Section
6.1(ii). The Securityholder Representative shall distribute any such refund, credits or
similar benefits to the Company Securityholders in accordance with their Pro
Rata Shares.

Section 6.5 Transfer Taxes. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent shall timely make, or cause to be timely made, all Filings,
including Filing appropriate Tax Returns, and take, or cause to be taken, all
other actions under applicable transfer notification Legal Requirements and
all applicable Legal Requirements relating to Taxes, including Transfer Taxes,
that are required to be made or taken by any of the Company Entities in
connection with or as a result of the Transactions; provided, that Parent
shall permit the Securityholder Representative to review, comment on and
approve in writing (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) each such Filing, including Tax Returns, prior to finalizing and
Filing each such Filing, including Tax Returns. All Transfer Taxes, if any,
arising in connection with, or as a result of, the Transactions are to be
equally apportioned between, and timely paid by, Parent, on the one hand, and
the Company Securityholders (subject to the terms and conditions of Article
VIII), on the other hand, regardless of the Person on whom such Transfer Taxes
are imposed by any Legal Requirements.

Section 6.6 Tax Treatment of the Integrated Mergers. For U.S. federal income
tax purposes, it is intended that the Integrated Mergers shall be treated as a
single integrated transaction, as described in Revenue Ruling 2001‑46, 2001‑2
C.B. 321, and shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code. This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Section 1.368‑2(g) of the Treasury
Regulations. From and after the date of this Agreement and until the Second
Step Merger Effective Time, each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Integrated Mergers to qualify as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and will not knowingly take any
action, cause or permit any action to be taken, fail to take any action or
cause any action to fail to be taken which action or failure to act could
prevent the Integrated Mergers from qualifying, as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Following the Second Step Merger
Effective Time, neither the Surviving Entity, Parent nor any of their
Affiliates shall knowingly take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail
to take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken, which action or
failure to act could case the Integrated Mergers to fail to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The Parties
intend that if the Integrated Mergers do not qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, the First Step Merger and
the Second Step Merger shall be treated as separate transactions for U.S.
federal income tax purposes pursuant to Revenue Ruling 90‑95, 1990‑2 C.B. 67.
If, at any time prior the Closing, there is a change in any Legal Requirement
applicable to Tax that would cause the Integrated Mergers to be characterized
as a taxable sale of the Company's assets to the Surviving Entity for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, the Parties agree, upon the receipt of written
notice from the Company, to amend this Agreement in such a manner as to cause
the completion of the First Step Merger, but not the Second Step Merger.

Section 6.7 Confidentiality. The terms of the letter agreement, dated as of
July 17, 2015 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), between Healthland Inc. and
Parent are hereby incorporated herein by reference and shall continue in full
force and effect until the Closing. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms.

Section 6.8 Public Announcements. None of the Parties shall make any
disclosure or permit any of its Affiliates or Representatives to make any
disclosure (whether or not in response to an inquiry) with respect to the
Transaction Documents and the Transactions unless previously approved by the
Parties in writing, except to the extent such disclosure is required by
applicable Legal Requirements, in which case the disclosing Party shall
promptly notify the other Parties thereof and the Parties shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause a mutually agreeable release or announcement to be
issued. Consistent with the foregoing sentence, the Company acknowledges that
upon execution of this Agreement, Parent will file a copy of this Agreement as
an exhibit to a Form 8‑K (describing the Transactions) with the SEC and issue
a press release, in each case, as required by the Exchange Act. The Company
shall consult with Parent concerning the means by which the Company's
customers, suppliers, distributors, lessors, lessees, licensors, licensees,
creditors, employees, independent contractors and others having business
dealings or relations with any of the Company Entities will be informed of the
Transactions, and Parent's prior written approval will be required (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and Parent
has the right, and the Company shall provide Parent with a reasonably
opportunity, to be present for any such communications.

Section 6.9 Further Assurances. Following the Closing, the Parties shall
reasonably cooperate with each other and with their respective Representatives
in connection with any steps required to be taken as part of their respective
obligations under this Agreement, and the Parties agree (a) to furnish upon
request to the other Parties such further information, (b) to execute and
deliver to each other Party such other documents, and (c) to do such other
acts and things, all as the other Parties reasonably request, for the purpose
of carrying out the intent of this Agreement and the Transactions.

(b) Payments by an Indemnifying Person pursuant to Section 8.2 or Section 8.3
in respect of any Damages are to be reduced by any insurance proceeds actually
received by the Indemnified Person with respect to any such claim (net of any
related costs incurred in connection therewith, including deductibles,
retroactive premiums and premium increases). Each Indemnified Person shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to recover under applicable insurance policies
for any Damages prior to seeking indemnification under this Agreement;
provided, however, the foregoing shall not prohibit an Indemnified Person from
providing notice of a claim or potential claim as contemplated by Section 8.4 prior to seeking recovery under any
applicable insurance policy.

(c) Each Indemnified Person shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any Damages upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance that
would be reasonably expected to, or does, give rise thereto; provided,
however, no Indemnified Person is to be required to incur any costs in
connection therewith.

(d) The representations, warranties, covenants, obligations and agreements of
the Parties, and an Indemnified Person's right to indemnification or other
remedy with respect thereto or otherwise under Section 8.2 or Section 8.3, as
applicable, are not to be affected or deemed waived by reason of any
investigation made by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person, its Affiliates
or any of their respective Representatives, or by reason of the fact that such
Indemnified Person, its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives
knew or should have known that any such representation, warranty, covenant,
obligation or agreement is, was or might be inaccurate, breached or not
complied with, or by reason of such Indemnified Person's waiver of any
condition set forth in Article VII.

(e) The Parties intend for each representation, warranty, covenant, obligation
and agreement contained in this Agreement to have independent significance. If
an inaccuracy exists in, or any Party has breached, any representation,
warranty, covenant, obligation or agreement contained in this Agreement in any
respect, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or obligation relating to the same subject matter
(regardless of the relative levels of specificity) that is accurate or that
such Party has not breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that
an inaccuracy exists in, or such Party is in breach of, the first
representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or agreement.

(f) No Indemnifying Party shall have any Liability under any provision of this
Agreement for any punitive Damages, except for and to the extent that such
Damages are awarded against an Indemnified Party in connection with a Third
Party Claim.

(g) For purposes of calculating the amount of Damages to which a Parent
Indemnified Person is entitled under this Article VIII (but, for the avoidance
of doubt, not for purposes of determining whether a breach has occurred), the
terms "material," "materially," "materiality," "material adverse effect" and
"Company Material Adverse Effect" and other similar qualifications are to be
disregarded; provided, however, the foregoing is not to apply to the term
Material Company Contract, Material Customer or Material Supplier or the
definitions thereof.

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
this Agreement, including Section 8.4 and this Section 8.5, limits the
survival of any claim or potential claim or the Liability of any Indemnifying
Person for fraud .

Section 8.6 Procedure for Indemnification - Third Party Claims.

(a) If any Indemnified Person receives notice of the assertion or commencement
of any Proceeding made or brought by any Person who is not a Party, an
Affiliate of a Party, or a Representative of a Party or an Affiliate of a Party (a "Third‑Party Claim")
against such Indemnified Person with respect to which the Indemnifying Person
is obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified
Person shall give the Indemnifying Person prompt written notice of such
Third‑Party Claim. The failure to give such prompt written notice will not,
however, relieve the Indemnifying Person of its indemnification obligations,
except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Person forfeits rights or
defenses by reason of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Person must
describe the Third‑Party Claim in reasonable detail and must indicate the
estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Damages that have been or
could be sustained by the Indemnified Person.

(b) The Indemnifying Person shall have the right to participate in, or by
giving written notice to the Indemnified Person within thirty (30) days after
being notified of a Third‑Party Claim by the Indemnified Person in accordance
with Section 8.6(i), to assume the defense of such Third‑Party Claim at the
Indemnifying Person's expense and by the Indemnifying Person's own counsel
(such counsel must be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Person), and
the Indemnified Person shall cooperate in good faith in such defense. The
Indemnified Person shall have the right, at its own cost and expense, to
participate in the defense of any Third‑Party Claim with counsel selected by
the Indemnified Person subject to the Indemnifying Person's right to control
the defense thereof and, in any event, the Indemnifying Person shall keep the
Indemnified Person fully apprised as to the status of such defense. If the
Indemnifying Person elects not to assume the defense of such Third‑Party Claim
or fails to timely notify the Indemnified Person in writing of the
Indemnifying Person's election to assume the defense of such Third‑Party Claim
as provided in this Agreement, the Indemnified Person shall be entitled to,
subject to Section 8.6(iv), pay, compromise and defend such Third‑Party Claim
and seek indemnification for any and all Damages based upon, arising out of,
with respect to or by reason of such Third‑Party Claim. Parent and the
Securityholder Representative shall cooperate with each other in all
reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any Third‑Party Claim,
including making available records relating to such Third‑Party Claim (to the
extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements) and making available,
without expense (other than reimbursement of actual out‑of‑pocket expenses) to
the defending Party, management employees of the non‑defending Party in such a
manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the
non‑defending Party, as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the
defense of such Third‑Party Claim.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if (i) the
Indemnifying Person is given notice of a Third‑Party Claim in compliance with
Section 8.6(i) and fails to notify the Indemnified Person of the Indemnifying
Person's election to defend such Third‑Party Claim within the time prescribed
in Section 8.6(ii), (ii) the claim for indemnification is based upon, arises
out of, is with respect to or is by reason of any criminal or quasi‑criminal
Proceeding, (iii) the relief sought in connection with the Third‑Party Claim
is not solely monetary Damages, (iv) the Indemnified Person reasonably
concludes, based upon advice of counsel, that either a conflict exists between
the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person in connection with the
defense of the Third‑Party Claim or there are legal defenses available to the
Indemnified Person that are different from or additional to those available to
the Indemnified Person that are different from or additional to those
available to the Indemnifying Person, (v) Parent, if acting as the Indemnified
Person, reasonably concludes that the Damages relating to such Third‑Party
Claim could exceed the then current balance of the Escrow Fund, (vi) the Third‑Party
Claim is asserted directly by or on behalf of a Person that is a material
customer, supplier, distributor, lessor, licensor, licensee or creditor of the
Indemnified Person, or (vii) the defense of the Third‑Party Claim is not
instituted and is not continuously maintained in good faith by the
Indemnifying Person, then, in any such case, the Indemnified Person is
entitled to assume the defense of such Third‑Party Claim and assert a claim
against the Indemnifying Person for indemnification with respect to such
Third‑Party Claim pursuant to the terms of this Article VIII, with the
reasonable costs and expenses of such defense to be included in the amount of
Damages sought pursuant to such indemnification. The Indemnifying Person shall
cooperate in good faith with the Indemnified Person with respect to the
transfer of the defense of such Third‑Party Claim from the Indemnifying Person
to the Indemnified Person in accordance with this Section 8.6(iii).

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Indemnifying Person shall not enter into a settlement of any Third‑Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as provided in
this Section 8.6(iv). If a firm offer is made to settle a Third‑Party Claim
without leading to Liability or the creation of a financial or other
obligation on the part of the Indemnified Person and provides, in customary
form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified Person from all
Liabilities in connection with such Third‑Party Claim and the Indemnifying
Person desires to accept and agree to such offer, the Indemnifying Person
shall give written notice to that effect to the Indemnified Person. If the
Indemnified Person fails to consent in writing to such firm offer within
fifteen (15) days after the Indemnified Person's receipt of such notice, the
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to continue to contest or defend such
Third‑Party Claim and in such event, the maximum Liability of the Indemnifying
Person as to such Third‑Party Claim is not to exceed the amount of such
settlement offer. If the Indemnified Person fails to consent to such firm
offer and also fails to timely assume defense of such Third‑Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to settle the Third‑Party Claim upon the
terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such Third‑Party Claim. If the
Indemnified Person has assumed the defense of any Third‑Party Claim pursuant
to Section 8.6(ii) or Section 8.6(iii), the Indemnified Person shall have the
right to conduct such defense, and to compromise and settle in good faith any
such Third‑Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Person consents to the compromise
or settlement of any such Third‑Party Claim, then such Indemnifying Person
shall be bound by any ultimate judgment or settlement as to the existence and
the amount of such Third Party Claim and the amount of said judgment or
settlement (including the costs and expenses of defending such Third Party
Claim); provided, however, that except with the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Person, no settlement of any such Third‑Party Claim shall be
solely determinative that such Third‑Party Claim is covered by indemnification
hereunder or as to the amount of Damages the Indemnified Person is entitled to
recover pursuant to the indemnification provisions of this Article VIII
relating to such Third Party Claim.

Section 8.7 Procedure for Indemnification - Direct Claims. Any claim by an
Indemnified Person on account of Damages that do not result from a Third‑Party
Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be asserted by the Indemnified Person by giving
the Indemnifying Person prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give
such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Person
of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Person forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure.
Such notice by the Indemnified Person must describe the Direct Claim in
reasonable detail and must indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the Damages that have been or could be sustained by the
Indemnified Person. The Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days after
its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. During
such thirty (30) day period, the Indemnified Person shall allow the
Indemnifying Person and its Representatives to investigate the matter or
circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what
extent any amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim and the
Indemnified Person shall reasonably assist the Indemnifying Person's
investigation by giving such information and assistance (including access to
the Indemnified Person's premises and personnel and the right to examine and
copy any accounts, documents or records) as the Indemnifying Person or any of
its Representatives reasonably requests, in each such case, in such a manner
as not to unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the Indemnified
Person. If the Indemnifying Person does not so respond within such thirty (30)
day period, the Indemnifying Person is to be deemed to have rejected such
Direct Claim, in which case the Indemnified Person shall be entitled to pursue
such remedies as are available to the Indemnified Person on the terms and
subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

Section 8.8 Payment; Escrow. After (a) any final Order has been rendered by a
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction, (b) a settlement has been
consummated in accordance with this Article VIII, or (c) the Indemnified
Person and the Indemnifying Person have arrived at a mutually binding
Contract, in each case, with respect to a Third‑Party Claim or a Direct Claim,
the Indemnified Person shall forward to the Indemnifying Person notice of any
amounts due and owing by the Indemnifying Person in accordance with this
Article VIII. Any amounts due and owing by the Company Indemnifying Persons to
any Parent Indemnified Person in accordance with this Article VIII are to be
paid first by release of an amount of cash from the Escrow Cash equal to such
amount due and owning and if the then current balance of Escrow Cash is
insufficient to cover all of such amount due and owing, then a number of
Transaction Shares equal to (i) the remainder of such amount due and owing
divided by (ii) the CPSI Share Price to the applicable Parent Indemnified
Person from the Escrow Fund by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement (and Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall promptly
instruct the Escrow Agent accordingly). If the Escrow Fund is fully
extinguished or insufficient to pay in full the amounts due and owing by the
Company Indemnifying Persons to any Parent Indemnified Person in accordance
with this Article VIII, then each Company Stockholder shall severally and not
jointly, within five (5) Business Days after the occurrence of the earliest
event to occur that is described in the first sentence of this Section 8.8,
pay to the applicable Parent Indemnified Person all such remaining amounts due
and owing by the Company Indemnifying Persons to the applicable Parent
Indemnified Person in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, such amounts to be
paid, at the election of each Company Indemnifying Person, wholly in cash, or
in a mix of cash and Transaction Shares, provided that such mix shall contain
no more than fifty percent (50%) Transaction Shares (with such Transaction
Shares valued at the CPSI Share Price), with any such cash payment to be by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by
Parent to the Company Indemnifying Persons in writing. If any amounts are due
and owing by Parent to any Company Indemnified Person in accordance with this
Article VIII, then Parent shall, within five (5) Business Days after the
occurrence of the earliest event to occur that is described in the first
sentence of this Section 8.8, pay in cash to the Securityholder
Representative, on behalf of the Company Securityholders, all such amounts by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account designated by the Securityholder Representative to Parent
in writing and the Securityholder Representative shall pay such amount to the
Company Securityholders in accordance with their Pro Rata Share. In no event
shall any Company Securityholder be liable under this Article VIII for more
than the Aggregate Merger Consideration received by it pursuant to Article II.

Section 8.9 Exclusive Remedies. Subject to Section 2.14 and Section 10.10, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that the remedies provided for in this Article
VIII are to be their sole and exclusive remedies with respect to any claims
based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of the matters
covered by this Agreement, other than claims based upon, arising out of, with
respect to or by reason of any fraud. Nothing in this Section 8.9 is to
interfere with or impede the operation of Section 2.14 (including with respect
to the resolution of the Disputed Matters by the Parties and the Independent
Accounting Firm), or limit any Person's right to seek and obtain any equitable
relief to which any Person is entitled pursuant to Section 10.10 or to seek
any remedy on account of fraud or willful misconduct.

Section 8.10 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. The Parties shall
treat each payment made under this Article VIII as an adjustment to the
Aggregate Merger Consideration for Tax purposes, unless (a) a final
determination (which includes the execution of a Form 870‑AD or successor
form) with respect to any such payment causes such payment not to be treated
as an adjustment to the Aggregate Merger Consideration for Tax purposes or (b)
as otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements.

Section 8.11 Securityholder Representative.

(a) For purposes of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, each Company
Securityholder shall, without any further action on the part of any such
Company Securityholder, be deemed (by virtue of the adoption and approval of
this Agreement and approval of the Integrated Mergers) to have consented to
the appointment of AHR Holdings, LLC as the Securityholder Representative, as
the attorney‑in‑fact for and on behalf of each such Company Securityholder,
and the taking by the Securityholder Representative of any and all actions and
the making of any decisions required or permitted to be taken by them under or
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, including
the exercise of the power to (i) execute this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement,
the other Transaction Documents and other agreements, documents and
certificates pursuant to such Contracts, including all amendments to such
Contracts, and take all actions required or permitted to be taken under such
Contracts (provided, that the Securityholder Representative, on behalf of
itself and all other Company Securityholders, may not enter into any amendment
that has a disproportionate adverse impact on any Company Securityholder
compared to any other Company Securityholder), (ii) authorize delivery to
Parent of all or any portion of the Escrow Fund, in satisfaction of
indemnification or other claims contemplated by this Agreement or as provided
in the Escrow Agreement, (iii) agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of and comply with Orders with respect to such indemnification or
other claims, (iv) resolve any indemnification or other claims, (v) receive
and forward notices and communications pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, and (vi) take all actions
necessary in the judgment of the Securityholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing and all of the other terms, conditions
and limitations of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents and any other agreements, documents and certificates thereto. The
Company Securityholders shall cooperate with the Securityholder Representative
and any accountants, attorneys or other agents whom the Securityholder
Representative may retain to assist in carrying out the Securityholder
Representative's duties hereunder. AHR Holdings, LLC hereby accepts its
appointment as the Securityholder Representative. The Securityholder
Representative is authorized by each Company Securityholder by virtue of the
adoption and approval of this Agreement and approval of the Integrated Mergers
to act on its behalf as required hereunder under the Escrow Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents. At any time during the term of the Escrow
Agreement, the Company Securityholders entitled to a majority in interest of
the Escrow Fund can appoint a new Securityholder Representative by written
consent by sending notice and a copy of the duly executed written consent
appointing such new Securityholder Representative to Parent and the Escrow
Agent. Such appointment will be effective upon the later of the date indicated
in the consent or the date such consent is received by Parent and the Escrow
Agent.

(b) The Parties acknowledge that the Securityholder Representative's
obligations under this Article VIII are solely as a representative of the
Company Securityholders with respect to the obligations to indemnify the
Parent Indemnified Persons under this Article VIII and that the Securityholder
Representative shall have no personal responsibility for any expenses incurred
by it in such capacity and that all payments to the Parent Indemnified Persons
as a result of such indemnification obligations shall be made solely in
accordance with this Article VIII.

(c) All decisions, actions, consents and instructions of the Securityholder
Representative shall be final and binding upon all the Company Securityholders
and no Company Securityholder shall have any right to object, dissent, protest
or otherwise contest the same, except for fraud, bad faith or willful
misconduct. Neither the Securityholder Representative nor any agent employed
by the Securityholder Representative shall incur any Liability to any Company
Securityholder relating to the performance of its duties hereunder except for
actions or omissions constituting fraud, bad faith or willful misconduct. The
Securityholder Representative shall not have by reason of this Agreement a
fiduciary relationship in respect of any Company Securityholder, except in
respect of amounts actually received on behalf of such Company Securityholder.
The Securityholder Representative, in its capacity as such, shall not be
required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance
of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement.

(d) The provisions of this Section 8.11 shall in no way impose any obligations
on Parent, Merger Sub, Successor Sub or the Surviving Entity. In particular,
notwithstanding any notice received by Parent, Merger Sub, Successor Sub, or
the Surviving Entity to the contrary, Parent, Merger Sub, Successor Sub and
the Surviving Entity (i) shall be fully protected in relying upon and shall be
entitled to rely upon, shall have no Liability to the Company Securityholders
with respect to, actions, omissions to act, decisions and determinations of
the Securityholder Representative, (ii) shall be entitled to assume that all
actions, omissions to act, decisions and determinations of the Securityholder
Representative are fully authorized by all of the Company Securityholders and
(iii) shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the Securityholder
Representative on all matters relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents. Each Letter of Transmittal will contain a provision
authorizing the Securityholder Representative to act on behalf of the Company
Securityholder signing such Letter of Transmittal for all matters arising
under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
and will contain the provisions set forth in this Section 8.11. All deliveries
made by Parent, Merger Sub, Successor Sub or the Surviving Entity to the
Securityholder Representative or at the direction of the Securityholder
Representative shall be made on behalf of the Company Securityholders and
shall constitute full performance of the delivery obligations of Parent,
Merger Sub, Successor Sub or Surviving Entity hereunder under the Escrow
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents. None of Parent, Merger Sub,
Successor Sub or the Surviving Entity shall be liable for allocation of
particular deliveries and payments of such amounts at the direction of the
Securityholder Representative.

(e) The Representative Expense Fund will be delivered at the Closing to the
Securityholder Representative to be held in trust as a source of reimbursement
as provided in this Agreement and for costs and out‑of‑pocket expenses
(including Taxes and costs of professional advisers) incurred by the
Securityholder Representative for its obligations in connection with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, with any balance of the Representative
Expense Fund not incurred for such purposes, to be distributed to the Company
Securityholders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares.

Section 10.4 Entire Agreement; Modification. This Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents constitute the entire agreement among the Parties and
supersede all prior agreements, whether written or oral, among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. The Parties are not
permitted to amend, modify or supplement this Agreement, except by a written
agreement signed by the Parties. No course of dealing between or among any
Persons having any interest in this Agreement is to be deemed effective to
modify, amend or discharge any part of this Agreement or any rights or
obligations of any Person under or by reason of this Agreement.

Section 10.5 Waiver; Remedies. Neither the failure nor any delay by any of the
Parties in exercising any right under this Agreement is to operate as a waiver
of such right, and no single or partial exercise of any such right is to
preclude any other or further exercise of such right or the exercise of any
other right. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement is to be
deemed or is to constitute a waiver of any other provisions of this Agreement,
whether or not similar, nor is any waiver to constitute a continuing waiver.
Any waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or
warranty, or based on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or

other remedy based on such representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or
agreement. The rights and remedies of the Parties are cumulative and not
alternative.

Section 10.6 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction is to be, as to that

1.

|

Confidentiality. 







(a)From and after the Closing, the Principal Stockholder and the FP Funds
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and the Representatives to
whom Confidential Information (as hereinafter defined) was provided prior to
the Closing of each of the foregoing to, hold in confidence any and all
confidential and proprietary information, whether in written, verbal, graphic
or other form, concerning any of the Company Entities (collectively, "Company
Confidential Information"), except that the Principal Stockholder and the FP
Funds shall have no obligation under this Section 1 with respect to any
Company Confidential Information that (i) as of the Execution Date is, or
after the Execution Date becomes, generally available to the public other than
through a breach of this Section 1 by the Principal Stockholder, either of the
FP Funds, any of their respective Affiliates or any of the Representatives of
any of the foregoing, (ii) is provided on a non-confidential basis to the
Principal Stockholder, either of the FP Funds, any of their respective
Affiliates or any of the officers, directors or employees of any of the
foregoing by any Person other than the Surviving Entity or any of its
Affiliates (including Parent) that was not known to the receiving party, after
due inquiry, to be bound by any duty of confidentiality to the Surviving
Entity or any of its Affiliates (including Parent), or (iii) is independently
developed by the Principal Stockholder or any of its Affiliates after the
Closing Date without use of or reference to any Company Confidential
Information and without otherwise violating this Agreement.

(b)The Principal Stockholder and the FP Funds shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates and the Representatives of each of the foregoing to take
the same degree of care to protect the Company Confidential Information that
such Person uses to protect such Person's own confidential and proprietary
information of a similar nature, but in no event less than a commercially
reasonable degree of care.

(c)Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Principal Stockholder nor the FP
Funds shall be in breach of this Section 1 as a result of any disclosure of
Company Confidential Information that is required by applicable law or that is
requested or required by any Governmental Authority or under any subpoena,
civil investigative demand or other similar process, provided that the
Principal Stockholder and the FP Funds, as applicable, shall promptly notify
Parent, if allowed under applicable law, of the existence, terms and
circumstances surrounding such requested or compelled disclosure, and shall
cooperate with Parent, at Parent's expense, in connection with any of Parent's
efforts to prevent or limit the scope of such disclosure. The Principal
Stockholder and the FP Funds shall only disclose that portion of the Company
Confidential Information that is legally required to be disclosed in
accordance with the foregoing sentence.

2.Non-Solicitation. The Principal Stockholder and the FP Funds agree that for
a period of eighteen (18) months from and after the Closing Date (the
"Restricted Period"), without the prior written consent of Parent, the
Principal Stockholder and the FP Funds shall not, and shall cause their
respective controlled Affiliates (which, for the purposes of this Section 2
shall include the general partner of the FP Funds and its controlled
Affiliates) not to, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit for the purpose of
offering employment to (whether as an employee, consultant, agent, independent
contractor or otherwise), any of the employees of any of the Company Entities
who were paid a base salary of at least One Hundred Thousand Dollars
($100,000) on the Closing Date (collectively, the "Covered Persons") or (b)
otherwise interfere with, or attempt to interfere with, the relationship
between any Covered Person and any of the Company Entities; provided, however,
that (i) general 







solicitations of employment published in a newspaper, over the internet, or in
another publication of general circulation and not specifically directed
towards any Covered Person shall not be deemed to constitute a prohibited
solicitation for purposes of this Section 2, and (ii) the hiring of any
Covered Person (or the engagement of any such Covered Person as a consultant)
shall not violate this Section 2 if such Covered Person's employment with any
of the Company Entities was terminated by any of the Company Entities or by
the Covered Person and, in each such case, at least three (3) months shall
have elapsed since the date of any such termination or resignation. The
Principal Stockholder and the FP Funds acknowledge that the provisions of this
Section 2 are (A) reasonable and not any greater than reasonably necessary to
protect Parent, Merger Sub, Successor Sub and their respective Affiliates, and
(B) in consideration of (1) the Transactions, including the Principal
Stockholder's right to receive its portion of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration, and (2) additional good and valuable consideration as set forth
in this Agreement, the Merger Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.
The Principal Stockholder and the FP Funds acknowledge that the potential harm
to Parent, Merger Sub, Successor Sub and their respective Affiliates of the
non-enforcement of any provision of this Section 2 outweighs any potential
harm to the Principal Stockholder or either of the FP Funds of the enforcement
of any provision of this Section 2 by injunction or otherwise.

3.Release.

(a)For and in consideration of the covenants and promises set forth in this
Agreement, the Merger Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, effective
as of, from, and after the First Step Merger Effective Time, the Principal

past, present and future Affiliates, and on behalf of the investors,
shareholders, members, principals, partners, trustees, beneficiaries, heirs,
executors of each of the foregoing, the Representatives of each of the
foregoing, and the predecessors, successors and assigns of each of the
foregoing (collectively, the "Releasing Parties"), hereby fully, finally,
unconditionally and irrevocably release, acquit and forever discharge, the

(including, without limitation, Parent, Merger Sub and Successor Sub), the

all covenants, Proceedings, torts, debts, Damages, demands, offsets and
compensation of every kind and nature whatsoever, past, present, or future, at
law or in equity (including, without limitation, with respect to conduct that

or a breach of any duty or Legal Requirement), whether known or unknown,
whether concealed or hidden, whether disclosed or undisclosed, whether fixed,
contingent or otherwise, whether asserted or unasserted, whether accrued or
unaccrued, whether matured or unmatured, whether liquidated or unliquidated,
whether due or to become due and whether secured or unsecured, that such
Releasing Parties, or any of them, had, have, or ever in the future may have
(excluding any claims by employees that such employees may have under
employment, option or other agreements with the Company) against the Released
Parties, or any of them, in each case based on (i) acts, events,
circumstances, conditions or omissions occurring at or prior to the First Step
Merger Effective Time, or (ii) Liabilities of the Principal Stockholder or the
FP Funds arising under this Agreement, the Merger 







Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 2.14 of the Merger Agreement
or Article VIII of the Merger Agreement) or any of the other Transaction
Documents (collectively, for the purposes of this Section 3, "Causes of
Action"), excluding Causes of Action related to the Principal Stockholder's
rights (A) explicitly arising under the Merger Agreement, and (B) to
indemnification under the provisions of the Governance Documents or the
Constitutive Documents of any of the Company Entities (or any directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy maintained by any of the Company Entities
in respect of the same) if any Releasing Party is made a party to a Proceeding
as a result of such Releasing Party's status as a director, officer or
employee of any of the Company Entities with respect to any act, omission,
event or transaction occurring at or prior to the First Step Merger Effective
Time (the "Reserved Causes of Action"). The Principal Stockholder and the FP
Funds hereby acknowledge and agree that they do not have any claim or right to
indemnity or contribution from any of the Released Parties with respect to any
amounts paid by the Principal Stockholder or either of the FP Funds pursuant
to this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or otherwise. The Principal
Stockholder and the FP Funds agree that in no event will any of the Released
Parties have any Liability whatsoever to the Principal Stockholder or either
of the FP Funds for any inaccuracies, breaches, non-fulfillment or non-
performance of the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or
agreements of the Company under the Merger Agreement, and that the Principal
Stockholder and the FP Funds shall not seek to recover any amounts in
connection therewith or thereunder from the Released Parties. In executing
this Agreement, each Releasing Party acknowledges that it has been informed
that the Company Entities may from time to time enter into agreements for
additional types of financing, including, without limitation,
recapitalizations, mergers and initial public offerings of capital stock of
any of the Company Entities, and also may pursue acquisitions or enter into
agreements for the sale of any of the Company Entities or all or a portion of
any of the Company Entities' assets, which may result in or reflect an
increase in equity value or enterprise value, and that any and all claims
arising from or relating to such transactions or such increases in equity
value or enterprise value (without limitation) are encompassed within the
scope of the release under this Section 3(a).

(b)Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, the Principal
Stockholder and the FP Funds hereby represent to the Released Parties that (i)
no Releasing Party has assigned any Causes of Action or possible Causes of
Action against any Released Party, (ii) each Releasing Party fully releases,
and intends to fully release, all Causes of Action against the Released
Parties including, without limitation, unknown and contingent Causes of Action
(other than the Reserved Causes of Action), and (iii) each Releasing Party has
consulted with counsel with respect to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and has been fully apprised of the consequences of this Section 3.
The Principal Stockholders and the FP Funds agree not to, and shall cause the
other Releasing Parties not to, institute or maintain any Proceeding against
any Released Party with respect to any Causes of Action (other than the
Reserved Causes of Action).

(c)Each Releasing Party understands that this Section 3 includes a full and
final release covering all Causes of Actions (other than the Reserved Causes
of Action), including, without limitation, all known and unknown, suspected or
unsuspected injuries, debts, claims or damages that have arisen or may have
arisen from any matters, acts, omissions or dealings actually released in this
Section 3. Each Releasing Party acknowledges that there is a risk that after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, such Releasing Party may
discover a Cause of Action that is released 







under this Section 3, but that is presently unknown to such Releasing Party,
and the Releasing Party assumes such risk and understands that this release
shall apply to any such Cause of Action. Therefore, each Releasing Party
expressly waives the provisions of California Civil Code Section 1542, or any
similar provision of other applicable Legal Requirement, which states:

A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know
or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release,
which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her
settlement with the debtor.

exercise thereof or of any other right. No waiver of any of the provisions of
this Agreement is to be deemed or is to constitute a waiver of any other

constitute a continuing waiver. All rights and remedies existing under this

rights or remedies otherwise available.

Agreement, without posting any bond or other undertaking or proving damages.

to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent
or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by Parent,
Merger Sub and Successor Sub, and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or
to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of Parent, Merger

available or otherwise are not granted, and (B) nothing set forth in this
Section 13(i)(ii) shall require any Party to institute any Proceeding for (or

termination right hereunder (or pursuing damages prior to or after such
termination), nor shall the commencement of any Proceeding pursuant to this
Section 13(i)(ii) or anything set forth in this Section 13(i)(ii) restrict or
limit any Party's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that

REGISTRATION RIGHTS

Section 3.1. Demand Registration

Section 3.1.1 Request for Demand Registration.

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Unless a Shelf Registration Statement is then in effect pursuant to Section
3.2.1, at any time after the date that is one hundred twenty (120) days after
the Closing Date, the Holders shall have the right to make a written request
from time to time (a "Demand Registration Request") to the Company for
Registration of either (i) an aggregate number of Registrable Securities
equaling at least thirty three percent (33.0%) of the total number of shares
of Common Stock issued to the Holders at the Closing or (ii) all remaining
outstanding Registrable Securities held by the Holders (subject, with respect
to both clauses (i) and (ii), to the limitations on Transfer in Section 3.4.2
of this Agreement) (the "Threshold Amount"). Any such Registration pursuant to
a Demand Registration Request shall hereinafter be referred to as a "Demand
Registration." 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Each Demand Registration Request shall specify (i) the number of Registrable
Securities to be registered, and (ii) the intended method or methods of
disposition thereof. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Upon receipt of a Demand Registration Request, the Company shall as promptly
as practicable (but in no event more than ninety (90) days after receipt of
the Demand Registration Request) file a Registration Statement (a "Demand
Registration Statement"), as specified in the Demand Registration Request for
such Demand Registration, relating to such Demand Registration, and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such 

 







Demand Registration Statement to be promptly declared effective under the
Securities Act; provided that the Company shall not be required to take any
action to cause any Demand Registration Statement to become effective under
the Securities Act on a date that is prior to the one hundred eightieth
(180th) day after the Closing Date.

Section 3.1.2 Limitation on Demand Registrations. The Company shall not be
obligated to take any action to effect more than two (2) Public Offerings
pursuant to Section 3.1 of this Agreement in any consecutive twelve (12) month
period. In addition, the Company shall not be obligated to take any action to
effect any Demand Registration if a Demand Registration was declared effective
or an Underwritten Shelf Takedown was consummated in the preceding ninety (90)
days (unless otherwise consented to by the Board of Directors).

Section 3.1.3 Preemption. The Company may preempt a Demand Registration
Request in order to conduct an Underwritten Public Offering of its Common
Stock for its own account (and/or, at the Company's sole discretion, for the
account or accounts of any or all of the Holders) by delivering written notice
of such intention (the "Preemption Notice") to the Holders within five (5)
Business Days after the Company has received the Demand Registration Request.
The Demand Registration Request so preempted shall be automatically withdrawn
by the Holders and will not count as a Demand Registration; provided, however,
that if such Underwritten Public Offering of its Common Stock for the
Company's own account is not completed, the Company shall promptly recommence
such withdrawn Demand Registration, unless advised otherwise by the Holders.
The period of preemption shall not exceed sixty (60) days following the date
of the Preemption Notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right to preempt a Demand
Registration pursuant to this Section 3.1.3 more than once in any consecutive
twelve (12)-month period.

Section 3.1.4 Demand Withdrawal. Either Holder may withdraw all or any portion
of its Registrable Securities included in a Demand Registration from such
Demand Registration at any time prior to the effectiveness of the applicable
Demand Registration Statement or, in the case of an Underwritten Public
Offering, prior to the Registration Statement's latest effective date with
regard to the Demand Registration (as determined for purposes of Rule
430B(f)(2) under the Securities Act); provided, however, that the aggregate
number of Registrable Securities that remain in the Demand Registration must
equal or exceed the Threshold Amount. Upon receipt of a notice to such effect
from the Holders with respect to a number of the Registrable Securities
included in a Demand Registration that would result in the aggregate number of
Registrable Securities included in such Demand Registration to be less than
the Threshold Amount, the Company shall cease all efforts to secure
effectiveness of the applicable Demand Registration Statement.

Section 3.1.5 Effective Registration. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Demand Registration Statement to become
effective and remain effective for not less than one hundred twenty (120) days
(or such shorter period as









will terminate when all Registrable Securities covered by such Demand
Registration Statement have been sold or withdrawn or are no longer
Registrable Securities), or, if such Demand Registration Statement relates to
an Underwritten Public Offering, such longer period as, in the opinion of
counsel for the underwriter or underwriters, a Prospectus is required by law
to be delivered in connection with sales of Registrable Securities by an
underwriter or dealer.

Section 3.1.6 Delay in Filing; Suspension of Registration. If the filing,
initial effectiveness or continued use of a Demand Registration Statement at
any time would require the Company to make an Adverse Disclosure, the Company
may, upon giving prompt written notice of such action to the Holders, delay
the filing or initial effectiveness of, or suspend use of, the Demand
Registration Statement (a "Demand Suspension"); provided, however, that the
Company shall not be permitted to exercise a Demand Suspension (i) more than
twice during any consecutive twelve (12) month period or (ii) for a period
exceeding ninety (90) days on any one occasion. In the case of a Demand
Suspension, the Holders agree to suspend use of the applicable Prospectus in
connection with any sale or purchase, or offer to sell or purchase,
Registrable Securities, upon receipt of the notice referred to above. The
Company shall immediately notify the Holders in writing upon the termination
of any Demand Suspension, amend or supplement the Prospectus, if necessary, so
it does not contain any untrue statement or omission and furnish to the
Holders such numbers of copies of the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented
as the Holders may reasonably request. The Company shall, if necessary,
supplement or make amendments to the Demand Registration Statement, if
required by the registration form used by the Company for the Demand
Registration or by the instructions applicable to such registration form or by
the Securities Act or the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder or as
may reasonably be requested by the Holders.

Section 3.1.7 Priority of Securities Registered Pursuant to Demand
Registrations. If the managing underwriter or underwriters of a proposed
Underwritten Public Offering of the Registrable Securities included in a
Demand Registration informs the Company in writing that, in its or their
opinion, the number of securities requested to be included in such Demand
Registration (including securities of the Company for its own account or for
the account of Persons other than the Holders) exceeds the number that can be
sold in such offering without being likely to have a significant adverse
effect on the price, timing or distribution of the securities offered or the
market for the securities offered, then the number of securities to be
included in such Demand Registration shall be reduced to the number
recommended by the managing underwriter or underwriters and allocated as
follows: (i) first, pro rata among the Holders that have requested to
participate in such Demand Registration on the basis of the relative number of
Registrable Securities then held by each such Holder, provided that any
securities thereby allocated to a Holder that exceed such Holder's request
shall be reallocated among the remaining requesting Holders in like manner;
(ii) second, and only if all of the Registrable Securities included in the
Demand Registration Notice by the Holders have been included in the Demand
Registration pursuant to clause (i) above, such additional securities that the
Company requests to be included for its own account; and (iii) third, and only
if all of the Registrable Securities included in the Demand









Registration Notice by the Holders and requested by the Company to be included
for its own account have been included in the Demand Registration pursuant to
clauses (i) and (ii) above, such additional securities that the Company
requests to be included for the account of Persons other than the Holders and
the Company.

Section 3.2. Shelf Registration.

Section 3.2.1 Request for Shelf Registration.

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Subject to the Company's ability to use Form S-3 for the Registration of
Registrable Securities for resale by the Holders, and provided that a Shelf
Registration Statement registering Registrable Securities for resale by the
Holders is not otherwise then effective, then upon the written request of the
Holders from time to time after the date that is one hundred twenty (120) days
after the Closing Date (a "Shelf Registration Request"), the Company shall, as
promptly as practicable (but in no event more than ninety (90) days after
receipt of the Shelf Registration Request), file with the SEC a shelf
Registration Statement on Form S-3 pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities
Act ("Shelf Registration Statement") relating to the offer and sale of
Registrable Securities by the Holders thereof from time to time in accordance
with the methods of distribution elected by such Holders and set forth in the
Shelf Registration Statement and the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such Shelf Registration Statement to promptly
become effective under the Securities Act; provided that the Company shall not
be required to take any action to cause any Shelf Registration Statement to
become effective under the Securities Act on a date that is prior to the one
hundred eightieth (180th) day after the Closing Date. Any such Registration
pursuant to a Shelf Registration Request shall hereinafter be referred to as a
"Shelf Registration." 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company shall promptly
file with the SEC within ninety (90) days of the Closing Date a Shelf
Registration Statement covering all Registrable Securities then outstanding
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Shelf Registration
Statement to become effective within one hundred eighty (180) days of the
Closing Date and remain effective under the Securities Act until all such
shares are sold thereunder by such Holders or such shares otherwise no longer
constitute Registrable Securities. For the avoidance of doubt, the Shelf
Registration Statement described in this Section 3.2.1(b) shall not be deemed
a Demand Registration. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

If on the date of the Shelf Registration Request: (i) the Company is a WKSI,
then the Shelf Registration Request shall request Registration of an
unspecified amount of Registrable Securities and any other securities to be
registered by the Company; and (ii) the Company is not a WKSI, then the 

 







Shelf Registration Request shall specify the number of Registrable Securities
to be registered.

Section 3.2.2 Continued Effectiveness. The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to keep such Shelf Registration Statement continuously
effective under the Securities Act in order to permit the Prospectus forming
part of the Shelf Registration Statement to be usable by the Holders until the
earlier of: (i) the date as of which all of the Holders' Registrable
Securities have been sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement or
another Registration Statement filed under the Securities Act (but in no event
prior to the applicable period referred to in Section 4(a)(3) of the
Securities Act and Rule 174 thereunder); and (ii) the date as of which no
Holder holds Registrable Securities (such period of effectiveness, the "Shelf
Period").

Section 3.2.3 Suspension of Registration. If the continued use of such Shelf
Registration Statement at any time would require the Company, in its sole
judgment, to make an Adverse Disclosure, the Company may, upon giving prompt
written notice of such action to the Holders, suspend use of the Shelf
Registration Statement (a "Shelf Suspension"); provided, however, that the
Company shall not be permitted to exercise a Shelf Suspension (i) more than
two (2) times during any consecutive twelve (12)-month period, or (ii) for a
period exceeding ninety (90) days on any one occasion; provided, however, that
for the period commencing on the Closing Date to the one year anniversary of
the Closing Date, the ninety (90) day period specified in subclause (ii) shall
be sixty (60) days, and there shall be at least forty-five (45) days between
any Shelf Suspensions. In the case of a Shelf Suspension, the Holders agree to
suspend use of the applicable Prospectus and in connection with any sale or
purchase of, or offer to sell or purchase, Registrable Securities, upon
receipt of the notice referred to above. The Company shall immediately notify
the Holders in writing upon the termination of any Shelf Suspension, amend or
supplement the Prospectus, if necessary, so it does not contain any untrue
statement or omission and furnish to the Holders such numbers of copies of the
Prospectus as so amended or supplemented as the Holders may reasonably
request. The Company shall, if necessary, supplement or make amendments to the
Shelf Registration Statement, if required by the registration form used by the
Company for the Shelf Registration Statement or by the instructions applicable
to such registration form or by the Securities Act or the rules or regulations
promulgated thereunder or as may reasonably be requested by the Holders.

Section 3.2.4 Shelf Takedown

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

At any time during which the Company has an effective Shelf Registration
Statement with respect to the Registrable Securities, by notice to the Company
specifying the intended method or methods of disposition thereof, the Holders
may make a written request (a "Shelf Takedown Request") to the Company to
effect a Public Offering, including an Underwritten Shelf Takedown, off of
such Shelf Registration Statement (a "Shelf Takedown"), of an aggregate number
of Registrable Securities equaling at least the Threshold Amount (subject to
the limitations on Transfer in Section 3.4.2 of 

 







this Agreement), and the Company shall promptly amend or supplement the Shelf
Registration Statement for such purpose.

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

The Company shall not be obligated to take any action to effect more than two
(2) Underwritten Shelf Takedowns pursuant to this Section 3.2 in any
consecutive twelve (12) month period; provided, however, there shall be no
limit to the number of Shelf Takedowns available to the Holders, so long as
such Shelf Takedowns do not constitute Underwritten Shelf Takedowns. In
addition, the Company shall not be obligated to take any action to effect any
Underwritten Shelf Takedown if a Demand Registration was declared effective or
an Underwritten Shelf Takedown was consummated within the preceding ninety
(90) days (unless otherwise consented to by the Board of Directors). 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

The Company may preempt a Shelf Takedown Request in order to conduct an
Underwritten Public Offering of its Common Stock for its own account (and/or,
at the Company's sole discretion, for the account or accounts of any or all of
the Holders) by a Preemption Notice to the Holders within five (5) Business
Days after the Company has received the Shelf Takedown Request. The Shelf
Takedown Request shall be automatically withdrawn by the Holders and will not
count as a Shelf Takedown; provided, however, that if such Underwritten Public
Offering of its Common Stock for its own account is not completed, the Company
shall promptly recommence such withdrawn Shelf Takedown, unless advised
otherwise by the Holders. The period of preemption shall not exceed sixty (60)
days following the date of the Preemption Notice. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right
to preempt a Shelf Takedown Request pursuant to this Section 3.2.4(c) more
than once in any consecutive twelve (12)-month period. 

Section 3.2.5 Priority of Securities Sold Pursuant to Shelf Takedowns. If the
managing underwriter or underwriters of a proposed Underwritten Shelf Takedown
pursuant to Section 3.2.4 informs the Company in writing that, in its or their
opinion, the number of securities requested to be included in the proposed
Underwritten Shelf Takedown (including securities of the Company for its own
account or for the account of Persons other than the Holders) exceeds the
number that can be sold in such Underwritten Shelf Takedown without being
likely to have a significant adverse effect on the price, timing or
distribution of the securities offered or the market for the securities
offered, then the number of Registrable Securities to be included in such
Underwritten Shelf Takedown shall be reduced to the number recommended by the
managing underwriter or underwriters and allocated as follows: (i) first, pro
rata among the Holders that have requested to participate in such Underwritten
Shelf Takedown on the basis of the relative number of Registrable Securities
then held by each such Holder, provided that any securities thereby allocated
to a Holder that exceed such Holder's request shall be reallocated among the
remaining requesting Holders in like manner; (ii) second, and only if all of
the Registrable Securities included in the Shelf









Takedown Request by the Holders have been included in the Underwritten Shelf
Takedown pursuant to clause (i) above, such additional securities that the
Company requests to be included for its own account; and (iii) third, and only
if all of the Registrable Securities included in the Shelf Takedown Request by
the Holders and requested by the Company to be included for its own account
have been included in the Underwritten Shelf Takedown pursuant to clauses (i)
and (ii) above, such additional securities that the Company requests to be
included for the account of Persons other than the Holders and the Company.

Section 3.3. Piggyback Registration.

Section 3.3.1 Participation. If the Company at any time proposes to file a
Registration Statement under the Securities Act or to conduct a Public
Offering with respect to any offering of its equity securities for its own
account or for the account of any other Persons (other than (i) a Registration
under Sections 3.1 or 3.2, (ii) a Registration on Form S-4 or Form S-8 or any
successor form to such Forms, (iii) a Registration of securities solely
relating to an offering and sale to employees or directors of the Company or
its subsidiaries pursuant to any employee stock plan or other employee benefit
plan arrangement, (iv) a Registration pursuant to a dividend reinvestment or
similar plan, (v) a Registration not otherwise covered by clause (ii) above
pursuant to which the Company is offering to exchange its own securities for
other securities or (vi) a Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to which only
the initial purchasers and subsequent transferees of debt securities of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries that are convertible or exchangeable for
Common Stock and that are initially issued pursuant to Rule 144A and/or
Regulation S (or any successor provisions) of the Securities Act may resell
such debt securities and/or sell the Common Stock into which such debt
securities may be converted or exchanged), then, as soon as practicable (but
in no event less than fifteen (15) days prior to the proposed date of filing
of such Registration Statement or, in the case of any such Public Offering,
the anticipated pricing or trade date), the Company shall give written notice
(a "Piggyback Notice") of such proposed filing or Public Offering to the
Holders, and such Piggyback Notice shall offer the Holders the opportunity to
register under such Registration Statement, or to sell in such Public
Offering, such number of Registrable Securities as the Holders may request in
writing (a "Piggyback Registration"). Subject to Section 3.3.2, the Company
shall include in such Registration Statement or in such Public Offering as
applicable, all such Registrable Securities that are requested to be included
therein within two (2) Business Days after the receipt by the Holders of any
such notice; provided, however, that if at any time after giving written
notice of its intention to register or sell any securities and prior to the
effective date of the Registration Statement filed in connection with such
Registration, or the pricing or trade date of such Public Offering, the
Company shall determine for any reason not to register or sell or to delay
Registration or the sale of such securities, the Company shall give written
notice of such determination to the Holders and, thereupon, (i) in the case of
a determination not to register or sell, shall be relieved of its obligation
to register or sell any Registrable Securities in connection with such
Registration or Public Offering (but not from its obligation to pay the
Registration Expenses in connection therewith), without prejudice, however, to
the rights of the Holders entitled to request that such Registration or sale
be effected as a Demand Registration under Section 3.1 or an Underwritten
Shelf









Takedown under Section 3.2, as the case may be, and (ii) in the case of a
determination to delay Registration or sale, in the absence of a request for a
Demand Registration or an Underwritten Shelf Takedown, as the case may be,
shall be permitted to delay registering or selling any Registrable Securities,
for the same period as the delay in registering or selling such other
securities. If the offering pursuant to such Registration Statement or Public
Offering is to be underwritten, then each Holder making a request for a
Piggyback Registration pursuant to this Section 3.3.1 shall, and the Company
shall make such arrangements with the managing underwriter or underwriters so
that each such Holder may, participate in such underwritten offering. If the
offering pursuant to such Registration Statement or Public Offering is to be
on any other basis, then each Holder making a request for a Piggyback
Registration pursuant to this Section 3.3.1 shall, and the Company shall make
such arrangements so that each such Holder may, participate in such offering
on such basis. The Holders shall have the right to withdraw all or part of
their request for inclusion of their Registrable Securities in a Piggyback
Registration by giving written notice to the Company of their request to
withdraw; provided that such request must be made in writing prior to the
effectiveness of such Registration Statement or, in the case of a Public
Offering, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the earlier of (i) the
anticipated filing of the "red herring" Prospectus, if applicable, and (ii)
the anticipated pricing or trade date.

Section 3.3.2 Priority of Piggyback Registration. If the managing underwriter
or underwriters of any proposed offering of Registrable Securities included in
a Piggyback Registration informs the Company and participating Holders in
writing that, in its or their opinion, the number of securities that such
Holders and any other Persons intend to include in such offering exceeds the
number that can be sold in such offering without being likely to have a
significant adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the
securities offered or the market for the securities offered, then the
securities to be included in such Registration shall be (i) first, one hundred
percent (100%) of the securities that the Company or (subject to Section 3.7)
any Person (other than a Holder) exercising a contractual right to demand
Registration, as the case may be, proposes to sell, (ii) second, and only if
all the securities referred to in clause (i) have been included, the number of
Registrable Securities that, in the opinion of such managing underwriter or
underwriters, can be sold without having such adverse effect, with such number
to be allocated pro rata among the Holders that have requested to participate
in such Registration on the basis of the relative number of Registrable
Securities then held by each such Holder (provided that any securities thereby
allocated to a Holder that exceed such Holder's request shall be reallocated
among the remaining requesting Holders in like manner) and (iii) third, and
only if all of the Registrable Securities referred to in clause (ii) have been
included in such Registration, any other securities eligible for inclusion in
such Registration.

Section 3.3.3 No Effect on Other Registrations. No Registration of Registrable
Securities effected pursuant to a request under this Section 3.3 shall be
deemed to have been effected pursuant to Sections 3.1 or 3.2 or shall relieve
the Company of its obligations under Sections 3.1 or 3.2.









Section 3.4. Lock-Up; Volume Limitation

Section 3.4.1 Post-Closing Lock-Up. The Holders each agree that, for a period
(the "Lock-Up Period") beginning on the date hereof and ending on, and
including, the date that is one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing
Date, the Holders and their respective Affiliates will not, without the prior
written consent of the Company, (i) sell, offer to sell, contract or agree to
sell, hypothecate, pledge, grant any option to purchase or otherwise dispose
of or agree to dispose of, directly or indirectly, or establish or increase a
put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position
within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to, any
Registrable Securities, (ii) enter into any swap or other arrangement that
Transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of
ownership of Registrable Securities, whether any such transaction is to be
settled by delivery of Common Stock, in cash or otherwise or (iii) publicly
announce an intention to effect any transaction specified in clause (i) or
(ii).

Section 3.4.2 Post-Lock-Up Period Volume Limitation. Following the expiration
of the Lock-Up Period, the Holders will not, without the advance written
consent of the Company, Transfer more than 984,284 shares of Registrable
Securities (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations
and similar readjustments of shares) in any consecutive three (3)-month period
(the "Volume Limitation"); provided, however, that (i) the Volume Limitation
shall not apply to Underwritten Public Offerings and (ii) the Volume
Limitation shall be increased by the amount of Registrable Securities that
could have been sold by the Holders pursuant to Rule 144 during any suspension
period in effect as a result of the Company exercising its preemption rights
under Section 3.1.3 or 3.2.4(c).

Section 3.4.3 Stop Transfer Instructions. The Holders agree and consent to the
entry of stop transfer instructions with the Company's transfer agent and
registrar relating to the transfer of the Holder's shares of Common Stock
except in compliance with the restrictions set forth in this Section 3.4.

Section 3.4.4 Underwritten Public Offerings. In connection with each
Registration or sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 3.1, 3.2 or
3.3 conducted as an Underwritten Public Offering, except with respect to any
shares to be sold by a Holder in such Underwritten Public Offering, each
Holder agrees, if requested, to become bound by and to execute and deliver
such lock-up agreement with the underwriter(s) of such Public Offering
restricting such Holder's right to (a) Transfer, directly or indirectly, any
Registrable Securities or (b) enter into any swap or other arrangement that
transfers to another any of the economic consequences of ownership of
Registrable Securities, as the underwriter(s) shall request; provided,
however, that no Holder shall be required to enter into a lock-up agreement
covering a period of greater than ninety (90) days after the date of the final
Prospectus relating to such offering.

Section 3.5. Registration Procedures

Section 3.5.1 Requirements. In connection with the Company's obligations under
Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, and except as may be otherwise provided in Section
3.2.1(b), the









Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect such
Registration and to permit the sale of such Registrable Securities in
accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof as
expeditiously as reasonably practicable, and in connection therewith the
Company shall:

|

(a)

|

financial statements required under the Securities Act to be filed therewith,
and, before filing a Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or

selling Holders, copies of all documents prepared to be filed, which documents
shall be subject to the review of such underwriters and the selling Holders
and their respective counsel, (y) make such changes in such documents
concerning the selling Holders prior to the filing thereof as the selling
Holders, or their counsel, may reasonably request and (z) except in the case
of a Registration under Section 3.3, not file any Registration Statement or
Prospectus or amendments or supplements thereto to which the selling Holders,
or the underwriters, if any, shall reasonably object; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and post-effective amendments to
such Registration Statement and supplements to the Prospectus as may be (i)
reasonably requested by the selling Holders (to the extent such request
relates to information relating to the selling Holders), or (ii) necessary to
keep such Registration Statement effective for the period of time required by
this Agreement, and comply with provisions of the applicable securities laws
with respect to the sale or other disposition of all securities covered by
such Registration Statement during such period in accordance with the intended
method or methods of disposition by the sellers thereof set forth in such
Registration Statement; 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

notify the selling Holders and the managing underwriter or underwriters, if
any, and (if requested) confirm such notice in writing and provide copies of
the relevant documents, as soon as reasonably practicable after notice thereof
is received by the Company (a) when the applicable Registration Statement or
any amendment thereto has been filed or becomes effective, and when the
applicable Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto has been filed,
(b) of any written comments by the SEC, or any request by the SEC or other
federal or state governmental authority for amendments or supplements to such
Registration Statement or such Prospectus, or for additional information
(whether before or after the effective date of the Registration Statement) or
any other correspondence with the SEC relating to, or which may affect, the
Registration, (c) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of such Registration Statement or any order by the SEC or any
other regulatory authority preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary

such purposes, (d) if, at any time, the 

 







representations and warranties of the Company in any applicable underwriting
agreement cease to be true and correct in all material respects and (e) of the
receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of
the qualification of the Registrable Securities for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such
purpose;

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

promptly notify the selling Holders and the managing underwriter or
underwriters, if any, when the Company becomes aware of the happening of any
event as a result of which the applicable Registration Statement or the
Prospectus included in such Registration Statement (as then in effect)
contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material
fact necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of such Prospectus
or any preliminary Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made) not misleading, when any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus includes
information that may conflict with the information contained in the

ownership of Registrable Securities as the Company may from time to time
reasonably request in writing and the Company may exclude from such

unreasonably fails to furnish such information within a reasonable time after
receiving such request. Each Holder agrees to furnish such information to the
Company and to cooperate with the Company as reasonably necessary to enable
the Company to comply with the provisions of this Agreement.

Section 3.5.3 Discontinuing Registration. Each Holder agrees that, upon

date of the giving of such notice to and including the date when each seller
of Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement either
receives the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by
Section 3.5.1(d) or is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the

Section 3.6. Underwritten Offerings

Section 3.6.1 Shelf and Demand Registrations. If requested by the underwriters
for any Underwritten Public Offering, pursuant to a Registration or sale under
Sections 3.1 or 3.2, the Company shall enter into an underwriting agreement
with such underwriters, such agreement to be reasonably satisfactory in
substance and form to each of the Company,









the Holders and the underwriters, and to contain such representations and
warranties by the Company and such other terms as are generally prevailing in
agreements of that type, including indemnities no less favorable to the
recipient thereof than those provided in Section 3.9. The Holders shall
cooperate with the Company in the negotiation of the underwriting agreement
and shall give consideration to the reasonable suggestions of the Company
regarding the form thereof. The Holders of the Registrable Securities to be
distributed by such underwriters shall be parties to such underwriting
agreement, which underwriting agreement shall: (i) contain such
representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on the part of,
the Company to and for the benefit of such Holders as are customarily made by
issuers to selling stockholders in public offerings similar to the applicable
offering; and (ii) provide that any or all of the conditions precedent to the
obligations of such underwriters under such underwriting agreement also shall
be conditions precedent to the obligations of such Holders. Any such Holder
shall not be required to make any representations or warranties to or
agreements with the Company or the underwriters other than representations,
warranties or agreements regarding such Holder, such Holder's title to the
Registrable Securities, such Holder's intended method of distribution and any
other representations required to be made by the Holder under applicable law,
and the aggregate amount of the liability of such Holder under such
underwriting agreement shall not exceed such Holder's net proceeds from such
offering.

Section 3.6.2 Piggyback Registrations. If the Company proposes to register or
sell any of its securities under the Securities Act as contemplated by Section
3.3 and such securities are to be distributed through one or more
underwriters, the Company shall, if requested by the Holders pursuant to
Section 3.3 and, subject to the provisions of Section 3.3.2, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to arrange for such underwriters to include on
the same terms and conditions that apply to the other sellers in such
Registration or sale all the Registrable Securities to be offered and sold by
the Holders among the securities of the Company to be distributed by such
underwriters in such Registration or sale. The Holders of Registrable
Securities to be distributed by such underwriters shall be parties to the
underwriting agreement between the Company and such underwriters, which
underwriting agreement shall (i) contain such representations and warranties
by, and the other agreements on the part of, the Company to and for the
benefit of such Holders as are customarily made by issuers to selling
stockholders in secondary public offerings and (ii) provide that any or all of
the conditions precedent to the obligations of such underwriters under such
underwriting agreement also shall be conditions precedent to the obligations
of such Holders. Any such Holder shall not be required to make any
representations or warranties to or agreements with the Company or the
underwriters other than representations, warranties or agreements regarding
such Holder, such Holder's title to the Registrable Securities and such
Holder's intended method of distribution or any other representations required
to be made by the Holder under applicable law, and the aggregate amount of the
liability of such Holder under such underwriting agreement shall not exceed
such Holder's net proceeds from such offering.

Section 3.6.3 Participation in Underwritten Registrations. Subject to the
provisions of Section 3.6.1 and Section 3.6.2 above, no Person may participate
in any Underwritten









Public Offering hereunder unless such Person (i) agrees to sell such Person's
securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by
the Persons entitled to approve such arrangements and (ii) completes and
executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting
agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such
underwriting arrangements.

Section 3.6.4 Selection of Underwriters. In the case of an Underwritten Public
Offering under Section 3.1 or Section 3.2, the managing underwriter or
underwriters to administer the offering shall be determined by the Company
with the prior written consent of the Holders, not to be unreasonably
withheld. In the case of an Underwritten Public Offering under Section 3.3,
the managing underwriter or underwriters to administer the offering shall be
determined by the Company.

Section 3.7. No Inconsistent Agreements; Additional Rights. Neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall hereafter enter into, and neither
the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is currently a party to, any agreement
with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to
the Holders by this Agreement. The Company hereby represents and warrants
that, as of the date hereof, no registration rights have been granted to any
other Person other than pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 3.8. Registration Expenses. All expenses incident to the Company's
performance of or compliance with this Agreement shall be paid by the Company,

underwriters so require in accordance with then-customary underwriting
practice, (vi) all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the listing

and expenses of any special experts or other Persons retained by the Company
in connection with any Registration or sale, (viii) all of the Company's
internal expenses (including all salaries and expenses of its officers and

the "road-show" for any Underwritten Public Offering, including all travel,
meals and lodging and (x) the reasonable fees and disbursements of one counsel
for the Holders, not to exceed $50,000 in the aggregate for all offerings of
Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement. All such expenses are
referred to herein as "Registration Expenses". Each Holder of Registrable
Securities sold pursuant to a Registration Statement shall bear the expense of
any broker's commission or underwriter's discount or commission relating to
the registration and sale of such Holder's Registrable Securities and shall
bear the fees and expenses of their own counsel. The Company shall not be
required to pay any fees and disbursements to underwriters not customarily
paid by the issuers of securities in an offering similar to the applicable
offering, including underwriting discounts and commissions and transfer taxes,
if any, attributable









to the sale of Registrable Securities, and, except as expressly provided for
herein, the Company shall not be required to pay any fees of counsel to the
Holders.

Section 3.9. Indemnification

Section 3.9.1 Indemnification by the Company. The Company shall indemnify and
hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by law, each Holder of Registrable
Securities, each shareholder, member, limited or general partner thereof, each
shareholder, member, limited or general partner of each such shareholder,
member, limited or general partner, each of their respective Affiliates,
officers, directors, shareholders, employees, advisors, and agents and each
Person who controls (within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act) such Persons and each of their respective Representatives from and
against any and all losses, penalties, judgments, suits, costs, claims,
damages, liabilities and expenses, joint or several (including reasonable
costs of investigation and legal expenses) (each, a "Loss" and collectively
"Losses") arising out of or based upon (i) any untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement under
which such Registrable Securities are registered or sold under the Securities
Act (including any final, preliminary or summary Prospectus contained therein
or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any documents incorporated
by reference therein) or any other disclosure document produced by or on
behalf of the Company or any of its subsidiaries including any report and
other document filed under the Exchange Act or (ii) any omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a Prospectus or
preliminary Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made) not misleading; provided, that no selling Holder shall be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Section 3.9.1 for any Losses arising out of
or based upon an untrue statement or omission occurring in reliance upon and
in conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in
connection with such registration by any such selling Holder to the Company;
provided, further, that in the absence of written information furnished
expressly for use in connection with such registration by such selling Holder,
the only information presumed to be furnished to the Company is limited to (i)
the legal name of the selling Holder, (ii) the address of the selling Holder,
(iii) the name and address of the natural person or persons who have or share
voting or dispositive control over the shares to be offered and sold by the
selling Holder and (iv) the number of shares to be sold by the selling Holder.
This indemnity shall be in addition to any liability the Company may otherwise
have. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of such Holder or any indemnified party and
shall survive the Transfer of such securities by such Holder. The Company
shall also indemnify underwriters, selling brokers, dealer managers and
similar securities industry professionals participating in the distribution,
their officers and directors and each Person who controls such Persons (within
the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) to the same extent as
provided above with respect to the indemnification of the indemnified parties.

Section 3.9.2 Indemnification by the Holders. The Holders of Registrable
Securities agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify and hold harmless, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company, its directors and officers
and each Person who controls the









Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act) from
and against any Losses resulting from (i) any untrue statement of a material
fact in any Registration Statement under which such Registrable Securities
were registered or sold under the Securities Act (including any final,
preliminary or summary Prospectus contained therein or any amendment thereof
or supplement thereto or any documents incorporated by reference therein) or
(ii) any omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a
Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made) not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to
the extent, that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any
information furnished in writing by either Holder (or an advisor to either
Holder) to the Company specifically for inclusion in such Registration
Statement and has not been corrected in a subsequent writing prior to or
concurrently with the sale of the Registrable Securities to the Person
asserting the claim.

Section 3.9.3 Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings. Any Person entitled to
indemnification hereunder shall (i) give prompt written notice to the
indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification
(provided that any delay or failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall
relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations hereunder only to the
extent, if at all, that it is actually and materially prejudiced by reason of
such delay or failure) and (ii) permit such indemnifying party to assume the
defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified
party; provided, however, that any Person entitled to indemnification
hereunder shall have the right to select and employ separate counsel and to
participate in the defense of such claim, but the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be at the expense of such Person unless (i) the indemnifying
party has agreed in writing to pay such fees or expenses, (ii) the
indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such claim
within a reasonable time after receipt of notice of such claim from the Person
entitled to indemnification hereunder and employ counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such Person or (iii) if in the reasonable opinion of outside
counsel to the indemnified party, there exists a conflict of interest between
the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in such proceeding. If the
indemnifying party assumes the defense, the indemnifying party shall not have
the right to settle such action without the consent of the indemnified party
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). No
indemnifying party shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving
by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of an unconditional
release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation without the
prior written consent of such indemnified party (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If such defense is not assumed
by the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any
liability for any settlement made without its prior written consent, but such
consent may not be unreasonably withheld. It is understood that the
indemnifying party or parties shall not, except as specifically set forth in
this Section 3.9.3, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings
in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees, disbursements or
other charges of more than one separate counsel admitted to practice in such
jurisdiction at any one time unless the employment of more than one counsel
has been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party or parties.









Section 3.9.4 Contribution. If, for any reason, the indemnification provided
for in Section 3.9.1 and Section 3.9.2 is unavailable to an indemnified party
(other than as a result of exceptions contained in Section 3.9.1 and Section
3.9.2) or insufficient in respect of any Losses referred to therein, then the
indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the
indemnified party as a result of such Loss in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the
one hand, and the indemnified party or parties, on the other hand, in
connection with the acts, statements or omissions that resulted in such
Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. In connection
with any Registration Statement filed with the SEC by the Company, the
relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and the indemnified
party, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or
the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and
such parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Parties
agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this
Section 3.9.4 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of
allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred
to in this Section 3.9.4. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled
to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a
result of the Losses referred to in Sections 3.9.1 and 3.9.2 shall be deemed
to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with
investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this Section 3.9.4, in connection with any Registration
Statement filed by the Company, a selling Holder of Registrable Securities
shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the dollar amount
of the net proceeds received by such holder under the sale of Registrable
Securities giving rise to such contribution obligation less any amounts paid
by such Holder pursuant to Section 3.9.2 and any amounts paid by such Holder
as a result of liabilities incurred under the underwriting agreement, if any,
related to such sale. In addition, in no event shall a Holder be required to
contribute pursuant to this Section 3.9.4 unless such Holder would have had an
indemnification obligation pursuant to Section 3.9.2, if such Section 3.9.2
were applicable, in respect of a Loss (or action in respect thereof) giving
rise to such contribution obligation. If indemnification is available under
this Section 3.9, the indemnifying parties shall indemnify each indemnified
party to the full extent provided in Sections 3.9.1 and 3.9.2 hereof without
regard to the provisions of this Section 3.9.4. The remedies provided for in
this Section 3.9 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies
which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.

Section 3.10. Rules 144 and 144A and Regulation S. The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to file the reports required to be filed by it under
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted
by the SEC thereunder (or, if the Company is not required to file such
reports, it will, upon the request of any Holder of Registrable Securities,
use reasonable best efforts to make publicly available such necessary
information for so long as necessary to permit sales that would otherwise be
permitted by this Agreement pursuant to Rule 144, Rule 144A or









Regulation S under the Securities Act, as such rules may be amended from time
to time or any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC),
provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to make any Adverse
Disclosure; and it will use reasonable best efforts to take such further
action as the Holders may reasonably request, all to the extent required from
time to time to enable the Holders to sell Registrable Securities without
Registration under the Securities Act in transactions that would otherwise be
permitted by this Agreement and within the limitation of the exemptions
provided by (i) Rules 144, 144A or Regulation S under the Securities Act, as
such rules may be amended from time to time, or (ii) any similar rule or
regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC. Upon the reasonable request of the
Holders, the Company will deliver a written statement as to whether it has
complied with such requirements and, if not, the specifics thereof.

Section 3.11. Existing Registration Statements. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary and subject to applicable law and regulation, the
Company may satisfy any obligation hereunder to file a Registration Statement
or to have a Registration Statement become effective by a specified date by
designating, by notice to the Holders, a Registration Statement that
previously has been filed with the SEC or become effective, as the case may
be, as the relevant Registration Statement for purposes of satisfying such
obligation, and all references to any such obligation shall be construed
accordingly; provided that such previously filed Registration Statement may be
amended or, subject to applicable securities laws, supplemented to add the
number of Registrable Securities, and, to the extent necessary, to identify as
selling stockholders those Holders demanding the filing of a Registration
Statement pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. To the extent this
Agreement refers to the filing or effectiveness of other Registration
Statements, by or at a specified time and the Company has, in lieu of then
filing such Registration Statements or having such Registration Statements
become effective, designated a previously filed or effective Registration
Statement as the relevant Registration Statement for such purposes, in
accordance with the preceding sentence, such references shall be construed to
refer to such designated Registration Statement, as amended.

Section 3.12. Standstill. For a period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending on the date that the Holders and their Affiliates collectively
beneficially own Registrable Securities representing less than five percent
(5.0%) of the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock (the "Restricted
Period"), none of the Holders or their respective Affiliates will in any
manner, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the
Company, (i) effect or seek, offer or propose (whether publicly or otherwise
and whether or not subject to conditions) to effect, or announce any intention
to effect or cause or participate in or in any way solicit, assist, facilitate
or encourage any other Person to effect or seek, offer or propose (whether
publicly or otherwise and whether or not subject to conditions) or announce
any intention to effect or cause or participate in: (a) the acquisition of, or
obtaining any economic interest in, any right to direct the voting or
disposition of, or any other right with respect to, any securities, bank debt,

exercising their rights under this Agreement.

recommended by the Board of Directors for election at









such meetings, (iii) in accordance with the recommendation of the Board of
Directors on any shareholder proposal that is put to a vote of shareholders at

any such delinquency is a result of errors in the historical financial

that may be available, each of the Parties shall be entitled to specific
performance of the obligations of the other Parties and, in addition, to such
other equitable remedies (including preliminary or temporary relief) as may be
appropriate in the circumstances. No delay of or omission in the exercise of
any right, power or remedy accruing to any Party as a result of any breach or
default by any other Party under this Agreement shall impair any such right,
power or remedy, nor shall it be construed as a waiver of or acquiescence in
any such breach or default, or of any similar breach or default occurring
later; nor shall any such delay, omission nor waiver of any single breach or
default be deemed a waiver of any other breach or default occurring before or
after that waiver.

Section 4.6. Amendments. This Agreement may be amended, modified, extended or
terminated, and the provisions hereof may be waived, only by an agreement in
writing signed by the Company and the Holders. In addition, each Party may
waive any right hereunder by an instrument in writing signed by such Party.

Section 4.7. Governing Law. This Agreement and all claims arising out of or
based upon this Agreement or relating to the subject matter hereof shall be

provision or rule that would cause the application of the domestic substantive
laws of any other jurisdiction.

proceeding or investigation arising out of or based upon this Agreement or
relating to the subject matter hereof, (ii) hereby waives to the extent not

immune from attachment or execution, that any such proceeding brought in one
of the above-named courts is improper, or that this Agreement or the subject
matter hereof or thereof may not be enforced in or by such court and (iii)
hereby agrees not to commence or maintain any action, claim, cause of action
or suit (in contract, tort or otherwise),









inquiry, proceeding or investigation arising out of or based upon this
Agreement or relating to the subject matter hereof or thereof other than
before one of the above-named courts nor to make any motion or take any other
action seeking or intending to cause the transfer or removal of any such
action, claim, cause of action or suit (in contract, tort or otherwise),
inquiry, proceeding or investigation to any court other than one of the above-
named courts whether on the grounds of inconvenient forum or otherwise.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any Party is or becomes a
party in any litigation in connection with which it may assert indemnification
rights set forth in this Agreement, the court in which such litigation is
being heard shall be deemed to be included in clause (i) above.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Party may commence and maintain an action
to enforce a judgment of any of the above-named courts in any court of

TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE OR ACTION, CLAIM, CAUSE OF
ACTION OR SUIT (IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE), INQUIRY, PROCEEDING OR
INVESTIGATION ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT
MATTER HEREOF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR
HEREAFTER ARISING. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INFORMED BY THE
OTHER PARTIES THAT THIS SECTION 4.9 CONSTITUTES A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT UPON
WHICH THEY ARE RELYING AND WILL RELY IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT. ANY
PARTY MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION 4.9 WITH ANY
COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF
ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

Section 4.10. Binding Effect, Etc. This Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement of the Parties with respect to its subject matter, supersedes all
prior or contemporaneous oral or written agreements or discussions with
respect to such subject matter, and shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Parties and thereto and their respective heirs,
representatives, successors and permitted assigns. Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, no Holder or other Party may assign any of its
respective rights or delegate any of its respective obligations under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any
attempted assignment or delegation in violation of the foregoing shall be null
and void.

Section 4.11. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
taken together shall constitute one instrument.









Section 4.12. Severability. In the event that any provision hereof would,
under applicable law, be invalid or unenforceable in any respect, such
provision shall be construed by modifying or limiting it so as to be valid and
enforceable to the maximum extent compatible with, and possible under,
applicable law. The provisions hereof are severable, and in the event any
provision hereof should be held invalid or unenforceable in any respect, it
shall not invalidate, render unenforceable or otherwise affect any other
provision hereof.
