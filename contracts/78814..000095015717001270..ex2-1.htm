or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, as the case may be and (b) the officers of the Company serving
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

  


 

  

Section 2.6 _Subsequent Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills
of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary
or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the
Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of either the Company or Sub acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of or in connection with the
Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the officers and directors of
the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to

  

  

  

 

13  

  

execute and deliver, in the name of and on behalf of either the Company or
Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and
do, in the name and on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all
such other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest,
perfect or confirm any and all right, title and interest in, to and under such
rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to
carry out this Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 2.7 _Conversion of Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of the Acquiror, Sub, the
Company or any holder of any Shares or any shares of capital stock of Sub:

  


 

  

(a) each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Cancelled Shares and any Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive the Closing Per Share Merger
Consideration, in cash, without interest, together with any amounts that may
be payable in respect of such Share from the Adjustment Escrow Account and the
Stockholder Representative Expense Holdback Amount as provided in this
Agreement and the Adjustment Escrow Agreement;

  


 

  

(b) each Share that is owned by the Acquiror or Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in
exchange therefor;

  


 

  

(c) each Share that is held in the treasury of the Company or owned by the
Company or any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in
exchange therefor (the Shares described in Section 2.7(b) and this Section
2.7(c), " _Cancelled Shares_ "); and

  


 

  

(d) each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one fully paid, validly issued and non-assessable share of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

Section 2.8 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares (other than Cancelled Shares) outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of
the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has properly demanded
appraisal for such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL ("
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the
right to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration unless and until such
holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his right to appraisal
and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder
fails to perfect or withdraws or loses his right to appraisal, such Dissenting
Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the portion of the Merger
Consideration, if any, to which such holder is entitled, without interest.
From and after the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall automatically
be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall give the Acquiror
(a) reasonably prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of Shares pursuant to the DGCL or any withdrawals of

  

  

  

 

14  

  

such demands received by the Company and (b) the opportunity to direct and
control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands;
_provided_ , that the Acquiror shall reasonably consult with the Company with
respect to any such negotiations and proceedings and the Company shall not be
required to pay any amounts prior to the Closing in settlement of any such
negotiations or proceedings. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of the Acquiror, make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, such demands.

  


 

  

Section 2.9 _Options_.

  


 

  

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding In-the-Money Option (whether
vested or unvested) shall accelerate and be deemed fully vested and shall be
cancelled, and each holder of such an Option shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of
Shares for which such Option is exercisable as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) the excess of the Closing Per Share Merger
Consideration over the per Share exercise price of such Option as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time. The holder of any In-the-Money Option
shall also be entitled to any amounts that may be payable in respect of such
Option from the Adjustment Escrow Account and the Stockholder Representative
Expense Holdback Amount as provided in this Agreement and the Adjustment
Escrow Agreement, at the respective times and subject to the contingencies
specified herein. The amounts described in this Section 2.9(a) shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such In-
the-Money Options.

  


 

  

(b) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Out-of-the-Money Option (whether
vested or unvested) shall be cancelled without consideration and shall be of
no further force and effect.

  


 

  

Section 2.10 _Payment for Shares and Options_.

  


 

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Acquiror shall designate a bank or trust
company that is approved by the Stockholder Representative (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to act as paying
agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") pursuant to a
paying agent agreement providing for, among other things, the matters set
forth in this Section 2.10 and otherwise reasonably satisfactory to the
parties hereto. Prior to the Effective Time, the Acquiror shall deposit with
the Paying Agent, for the benefit of holders of Shares (each, a "
_Stockholder_ ") and Persons that held In-the-Money Options as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time who are not current or former employees, cash in
an amount equal to (i) the Estimated Merger Consideration, _minus_ (ii) the
portion of the Option Payment Amount attributable to compensatory In-the-Money
Options held by current or former employees, _minus_ (iii) the Aggregate
Option Exercise Price _minus_ (iv) the aggregate Closing Per Share Merger
Consideration to be directly paid from the Acquiror to any Stockholder (the "
_Payment Fund_ "). The expenses of the Paying Agent shall be paid by the
Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be.

  


 

  

(b) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as
directed by the Acquiror or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation, in: (i) direct obligations of, or obligations the principal of
and interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by, the United States of
America with a remaining term at the time of acquisition

  

  

  

 

15  

  

thereof not in excess of 90 days, (ii) money market accounts or certificates
of deposit maturing within 90 days of the acquisition thereof and issued by a
bank or trust company organized under the laws of the United States of America
or a state thereof and having a combined capital surplus in excess of
$500,000,000, or (iii) commercial paper issued by a domestic corporation and
given a rating of no lower than A‑1 by Standard and Poor's Corporation or P‑1 by
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investments shall be paid as directed by the Acquiror or, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

(c) As part of the Merger Consideration, concurrently with the Effective Time,
the Acquiror shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Company the
portion of the Option Payment Amount attributable to compensatory In-the-Money
Options held by current or former employees, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event on or
prior to the second payroll date following the Closing Date), the Surviving
Corporation shall make payments to holders of such outstanding In-the-Money
Options as set forth in the first sentence of Section 2.9(a) utilizing the
Surviving Corporation's payroll system.

  


 

  

(d) No later than two Business Days after the Closing Date, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates at the address of such holder set forth on the
Closing Date Payment Schedule that, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
evidenced outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") and whose Shares were
converted with the right to receive the consideration described in Section
2.7(a), (i) a letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_
(the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment therefor. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with
such properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal, the holder of
such Certificate (other than any Stockholder who is to be directly paid from
the Acquiror) shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (as promptly
as practicable following such surrender, and in no event more than two
Business Days after such surrender, or in the case of any Stockholder that
surrenders a Certificate for cancellation, together with a duly executed
Letter of Transmittal, no later than three Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, no later than the first Business Day after the Closing Date) an amount
in cash equal to (A) the Closing Per Share Merger Consideration, _multiplied
by_ (B) the number of Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, without
interest, and such Certificate shall, upon such surrender, be cancelled. If
payment in respect of any Certificate is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name such Certificate is registered in the transfer records of
the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Acquiror and the Paying Agent that any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate have been paid or are not
applicable. Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 2.10, any Certificate (other than Certificates representing Cancelled
Shares and any Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed, at any time after the
Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the portion of the
Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto, in cash, without interest,
as contemplated herein. In addition, promptly following the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to make payments to
holders of In-the-

  

  

  

 

16  

  

Money Options (other than in respect of compensatory In-the-Money Options held
by current or former employees) as set forth in the first sentence of Section
2.9(a).

  


 

  

(e) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
updated to reflect the transfer of the Shares to the Acquiror in accordance
with the terms herein, and subsequently such books shall be closed and there
shall be no further registration of transfers of any shares of capital stock
thereafter on the records of the Company. If, after the Effective Time, a
Certificate (other than Certificates representing Cancelled Shares) is
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, it shall be cancelled
and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.10.

  


 

  

(f) All cash paid upon conversion of the Shares in accordance with the terms
of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such Shares. From and after the Effective Time, the
holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect to Shares
represented thereby, except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law.

  


 

  

(g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof in the form attached
to the Letter of Transmittal and, if required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the
Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the relevant portion of the Merger Consideration payable
in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.10(d) for Shares represented thereby.

  


 

  

(h) At any time following the expiration of 12 months after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent
to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect
thereto) which had been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not
been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and such funds shall thereafter
become the property of the Surviving Corporation. Thereafter, such holders
shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law) only as general creditors thereof
with respect to the applicable consideration payable as contemplated by this
Agreement upon due surrender of their Certificates, without any interest
thereon. Any portion of such remaining cash unclaimed by Stockholders as of a
date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

  


 

  

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none of the
parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable
to any Person if the Merger Consideration is delivered to a public official as
required by any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  


 

  

 

17  

  

(j) Any interest and other income resulting from investments of the Payment
Fund shall be treated as accrued by the Acquiror and, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

  


 

  

Section 2.11 _Closing Payments_. At the Closing, the Acquiror will make (or
cause to be made) the following payments, in each case by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated by the payee
in writing no later than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date:

  


 

  

(a) to the Paying Agent, an amount as specified in Section 2.10(a);

  


 

  

(b) to the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder Representative Expense
Holdback Amount;

  


 

  

(c) to the Escrow Agent, the Adjustment Escrow Amount, to be managed and paid
out by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the Adjustment Escrow
Agreement;

  


 

  

(d) to the Company, an amount equal to the portion of the Option Payment
Amount attributable to compensatory options held by current or former
employees, which amount shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation to the
holders of such outstanding In-the-Money Options as set forth in the first
sentence of Section 2.9(a) promptly following the Effective Time utilizing the
Surviving Corporation's payroll system;

  


 

  

(e) on behalf of the Company, the amount payable to each counterparty or
holder of Indebtedness identified on _Schedule 2.11(e)_ other than the
Retained Indebtedness on such schedule (which schedule shall be updated to
include any Indebtedness incurred after the date hereof) in order to fully
discharge such Indebtedness and terminate all applicable obligations and
liabilities of the Company and any of its Affiliates related thereto; and

  


 

  

(f) on behalf of the Company, an amount equal to the Estimated Transaction
Expenses, to each Person who is owed a portion thereof in the amounts set
forth next to such Person's name in the Preliminary Closing Statement.

  


 

  

Section 2.12 _Merger Consideration Adjustments_.

  


 

  

(a) At least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to the Acquiror a reasonably
detailed written statement (the " _Preliminary Closing Statement_ ") setting
forth a good-faith estimate, along with related calculations, of the Company's
(i) Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ "), (ii)
Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Indebtedness_ "), (iii) Cash (the " _Estimated
Cash_ "), and (iv) Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated Transaction
Expenses_ "), each determined as of 11:59 p.m. on the day prior to the Closing
Date (and, except for the Estimated Transaction Expenses, without giving
effect to the transactions contemplated hereby), based on the Company's books
and records and other information available at the Closing, calculated on a
basis consistent with _Schedule 2.12(a)_ and the accounting principles,
practices, assumptions, conventions and policies referred to therein,
including any exclusions or deviations from GAAP (the " _Applicable Accounting
Principles_ "). An illustrative example of a Preliminary Closing

  

  

  

 

18  

  

Statement and calculation of Net Working Capital, Indebtedness, Cash and
Transaction Expenses is set forth in _Schedule 2.12(a)_ (the " _Sample
Statement_ ").

  


 

  

(b) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, the Acquiror shall cause to be
prepared and delivered to the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of all the
Equityholders) a written statement (the " _Final Closing Statement_ ") that
shall include and set forth a calculation in reasonable detail of the actual
(i) Net Working Capital (" _Closing Net Working Capital_ "), (ii) Indebtedness
(" _Closing Indebtedness_ "), (iii) Cash (" _Closing Cash_ "), and (iv)
Transaction Expenses (" _Closing Transaction Expenses_ "), each determined as
of 11:59 p.m. on the day prior to the Closing Date (and, except for Closing
Transaction Expenses, without giving effect to the transactions contemplated
hereby). The Final Closing Statement shall be prepared on a basis consistent
with the Applicable Accounting Principles including the Sample Statement.

  


 

  

(c) The Final Closing Statement shall become final and binding on the 30th day
following delivery thereof, unless prior to the end of such period, the
Stockholder Representative delivers to the Acquiror a reasonably detailed
written notice of its disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") specifying
the nature and amount, along with related calculations, as applicable, of any
dispute as to the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Cash and/or Closing Transaction Expenses, as set forth in the Final Closing
Statement. The Stockholder Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with
all items and amounts of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness,
Closing Cash and/or Closing Transaction Expenses not specifically referenced
in the Notice of Disagreement, and such items and amounts shall not be subject
to review in accordance with Section 2.12(d).

  


 

  

(d) During the 30-day period following delivery of a Notice of Disagreement by
the Stockholder Representative to the Acquiror, the parties in good faith
shall seek to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with
respect to the calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Closing Transaction Expenses as specified
therein. Any disputed items resolved in writing between the Acquiror and the
Stockholder Representative within such 30 day period shall be final and
binding with respect to such items, and if the Stockholder Representative and
the Acquiror agree in writing on the resolution of each disputed item
specified by the Stockholder Representative in the Notice of Disagreement and
the amount of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Cash and/or Closing Transaction Expenses, the amounts so determined shall be
final and binding on the parties for all purposes hereunder. If the Acquiror
and the Stockholder Representative have not resolved all such differences by
the end of such 30-day period, the Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative
shall submit, in writing, to an independent public accounting firm (the "
_Independent Accounting Firm_ "), their briefs detailing their views as to the
correct nature and amount of each item in the Notice of Disagreement remaining
in dispute and the amounts of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness and/or Closing Cash, Closing Transaction Expenses, and the
Independent Accounting Firm shall make a written determination as to each such
disputed item in the Notice of Disagreement remaining in dispute and the
amount of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash
and/or Closing Transaction Expenses. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be
Deloitte LLP or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to act, such other
independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed in writing by the
Stockholder Representative and the Acquiror. The Acquiror and the Stockholder
Representative shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the

  

  

 

19  

  

Independent Accounting Firm to render a written decision resolving the matters
submitted to it within 30 days following the submission thereof. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall consider only those items and amounts in the
Acquiror's and the Stockholder Representative's respective calculations of the
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and/or Closing Cash Closing
Transaction Expenses that are identified as being items and amounts in the
Notice of Disagreement to which the Acquiror and the Stockholder
Representative have been unable to agree. The scope of the disputes to be
resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be limited to correcting
mathematical errors and determining whether the items and amounts in the
Notice of Disagreement remaining in dispute were determined in accordance with
the Applicable Accounting Principles and the Sample Statement and the
Independent Accounting Firm is not to make any other determination, including
any determination as to whether the Target Net Working Capital is correct,
adequate or sufficient. In resolving any disputed item, the Independent
Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value
for such item claimed by either party. The Independent Accounting Firm's
determination of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness,
Closing Cash and Closing Transaction Expenses shall be based solely on written
materials submitted by the Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative (i.e.,
not on independent review). The determination of the Independent Accounting
Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto and shall not be
subject to appeal or further review. Judgment may be entered upon the written
determination of the Independent Accounting Firm in accordance with Section
8.10.

  


 

  

(e) The costs of any dispute resolution pursuant to this Section 2.12,
including the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm and of any
enforcement of the determination thereof, shall be borne by the Acquiror and
the Stockholder Representative in inverse proportion as they may prevail on
the matters resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, which proportionate
allocation shall be calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative
dollar values of the amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the
Independent Accounting Firm at the time the determination of such firm is
rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. The fees and disbursements of
the Representatives of each party incurred in connection with the preparation
or review of the Final Closing Statement and preparation or review of any
Notice of Disagreement, as applicable, shall be borne by such party.

  


 

  

(f) The Acquiror, the Company and the Stockholder Representative will, and the
Acquiror will cause the Surviving Corporation (following the Closing through
the resolution of any adjustment to the Merger Consideration contemplated by
this Section 2.12) to, afford the other party and its Representatives
reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior
notice, to the personnel, properties, books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, as the case
may be, and to any other information reasonably requested for purposes of
preparing and reviewing the calculations contemplated by this Section 2.12.
Each party shall authorize its accountants to disclose work papers generated
by such accountants in connection with preparing and reviewing the
calculations specified in this Section 2.12; _provided_ , that such
accountants shall not be obligated to make any work papers available except in
accordance with such accountants' disclosure procedures and then only after
the non-client party has signed an agreement relating to access to such work
papers in form and substance acceptable to such accountants.

  

  

  

 

20  

  


 

  

(g) The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted, upwards or downwards, as
follows:

  


 

  

(i) For the purposes of this Agreement, the " _Net Adjustment Amount_ " means
an amount, which may be positive or negative, equal to (A) the Closing Net
Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.12 _minus_
the Estimated Net Working Capital, _plus_ (B) the Estimated Indebtedness
_minus_ the Closing Indebtedness as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 2.12, _plus_ (C) the Closing Cash as finally determined pursuant to
this Section 2.12 _minus_ the Estimated Cash, _plus_ (D) the Estimated
Transaction Expenses _minus_ the Closing Transaction Expenses as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 2.12;

  


 

  

(ii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is positive, the Merger Consideration shall
be adjusted upwards in an amount equal to the Net Adjustment Amount. In such
event, the Acquiror shall pay an aggregate amount equal to the Net Adjustment
Amount to (A) the Paying Agent for delivery to the Stockholders and Persons
that held In-the-Money Options as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
who are not current or former employees and (B) the Surviving Corporation for
delivery to the current or former employees that held In-the-Money Options as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time through the Surviving Corporation's
payroll system, which payments shall be made pro rata in accordance with each
holder's respective Fully Diluted Percentage; and

  


 

  

(iii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is negative (in which case the "Net
Adjustment Amount" for purposes of this clause (iii) shall be deemed to be
equal to the absolute value of such amount), the Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted downwards in an amount equal to the Net Adjustment Amount. In such
event, the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the Equityholders) and the
Acquiror shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to (A) if the Net Adjustment
Amount equals or exceeds the Adjustment Escrow Amount, promptly deliver to the
Acquiror the Adjustment Escrow Amount from the Adjustment Escrow Account, or
(B) if the Adjustment Escrow Amount exceeds the Net Adjustment Amount,
promptly deliver to the Acquiror the Net Adjustment Amount from the Adjustment
Escrow Account. In the case of clause (A) above, if the Net Adjustment Amount
exceeds the Adjustment Escrow Amount, at the Acquiror's request, each
Equityholder shall pay to the Stockholder Representative, for payment to the
Acquiror, such Equityholder's pro rata share of such excess in accordance with
such Equityholder's respective Fully Diluted Percentage, and the Stockholder
Representative shall deliver the aggregate amount so received by the
Stockholder Representative to the Acquiror within three Business Days of
receipt thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
account or accounts as may be designated in writing by the Acquiror. In the
case of clause (A) above, if the Net Adjustment Amount exceeds the Adjustment
Escrow Amount, and any Equityholder fails to timely pay its pro rata share of
such excess in accordance with such Equityholder's respective Fully Diluted
Percentage, the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to use all or a
portion of the Stockholder Representative Expense Holdback Amount to comply
with the provisions of this Section 2.12(g).

  


 

  

(iv) If (A) the Net Adjustment Amount is negative and (B) the Adjustment
Escrow Amount exceeds the absolute value of the Net Adjustment Amount, then
the Stockholder Representative and the Acquiror shall jointly instruct the
Escrow Agent to arrange

  

  

 

21  

  

for the distribution of such excess from the Adjustment Escrow Account to (1)
the Paying Agent for delivery to the Stockholders and Persons that held In-
the-Money Options as of immediately prior to the Effective Time who are not
current or former employees and (2) the Surviving Corporation for delivery to
the current or former employees that held In-the-Money Options as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, which payments shall be made pro rata
in accordance with their respective Fully Diluted Percentages, and no further
payment shall be payable by the Acquiror or the Stockholder Representative (on
behalf of the Stockholders) under this Section 2.12.

  


 

  

(v) Payments in respect of this Section 2.12(g) shall be made (A) in the case
of Stockholders and Persons that held In-the-Money Options as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time who are not current or former employees, within
three Business Days of final determination of the Net Adjustment Amount
pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.12 by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to such account or accounts as may be designated
in writing by the party entitled to such payment at least two Business Days
prior to such payment date and (B) in the case of the current or former
employees that held In-the-Money Options as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, on or prior to the second payroll date immediately following
the final determination of the Net Adjustment Amount pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 2.12 through the Surviving Corporation's payroll
system.

  


 

  

(vi) For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 2.12 is not intended to be used
to permit the introduction of different judgments, accounting methodologies
(including with respect to accruals and reserves), policies, principles,
practices, procedures or classifications for purposes of calculating amounts
referred to in this Section 2.12, or to adjust for any inconsistencies between
the Applicable Accounting Principles, on the one hand, and GAAP, on the other.

  


 

  

Section 2.13 _Stockholder Representative_.

  


 

  

(a) Immediately upon the approval of this Agreement by the requisite vote or
written consent of the Stockholders, each Stockholder and holder of Options
shall be deemed to have consented to the appointment of Littlejohn Fund IV,
L.P. as such Stockholder's representative and attorney-in-fact (the "
_Stockholder Representative_ "), with full power of substitution to act on
behalf of the Equityholders to the extent and in the manner set forth in this
Agreement and the Adjustment Escrow Agreement, including with respect to any
Actions or Judgments relating to Claims made by an Acquiror Indemnitee
pursuant to Article VIII hereof. All decisions, actions, consents and
instructions by the Stockholder Representative shall be binding upon all of
the Equityholders, and no Person shall have the right to object to, dissent
from, protest or otherwise contest the same. The Acquiror shall not have the
right to object to, dissent from, protest or otherwise contest the authority
of the Stockholder Representative. The Acquiror and Sub shall be entitled to
rely on any decision, action, consent or instruction of the Stockholder
Representative as being the decision, action, consent or instruction of the
Equityholders, and the Acquiror and Sub are hereby relieved from any liability
to any Person for acts done by them in accordance with any such decision, act,
consent or instruction. By their approval of this Agreement, the Stockholders

those that may arise in the future, against the Stockholder Representative for
any action or inaction taken or not taken by the Stockholder Representative in

  

  

 

22  

  

connection with such Person's capacity as Stockholder Representative except to
the extent that such action or inaction shall have been held by a court of
competent jurisdiction to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct.

  


 

  

(b) The Stockholder Representative shall have the right to recover from, in
its sole discretion, the Stockholder Representative Expense Holdback Amount
and amounts actually released by the Escrow Agent to the Stockholder
Representative from the Adjustment Escrow Account, prior to any distribution
to the Stockholders, the Stockholder Representative's documented reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the performance of its duties hereunder ("
_Charges_ "), including, without limitation, those resulting from the
employment of financial advisors, attorneys, auditors and other advisors and
agents assisting in the assessment of arbitration, litigation and settlement
of any disputes arising under this Agreement. In the event the remaining
Stockholder Representative Expense Holdback Amount is at any time insufficient
to satisfy the Charges, then each Equityholder will be obligated (severally)
to pay its Fully Diluted Percentage of such deficit. Any portion of the
Stockholder Representative Expense Holdback Amount that is remaining upon
completion of the Stockholder Representative's duties hereunder shall be
distributed by the Stockholder Representative to the holders of Shares and In-
the-Money Options in accordance with their respective Fully Diluted
Percentages.

  


 

  

(c) The Stockholder Representative may resign at any time, and may be removed
for any reason or no reason by the vote or written consent of Stockholders
holding a majority of the aggregate Fully Diluted Share Number at the
Effective Time (the " _Majority Holders_ "). In the event of the death,
incapacity, resignation or removal of the Stockholder Representative, a new
Stockholder Representative shall be appointed by the vote or written consent
of the Majority Holders. Notice of such vote or a copy of the written consent
appointing such new Stockholder Representative shall be sent to the Acquiror
and, after the Effective Time, to the Surviving Corporation, such appointment
to be effective upon the later of the date indicated in such consent or the
date such consent is received by the Acquiror and, after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

(d) The approval of this Agreement by the requisite vote or written consent of
Stockholders shall also be deemed to constitute approval of all arrangements
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby and to the provisions hereof
binding upon the Stockholders.

  


 

  

 

23  

  

Section 2.14 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
the Acquiror, Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent, the
Stockholder Representative, the Escrow Agent and the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it
is required by any Law to deduct and withhold with respect to Taxes and any
amounts so withheld shall be promptly remitted to the appropriate Governmental
Authority. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid to the
appropriate Governmental Authority in accordance with all applicable Law, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

outstanding capital stock of, or any other equity or ownership interests in,
the Company, (ii) no Person not disclosed in the Closing Date Payment Schedule
will be the record owner of, or have a right to acquire from the Company any

Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will,

any covenant, condition, restriction, right-of-way, easement or other

other than the applicable Lease. The Company and its Subsidiaries use and
occupy the Leased Real Property exclusively for the conduct of the business.

condition and repair, structurally sound and has been reasonably maintained
consistent standards generally followed in the industry (giving due account to
the age and length of use of same, ordinary wear and tear excepted). The
Leased Real Property, and its continued use, occupancy and operation as
currently used, occupied or operated, does not constitute a non-conforming use
under applicable building, zoning, subdivision, land use or similar applicable
Laws. There is no condemnation or other proceeding in eminent domain, pending
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing affecting any
Leased Real Property or any portion thereof or interest therein.

terminate any Lease affiliated with any such Contract or (ii) assign any such

Section 5.2 _Covenants Regarding Information_.

  


 

  

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, upon reasonable notice, the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall (i) afford the Acquiror and its
Representatives (including, for purposes of this Section 5.2, any underwriters
and financing sources) and any insurers and underwriters in respect of the RandW
Insurance Policy reasonable access to the Representatives, employees,
properties, assets, offices, plants and other facilities, and to all existing
books, Contracts, projections, plans, records, filings, submissions, Tax
Returns, work papers, records and other documents and information of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) furnish the Acquiror with such
financial, operating and other data and information as the Acquiror may
reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such access or
furnishing of information shall be conducted at the Acquiror's expense, during
normal business hours, under the supervision of the Company's personnel and in
such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the normal operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to disclose any information to the Acquiror or its Representatives if
the Company determines, in its reasonable judgment after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that (A) such disclosure would jeopardize any attorney-
client or other legal privilege, (B) such disclosure would contravene any
applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or binding Contract entered into prior to the
date hereof or (C) such information is pertinent to any Action in which the
Company or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Acquiror or any of
its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties. The Company and its
Subsidiaries will each use commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate
substitute arrangements and obtain consents to permit reasonable disclosure
under circumstances in which the restrictions in the preceding sentence apply.

  


 

  

(b) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made against or
incurred by the Stockholders (as they relate to the Company and its
Subsidiaries), the Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Corporation to (i)
retain the books and records relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries
relating to periods prior to the Closing for the applicable period required by
the Acquiror's record retention policies and (ii) for a period of seven years
after the Closing, afford the Stockholder Representative, upon reasonable
notice, reasonable access (including the right to make, at the Stockholder
Representative's expense, photocopies) to such books and records retained in
accordance with clause (i) solely for such purpose; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (x) any such access or furnishing of information shall be conducted at
the applicable Stockholder Representative's expense, during normal business
hours, under the supervision of the Surviving Corporation's personnel and in
such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the normal operations of
the Surviving Corporation, (y) such access shall be subject to the
Equityholders'

  

  

 

52  

  

obligations to keep such information confidential pursuant to Section 8.21 and
shall be limited to information required in connection with the resolutions of
such claims and (z) the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to
disclose any information (I) if the Surviving Corporation determines, in its
reasonable judgment after consultation with outside legal counsel, that such
disclosure would (A) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege
or (B) contravene any applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or binding Contract
entered into prior to the date hereof, (II) if the parties are adverse parties
in any Action and such information is pertinent thereto, or (III) that should
not be disclosed due to its competitively sensitive nature. The Company and
its Subsidiaries will each use commercially reasonable efforts at the expense
of the Stockholder Representative to make appropriate substitute arrangements
and obtain consents to permit reasonable disclosure under circumstances in
which the restrictions in the preceding sentence apply.

  


 

  

Section 5.3 _Stockholder Consent_. (a) As soon as practicable following the
date of this Agreement, the Company shall take all action necessary in
accordance with the DGCL and the Company's certificate of incorporation and
bylaws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the
Company's Stockholders for Stockholders to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval or solicit the written consent of Stockholders with respect thereto,
and to obtain executed Restrictive Covenant Agreements and Stockholder Consent
and Agreements from the Persons set forth on _Schedule 5.3(a)_ of the
Disclosure Schedules.

  


 

  

(b) Promptly following, but in no event more than five Business Days after,
receipt of the written consents pursuant to clause (a), the Company shall
prepare and mail a notice (the " _Stockholder Notice_ ") to every Stockholder
that did not execute a written consent in accordance with Section 228(e) of
the DGCL and the bylaws of the Company. The Stockholder Notice shall include
therewith a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL, and shall be sufficient in form
and substance to start the 20-day period during which a Stockholder must
demand appraisal of such Shares as contemplated by Section 262(d)(2) of the
DGCL. All materials submitted to the Stockholders in accordance with this
Section 5.3 will be subject to the Acquiror's advance review and reasonable
approval.

  


 

  

Section 5.4 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Until the Closing, each party
hereto shall promptly notify the other parties in writing (and will
subsequently keep the other informed on a current basis of any material
developments related to such notice) of any fact, change, condition,
circumstance or occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event of which it is aware
that will or is reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions set forth
in Article VI of this Agreement becoming incapable of being satisfied.

  


 

  

Section 5.5 _Takeover Statutes_. If any state Takeover Statute or similar Law
shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreements, each of the Company and the Acquiror and their
respective board of directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions
as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby or thereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby.

  

  


 

  

 

53  

  

Section 5.6 _Stock Option Plan_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take any actions necessary or appropriate under the NGS Holdings, Inc.
Equity Incentive Plan to provide that, (i) at the Effective Time, each then
outstanding In-the-Money Option shall terminate and the holder thereof shall
have the right to receive the consideration set forth in Section 2.9 in
respect thereof and each then-outstanding Out-of-the-Money Option shall be
cancelled without consideration and shall be of no further force and effect
and (ii) following the Effective Time, no Company Personnel shall have any
right under the NGS Holdings, Inc. Equity Incentive Plan or any other Employee
Plan to acquire any capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any other equity interest therein.

  


 

  

Section 5.7 _Employee Benefits_.

  


 

  

(a) The Acquiror shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries who are employed in the United States (the "
_Affected Employees_ "), for a period of one year following the Effective
Time, compensation and employee benefits that in the aggregate are at least
comparable to those currently provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to
such employees, and the Acquiror shall cause to be provided to any Affected
Employee who is terminated during such one-year period following the Effective
Time severance benefits at least comparable to those currently provided by the
Company and its Subsidiaries to similarly situated employees as set forth in
_Schedule 5.7(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedules. From and after the Effective
Time, the Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries,
as applicable, to honor the terms of existing employment, severance, change of
control and salary continuation agreements between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any current or former officer, director, employee or
consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or group of such
officers, directors, employees or consultants, in each case, to the extent the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries would have been required to perform such
agreement and as such agreement may be amended from time to time in accordance
with its terms.

  


 

  

(b) The Acquiror shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor all
unused vacation, holiday, sickness and personal days accrued by the employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the policies and practices of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. In the event of any change in the welfare
benefits provided to any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under any plan, the Acquiror shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the Affected Employees and their covered dependents under such
plan (except to the extent that such conditions, exclusions or waiting periods
would apply under the Company's or such Subsidiary's then existing plans
absent any change in such welfare coverage plan) and (ii) provide each
Affected Employee and his or her covered dependents with credit for any co-
payments and deductibles paid prior to any such change in coverage in
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under such
new or changed plan. The Acquiror shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, provide each Affected Employee with credit for all service
with the Company and its Affiliates for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, level of benefits and vesting (but not for purposes of (A) early
retirement eligibility and (B) benefits accruals under any defined benefit
pension plan) under each employee benefit plan, policy, program or arrangement
in which such Affected Employee is eligible to participate, except to the
extent that it would result

  

  

 

54  

  

in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of services and
no such service shall be recognized for purposes of any employee benefit plan,
policy, program or arrangement that is grandfathered or frozen with respect to
levels of benefits or participation.

  


 

  

(c) If requested by the Acquiror in writing at least five Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, the Company shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
terminate any and all Employee Plans intended to qualify under Section 401(k)
of the Code (the " _401(k) Plan(s)_ "), effective not later than the Business
Day immediately preceding the Closing Date. In the event that the Acquiror
requests that such 401(k) Plan(s) be terminated, the Company shall provide the
Acquiror with evidence that such 401(k) Plan(s) have been terminated pursuant
to resolution of the Company's board of directors not later than two Business
Days immediately preceding the Closing Date. In such event, the Acquiror shall
permit Affected Employees with account balances under the 401(k) Plan(s) to
directly roll over their entire accounts (including any loan notes) to a tax-
qualified defined contribution plan maintained by the Acquiror or an Affiliate
so long as such direct rollover is elected by the applicable Affected Employee
in accordance with applicable Law (and, in the case of loan notes, so long as
such loan notes are permitted under the terms of Acquiror's or its Affiliate's
tax qualified defined contribution plan).

  


 

  

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.7 shall be construed to (i) create any
third party beneficiary rights in any Company Personnel (including any
dependent or beneficiary thereof), including in respect of continued
employment for specified period or compensation, benefits or other terms and
conditions of employment that may be provided by the Acquiror, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries or under any employee benefit plans
they maintain, (ii) require the Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation to
continue any specific employee benefit plans be treated as an establishment,
adoption or amendment of any particular employee benefit plan, or (iv) prevent
the Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries from
amending or terminating any of their benefit plans or any Employee Plan in
accordance with its terms.

  


 

  

Section 5.8 _Confidentiality_. Each of the parties shall hold, and shall cause
its Representatives to hold in confidence all documents and information
furnished to it by or on behalf of any other party to this Agreement in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the terms of
the non-disclosure agreement dated May 5, 2017, as amended on July 14, 2017
between the Acquiror and the Company (together, the " _Non-Disclosure
Agreement_ "), which shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing
Date, at which time such Non-Disclosure Agreement and the obligations of the
parties under this Section 5.8 shall terminate. If for any reason this
Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing Date, the Non-Disclosure
Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms.

  


 

  

Section 5.9 _Consents and Filings; Further Assurances_.

  


 

  

(a) Each of the parties shall cooperate with each other and use commercially
reasonable efforts, subject to Section 5.9(b), to take, or cause to be taken,
all appropriate action and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement and applicable
Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements as promptly as

  

  

  

 

55  

  

practicable, including to (i) obtain from Governmental Authorities all
consents, approvals, authorizations, waivers, qualifications and orders as are
necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and (ii) promptly (and in no event
later than five Business Days after the date hereof) make all necessary
filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to
this Agreement required under the HSR Act or any other applicable Law. The
Acquiror shall pay all filing fees and other charges for the filing under the
HSR Act by all parties.

  


 

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of the parties' undertaking pursuant to
Section 5.9(a), the Acquiror agrees to use, during the period prior to the
Termination Date, its reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law
reasonably asserted by any Governmental Authority so as to enable the parties
hereto to expeditiously close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements as promptly as practicable. In addition, the
Acquiror shall use its reasonable best efforts to defend through litigation on
the merits any claim asserted in court by any Governmental Authority in order
to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Judgment (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the Closing by the
Termination Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
nothing in this Section 5.9 shall require the Acquiror to propose, negotiate,
commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise,
(i) the sale, divesture, licensing or disposition of any of its assets,
properties or businesses (or portion thereof) or of the assets, properties or
businesses to be acquired by it pursuant hereto, or (ii) any regulatory
conditions, undertakings, limitations or behavioral remedies with respect to
the Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries (including after the Closing, the
Surviving Corporation) or the ownership or conduct of its business following
Closing, and the Company and its Representatives shall not propose or agree to
any such consent decree or hold separate order without the Acquiror's prior
written consent.

  


 

  

(c) Each of the parties shall promptly notify the other parties of any
communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental
Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and
permit the other parties to review in advance any proposed communication by
such party to any Governmental Authority. No party to this Agreement shall
agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect
of any filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the
other parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate
at such meeting. Subject to the Non-Disclosure Agreement and the obligation of
the Company and its Representatives to keep all such information confidential
and to not use such information for any other purpose, the parties will
coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information
and providing such assistance as the other parties may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any
applicable waiting periods including under the HSR Act. Subject to the Non-
Disclosure Agreement and the obligation of the Company and its Representatives
to keep all such information confidential and to not use such information for
any other purpose, the parties will provide each other with copies of all
correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of
its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  


 

  

 

56  

  

(d) Certain consents and waivers with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement may be required from parties to contracts to which the
Company or a Subsidiary of the Company is a party that have not been and may
not be obtained. Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates shall have any
liability to the Acquiror arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain
any consents or waivers that may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or because of the termination of
any contract as a result thereof.

  


 

  

(e) The Company shall (i) inform the Acquiror as soon as reasonably
practicable of any material communication (written or oral) between the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (A) any Postal Authority concerning any
Material Contract with such Postal Authority or concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (B) solely with respect to the Leased Real
Property set forth on _Schedule 5.9(e)(i)_ of the Disclosure Schedules, the
lessor or any other third party associated with the development and
construction (including any engineers, contractors and consultants) concerning
the development or construction of such Leased Real Property (including by
providing the Acquiror with copies of specifications and plans regarding any
Leased Real Property) or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(C) any lessor of any of the Leased Real Properties set forth on _Schedule
5.9(e)(ii)_ of the Disclosure Schedules concerning any renewal of the
applicable Lease or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii)
to the extent reasonably practicable, provide the Acquiror with a reasonable
opportunity to provide the Company feedback on any such communication. For the
avoidance of doubt, material communications shall only include communications
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
Postal Authority, lessor or other Person described in the foregoing clauses
(A), (B) and (C), respectively, on the other hand, concerning the matters
described in the foregoing clauses (A), (B) and (C), as applicable.

  


 

  

Section 5.10 _Public Announcements_. On and after the date hereof and through
the Closing Date, the parties shall consult with each other before issuing,
and give each other the reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any
press release, employee announcement or otherwise making any public statements
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
none of the parties shall issue any press release, employee announcement or
make any public statement regarding the transactions contemplated hereby prior
to obtaining the other parties' written approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, except that no such approval
shall be necessary to the extent disclosure may be required by applicable Law
or any listing agreement of any party hereto.

  


 

  

Section 5.11 _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification_.

  


 

  

(a) The Acquiror agrees that all rights to indemnification or exculpation now
existing in favor of the directors, officers, employees and agents of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, solely with respect to actions and
omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date, as provided in the Company's or
such Subsidiary's certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other similar
governing documents in effect as of the date hereof, shall survive the Closing
and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than six
years and that the Company and its Subsidiaries will perform and discharge the
obligations to provide such indemnity and exculpation after the Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification and

  

  

 

57  

  

exculpation in respect of any Action arising out of or relating to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date and asserted or made
within such six-year period shall continue until the final disposition of such
Action. From and after the Closing, the Acquiror shall not, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation)
not to, amend, repeal or otherwise modify the indemnification provisions of
the Surviving Corporation's certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other
similar governing documents as in effect as of the date hereof, solely with
respect to actions and omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at
the Closing were directors, officers, employees, or agents of the Company or
its Subsidiaries.

  


 

  

(b) For a period of six years from the Closing Date, the Acquiror shall either
cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries,
solely with respect to actions and omissions occurring prior to the Closing
Date, or cause to be provided substitute policies or purchase or cause the
Company to purchase, a "tail policy" in either case of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are at least as
favorable as the policy currently in effect with respect to actions and
omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that
after the Closing, the Acquiror and the Company shall not be required to pay
with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any one policy year
annual premiums in excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid by the
Company in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto,
but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for
such amount; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the Company purchases a "tail
policy" and the coverage thereunder costs more than 300% of the current annual
premium, the Company shall purchase the maximum amount of coverage that can be
obtained for 300% of the current annual premium. The fees, costs and expenses
incurred in connection with such "tail policy" shall be paid by or on behalf
of the Company and shall be deemed a Transaction Expense.

  


 

  

(c) The Acquiror covenants, for itself and its Affiliates, successors and
assigns, that it and they shall not institute any Action in any court or
before any administrative agency or before any other tribunal against any of
the current directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in their capacity
as such, with respect to any liabilities, actions or causes of action,
judgments, claims or demands of any nature or description (consequential,
compensatory, punitive or otherwise), in each such case solely to the extent
resulting from their approval of this Agreement or their approval of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  


 

  

(d) In the event the Acquiror, the Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then and in either such case, the
Acquiror shall make proper provision so that the successors and assigns of the
Acquiror or the Company, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.11.

  


 

  

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.11 shall survive the consummation of the
Closing and continue for the periods specified herein. This Section 5.11 is
intended to benefit the directors, officers, employees and agents of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective heirs, successors and
assigns, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this

  

  

 

58  

  

Section 5.11 (whether or not parties to this Agreement). Each of the Persons
referenced in the immediately preceding sentence are intended to be third
party beneficiaries of this Section 5.11.

  


 

  

Section 5.12 _Resignations_. As requested by the Acquiror, prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to the Acquiror the resignations of
all the directors and officers of each of its Subsidiaries, in each case
serving immediately prior to the Effective Time, which resignations shall be
effective at the Effective Time.

  


 

  

Section 5.13 _Transfer Taxes_. Any and all transfer, sales, use, value added,
excise, stock transfer, stamp, recording, registration and any similar Taxes
(" _Transfer Taxes_ ") that become payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be borne equally by the Acquiror and the
Equityholders, and the Acquiror shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be
prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed with respect
to Transfer Taxes. The Stockholder Representative shall cooperate with the
Acquiror in preparing, executing and filing any Tax Returns with respect to
such Transfer Taxes.

  


 

  

Section 5.14 _Exclusive Dealing_. Between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, and shall cause
their respective Representatives and Affiliates not to, take, directly or
indirectly, any action to initiate, assist, facilitate, respond to, solicit,
negotiate, encourage (including by way of furnishing information), discuss,
accept or otherwise pursue any offer or inquiry from any Person (a) to engage
in any Business Combination with any Person other than the Acquiror and its
Affiliates, or (b) to reach any agreement or understanding (whether or not
such agreement or understanding is oral, absolute, revocable, contingent or
conditional) for, or otherwise attempt to consummate, any Business Combination
other than the transactions with the Acquiror contemplated hereby. The Company
agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will immediately cease, and will cause
each of their respective Representatives and Affiliates to immediately cease,
all discussions and negotiations with any Person (other than the Acquiror and
its Affiliates) concerning a Business Combination.

  


 

  

Section 5.15 _Closing Date Payment Schedule_. At least three Business Days
prior to the Closing, the Company shall prepare and deliver to the Acquiror a
schedule setting forth as of the Closing Date, the calculation of the
Estimated Merger Consideration and the Closing Per Share Merger Consideration
and to the extent applicable for each holder of Shares or Options, (i) such

(iv) the aggregate Closing Per Share Merger Consideration to be paid to such
holder at the Closing pursuant to Section 2.7(a) and the aggregate portion of
the Option Payment Amount to be paid to such holder at the Closing pursuant to

Date Payment Schedule_ "). The Company may update the Closing Date Payment
Schedule from time to time prior to the Closing, and shall provide the
Acquiror with a final Closing Date Payment Schedule prior to the Closing.

  


 

  

Section 5.16 _Section 280G Matters_. The Company shall take all necessary
actions (including obtaining any required waivers or consents from
"disqualified individuals" (as defined in Treasury Regulation 1.280G-1)) to
submit for approval or disapproval, in a manner that

  

  

 

59  

  

satisfies 280G(b)(5) of the Code and the final Treasury Regulations issued
thereunder, the right of each disqualified individual to receive or retain, as
applicable, that portion of any payments and benefits that, together with any
other payments and benefits the disqualified individual may become entitled to
receive that may be considered "parachute payments" under Section 280G(b)(2)
of the Code, exceeds 299% of such disqualified individual's "base amount" (as
defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code). No later than two Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to the Acquiror evidence

interpreting the terms "material" or "Material Adverse Effect" or other
similar terms in this Agreement.

  


 

  

 

67  

  

Section 8.12 _Personal Liability_. This Agreement shall not create or be
deemed to create or permit any personal liability or obligation on the part of

Section 8.13 _Assignment; Successors_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the

wholly owned U.S. Subsidiary of the Acquiror and (ii) in the case of Sub, to
the Acquiror or to any direct or indirect wholly owned U.S. Subsidiary of the
Acquiror; _provided_ , that no such assignment shall relieve the Acquiror or
Sub, as applicable, of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

  


 

  

Section 8.14 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
Accordingly, each of the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of
the terms hereof, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement, and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, _provided_ ,
that if jurisdiction is not then available in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware, then in any federal court located in the State of Delaware,
or if jurisdiction is not then available in both the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware and the federal courts within the State of Delaware, any
other Delaware state court, and, in each case, any appellate court therefrom,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at
law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in
any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and
(b) any requirement under any law to post security as a prerequisite to
obtaining equitable relief.

Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement refer to United States dollars, which is

Section 8.16 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction so long
as the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is
not affected in any manner materially adverse to either party, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as
negotiated

  

  

 

68  

  

by the parties in good faith so as to effect the original intent of the

Section 8.20 _Legal Representation_.

  


 

  

(a) The Acquiror, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation), acknowledges that Gibson Dunn and Crutcher
LLP (" _Gibson Dunn_ ") acts or has acted as counsel for the Stockholders, the
Stockholder Representative and the Company and may continue to represent the
Stockholders, the Stockholder Representative or any of their respective
Affiliates with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Accordingly, the Acquiror, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation), consents
to such representation and waives any conflict that may result therefrom,
_provided_ , that such waiver is conditioned on (i) no Person from Gibson Dunn
who is currently working on, or who has in the past five years worked on, any
of the Acquiror's or its current or past Affiliates' matters representing the
Stockholders, the Stockholder Representative, (prior to the Closing) the
Company, or any of their respective Affiliates in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ( _provided_ ,
that those Gibson Dunn Persons approved in writing by the Acquiror may so
represent such Persons), and (ii) Gibson Dunn not representing the
Stockholders, the Stockholder Representative or (prior to the Closing) the
Company, or any of their respective Affiliates in connection with any dispute
(including any Action but excluding any dispute regarding the Final Closing
Statement) arising from this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

  


 

  

(b) The Acquiror, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation), acknowledges and agrees that all
confidential communications between the Stockholders, the Stockholder
Representative, the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective
their Affiliates, on the one hand, and Gibson Dunn, on the other hand, in the
course of Gibson Dunn's engagement in connection with this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (the
" _Acquisition Engagement_ "), and any attendant attorney-client privilege,
attorney work product protection, and expectation of client confidentiality
applicable thereto, shall be deemed to belong

  

  

 

69  

  

solely to the Stockholders and the Stockholder Representative, and not to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and shall not pass to or be claimed, held, or
used by the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates (including after the Closing,
the Surviving Corporation). Accordingly, the Acquiror and its Affiliates
(including after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) shall not have
ownership of any such communications (or to the files of Gibson Dunn relating
to the Acquisition Engagement), regardless of such communications may be
stored or located, and the Acquiror, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
(including after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) irrevocably waives
any right it may have to obtain such communications or other information or
documentation relating to the Acquisition Engagement on the basis of any
purported ownership; _provided_ , that nothing herein shall require the
Acquiror and its Affiliates to destroy communications already in its
possession. The Acquiror hereby agrees not to assert, and to cause each of its
Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) not to
assert, any attorney-client privilege held by the Company and its
Subsidiaries, or any officer, employee, director or manager thereof, with
respect to any communication occurring with Gibson Dunn and relating to the
Acquisition Engagement, it being the intention of the parties that all such
rights to such attorney-client privilege and to control such attorney-client
privilege shall be retained by the Stockholders and the Stockholder
Representative, _provided_ , that all such communications shall be kept
confidential and this Section 8.20 shall not constitute or be construed as a
waiver or release of Gibson Dunn's obligation to keep confidential any
communication or information in its possession.

  


 

  

Section 8.21 _Agreements by the Equityholders_. By the acceptance of any
portion of the Merger Consideration or the acceptance of a right to receive
any portion of the Closing Per Share Merger Consideration, such Equityholder:

  


 

  

(a) approves, consents to and agrees to be bound by all provisions of this
Agreement applicable to the Equityholders, including the determination and

treatment of Options pursuant to Section 2.9, the appointment and
authorization of the Stockholder Representative pursuant to Section 2.13;

  


 

  

(b) effective as of the Closing Date, on behalf of such Equityholder and its
past, present or future agents, partners, heirs, officers, directors,
equityholders, Subsidiaries and Affiliates and each of their respective
successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Equityholder Releasors_ ") hereby
(i) irrevocably and unconditionally releases, acquits and forever discharges,
to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the Surviving Corporation, the
Subsidiaries of the Company, the Company, the Acquiror, Sub and each of their
respective past, present or future successors, assigns, employees, agents,
equityholders, members, partners, officers, managers, directors, counsel,
Subsidiaries and Affiliates (collectively, the " _Acquiror Releasees_ "), of
and from any and all Actions, Judgments and Losses of any kind, nature and
description whatsoever, (including attorneys' and other professional fees and
expenses), whether now known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, which such
Equityholder Releasor or its successors or assigns ever had, now has or may in
the future have on or by reason of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever
related to such Equityholder's investment in or ownership of (or purported
investment in or ownership of) the Shares or Options, as applicable, or any
other equity interest held (or purported to be held) by such Equityholder with
respect to the Company or any of its

  

  

 

70  

  

Subsidiaries or their respective businesses through the Closing Date or the
transactions contemplated hereby prior to or on the Closing Date, and any
rights under the NGS Holdings, Inc. Equity Incentive Plan and the
Stockholders' Agreement, except for such Equityholder's rights and interests
under the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Letters of Transmittal
and the Ancillary Agreements, _provided_ , that the foregoing clause (i) shall
not apply to any Losses or claims made by an Equityholder in its capacity as a
current or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries against
an Acquiror Releasee arising out of or relating to the employment, termination
of employment, or compensation or benefits in respect thereof, and (ii) agrees
not to, and agrees to cause its respective agents, partners, heirs, officers,
directors, equityholders, Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and each of their
respective successors and assigns, not to, assert any claim released in the
foregoing against the Acquiror Releasees; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding
the foregoing, each Equityholder Releasor retains and does not release its
rights and interests under the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Letters of Transmittal, the Ancillary Agreements or, to the extent applicable,
any director and officer indemnification insurance policy;

  


 

  

(c) agrees that, as of the Effective Time, the Stockholders' Agreement shall
be terminated and, except as otherwise expressly provided therein (including
with respect to any provisions therein which expressly survive the termination
thereof (including the provisions set forth in Section 11 thereof)), shall
have no further force or effect;

  


 

  

(d) agrees, for a period of five years following the Closing Date, to keep,

relating to the Acquiror, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries and
their businesses, including trade secrets, pricing policies, marketing plans
or strategies, product development plans, business acquisition plans
(including identified acquisition targets), inventions, carrier and customer
lists, and including any information furnished pursuant to Section 5.2(a), and
shall not disclose such information to any other Person; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this Section 8.21 shall not apply (i) with respect to any
Littlejohn Party (other than Persons described in clause (ii) of such
definition), Paribas North America, Inc. or Clarendon Resources IV, LLC, to
information regarding the financial performance of the Company provided to
current or potential limited partners, co-investors and Representatives in
connection with capital raising activities or reporting obligations (so long
as, in each case, such disclosure shall not be used in a manner competitive to
the interests of the Company or involve the disclosure of Trade Secrets of the
Company, and is effected in a manner consistent with customary practices,
including with respect to confidentiality) or (ii) to any information that (A)
is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of
disclosure in violation of this Section 8.21, (B) was available to such
Equityholder on a non-confidential basis prior to the disclosure of such
confidential information to such Equityholder, provided that the source of
such information was not known by such Equityholder or any of its
Representatives, after reasonable inquiry, to be bound by a confidentiality
obligation with respect to such information, (C) becomes available after the
Closing Date to such Equityholder on a non-confidential basis from a Person
who, to the knowledge of such Equityholder, is not otherwise bound by any
obligation of confidentiality, or (D) is independently developed by such

represent all equity interests of the Company owned by such Equityholder, (ii)
such Equityholder is the record and beneficial owner of, and has good and
valid title to, such Shares and the Certificates representing such Shares,
free and clear of all Encumbrances, proxies, voting trusts or agreements,
understandings or arrangements, and has the sole power (without the consent of
any other Person) to transfer, vote and execute stockholder written consents
with respect to such Shares, and no other Person has any right or interest to
acquire or vote any such Shares and (iii) assuming that the Acquiror has the
requisite power and authority to be the lawful owner of the Shares, at the
Effective Time, good and valid title to such Shares will pass to the Acquiror,
free and clear of all Encumbrances, proxies, voting trusts or agreements,
understandings or arrangements; and

Closing Per Share Merger Consideration represents full and final payment in
respect of such Equityholder's Shares or any other claimed equity interest of
the Company and (ii) so long as the Acquiror, Sub and the Surviving
Corporation distribute the Closing Per Share Merger Consideration in
accordance with the terms hereof, the Acquiror, Sub, the Surviving Corporation
and their respective Affiliates are released with respect to liabilities
arising from any calculation of the Closing Per Share Merger Consideration by
the Company in a manner inconsistent with the Company's certificate of
incorporation.
