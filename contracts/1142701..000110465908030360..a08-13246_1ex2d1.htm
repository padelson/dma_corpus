Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to

receive, subject to paragraphs (i) and (ii) below of this _Section 4.2(b)_,
(x) $7.34 in cash, without interest (the " **Cash Merger Consideration**
"), (y) 0.4087 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share ("
**Purchaser Common Stock** ") of Purchaser, together with the applicable
preferred stock purchase right under the Rights Agreement (the " **Rights
Agreement** "), dated as of November 15, 2001, as amended as of April 29,
2003, and as it may be further amended or modified from time to time, by and
between Purchaser and Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (successor in
interest to U.S. Stock Transfer Corporation), as rights agent (the " **Stock
Merger Consideration** ") and (z) $3.31 principal amount of 13%
senior secured notes due 2013 of Purchaser (the " **Purchaser Notes** ") to
be issued under and governed by an indenture (the " **New** **Indenture** ")
to be entered into by and among Purchaser, the Subsidiaries of Purchaser that
are guarantors of the Purchaser Notes and a trustee selected by Purchaser and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " **Notes Trustee** ") which
shall include the terms and provisions set forth in the Description of Notes
(the " **Description of Notes** ") annexed as Exhibit C hereto (the " **Notes
Merger Consideration** , and together with the Stock Merger Consideration and
Cash Merger Consideration, the " **Merger Consideration** "), payable to the
holder thereof upon surrender of the certificate formerly representing such
share of Company Common Stock (or, in the case of uncertificated shares,
evidence of such share of Company Common Stock in book-entry form) in the
manner provided in _Section 4.3_, and no other consideration shall be
delivered or deliverable on or in exchange therefor.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing:

  



  

(i) At any one time prior to the earlier of (a) the date the definitive
Proxy/Prospectus is mailed to the stockholders of the Company and (b) the
105th day after the date hereof, upon written notice to the Company (a "
**Substitution Notice** "), Purchaser shall have the right in its
sole discretion to increase the Cash Merger Consideration by $2.81 (and pay
related fees and expenses) ( _i.e._ , such that the total Cash Merger
Consideration equals $10.15), which increase shall be effective upon the
Companys receipt of a Substitution Notice from Purchaser, in full
substitution of the Notes Merger Consideration (in which case, references to
"Cash Merger Consideration" shall be deemed to be the Cash
Merger Consideration as increased pursuant to this _Section 4.2(b)_, and
"Notes Merger Consideration" shall be deemed to be zero), provided that at
the time Purchaser delivers a Substitution Notice to the Company, Purchaser
or Merger Sub has entered into binding commitment letters (the " **Additional
Financing Letters** ") pursuant to which it has received commitments from
one or more lenders of financing in an amount (when combined with cash on
hand at Purchaser agreed to be used as Cash Merger Consideration) sufficient
to increase the Cash Merger Consideration by $2.81 ( _i.e._ , such that the
total Cash Merger Consideration equals $10.15) in full substitution of all of
the Notes Merger Consideration (the " **Additional Financing** ") on terms
and conditions that (x) are

  



  

4   

     
   

  



  

not less favorable, in the aggregate, to Purchaser and Merger Sub with
respect to conditionality (measured against the Financing Letters (it being
understood that conditions contained in the Additional Financing that relate
to Purchaser and are substantially identical to conditions in the Financing
Letters that relate to the Company shall not be considered when determining
the conditionality of the Additional Financing)) as determined in the
reasonable judgment of Purchaser and Merger Sub; provided, however, that the
inclusion in such Additional Financing Letters of the non-occurrence of a
material adverse effect on Purchaser (an " **Additional Financing Material
Adverse Effect** ") as a condition to the obligation of such lender or
lenders to consummate the Additional Financing shall not be deemed to violate
the provisions of this clause (x) so long as such Additional Financing
Material Adverse Effect is not less favorable, in the aggregate, to Purchaser
and Merger Sub than the definition of Purchaser Material Adverse Effect
contained in this Agreement, and (y) would not reasonably be expected to
prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement past the End Date. The Purchaser shall have the right in its sole
discretion, on or prior to the delivery of a Substitution Notice, to deliver
the Additional Financing Letters to the Company for its written
approval (which approval shall be granted or denied by the Company in its
sole discretion consistent with the Boards fiduciary duties within five
business days after the Companys receipt of the Substitution Notice). In the
event that the Company approves any Additional Financing Letters in
accordance with the prior sentence, the Additional Financing contemplated by
such approved Additional Financing Letters shall be considered an "
**Approved Additional Financing** " for purposes of _Section 8.3_. The
Substitution Notice (and corresponding increase in the Cash Merger
Consideration in full substitution of the Notes Merger Consideration)
pursuant to this _Section 4.2(b)(i)_ shall remain in effect for so long as
an Additional Financing Termination has not occurred. For the avoidance of
doubt, upon the occurrence of an Additional Financing Termination (if any),
subject to  _Section 4.2(b)(ii)_, the Cash Merger Consideration shall be
$7.34 in cash, without interest, and the Notes Merger Consideration shall be
$3.31 principal amount of the Purchaser Notes, as if a Substitution Notice
had never been delivered; and

  



  

(ii) In the event that a CMC IPO (as defined in the Description of Notes) is
consummated prior to the date the definitive Proxy/Prospectus is mailed to
the stockholders of the Company and a Substitution Notice is not in effect in
accordance with _Section 4.2(b)(i)_, Purchaser shall increase the Cash
Merger Consideration by an amount equal to either, at the election of
Purchaser, (x) $2.81 or (y) $1.405, in substitution of (i) in the case of
clause (x) above, the full amount of the Notes Merger Consideration, or (ii)
in the case of clause (y) above, in substitution of a principal amount of the
Notes Merger Consideration equal to $1.655 (in either which case, subject to
_Section 4.2(b)(i)_, references to "Cash Merger Consideration" shall be
deemed to be the Cash Merger Consideration as increased pursuant to this
_Section 4.2(b)(ii)_ and "Notes Merger Consideration" shall be deemed to be
the Notes Merger Consideration as decreased pursuant to this _Section
4.2(b)(ii)_).

  



  

5   

     
   

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if
required by the DGCL but only to the extent required thereby, shares of
Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that are held by any holder of such shares of Company
Common Stock who is entitled to demand and who has properly perfected
appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who has
complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the " **Dissenting Common Stock**
") will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
as provided in _Section 4.2(b)_, but instead such holder of such shares of
Dissenting Common Stock will be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
provisions of such Section 262 unless and until such holder fails to perfect
or effectively withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and payment under
the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or
effectively withdraws or loses such right, such shares of Company Common
Stock will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and have
become, at the Effective Time, the right to receive, without any interest
thereon, the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 4.2(b)_, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 4.3(e)_, any cash in
lieu of Fractional Purchaser Notes payable pursuant to _Section 4.3(f)_
and any dividends or other distributions or payments payable pursuant to
_Section 4.3(d)_. At the Effective Time, shares of Dissenting Common Stock
shall automatically be canceled, retired and shall cease to exist, and any
holder of Dissenting Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and as
provided in the immediately preceding sentence. The Company shall give
Purchaser (i) prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisals of shares of Company Common Stock and any withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such notices and demands.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Purchaser,
make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle any such
demands or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  



  

(d) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each unexercised and
outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (individually
an " **Option** ", and collectively, the " **Options** ") under any plan,
program or arrangement of the Company (collectively, the " **Stock Option
Plans** ") (true and correct copies of which have been made available by the
Company to Purchaser), that is then outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, if vested (such vested options being collectively
referred to as the " **Vested Options** "), shall be canceled and, in
consideration of such cancellation, the holder of a canceled Option shall, as
of the Effective Time, be entitled to receive the Option Consideration.

  



  

(i) For purposes of this Agreement, " **Option Consideration** " means (x) an
amount of cash equal to the positive difference, if any, between the Total
Option Cash Consideration, less the Total Cash Exercise Price; (y) the number
of shares of Purchaser Common Stock equal to the positive difference, if any,
between the Total Option Stock Consideration less the Total Company
Stock Exercise Price; and, if applicable, (z) the principal amount of
the Purchaser Notes equal to the positive difference, if any, between the
Total Option Notes Consideration less the Total Notes Exercise Price.

  



  

6   

      
 

  



  

(ii) For purposes of this Agreement, " **Purchaser Common Stock Value** "
means the last reported sales price of Purchaser Common Stock at the end of
regular trading hours on The NASDAQ Global Select Market on the Closing Date.

  



  

(iii) For purposes of this Agreement, " **Total Option Cash Consideration** "
means the product of (x) the Cash Merger Consideration multiplied by (y)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(iv) For purposes of this Agreement, " **Total Option Notes Consideration** "
means the product of (x) the Notes Merger Consideration multiplied by (y)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(v) For purposes of this Agreement, " **Total Option Stock Consideration** "
means the product of (x) the Stock Merger Consideration multiplied by (y) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(vi) For purposes of this Agreement, " **Total Cash Exercise Price** "
means the product of (x) the aggregate exercise price of such Option,
multiplied by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash
Merger Consideration, and the denominator of which is the sum of (A) the
Cash Merger Consideration, (B) the product of the Stock Merger
Consideration multiplied by the Purchaser Common Stock Value and (C) the
Notes Merger Consideration (if any).

  



  

(vii) For purposes of this Agreement, " **Total Notes Exercise Price** "
means the product of (x) the aggregate exercise price of such Option,
multiplied by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Notes
Merger Consideration, and the denominator of which is the sum of (A) the
Cash Merger Consideration, (B) the product of the Stock Merger Consideration
multiplied by the Purchaser Common Stock Value and (C) the Notes Merger
Consideration (if any).

  



  

(viii) For purposes of this Agreement, " **Total Company Stock Exercise
Price** " means (A) the aggregate exercise price of such Option,
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the product of the Stock
Merger Consideration and the Purchaser Common Stock Value and the denominator
of which is the sum of (x) the Cash Merger Consideration, (y) the product
of the Stock Merger Consideration multiplied by the Purchaser Common Stock
Value and (z) the Notes Merger Consideration (if any), divided by (B)
the Purchaser Common Stock Value.

  



  

All amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 4.2(d)_ shall be reduced by
any required withholding of taxes in accordance with _Section 4.3(o)_
and shall be paid without interest. All required

  



        
   

  



  

withholding of taxes shall be applied proportionately to the Total Option
Cash Consideration, the Total Option Stock Consideration (based upon the
Purchaser Common Stock Value) and the Total Option Notes Consideration (if
any).

  



  

(e) Except as otherwise may be agreed to by the parties or as set forth
below, Purchaser shall assume the Companys 2005 Amended and Restated Equity
Incentive Award Plan (the " **2005 Plan** ") effective as of the Effective
Time. Notwithstanding the above, Purchaser may, upon written notice to the
Company no later than ten days prior to Purchasers good faith estimation of
the Effective Time, elect to require the Company to amend the 2005 Plan to
limit or reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock available under
the 2005 Plan (but not below the number of shares of Company Common Stock
issuable upon the then outstanding Options) or to terminate the 2005 Plan
effective as of the Effective Time. As soon as reasonably practicable
after receipt of such notice, the Company shall amend or terminate (as
applicable), effective as of the Effective Time, the 2005 Plan as requested
in writing by Purchaser and subject to the preceding sentence. In addition,
effective as of the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) cancel each other

uncertificated shares, evidence of such share of Company Common Stock in
book-entry form) (each, a " **Certificate** ") for the Merger Consideration
in accordance with this ARTICLE IV. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Purchaser shall deposit with, or shall cause to be deposited with, the Paying

Common Stock constituting the aggregate Stock Merger Consideration, (ii) cash
in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Merger Consideration and

fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 4.3(e)_, any cash in lieu of
Fractional Purchaser Notes payable pursuant to _Section 4.3(f)_ and any
dividends or other distributions or payments payable pursuant to _Section

pursuant to this _Section 4.3(a)_ is hereinafter referred to as the "
**Exchange Fund**."

  



  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record (other than the Company,
any Subsidiary of the Company, Purchaser, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary
of Purchaser) of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and Merger

  



        
   

  



  

Sub prior to the Effective Time that shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to such Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which letter
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as are reasonable and
customary (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an
"agents message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form) in
transactions such as the Merger and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of such Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration, any
dividends or other distributions in respect of Purchaser Common Stock or any
interest payments or other payments on the Purchaser Notes, in either case
payable pursuant to _Section 4.3(d)_, cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Purchaser Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section 4.3(e)_ and cash in lieu
of Fractional Purchaser Notes payable pursuant to _Section 4.3(f)_. Upon
surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed and completed (or, if applicable, delivery of an
"agents message") in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder
of such Certificate shall promptly be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (A) a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of whole
shares of Purchasers Common Stock pursuant to _Section 4.2(b)_ in respect
of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate
(after taking into account all Certificates surrendered by such holder), (B)
the Cash Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 4.2(b)_ in respect of the

Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate, (D) cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section
4.3(e)_, (E) cash in lieu of any Fractional Purchaser Notes payable pursuant
to _Section 4.3(f)_ and (F) any dividends or other distributions in respect
of Purchaser Common Stock or any interest payments or other payments on the
Purchaser Notes, in either case payable pursuant to _Section 4.3(d)_, after
giving effect to any tax withholdings required by applicable Law, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.  No interest will be
paid or will accrue on any payment payable upon surrender of any Certificate,
except that all Purchaser Notes issued as Notes Merger Consideration shall be
deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and interest thereon
shall accrue in accordance with the terms of the Purchaser Notes and the New
Indenture commencing as of the Closing Date and shall be payable on the
applicable interest payment date to the holders of record thereof as of the
applicable record date in accordance with the terms of the Purchaser Notes
and the New Indenture (provided that, in accordance with _Section
4.3(d)_, no interest payments in respect of the Purchaser Notes shall be paid
to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until such Certificate is
surrendered in accordance with this _Section 4.3_). In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made with respect to such
Company Common Stock to such a transferee if the Certificate representing
such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to the Paying Agent,
accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid.

  



  

(c) As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock (other than
shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled and retired in accordance with
_Section 4.2(a)_ and any shares of Dissenting Common Stock) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of any such shares shall cease to have any rights

right to vote), except the right to receive, without interest (other than
interest accruing after the Closing Date on the Purchaser Notes issued as
Notes Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 4.3(b)_), the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 4.2(b)_, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 4.3(e)_, any cash in lieu
of Fractional Purchaser Notes payable pursuant to _Section 4.3(f)_ and any
dividends or other distributions in respect of Purchaser Common Stock or any
interest payments or other payments on the Purchaser Notes, in either
case payable pursuant to _Section 4.3(d)_, upon surrender of
the Certificate representing such shares in accordance with _Section
4.3(b)_, and until so surrendered, each Certificate representing such shares
shall represent for all purposes only the right to receive, without interest
(other than interest accruing after the Closing Date on the Purchaser Notes
issued as Notes Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 4.3(b)_),
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 4.2(b)_, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 4.3(e)_, any cash in lieu of
Fractional Purchaser Notes payable pursuant to _Section 4.3(f)_ and any
dividends or other distributions in respect of Purchaser Common Stock and any
interest payments or other payments on the Purchaser Notes, in either
case payable pursuant to _Section 4.3(d)_.  The Merger Consideration, any
cash in lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 4.3(e)_, any
cash in lieu of Fractional Purchaser Notes payable pursuant to _Section
4.3(f)_ and any dividends or other distributions in respect of Purchaser
Common Stock and any interest payments or other payments on the Purchaser
Notes, in either case payable pursuant to _Section 4.3(d)_ paid upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 4.3_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore
represented by such Certificates.

  



  

(d) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Purchaser Common
Stock or any interest payments or other payments with respect to the
Purchaser Notes, as the case may be, with a record date or an interest
payment date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Purchaser Common
Stock or the Purchaser Notes (if any) that the holder thereof has the right
to receive upon the surrender of such Certificate, and no cash payment in
lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock or Fractional Purchaser
Notes shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section 4.3(e)_ or
_Section 4.3(f)_, unless and until the holder of such Certificate shall have
surrendered such Certificate in accordance with this ARTICLE IV.  Subject to
the effect of escheat or other applicable Laws, following surrender of any
such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates
representing whole shares of Purchaser Common Stock issued in exchange
therefor, in addition to the Merger Consideration deliverable
therefor pursuant to _Section 4.2(b)_, without interest (other than
interest accruing after the Closing Date on the Purchaser Notes issued as
Notes Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 4.3(b)_), (A) at the
time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a
fractional share of Purchaser Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to _Section 4.3(e)_, (B) at the time of such surrender, the amount
of any cash payable in lieu of a Fractional Purchaser Note to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 4.3(f)_, (C) at the time of such
surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions in respect of

such whole shares of Purchaser Common Stock or the Purchaser Notes (if any),
as applicable and (D) at the appropriate payment

  



        
   

  



  

date, the amount of dividends or other distributions in respect of Purchaser
Common Stock and any interest payments or other payments on the Purchaser
Notes, in either case, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior
to surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable with
respect to such whole shares of Purchaser Common Stock or the Purchaser
Notes, as the case may be.

  



  

(e) No certificate or scrip representing fractional shares of Purchaser
Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
or upon cancellation of Options pursuant to _Section 4.2(d)_ and
such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to any
dividends or other distributions or to vote or to any other rights of a
stockholder of Purchaser. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant
to the Merger or Options canceled pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Purchaser Common Stock
(after taking into account, as applicable, all Certificates delivered by such
holder and the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented
thereby and/or Options held by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof,

multiplying (i) such fractional share interest of Purchaser Common Stock by
(ii) the Purchaser Common Stock Value.

  



  

(f) No Purchaser Note that has a principal amount of less than $1.00 (a "
**Fractional Purchaser Note** ") shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates or upon cancellation of Options pursuant to _Section
4.2(d)_ and such Fractional Purchaser Note shall not entitle the owner
thereof to any interest payments or other payments with respect to the
Purchaser Notes. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger or
Options canceled pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a Fractional Purchaser Note (after taking into account,
as applicable, all Certificates delivered by such holder and the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock represented thereby and/or Options
held by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest)
in an amount equal to the principal amount of such Fractional Purchaser Note.

  



  

(g) If any certificate for shares of Purchaser Common Stock or any Purchaser
Note is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition to the
issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered will be properly
endorsed and otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person
requesting such exchange will have paid to Purchaser or any agent designated
by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a
certificate for shares of Purchaser Common Stock or Purchaser Note in any
name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered,
or will have established to the satisfaction of Purchaser or any agent
designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

(h) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock
of Purchaser or the Company shall occur by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, any stock dividend thereon with a record date during
such period, or any issuance, exercise or exchange of any Rights (as defined
in the Rights Agreement), the Merger Consideration and any number or amount
contained in this Agreement

  



        
   

  



  

which is based on the price of Purchaser Common Stock or Company Common Stock
or the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock or Company Common Stock, as
the case may be, shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, stock dividend thereon, or issuance, exercise or
exchange of Rights. Nothing contained in this _Section 4.3(h)_ shall limit
the obligations of the Company and Purchaser under _Sections 7.1(b)_ and 
_7.1(d)_ , respectively.

  



  

(i) At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock, other
than transfers that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE IV.

  



  

(j) The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund, as directed by
Purchaser, in (i) direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii)
obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest,
(iii) commercial paper rated the highest quality by either Moodys Investors
Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Rating Group, a division of The McGraw
Hill Companies, Inc., or (iv) bank repurchase agreements or bankers
acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $500 million. Any net
earnings with respect to the Exchange Fund shall be the property of and paid
over to Purchaser as and when requested by Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_
, that any such investment or any such payment of earnings may not
materially delay the receipt by holders of Certificates of any Merger
Consideration.

  



  

(k) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any interest
and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all such funds)
that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company one year
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any
former stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with
this ARTICLE IV shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation with
respect to the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 4.2(b)_, any cash
in lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 4.3(e)_, any cash
in lieu of Fractional Purchaser Notes payable pursuant to _Section 4.3(f)_
and any dividends or other distributions or payments payable pursuant to
_Section 4.3(d)_, upon due surrender of their Certificates, in each case
without any interest thereon (other than interest accruing after the Closing
Date on the Purchaser Notes issued as Notes Merger Consideration as provided
in _Section 4.3(b)_).

  



  

(l) None of Purchaser, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying
Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any holder of Company Common
Stock or Purchaser Common Stock, as the case may be, for any portion of the
Merger Consideration or Option Consideration (or dividends or distributions
or payments with respect thereto) delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws following
the passage of time specified therein.

  



  

(m) If any Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving
Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be

  



        
   

  



  

made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 4.2(b)_, any dividends or other
distributions in respect of Purchaser Common Stock and any interest payments
or other payments on the Purchaser Notes, in either case payable pursuant to
_Section 4.3(d)_, any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to
_Section 4.3(e)_ and any cash in lieu of Fractional Purchaser Notes payable
pursuant to _Section 4.3(f)_, in each case pursuant to this ARTICLE IV.

  



  

(n) Except as otherwise provided herein, Purchaser shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the
exchange of the Merger Consideration for Certificates.

  



  

(o) The Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation and, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, Merger Sub, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or
cause to be deducted or withheld, from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or
Vested Options such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the " **Code** "), or any provision of applicable state,
local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such holders in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

(p) Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser, the Company and Paying Agent
shall mutually agree on the mechanics for the payment (as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time) to holders of Options canceled
pursuant to _Section 4.2(d)_ of the Option Consideration, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock in accordance with _Section
4.3(e)_, any cash in lieu of Fractional Purchaser Notes in accordance with
_Section 4.3(f)_ and any dividends or other distributions in respect of
Purchaser Common Stock and any interest payments or other payments on the
Purchaser Notes, in either case, to which such holders of canceled Options
are entitled consistent with _Section 4.3(d)_.

  



  

 **ARTICLE V**

  



  

 ** _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_**

  



  

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter, dated the date hereof,
delivered by the Company to Purchaser prior to the execution of this
Agreement (the " **Company Disclosure Letter** ") with specific reference
to the particular Section or subsection of this Agreement to which
the limitation set forth in such Company Disclosure Letter relates (it
being understood that any information set forth in a particular Section
or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply to
and qualify each other Section or subsection thereof or hereof to the
extent that it is reasonably apparent on its face that such information is
relevant to such other Section or subsection thereof or hereof), the Company
hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser and Merger Sub as follows:

  



        
   

  



  

5.1 _Existence; Good Standing; Corporate Authority_. (a) The Company is a
corporation duly organized and is validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the State of Delaware, (b) each Subsidiary of the Company is a
corporation duly organized and is validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and (c) each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing under the laws of each other state of the
United States or the laws of any foreign jurisdiction, if applicable, in
which the character of the properties owned, licensed or leased by it or in
which the transaction of its business makes such qualification necessary,
except, in the case of the foregoing clauses (b) and (c), where the failure
to be so licensed or qualified or to be in good standing, has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect
(provided, that references to good standing in clauses (b) and (c) above
shall not refer to FTD UK Holdings Limited and its Subsidiaries incorporated
under the laws of England and Wales). For purposes of this Agreement, "
**Company Material Adverse Effect** " means any change, circumstance,
development, occurrence, event, fact or effect (each, a " **Company**
**Effect** ") that, when considered either individually or together with all
other Company Effects, is or is reasonably likely to be materially adverse to
(i) the business, properties, assets, liabilities, consolidated results of
operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (ii) the ability of the Company to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, that
any such Company Effect resulting or arising from or relating to any of the
following matters shall not be considered when determining whether a Company
Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur
(i) any conditions, developments or changes affecting the industries in which
the Company and its Subsidiaries operate; (ii) any conditions affecting the
United States general economy or the general economy in any geographic area
in which the Company or its Subsidiaries operate or developments or changes
therein; (iii) political conditions, including acts of war (whether or not
declared), armed hostilities and terrorism, or developments or changes
therein; (iv) any conditions resulting from natural disasters; (v) compliance
by the Company and its Subsidiaries with the covenants contained in this
Agreement (provided that this clause shall not apply to Company Effects
resulting from compliance with _Section 7.1(a)_); (vi) the failure of the
financial or operating performance of the Company or its Subsidiaries to meet
internal projections or budgets for any period in and of itself (it being
understood that any fact or development giving rise to or contributing to
such failure may be the cause of a Company Material Adverse Effect if not
otherwise excluded pursuant to this definition); (vii) any action taken or
omitted to be taken by or at the written request or with the written consent
of Purchaser; (viii) any announcement of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, in each case, solely to the extent due to such
announcement; (ix) changes in any Laws or accounting principles; or (x)
any Company Effects arising out of or resulting from any legal claims or
other proceedings made by any of the Companys stockholders (on their own
behalf or on behalf of the Company) arising out of or related to this
Agreement or the Merger; provided, however, that Company Effects set forth in
clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (ix) above may be taken into account in
determining whether there has been or is a Company Material Adverse Effect if
and only to the extent such Company Effects have a disproportionate impact on
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to the other
participants in the floral industry in North America and the United Kingdom
(after taking into account the size of the Company and its Subsidiaries
relative to such other participants). Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate power and

  



        
   

  



  

authority to own, operate, license and lease its properties and carry on its
business as now conducted, except where the failure to have such power and
authority would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has heretofore made available to Purchaser true and
correct copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or other
governing instruments of the Company and each of its material Subsidiaries as
currently in effect. The corporate records and minute books of the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries reflect all material actions taken and
authorizations made at meetings of such companies board of directors or any
committees thereof and at any stockholders meetings thereof.

  



  

5.2 _Authorization, Validity and Effect of Agreements_.

  



  

(a) The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and all agreements and documents executed in
connection herewith (the " **Ancillary Documents** ") to which it is a party
and subject to the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock (the " **Stockholder
Approval** "), to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents to which it is a party by the Company and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly
and validly authorized by the Board, and no other corporate proceedings on
the part of the Company or approvals from any holders of equity securities of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are necessary to authorize this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents to which it is a party or to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (other than the Stockholder
Approval). This Agreement has been, and any Ancillary Document to which it is
a party at the time of execution will have been, duly and validly executed
and delivered by the Company, and (assuming this Agreement and such Ancillary
Documents each constitute a valid and binding obligation of Purchaser and
Merger Sub to the extent party thereto) constitutes or, in the case of any
such documents entered into after the date of this Agreement will constitute,
the valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance
with their respective terms, except as enforcement may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization, arrangement or similar
Laws affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles of
equity.

  



  

(b) On or prior to the date hereof, the Board has duly adopted resolutions
(i) evidencing its determination that as of the date hereof this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approving this Agreement,
the Ancillary Documents to which the Company is a party and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, (iii) declaring this Agreement and the
Merger advisable and (iv) recommending that the stockholders of the Company
adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (the " **Company** **Recommendation** "), and, as of the
date hereof, such resolutions have not been rescinded, modified or withdrawn
in any way. No "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or
other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation (including Section 203 of
the DGCL) or any anti-takeover provision in the Companys certificate
of incorporation or bylaws is, or at the Effective Time will be, applicable
to the Company, the Company Common Stock, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting and Support
Agreement. To the knowledge of the Company, no other anti-takeover laws or
regulations apply or purport to apply to this Agreement, the Ancillary
Documents to which it is a party or any of

  



        
   

  



  

the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.  No provision of the
certificate of incorporation or the bylaws of the Company or similar
governing instruments of any of its Subsidiaries would, directly or
indirectly, restrict or impair the ability of Purchaser to vote, or otherwise
to exercise the rights of a stockholder with respect to, any shares of the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries that may be acquired or controlled by
Purchaser.

  



  

5.3 _Compliance with Laws_.

  



  

(a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in material violation
of any foreign or domestic, federal, state, provincial, local, municipal or
other law (including common law), statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, code,
injunction, ordinance, convention, directive, order, judgment, award, writ,
stipulation, treaty, ruling or decree or other legal requirement (including
any arbitral award or decision) (the " **Laws** ") of any foreign or
domestic, federal, state, provincial, local, municipal, or other judicial,
legislative, executive, administrative or regulatory body or authority or any
court, arbitral body, board or tribunal (" **Governmental Entity** ")
applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or assets. To the knowledge of the Company, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is being investigated with respect
to, and, to the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has been threatened to be charged with or given notice of
any violation of, any applicable Law, except for such of the foregoing as
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(b) To the Companys knowledge, none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries
or any of the directors, officers, agents or employees of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries has, (i) used any funds for unlawful contributions,
gifts, entertainment or other unlawful expenses related to political activity
or (ii) made any unlawful payment to foreign or domestic government officials
or employees or to foreign or domestic political parties or campaigns or
violated any provision of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as
amended. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has participated in
any boycotts.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists solely of 75,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock and 200,000 shares of preferred stock, par

subscribe for or acquire, securities having the right to vote) with the
stockholders of the Company on any matter. Except as set forth in Section 5.4
of the Company Disclosure Letter, since June 30, 2007, the Company has not
(A) issued any shares of capital stock, restricted stock or other securities
other than shares of Company Common Stock upon the exercise of Options, (B)
granted any Options, or (C) split, combined,

  



        
   

  



  

converted or reclassified any of its shares of capital stock. All issued and
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are, and all shares of Company
Common Stock that may be issued prior to the Effective Time will be when
issued, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free
of preemptive rights. Except as set forth in this _Section 5.4_ and Section
5.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, there are no other shares of capital
stock, equity interests or voting securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and no options, warrants, calls, subscriptions, convertible,
exercisable or exchangeable securities or other rights, agreements or
commitments that obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue,

interests in or any security convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable
for, or that evidence the right to subscribe for or acquire any capital stock
or equity interest in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
such option, warrant, call, subscription, security or other right, agreement

Letter, there are no (i) outstanding agreements or other obligations of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise

shares of capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and there
are no performance awards outstanding under the Stock Option Plans or any
other outstanding stock-related awards, stock appreciation, phantom stock,

agreements or understandings to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or, to the knowledge of the Company, any of the Companys directors or
executive officers is a party with respect to the voting of capital stock of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the Voting and Support
Agreement. Section 5.4(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a
complete and accurate list of all outstanding Options granted pursuant to any
Stock Option Plan as of the date hereof, which list sets forth the name of
the holders thereof and, to the extent applicable, the exercise price or
purchase price thereof, the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject

Agreement.

**Encumbrances** "), and all other limitations or restrictions including on

interest.

5.10 _Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(a) Except as set forth in Section 5.10(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, none of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate maintains, administers,
sponsors or otherwise has any liability with respect to (i) any "employee
benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended (" **ERISA** "), (ii) any employment,
severance or similar contract, plan, arrangement or policy or (iii) any other
material plan or arrangement (written or oral) whether or not subject to
ERISA (including any funding mechanism therefore now in effect or required)
providing for compensation, bonuses, profit-sharing, stock option or other
stock related rights or other forms of incentive, retention or

  



        
   

  



  

deferred compensation, vacation benefits, insurance coverage (including any
self-insured arrangements), health or medical benefits, disability benefits,
workers compensation, supplemental unemployment benefits, severance benefits
and post-employment or retirement benefits (including compensation,
pension, health, medical, life insurance benefits or "relevant benefits"
within the meaning of section 393B of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions)
Act 2003 (UK) (ignoring the exemption contained in that section), including
the payment of contributions to or remuneration referable to contributions to
any personal pension scheme, stakeholder pension scheme, retirement annuity
contract or similar arrangement (" **Relevant Benefits** ")), which, without
limiting any other limitation hereof, in each case specified in subsection
(i), (ii) or (iii), covers any employee or former employee or director of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " **Company Employee
Plans** "). Other than with respect to any multiemployer plan as defined in
Section 4001 of ERISA, the Company has delivered or made available to
Purchaser (i) current, accurate and complete copies (or to the extent no such
copy exists, an accurate description of the material features) of each
Company Employee Plan and, if applicable, related trust agreements, (ii) all
amendments thereto, and (iii) if applicable, the two most recently prepared
(A) Forms 5500 and attached schedules, (B) audited financial statements, (C)
actuarial valuation reports, and (D) with respect to Company Employee Plans
operating in the United Kingdom, schedules of contributions, all investment
and insurance contracts and full membership data. All of the information and
documents which have been made available, or given by or on behalf of the
Company to Purchaser, its advisers or agents relating to the Company Employee
Plans and any Relevant Benefits before or during the negotiation of this
Agreement are true and complete. An " **ERISA Affiliate** " means any Person
which would be treated as a single employer with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under Section 414 of the Code.

  



  

(b) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any ERISA Affiliate has
incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA which has not been satisfied
(other than for premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("
**PBGC** ") not yet due) with respect to any employee pension benefit plan
(as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) or any multiemployer plan (as defined
in Section 3(37) of ERISA), and no events have occurred and no circumstances
exist that would reasonably be expected to result in any such liability to
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate.

  



  

(c) Each Company Employee Plan which is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and each trust forming a part
thereof is exempt from Tax pursuant to Section 501(a) of the Code and, to the
knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred, whether by action or failure
to act, that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such
qualification. The Company has furnished to Merger Sub a copy of the most
recent Internal Revenue Service determination letter, if any, with respect to
each Company Employee Plan.  Each Company Employee Plan has been maintained
in compliance in all material respects with its terms and with the
requirements prescribed by any and all statutes (other than the Pensions Act
2004 (UK) and the Finance Act 2004 (UK)), orders, rules and regulations,
including ERISA and the Code, which are applicable to such Company Employee
Plan. To the knowledge of the Company, each Company Employee Plan has been
maintained in compliance in all material respects with the requirements
prescribed by the Pensions Act 2004 (UK) and the Finance Act 2004 (UK), as
applicable. To the knowledge of the Company, nothing has been done or omitted
to be done and no transaction or holding of any asset under or in connection
with

  



        
   

  



  

any Company Employee Plan has occurred that will make the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or any officer or director of the Company or any
Subsidiaries, subject to any material liability under Part 4 of Title I of
ERISA or liable for any Tax pursuant to Section 4975 of the Code (assuming
the taxable period of any such transaction expired as of the date hereof) or
to any tax charge in accordance with the Finance Act 2004 (UK).

  



  

(d) No Company Employee Plan is a multiemployer plan (as defined in Section
4001 of ERISA). With respect to each Company Employee Plan (other than a
multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 4001 of ERISA)) that is subject to
Title IV of ERISA (a " **Pension Plan** "), the fair market value of the
assets of such Pension Plan equals or exceeds the actuarial present value of
the accumulated benefit obligations (as of the date of the most recent
actuarial report prepared for such Pension Plan) under such Pension Plan
(whether or not vested), based on the actuarial assumptions set forth in the
most recent actuarial report prepared for such Pension Plan. No "accumulated
funding deficiency" (for which an excise tax is due or would be due in the
absence of a waiver) as defined in Section 412 of the Code or as defined in
Section 302(a)(2) of ERISA, whichever may apply, has been incurred with
respect to any Pension Plan with respect to any plan year, whether or not
waived. Other than lump sum death in service benefits, the Company Employee
Plans operating in the United Kingdom provide only money purchase benefits
(as defined in section 181 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 (UK)) and no
promise or assurance (written or oral) has been made under the Company
Employee Plans operating in the United Kingdom that benefits (other than lump
sum death in service benefits) will be calculated by reference to any
persons remuneration or equate (approximately or exactly) to any particular
amount. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has failed to pay when
due any "required installment", within the meaning of Section 412(m) of the
Code and Section 302(e) of ERISA, whichever may apply, with respect to any
Pension Plan. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is subject to any
lien imposed under Section 412(n) of the Code or Section 302(f) of ERISA,
whichever may apply, with respect to any Pension Plan. Neither the Company nor
any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in, or is a successor or parent corporation
to an entity that has engaged in, any transaction described in Section 4069
of ERISA. Except for such of the following as would not reasonably be
expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) neither the
Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has any liability for unpaid
contributions with respect to any Pension Plan, (ii) neither the Company nor
any ERISA Affiliate is required to provide security to any Pension Plan under
Section 401(a)(29) of the Code, (iii) no filing has been made by the Company
or any ERISA Affiliate with the PBGC, and no proceeding has been commenced by
the PBGC, the Pensions Regulator (UK) or the Pension Protection Fund (UK), to
terminate any Pension Plan, that in either case is pending, and (iv) no
condition exists and no event has occurred that would reasonably be expected
to constitute grounds for the termination of any Pension Plan by the PBGC the
Pensions Regulator (UK) or the Pension Protection Fund (UK). There has been
no "reportable event" (as defined in Section 4043(b) of ERISA and the PBGC
regulations under such Section) or "notifiable event" (in accordance with
Section 69 of the Pensions Act of 2004 (UK)) with respect to any Pension
Plan.

  



  

(e) There has been no amendment to or change in employee participation or
coverage under, any Company Employee Plan which would materially increase the
expense of maintaining such Company Employee Plan above the level of the
expense incurred in respect thereof for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.

  



         
 

  



  

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations to
provide retiree health and life insurance or other retiree death benefits
under any Company Employee Plan which is a welfare plan as defined in Section
3(1) of ERISA, other than benefits mandated by Section 4980B of the Code or
under applicable Law.

  



  

(g) To the knowledge of the Company, no Company Employee Plan is under audit
or is the subject of an audit or investigation by the Internal Revenue
Service, the Department of Labor, Her Majestys Revenue and Customs, the
Pensions Regulator, the board of the Pension Protection Fund or any other
Governmental Entity, nor is any such audit or investigation pending.  With
respect to any Company Employee Plan and except as would not result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect, (A) no actions, suits,
termination proceedings or claims (other than routine claims for benefits in
the ordinary course) are pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened and (B) no facts or circumstances exist that would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any such actions, suits or claims.

  



  

(h) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Documents to which it is a party by the Company nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (either alone or in conjunction
with another event) will result in (i) the acceleration or creation of any
rights of any officer, director or employee of the Company under any Company
Employee Plan or under any agreement (including, without limitation, the
acceleration of the vesting or exercisability of any Options, the
acceleration of the vesting of any restricted stock, the acceleration of the
accrual or vesting of any benefits under any plan or the acceleration or
creation of any rights under any bonus, severance, parachute or change in
control agreement) or (ii) any payments which would fail to be deductible
under Section 280G of the Code. The Company is not a party to or bound by
any agreement, plan or arrangement pursuant to which the Company has any
obligation to "gross up," indemnify or otherwise compensate or hold harmless
any Person with respect to any portion of any excise tax (or interest or
penalties with respect thereto) which such Person may become subject to under
Section 4999 of the Code or any similar state tax Law.

  



  

(i) Any Company Employee Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the Code is
being operated in material good faith compliance with the requirements of
such Code section and the guidance promulgated thereunder.

  



  

(j) All Company Stock Options were (i) granted with an exercise price per
share no lower than the "fair market value" (as defined in the applicable
plan) of one share of Company Common Stock on the date of the corporate
action effectuating the grant, (ii) granted, accounted for, reported and
disclosed in accordance with applicable law, accounting rules and stock
exchange requirements, and (iii) validly issued and properly approved by the
board of directors of the Company (or a duly authorized committee or
subcommittee thereof) in compliance with all applicable Laws and recorded on
the audited financial statements and unaudited interim financial statements
of the Company.

  



  

(k) To the knowledge of the Company, every employee and officer and former
employee and officer who is or has been entitled to, or eligible for,
membership of any of the Company Employee Plans operating in the United
Kingdom, whether under a contract of

  



        
   

  



  

employment or under the rules or otherwise of the Company Employee Plans, has
joined or been invited to join as of the date on which he or she became so
entitled or eligible.

  



  

(l) To the knowledge of the Company, the Company Employee Plans operating in
the United Kingdom have at all times complied with the Employment Equality
(Age) Regulations 2006, as amended.

  



  

(m) No person has had his or her contract of employment transferred to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries from another employer in circumstances
where the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations
2006 and the Transfer of Employment (Pension Protection) Regulations 2005
applied to the transfer or his or her contract of employment.

  



  

(n) To the knowledge of the Company, all death benefits which may be payable
from the Company Employee Plans operating in the United Kingdom are fully
insured with an insurance company authorized under the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000 to carry on long-term insurance business.  To the knowledge
of the Company, all policies and contracts under which such benefits are
insured are enforceable.  Each member and beneficiary has been covered for
such insurance by such insurance company at its normal rates and on its
normal terms for persons in good health.

  



  

(o) Since October 8, 2001, the Company and its Subsidiaries (as applicable)
has complied in all material respects with its obligation to designate and
provide access to a stakeholder pension scheme for all its "relevant
employees" (as defined in the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 (UK) (as
amended)).

  



  

(p) The Company or any of its Subsidiaries does not have any obligation to
contribute to or make any payments or have any liability in respect of the
Interflora 1978 Retirement and Death Benefit Scheme which has been fully
wound up and to the Companys knowledge all legislative requirements in
relation to its winding-up have been complied with.

  



  

5.11 _Brokers_. None of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective affiliates has retained, authorized to act on behalf of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or entered into any contract,
arrangement or understanding with any Person or firm that may result in the

brokerage or agents commissions or other like payments in connection with
the negotiations leading to this Agreement or the consummation of the

Entities required to conduct their respective businesses as presently
conducted, or that are

  



        
   

  



  

necessary for the lawful ownership or use of their respective properties and

Adverse Effect, and no Permit is subject to any outstanding order, decree,

Material Adverse Effect. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has

officer, the chief financial officer and the general counsel of the Company,

5.20 _Insurance_.

  



  

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries maintains insurance coverage
(the " **Insurance Policies** ") with insurance companies or associations in
such amounts, on such terms and covering such risks, including fire and other
risks insured against by extended coverage, as is reasonably prudent and
as management has determined is customary for business entities of similar
size engaged in similar lines of business, and have public liability
insurance, insurance against claims for personal injury or death or property
damage occurring in connection with any activities of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any properties owned, occupied or controlled by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in such amount as is reasonably prudent
and as management has determined is customary for business entities of
similar size engaged in similar lines of business. Section 5.20 of the
Company Disclosure Letter contains a complete and accurate list of
all Insurance Policies of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof, including the underwriter and the amounts of coverage, deductibles
and self-insured retentions and a summary of all material exclusions. Each
Insurance Policy is in full force and effect and is valid, outstanding and
enforceable, and all premiums due thereon have been paid in full. Except as
set forth in Section 5.20 of the Company Disclosure Letter, none of
the material Insurance Policies will terminate or lapse (or be affected in
any other materially adverse manner) by reason of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has
complied in all material respects with the provisions of each Insurance
Policy under which it is the insured party. No insurer under any Insurance
Policy has by written notice to the Company canceled or generally disclaimed
liability under any such policy or, to the knowledge of the Company,
indicated any intent to do so or not to renew any such policy, in each case
without any exception other than those that would not be reasonably expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. In the three-year period prior to
the date hereof, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received
any written notice regarding any (i) cancellation or invalidation of any
material insurance policy, (ii) refusal of any coverage or rejection of any
material claim under any material insurance policy or (iii)
material adjustment in the amount of premiums payable with respect to any
material insurance policy. All material claims under the Insurance Policies
have been filed in a timely fashion. To the knowledge of the Company, since
the Companys formation, there have been no historical gaps in insurance
coverage of the Company or its Subsidiaries that presents a material risk to
coverage under the Insurance Policies.

  



  

(b) The Company has properly applied for and accurately completed its
applications for and has, in force and effect and fully paid through June 30,
2008, no less than $25 million in claims made directors and officers
insurance coverage (the " **Current D andO Insurance**"). The Company, its
directors and officers are all insureds under the Current DandO Insurance. The
Current DandO Insurance extends to "claims" for "wrongful acts" which may
result in "loss" to (i) the Companys directors and officers and/or (ii) the
Company itself for "securities claims," as those terms are commonly
understood in the insurance industry, including coverage for all manner of
investigations and proceedings including defense costs with respect thereto.
The Current DandO Insurance is not subject to any exclusions or
restrictions which would limit or eliminate coverage (other than such as are
normal and customary in directors and officers insurance policies for
business entities of similar size engaged in similar lines of business) based
upon, arising out of, and/or relating to any prior or pending act or
omission. The Current DandO Insurance does not contain any exclusion (other
than such as are normal and

  



        
   

  



  

customary in directors and officers insurance policies) applicable to the
Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby.

party to any such Lease, is in material breach of or material default under

both, would constitute a material breach or material default, result in a
loss of any material rights or result in the creation of any lien (other than
a Permitted Encumbrance) thereunder or pursuant thereto.  To the knowledge
of the Company, except for Permitted Encumbrances, the Real Property is not
subject to any leases, subleases, licenses, concessions or other agreements,
written or oral, granting to any Person the right of use or occupancy of any

required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of
the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or
persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the
principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of the
Company required by Sections 302 and 906 of Sarbanes-Oxley with respect to

evaluation of internal controls prior to the date hereof, to the Companys
auditors and audit committee (i) any "significant deficiency" (as defined in

weakness" (as defined in Rule 1-02(a)(4) of Regulation S-X) known to the
Company in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in a material
respect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (ii) any material fraud known to the Company that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in

representatives for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy/Prospectus or any other documents filed or to be filed with the SEC in
connection with the transactions provided for herein (" **Other Filings**
"), will, at the respective times such documents are filed, at the time
the Registration Statement is declared effective, at the time of mailing of
the Proxy Statement (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) to the

order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading or necessary to correct any statement in
any earlier communication (it being understood that receiving and responding
to comments from the SEC on the Proxy/Prospectus will not, in and of itself,
constitute an admission that anything contained in the Proxy/Prospectus did
not meet the requirements of this _Section 5.25_).  If, at any time prior
to the Effective Time, any event or circumstance relating to the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective affiliates, or any of their
respective officers or directors, is discovered by any such Person which,
pursuant to the Exchange Act, should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy/Prospectus or any Other Filings, the Company shall
promptly notify Purchaser in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company makes no representation or warranty with respect to any information
supplied by Purchaser for inclusion or incorporation by reference in, or
omitted by Purchaser from, the Proxy/Prospectus or any Other Filings.

 **ARTICLE VI 

**

  

 ** _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER AND MERGER SUB_**

  

 ** **

  

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter, dated the date hereof,
delivered by Purchaser and Merger Sub to the Company prior to the execution
of this Agreement (the " **Purchaser Disclosure Letter** ") with specific
reference to the particular Section or subsection of this Agreement to which
the limitation set forth in such Purchaser Disclosure Letter relates (it
being understood that any information set forth in a particular Section
or subsection of the Purchaser Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply to
and qualify each other Section or

  



        
   

  



  

subsection thereof or hereof to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on
its face that such information is relevant to such other Section or
subsection thereof or hereof), Purchaser and Merger Sub hereby represent and
warrant to the Company as follows:

  



  

6.1 _Existence; Good Standing; Corporate Authority_. (a) Purchaser is a
corporation duly organized and is validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the State of Delaware, (b) each Subsidiary of Purchaser is a
corporation duly organized and is validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and (c) each of Purchaser and
its Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing under the laws of each other state of the
United States or the laws of any foreign jurisdiction, if applicable, in
which the character of the properties owned, licensed or leased by it or in
which the transaction of its business makes such qualification necessary,
except, in the case of the foregoing clauses (b) and (c), where the failure
to be so licensed or qualified or to be in good standing, has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.
For purposes of this Agreement, " **Purchaser Material Adverse Effect**
" means any change, circumstance, development, occurrence, event, fact or
effect (each, a " **Purchaser** **Effect** ") that, when considered either
individually or together with all other Purchaser Effects, is or is
reasonably likely to be materially adverse to (i) the business, properties,
assets, liabilities, consolidated results of operations or condition
(financial or otherwise) of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole
or (ii) the ability of Purchaser or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, that any such Purchaser Effect
resulting or arising from or relating to any of the following matters shall
not be considered when determining whether a Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur: (i)
any conditions, developments or changes affecting the industries in which
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries operate; (ii) any conditions affecting the
United States general economy or the general economy in any geographic area
in which Purchaser or its Subsidiaries operate or developments or changes
therein; (iii) political conditions, including acts of war (whether or not
declared), armed hostilities and terrorism, or developments or changes
therein; (iv) any conditions resulting from natural disasters; (v) compliance
by Purchaser and its Subsidiaries with the covenants contained in this
Agreement (provided that this clause shall not apply to Purchaser Effects
resulting from compliance with _Section 7.1(c)_); (vi) the failure of the
financial or operating performance of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries to meet
internal projections or budgets for any period in and of itself (it being
understood that any fact or development giving rise to or contributing to
such failure may be the cause of a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect if not
otherwise excluded pursuant to this definition); (vii) any action taken or
omitted to be taken by or at the written request or with the written consent
of the Company; (viii) any announcement of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, in each case, solely to the extent due to such
announcement; (ix) changes in any Laws or accounting principles; or (x) any
Purchaser Effects arising out of or resulting from any legal claims or other
proceedings made by any of Purchasers stockholders (on their own behalf or
on behalf of Purchaser) arising out of or related to this Agreement or the
Merger; provided, however, that Purchaser Effects set forth in clauses (i),
(ii), (iii), (iv) and (ix) above may be taken into account in determining
whether there has been or is a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect if and only
to the extent such Purchaser Effects have a disproportionate impact
on Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to the
other participants in the businesses in which Purchaser operates (after
taking into account the size of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries relative to
such other participants). Each of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries has all
requisite corporate power

  



        
   

  



  

and authority to own, operate, license and lease its properties and carry on
its business as now conducted, except where the failure to have such power
and authority would not reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect. Purchaser has heretofore made available to the Company true
and correct copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or other
governing instruments of Purchaser and Merger Sub as currently in effect. The
corporate records and minute books of Purchaser and Merger Sub reflect all
material actions taken and authorizations made at meetings of such companies
board of directors or any committees thereof and at any stockholders
meetings thereof.

  



  

6.2 _Authorization, Validity and Effect of Agreements_. Each of
Purchaser, the Subsidiaries of Purchaser and Merger Sub has the requisite
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, the
Ancillary Documents to which it is or will be a party, the New Indenture, the
Purchaser Notes and the Pledge Agreement (as defined in the Description of
Notes) to the extent it is a party (together, the " **Notes Documents**
") and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby to
which it is or will be a party. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and the Notes Documents by Purchaser and
Merger Sub and the consummation by Purchaser and Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby to which it is or will be
a party have been duly and validly authorized by the respective boards
of directors of Purchaser and Merger Sub and by Purchaser as the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
Purchaser or Merger Sub or approvals from any holders of equity securities of
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries are necessary to authorize this
Agreement, the Ancillary Documents to which it is or will be a party and the
Notes Documents or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby to which it is a party. This Agreement has been, and the
Notes Documents and any Ancillary Documents to which Purchaser or Merger Sub
is or will be a party will have been at the time of execution, duly and
validly executed and delivered by Purchaser and Merger Sub, and (assuming
this Agreement, the Notes Documents and such Ancillary Documents each
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company or other Person
party thereto) constitutes or, in the case of any such documents entered into
after the date of this Agreement, will constitute, the valid and binding
obligations of each of Purchaser and Merger Sub, enforceable in accordance
with their respective terms, except as enforcement may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization, arrangement or similar
Laws affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles of
equity.

with or given notice of any violation of, any applicable Law, except for such
of the foregoing as would not reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(b) To Purchasers knowledge, none of Purchaser, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of the directors, officers, agents or employees of Purchaser or any of
its Subsidiaries has, (i) used any funds for unlawful contributions, gifts,
entertainment or other unlawful expenses

  



        
   

  



  

related to political activity or (ii) made any unlawful payment to foreign
or domestic government officials or employees or to foreign or domestic
political parties or campaigns or violated any provision of the Foreign

December 31, 2007 and except for liabilities and obligations incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since December 31,
2007 and liabilities and obligations incurred under this Agreement or in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries do not have any
liabilities of any kind (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise),
which, individually or in the aggregate would be material to Purchaser and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that would be required by GAAP to be
reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries
(or in the notes thereto).

  



        
   

  



  

6.9 _Litigation_. All of the material actions, suits, claims, investigations,
arbitrations or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Purchaser,
threatened, as of the date hereof, against Purchaser or any of
its Subsidiaries or to which any of their respective assets or properties
is subject before any arbitrator or Governmental Entity are set forth in
Section 6.9 of the Purchaser Disclosure Letter.  There is no action, suit,
claim, investigation, arbitration or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge
of Purchaser, threatened against Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective assets or properties before any arbitrator or
Governmental Entity that would be reasonably expected to have a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect, and to the knowledge of Purchaser, there is no basis
for any such action, suit, claim, investigation, arbitration or proceeding.
 None of Purchaser, any of its Subsidiaries or any officer, director
or employee of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries has been permanently
or temporarily enjoined by any order, judgment or decree of any court or any
other Governmental Entity from engaging in or continuing any conduct or
practice in connection with the business or assets of Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of Purchaser, is Purchaser, any of its
Subsidiaries or any executive officer or director of Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries under investigation by any Governmental Entity related to the
conduct of Purchasers or any of its Subsidiaries business. To the
knowledge of Purchaser, there is not in existence any order, judgment
or decree of any court or other tribunal or other agency that is applicable
to Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries enjoining or requiring Purchaser or
any of its Subsidiaries to take any action of any kind with respect to its
business, properties or assets or that would be reasonably expected to have a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

6.10 _Controls_.

  



  

(a) Purchaser has established and maintains "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act)
that are reasonably designed to ensure that material information (both
financial and non-financial) relating to Purchaser and its Subsidiaries
required to be disclosed by Purchaser in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to Purchasers principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing
similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications of the principal executive
officer and the principal financial officer of Purchaser required by Sections
302 and 906 of Sarbanes-Oxley with respect to such reports.

  



  

(b) Purchaser has established and maintains internal controls.  To the
knowledge of Purchaser, such internal controls are sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Purchasers
financial reporting and the preparation of Purchasers financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.  Purchaser has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation of internal controls prior to the date
hereof, to Purchasers auditors and audit committee (i) any "significant
deficiency" (as defined in Rule 1-02(a)(4) of Regulation S-X) and any
"material weakness" (as defined in Rule 1-02(a)(4) of Regulation S-X) known
to Purchaser in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in a material
respect Purchasers ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (ii) any material fraud known to Purchaser that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
internal

  



        
   

  



  

controls. Purchaser has made available to the Company a summary of any such
disclosure regarding significant deficiencies, material weaknesses and fraud
made by management to Purchasers auditors and audit committee since December
31, 2005.

  



  

6.11 _Financing_. Merger Sub has delivered to the Company (i) true, correct
and complete signed counterpart(s) of the commitment letter of Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A., dated the date hereof, and (ii) true, correct and complete
(subject to fee amounts being redacted) signed counterparts of the related
fee letter of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., dated the date hereof, pursuant to
which Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. has agreed, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, to provide up to an aggregate of $375.0 million
of financing in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and an
additional $75.0 million of revolving credit ((i) and (ii) collectively, the
" **Financing Letters** ").  The Financing Letters are in full force and
effect as of the date hereof. The Financing Letters are subject to no
contingencies or conditions other than those set forth in the copies of the
Financing Letters delivered to the Company. Purchaser and Merger Sub have
fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the
Financing Letters to be paid by them on or prior to the date hereof.  As of
the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of
Purchaser or Merger Sub under the Financing Letters. As of the date hereof,
subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Sections 8.1_ and
_8.3_  (excluding _Section 8.3(c)_), neither Purchaser nor Merger
Sub believes or has reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
financing set forth in the Financing Letters required to be satisfied by
Purchaser or Merger Sub will not be satisfied or that any portion of the
financing to be made thereunder will not otherwise be made available to
Purchaser or Merger Sub on the Closing Date. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 5.4_ and compliance by
the Company and its Subsidiaries with their agreements set forth in _Sections
7.1(a)_ and _7.1(b)_ , and the satisfaction of the closing condition set
forth in _Section 8.3(d)_, the aggregate sources of funding identified in
the Financing Letters and Additional Financing Letters (if applicable) as
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in
the respective amounts referred to in the Financing Letters (including any
direct or indirect equity contribution of Purchaser referred to therein) and
the Additional Financing Letters (if applicable), together with the Net
Proceeds (as defined in the Description of Notes) from the CMC IPO received
by Purchaser (if applicable), would be sufficient to enable Merger Sub and
the Company to pay the full Cash Merger Consideration, to make all other
necessary cash payments by them in connection with the Merger upon the terms
contemplated by this Agreement (including the payments required under
_Section 7.12_ with respect to the Defeasance and/or Debt Tender Offer) and
to pay all of the related fees and expenses, in each case as contemplated by
the Financing Letters and Additional Financing Letters (if applicable). The
financing referred to in the Financing Letters is herein referred to as the "
**Financing**."

  



  

6.12 _Purchaser-Owned Shares of Company Common Stock_. As of the date of
this Agreement, Purchaser, Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries own
no shares of Company Common Stock.

  



  

6.13 _Interim Operations of Merger Sub_. Merger Sub was formed solely for the
purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby, has engaged in
no other business activities (other than those incident to its formation and
pursuant to this Agreement and the

  



        
   

  



  

Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and has
conducted its operations only as contemplated hereby.

  



  

6.14 _Brokers_. Other than J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., all of whose fees and
expenses will be borne by Purchaser, neither Purchaser or Merger Sub has
entered into any contract, arrangement or understanding with any Person or
firm that may result in the obligation of Purchaser, Merger Sub or the
Company or any of their respective affiliates to pay any finders
fees, brokerage or agents commissions or other like payments in connection
with the negotiations leading to this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

6.15 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by Purchaser, Merger Sub or any of their respective
affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy/Prospectus or any Other
Filings, will, at the respective times such documents are filed, at the time
the Registration Statement is declared effective, at the time of mailing of
the Proxy Statement (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) to the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, as of the time of the Stockholder
Meeting or at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact, or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading or necessary to correct any statement in
any earlier communication (it being understood that receiving and responding
to comments from the SEC on the Proxy/Prospectus will not, in and of itself,
constitute an admission that anything contained in the Proxy/Prospectus did
not meet the requirements of this _Section 6.15_).  If, at any time prior
to the Effective Time, any event or circumstance relating to Purchaser,
Merger Sub or their respective affiliates, or any of their respective
officers or directors, is discovered by Purchaser which, pursuant to the
Exchange Act, should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy/Prospectus or any Other Filings, Purchaser shall promptly notify the
Company in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser makes no
representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in, or omitted by the Company from, the Proxy/Prospectus or any
Other Filings.

  



  

6.16 _Title to CMC Shares_. Purchaser owns of record and beneficially all of
the shares of outstanding common stock of CMC (the " **CMC Shares** ") free
and clear of any and all Encumbrances, except as imposed by
applicable federal or state securities laws and except for Permitted Liens
(as defined in the Description of Notes).

  



  

6.17 _Pledge Agreement_. The Pledge Agreement will, as of the Closing, be
effective to create in favor of the Notes Trustee for the benefit of the
holders of the Purchaser Notes, a legal, valid and enforceable security
interest in the CMC Shares and proceeds and products thereof (subject to
Permitted Liens). When any stock or other ownership certificates
representing the CMC Shares are delivered to the Notes Trustee, the security
interest of the Notes Trustee in the CMC Shares will constitute a first
priority perfected security interest in all right, title and interest in the
CMC Shares senior to all other Encumbrances (other than Permitted Liens that
have priority by operation of law).

Company mail or otherwise make available in accordance with the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act the definitive Proxy/Prospectus to its stockholders
prior to the 105th day after the date hereof without the prior written
consent of the Purchaser if the Purchaser notifies the Company in writing

Statement, any Other Filings or the Merger.

  



  

(d) Subject to the provisions of _Section 7.2(e)_, if at any time prior to
the Effective Time any event or circumstance relating to the Company or
Purchaser, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or their respective
officers or directors, or any of their holders of capital stock, is
discovered by a party which is required by applicable Law to be set forth in

of the SEC with respect to, the Proxy Statement shall be made by the Company,
no filing of, amendment or supplement to, or response to any comments of the
SEC with respect to, the Registration Statement shall be made by Purchaser,
and no filing of, amendment or supplement to, or response to any comments of
the SEC with respect to any Other Filings shall be made by the Company or
Purchaser, in each case, unless the party intending to make such filing or
response has given the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the proposed filing or response and has considered in such
document or response comments reasonably proposed by the other party. All
documents that either the Company or Purchaser is responsible for filing with
the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated herein will

  



        
   

  



  

comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and other applicable
Law.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the
parties hereto shall be required to comply with any of the covenants,
obligations or agreements in _Section 7.2(b)_ or the obligation to mail or
otherwise make available the Proxy/Prospectus under _Section 7.2(c),_ or to
take any of the actions contemplated by _Section 7.2(b)_ or actions relating
to the mailing or other distribution of the Proxy/Prospectus contemplated by
_Section 7.2(c)_ pursuant to any other covenant, obligation or agreement in
this Agreement during the pendency of an Adverse Recommendation Change due to
an Intervening Event unless Purchaser determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Company, that such Intervening Event is reasonably
expected to be cured prior to the End Date.

  



  

7.3 _Efforts and Assistance; HSR Act_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, and other than with respect
to those matters governed by  _Section 7.5_ hereof, which shall be governed
by _Section 7.5_ hereof, each party will use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, to file, or caused to be filed, all
documents and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents as promptly as practicable,
including, without limitation, negotiating mutually acceptable forms of Note
Documents consistent with the terms and provisions set forth in the
Description of Notes and obtaining all necessary consents, waivers,
approvals, authorizations, Permits or orders from all Governmental Entities
or other third parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that no representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company herein shall be breached or
not satisfied as a result of the failure to obtain any such consents,
waivers, approvals, authorizations, Permits or orders. Each party shall also
refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any action which would
materially impair such partys ability to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents.
 Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to (i) take all action necessary or desirable so that no fair price,
moratorium, control share acquisition or other anti-takeover laws
and regulations or similar laws or regulations are or become applicable to
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Documents and (ii) if any fair price, moratorium, control
share acquisition or other anti-takeover law or regulation becomes applicable
to any of the foregoing, take all action necessary so that the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated in
this Agreement and/or the Ancillary Documents, as the case may be, and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger
and such other transactions.

  



  

(b) The Company, Purchaser and Merger Sub shall cooperate with one another in
determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing, including,
without limitation, any Regulatory Filing, with, any Governmental Entity is
required, or any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required
pursuant to the terms of any Material Contracts, in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Ancillary Documents. Each of the Company, Purchaser and Merger Sub will, and
will cause its

  



        
   

  



  

respective Subsidiaries, if any, to take all reasonable actions necessary to
attempt to obtain (and will cooperate with each other in obtaining) any
consent, approval, waiver, authorization, order or approval of, or any
exemption by, (i) any Governmental Entity or (ii) other public or private
Third Party requested by Purchaser or the Company in writing to the other, in
each case solely to the extent required to be obtained or made by the
Company, Purchaser and Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the Ancillary Documents; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company herein shall be breached or
not satisfied as a result of the failure to obtain any such consent,
approval, waiver, authorization, order, approval or exemption.

  



  

(c) The Company, Purchaser and Merger Sub shall furnish all information
required to be included in any application or other filing to be made
pursuant to the rules and regulations of any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The Company, Purchaser and Merger Sub shall have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent reasonably practicable each will consult the other
on, all the information relating to the other and each of their
respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any Third Party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents.

  



  

(d) If required, each of the Company, Purchaser and Merger Sub shall take all
reasonable action necessary to file as soon as practicable, but in no event
later than the 10th business day following the date hereof, notifications
under the HSR Act and any other applicable Law governing antitrust or
competition matters, including, without limitation, Foreign Antitrust Laws,
and respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries from the Federal
Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice for
additional information or documentation and to respond as promptly as
practicable to all inquiries and requests received from any state attorney
general or other Governmental Entity in connection with antitrust matters
related to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents and use its reasonable best efforts to
take or cause to be taken all other actions necessary, proper or advisable
consistent with this _Section 7.3_ to cause the expiration or termination of
the applicable waiting periods, or receipt of required authorizations, as
applicable, under the HSR Act; _provided_ that and notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will require Purchaser, any of its
subsidiaries, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation to take or refrain from
taking any action that would (A) restrict, prohibit or limit the ownership or
operation by Purchaser or Merger Sub or their Subsidiaries of all or any
material portion of the business or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole or compel Purchaser or Merger Sub or any of
their respective subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separately all or any
material portion of the business or assets of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation) taken as a whole, or impose any
material limitation, restriction or prohibition on the ability of
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) taken as
a whole to conduct its business or own such assets, or (B) impose
material limitations on the ability of Purchaser or the Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby.  Without
limiting the foregoing, the parties shall request and shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain early termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act. No party shall voluntarily extend any waiting
period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with any Governmental
Entity to delay or not to consummate the Merger or any of the

  



        
   

  



  

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement except with the prior
written consent of the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed and which reasonableness shall be determined in light of
each partys obligation to do all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, as promptly as practicable, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

  



  

7.4 _Publicity_. The initial press release relating to this Agreement shall
be a joint press release and thereafter, so long as this Agreement is in
effect, the Company and Purchaser shall consult with each other before
issuing any press release or otherwise making public statements with respect
to this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, and shall not issue any such press release or make any
similar public statement without the prior consent of the other party, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except as the disclosing party
may determine to be required by applicable Law or any listing agreement with
the New York Stock Exchange, The NASDAQ Global Select Market or any
other national securities exchange.

  



  

7.5 _Further Action_.

  



  

(a) At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the Company or Purchaser, any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of
the Company or Purchaser, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all
right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or
assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation
as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

  



  

(b) Each of Purchaser and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause each of its
Representatives and affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to close
concurrently with the Closing, debt financing on terms and conditions
described in the Financing Letters and, if applicable, any Additional
Financing Letters and/or, if applicable, any Alternative Financing Letters,
including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the
Financing Letters and, if applicable, any Additional Financing Letters
and/or, if applicable, any Alternative Financing Letters and negotiate and
enter into definitive agreements contemplated by the Financing
Letters and/or, if applicable, any Alternative Financing Letters and
Additional Financing Letters on terms and conditions contained therein (as
such terms may be altered in accordance with any "flex" provisions in the
related fee letters (the " **Flex** ")) (the " **Definitive Financing
Agreements** "), (ii) comply on a timely basis with obligations under the
Financing Letters and, if applicable, any Additional Financing Letters
and/or, if applicable, any Alternative Financing Letters to assist the
arrangers of the Financing in accordance with the terms set forth and
contemplated therein (including seeking rating agency ratings to the
extent required), (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions and
other requirements to the consummation of the Financing and, if applicable,
any Additional Financing and/or, if applicable, any Alternative
Financing applicable to Purchaser and Merger Sub in the Financing Letters,
the Alternative Financing Letters (if applicable), the Additional Financing
Letters (if applicable) and the Definitive Financing Agreements that are
within their respective control; _provided_ , _however_ , that for the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall financial tests applicable to Purchaser
or the Company, as the case may be, under the Financing Letters and, if
applicable, any Additional Financing Letters

  



        
   

  



  

and/or, if applicable, any Alternative Financing Letters be deemed to be
within the control of such party, and (iv) cause the lenders and other
Persons providing the Financing and, if applicable, any Additional Financing
and/or, if applicable, any Alternative Financing to provide such Financing in
accordance with the terms of the Definitive Financing Agreements if all
conditions to the Definitive Financing Agreements have been satisfied or upon
funding and consummation of this Agreement will be satisfied; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall Purchaser or any of its affiliates be
required to make an equity contribution (including cash and/or common equity
or other equity securities of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries) to Merger
Sub or any other direct or indirect Subsidiary of Purchaser in excess of
$203.0 million, excluding the proceeds of the Additional Financing (if any)
which proceeds (if any) shall be used to fund a portion of the Cash Merger
Consideration (and related fees and expenses, including, without limitation,
fees and expenses of the nature set forth in Section 7.5(b) of the Purchaser
Disclosure Letter). Purchaser shall, upon the written request of the
Company, inform the Board on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable
detail of the status of its efforts to comply with the terms of, and satisfy
the conditions contemplated by, the Financing Letters and, if applicable, any
Additional Financing Letters, and/or, if applicable, any Alternative
Financing Letters in accordance with this _Section 7.5(b)_ and shall not,
and shall not permit Merger Sub to, amend or modify the terms of
the Financing Letters (including all exhibits, annexes, schedules, fee
letters and other ancillary documents) to increase the conditionality of the
Financing Letters in a manner that would adversely impact the ability of
Purchaser to consummate the transactions provided for herein or the
likelihood of the consummation of the Merger without obtaining the prior
written consent of the Company. Purchaser shall give the Board prompt
written notice of any material breach by any party to the Financing Letters,
any termination of any of the Financing Letters or any other circumstance,
event or condition (other than in respect of the Company and its affiliates)
that would reasonably be likely to prevent, delay or impede the consummation
of the financing contemplated by the Financing Letters. In the event that all
or any portion of the financing contemplated by the Financing Letters becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions set forth in the Financing Letters
(as such terms may be altered in accordance with the Flex), Purchaser shall
notify the Company and use reasonable best efforts to arrange as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event and after giving the
Company prior written notice, alternative financing from alternative sources
in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on terms that (as determined in the reasonable judgment of
Purchaser and Merger Sub) are no less favorable to Purchaser and Merger Sub
(including with respect to conditionality, required equity contributions
(including cash and/or common equity or any other equity securities of
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries), pricing and required guarantees by
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries) than the terms set forth in the Financing
Letters and would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
**Alternative Financing** "). Purchaser shall deliver to the Company true and
complete copies of all agreements pursuant to which it has
received commitments for the Alternative Financing (the "
**Alternative Financing Letters** "), after which the covenants provided with
respect to the Financing Letters in this _Section 7.5(b)_ shall
be applicable with respect to the Alternative Financing Letters. In the event
that Purchaser or Merger Sub enters into any Additional Financing Letters,
Purchaser promptly shall deliver to the Company true and complete copies of
such agreements, after which the covenants provided with respect to the
Financing Letters in this _Section 7.5(b)_ shall be applicable with respect
to the Additional Financing Letters. If the

  



        
   

  



  

Additional Financing becomes unavailable for any reason (an "
**Additional Financing Termination** "), Purchaser shall immediately notify
the Company in writing and the parties hereto shall use their reasonable best
efforts to take all actions necessary to enable Purchaser to issue the
Purchaser Notes in substitution for the Additional Financing, including
preparing and filing any required amendments to the Proxy/Prospectus, mailing
or making available to the stockholders of the Company any required
amendments to the Proxy/Prospectus and changing the date of the Stockholder
Meeting as advisable or required, in each case to the extent that the parties
reasonably believe that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement can
be consummated by the End Date.

  



  

(c) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and use
commercially reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
Representatives to, cooperate in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing (and, if applicable, any Additional Financing and/or, if
applicable, any Alternative Financing) as may be reasonably requested by
Purchaser (provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) including by (i) participating in meetings, presentations, road
shows, due diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies; (ii)
assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations,
offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda,
prospectuses and similar documents required in connection with the Financing
(and, if applicable, any Additional Financing and/or, if applicable, any
Alternative Financing); (iii) furnishing Purchaser and its financing sources
with historical financial information, business and financial projections and
similar information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries, including all
historical financial statements and financial data of the type required by
Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and of the type
and form customarily included in private placements under Rule 144A of the
Securities Act and of the type customarily included in syndicated
loan transactions (including monthly financial statements as described in
_Section 7.9(b)_ hereof), to use in connection with the Financing or any
Alternative Financing or any Additional Financing, including such information
as requested to determine whether the Company and its Subsidiaries satisfy
any applicable financial tests or other conditions set forth in the Financing
Letters and, if applicable, any Additional Financing Letters and/or, if
applicable, the Alternative Financing Letters (in each case within the time
frames specified therein); (iv) using commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain customary accountants comfort letters, legal opinions, surveys,
affidavits, title policies and commitments, pay-off letters and title
insurance as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser or the lenders under
the Financing Letters and, if applicable, the Additional Financing Letters
and/or, if applicable, the Alternative Financing Letters; (v) executing and
delivering such definitive financing documents as may be reasonably requested
by Purchaser, and taking all necessary corporate actions in connection
therewith, _provided_ , _however_ , that, except for the execution of a
supplemental indenture to the Indenture, no officer, director or employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to execute any
definitive financing documents, including any registration statements to
be filed with the SEC or any pledge or security documents, unless such
documents provide that they either are not effective or are not operative
until, or substantially concurrently with, the Effective Time; (vi) taking
all other customary actions reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection
with the Financing and any Alternative Financing and any Additional
Financing; and (vii) facilitating the pledge of collateral and the perfection
of the security interests therein; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be

  



        
   

  



  

required to pay any commitment or other similar fee in connection with the
financing contemplated by the Financing Letters or any Alternative Financing
or any Additional Financing prior to the Closing Date, and (y) none of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to indemnify any
Person in connection with the financing contemplated by the Financing Letters
or any Alternative Financing or any Additional Financing prior to the Closing
Date (it being understood that upon Closing, none of the aforementioned
restrictions in clauses (x) and (y) shall apply).  Purchaser shall, promptly
upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation. Purchaser and Merger Sub
shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company,
each of its Subsidiaries, and the Representatives of the Company from and
against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the arrangement of the financing contemplated by the
Financing Letters and any Alternative Financing and any Additional Financing
and any information utilized in connection therewith. The Company hereby
consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the
Financing and, if applicable, any Additional Financing and/or, if applicable,
any Alternative Financing, _provided_ that such logos are used solely in a
manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the
reputation of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
marks. All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the
Company and its Subsidiaries obtained by Purchaser or its Representatives
pursuant to this _Section 7.5_ shall be kept confidential pursuant to the
Confidentiality Agreement, except for disclosure to potential lenders and/or
investors as required or deemed by Purchaser to be reasonably advisable in
connection with the Financing and, if applicable, any Additional Financing
and/or, if applicable, the Alternative Financing, subject to customary
confidentiality provisions included in the documentation for such financing
or otherwise.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the covenants, obligations and agreements of the Company in this _Section
7.5(c)_ and  _Section 7.9_ shall be the only covenants, obligations or
agreements by the Company relating to the Financing or the Alternative
Financing or any Additional Financing.

  



  

7.6 _Insurance; Indemnity_.

  



  

(a) The Company will purchase from an insurer reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser a six-year pre-paid noncancellable directors and officers
insurance policy covering the current and all former directors or officers of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, and their heirs and representatives, with
respect to acts or failures to act prior to the Effective Time, in a single
aggregate amount over the six-year period immediately following the Closing
Date equal to the policy limits for the Companys and its Subsidiaries
current directors and officers insurance policies as in effect on the date
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to
obtain a policy providing such coverage except to the extent that such
coverage can be provided at a total cost of no greater than 300% of the
annual premium paid for such insurance in 2007 (the " **Cap** "), and, if
equivalent coverage cannot be obtained, or can be obtained only by paying a
total premium in excess of the Cap, the Company shall only be required to
obtain as much coverage as can be obtained by paying a total premium equal to
the Cap.

  



        
   

  



  

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall honor all of the Companys obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless, to the extent not paid by insurance, the present
and former officers and directors of the Company in respect of acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time to the extent, subject to
applicable Law, provided under the DGCL and the Companys certificate of
incorporation and bylaws in each case as in effect on the date hereof,
regardless of whether such certificate of incorporation or bylaws are
hereafter amended, and such obligations shall survive the Merger and continue
in full force and effect from the Effective Time until six years after the
Effective Time.  The Surviving Corporation shall periodically advance
expenses as incurred with respect to the foregoing, until six years after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
_provided_ , that the person to whom the expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Corporation to repay such
advance if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
reimbursement of such expenses.

  



  

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall, until six years after
the Effective Time, indemnify and hold harmless, to the extent not paid by
insurance or by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to its obligation to
provide indemnification under _Section 7.6(b)_, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, each person who is, or has been at any time
prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an
officer or director of the Company or any Subsidiary, and their heirs and
representatives (collectively, " **Indemnified Parties** "), against all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, reasonable costs or expenses (including
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement
(collectively, " **Losses** ") from any claims, actions, suits, proceedings,
arbitrations, investigations or audits (collectively, " **Litigation** ")
arising before or after the Effective Time as a result of or pertaining to
acts or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, by them to the extent
attributable to their capacities as such, which acts or omissions occurred
prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions provided for herein
and in the Voting and Support Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall Purchaser be required to indemnify any Indemnified Parties for
Losses arising out of such Indemnified Parties gross negligence, wanton
malfeasance, willful or illegal conduct or conduct that was intentionally
injurious to the Company.  Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser shall,
to the extent not advanced by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to _Section
7.6(b)_, periodically advance expenses as incurred with respect to the
foregoing, until six years after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law _provided_ that the person to whom the
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking reasonably acceptable to the
Surviving Corporation to repay such advance if it is ultimately determined
that such person is not entitled to reimbursement of such expenses.

  



  

(d) If, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties or assets to any Person, then, in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that successors and assigns of Purchaser
or the Surviving Corporation, as case may be, shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this _Section 7.6_. The provisions of this _Section
7.6_ are intended for the benefit of and, as of the Effective Time, shall
be enforceable by each person who is now or has been at any time prior to the
date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an
officer, director or similar person of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

  



         
 

  



  

(e) If any obligation to indemnify described in _Section 7.6(a)_ (each, an "
**Action** ") arises or occurs, the Surviving Corporation shall control the
defense of such Action with counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation,
which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to any Indemnified Party seeking
indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.6(c)_,  _provided_ that the
Indemnified Party shall be permitted to participate in the defense of such
Action through counsel selected by the Indemnified Party, at the Indemnified
Partys expense.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is any actual or
potential conflict between the Surviving Corporation and any Indemnified
Party or there are additional defenses available to any Indemnified Party,
such Indemnified Party shall be permitted to participate in the defense of
such Action with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party, at the Surviving
Corporations expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than
one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any single Action except to the
extent that two or more of such Indemnified Parties have conflicting
interests in the outcome of such Action. The Surviving Corporation shall not
be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent,
which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld.

  



  

7.7 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor all obligations and
provide all other benefits under the Company Employee Plans and compensation,
employment, change in control and severance arrangements and agreements,
including all benefits or other amounts earned or accrued to the extent
vested or that become vested in the ordinary course through the Effective
Time, in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein,
whether express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other
modification of any Company Employee Plan or any employee benefit plan
maintained by Purchaser, or shall limit the right of Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any
Company Employee Plan or any other employee benefit plan following the
Effective Time in accordance with such plans amendment procedures and
requirements of Law. During the one year period following the Effective Time,
Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide to the
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are employed at the
Effective Time and who remain employed with the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary of Purchaser (" **Company Employees** ") compensation and employee
benefits that, with respect to each employee, are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to the compensation and benefits provided to such employee
under the Company Employee Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or Purchasers
or the Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries, as applicable, to, give Company
Employees full credit for such Company Employees service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time to the same
extent such service was counted under similar Company Employee Plans for
purposes of eligibility, vesting, or eligibility for retirement (but not for
benefit accrual) and determination of the level of benefits (including, for
purposes of vacation and severance), but not for purposes of benefit
accruals, under any benefit plans made generally available to employees or
officers or any class or level of employees or officers maintained by
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective

  



        
   

  



  

Subsidiaries in which a Company Employee participates; _provided_ , _however_
, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the
same period of service.

  



  

(c) Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or Purchasers
or the Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries, as applicable, to, (i) waive any
preexisting condition limitations otherwise applicable to Company Employees
and their eligible dependents under any plan of Purchaser or any Subsidiary
of Purchaser that provides health benefits in which Company Employees may be
eligible to participate following the Closing, other than any limitations
that were in effect with respect to such employees as of the Effective Time
under the analogous Company Employee Plan, (ii) honor any deductible, co-
payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by the Company Employees and
their eligible dependents under the health plans in which they participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time during the portion of the calendar
year prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any deductibles, co-payments
or out-of-pocket maximums under health plans of Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries in which they are
eligible to participate after the Effective Time in the same plan year in
which such deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums were incurred
and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability
requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a Company Employee and his
or her eligible dependents on or after the Effective Time, in each case to
the extent such Company Employee or eligible dependent had satisfied any
similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Company Employee Plan
prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(d) No provision of this Agreement shall (i) create any right in any employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to continued employment by
Purchaser, the Company, or any respective Subsidiary or preclude the ability
of Purchaser, the Company, or any respective Subsidiary to terminate the
employment of any employee for any reason, (ii) require Purchaser, the
Company, or any respective Subsidiary to continue any Company Employee Plans
or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the
Effective Time, or (iii) confer upon any Company Employee any rights or
remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.

  



  

7.8 _Options_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board or an appropriate committee of the
Board administering the Stock Option Plans shall adopt such resolutions or
take such actions as required to (i) permit any Options outstanding prior to
the Effective Time that are not exercisable or Vested Options to become
exercisable and Vested Options immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(ii) permit the treatment of all Vested Options as of the Effective Time as
provided in ARTICLE IV including, without limitation, the termination of
Options pursuant to _Section 4.2(e)_. Any such action taken by the Company
pursuant to the terms of this _Section 7.8_ shall be effected concurrent
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
shall be carried out in accordance with the terms of the Stock Option Plan
and applicable Law.

  



  

(b) Except as set forth in Section 7.8(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
prior to the Effective Time, the Board shall adopt such resolutions or take
such other

  



        
   

  



  

actions as are required to cause all unvested restricted shares of Company
Common Stock to become vested immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Effective as of the Effective Time, all such restricted shares shall be
automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration on
the terms and conditions set forth in _Section 4.2(b)_.

  



  

7.9 _Access to Information_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and shall
instruct the respective Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries
to, afford to Purchaser and to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
financial advisors, financing sources and other Representatives of Purchaser,
reasonable access during normal business hours during the period prior to the
Effective Time, upon prior notice, to their respective offices, properties,
books, contracts, commitments, personnel, records and other documents as
Purchaser may reasonably request and, during such period, the Company shall,
and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries and shall instruct the respective
Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to
Purchaser (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and
other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of
federal or state securities laws and (ii) reasonably available financial and
operating data or information that Purchaser may reasonably request.  The
Company shall instruct its officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, financial advisors and other Representatives to cooperate with
reasonable requests of Purchaser in its investigation.  Except as required
by applicable Laws, each of the parties hereto will hold, and will cause its
respective officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors,
financing sources and other Representatives and affiliates to hold, any
nonpublic information in confidence to the extent required by, and in
accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality agreement, dated
October 30, 2007 previously entered into by Purchaser and the Company (the "
**Confidentiality Agreement** "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any of their Representatives
shall be required to provide access to or disclose information where such
access or disclosure (a) the Company reasonably determines would cause the
loss of any the attorney-client privilege of the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company or (b) would contravene any Law or order of any
Governmental Entity.

  



  

(b) The Company shall provide unaudited consolidated balance sheets and
related statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for each calendar month following the date
hereof, up to and including the month ended at least 30 days prior to the
Effective Time and after the most recently completed fiscal quarter of the
Company for which unaudited financial statements have been prepared.

  



  

(c) Purchaser shall give prompt notice to the Company of any facts, events or
notice received by Purchaser which in any such case may be reasonably
expected to cause, individually or in the aggregate, the Financing to be
unavailable by the End Date (as hereinafter defined). Upon discovery, the
Company shall give prompt notice to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall
give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) the occurrence or nonoccurrence
of any event the occurrence or nonoccurrence of which would reasonably be
expected to cause, individually or in the aggregate, any representation or
warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate
in any material respect or any condition to the obligations of such party to
effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied by
the

  



        
   

  



  

End Date, (ii) any failure of the Company or Purchaser, as the case may be,
to materially comply with or satisfy, or the occurrence or nonoccurrence of
any event, the occurrence or nonoccurrence of which would reasonably be
expected to cause, individually or in the aggregate, the failure by such
party to materially comply with or satisfy, any covenant or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder or any condition to the
obligations of such party to effect the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement not to be satisfied by the End Date, (iii) any notice or other
communication from any Governmental Entity or other Third Party alleging that
the consent of such Governmental Entity or Third Party is or may be required
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
Ancillary Document, (iv) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or
proceedings commenced or, to such partys knowledge, threatened against, or
affecting such party or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or assets or business which, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to this
Agreement or which relate to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary Documents, and (v) the occurrence of
any event, development or circumstance which has had or would be reasonably
expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect, as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of
any notice pursuant to this _Section 7.9(c)_ shall not cure any breach of
any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to
the date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party giving or receiving such notice,
and the failure to deliver any such notice shall not affect any of
the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VIII below, and _provided_ , _further_
, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 7.9(c)_
shall not cause the failure of any condition set forth in ARTICLE VIII below
to be satisfied nor shall the delivery of any such notice be deemed an
admission that any condition in ARTICLE VIII below, is not or will not be
satisfied.

  



  

7.10 _Acquisition Proposals; Board Recommendation_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall immediately terminate, and shall instruct its and its
Subsidiaries officers, directors, employees, attorneys, accountants,
advisors, representatives and agents (" **Representatives** ") to immediately
terminate, all existing discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Person
conducted heretofore with respect to an Acquisition Proposal. The term "
**Acquisition Proposal** " means any inquiry, offer or proposal (whether or
not in writing) (other than an offer or proposal by or on behalf of Purchaser
or its affiliates) for, or any indication of interest in: (i) a
transaction (or series of transactions) pursuant to which any Person or group
of Persons acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial
ownership of more than 15% of the outstanding voting power or shares of
capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether from the
Company or pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer or otherwise; (ii) any
transaction (or series of transactions) which would result in any Person (or
group of Persons) other than Purchaser, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates
(any such Person, a " **Third Party** ") acquiring 15% or more of the fair
market value of the assets (including, without limitation, the capital stock
of any Subsidiary of the Company), net income, net revenues or cash flow of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such
transaction (whether by a merger, consolidation, business combination,
reorganization, share exchange, sale or purchase of assets, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, purchase of securities, acquisition of stock of a
Subsidiary of the Company or otherwise); or (iii) any combination of the
foregoing.

  



        
   

  



  

(b) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company
shall not, and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
Representatives not to, (i) solicit or initiate or knowingly encourage or
facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-public information) any
proposal, inquiry, offer or request that constitutes, or that is reasonably
likely to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, participate in,
continue or engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person regarding
an Acquisition Proposal, or any proposal, inquiry, offer or request that is
reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) except as
provided in this _Section 7.10_ and subject to compliance herewith, approve
or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or enter into any
agreement or agreement in principle regarding an Acquisition Proposal, or any
proposal, inquiry, offer or request that is reasonably likely to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to obtaining the
Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
that was not initiated or solicited by the Company or its Subsidiaries or any
of its or their Representatives after the date hereof that the Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and with outside legal counsel, constitutes,
or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, the Company
may, subject to compliance with this _Section 7.10_ and notwithstanding any
other term or provision of this Agreement to the contrary, furnish
information and/or draft agreements with respect to the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and
its officers, directors, employees, attorneys, accountants, consultants,
legal counsel, advisors, agents and other representatives) pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement no less restrictive in any material
respect to such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement (except that such
confidentiality agreement shall not be required to include any provision
limiting the ability of the other party thereto to make an Acquisition
Proposal to the Company or its Board) and which agreement does not prohibit
compliance by the Company with its obligations under this _Section 7.10_ to
provide notices and other information to Purchaser; _provided further_ , that
the Company shall promptly provide to Purchaser any information concerning
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries which was not previously provided to
Purchaser (but in no event later than 24 hours after the Company provided
such information to such other party). Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company may (i) permit an Acquisition Proposal
to be made under a standstill or confidentiality agreement, and (ii) waive
any provision thereof in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or to permit
an Acquisition Proposal to be made, in each case if the Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that such action is
necessary for the Board to comply with its fiduciary duties imposed by
Delaware law.  For purposes of this Agreement, a " **Superior Proposal** "
means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (with all of the percentages
included in the definition of Acquisition Proposal increased to 50.01% for
purposes of this definition) not solicited or initiated in violation of this
_Section 7.10_, that is on terms that the Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation, is more favorable to the holders of the
Company Common Stock, from a financial point of view, than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account all relevant aspects of
such offer (in comparison with the terms of the Agreement and any revised
offer by Purchaser), including financial considerations (including additional
transaction costs and the effect of the payment of the Termination Fee,
expenses or amounts payable hereunder), the Person or group of Persons making
such offer, and the likelihood that the proposed transaction would be

  



        
   

  



  

consummated substantially in accordance with its terms (taking into account
all financing, regulatory, legal and other aspects of the proposal).

  



  

(c) The Company shall promptly advise Purchaser, telephonically and in
writing, of the Companys receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any
proposal, inquiry, offer or request that is reasonably likely to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal (in each case within 24 hours after receipt thereof).
 The Company shall promptly provide Purchaser, in writing and in
reasonable detail (within such 24 hour time frame), with a summary of the
terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal, or proposal, inquiry,
offer or request that is reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall promptly inform Purchaser of any material change
in any of the price, form of consideration or other meaningful terms or
conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal or proposal, inquiry, offer or
request that is reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and the
current status of any discussions or negotiations related thereto. The
Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any
confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date hereof which
prohibits the Company from providing such information to Purchaser.
Promptly upon determination by the Board that an Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company shall deliver to Purchaser a
written notice advising it that the Board has so determined, specifying in
reasonable detail the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal.

  



  

(d) Except as provided in the next sentence and in _Section 7.10(e)_,
neither the Board nor any committee thereof shall (x) withdraw or modify, or
publicly propose to withdraw or modify, the Company Recommendation, (y)
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal (any of the actions referred to in the foregoing clauses
(x) or (y), whether taken by the Board or a committee thereof, an " **Adverse
Recommendation Change** ") or (z) enter into any letter of intent,
agreement, or understanding or agreement in principle regarding or to
implement an Acquisition Proposal (an " **Acquisition Agreement** "), other
than a confidentiality agreement that the Company is permitted to enter into
under _Section 7.10(b)_.  The Board or any committee thereof shall prior to
obtaining the Stockholder Approval, (i) be permitted to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change with respect to a Superior Proposal (provided that at
the time such action is taken such Superior Proposal has not been withdrawn),
or (ii) terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.1(f)_ and
enter into any Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal if,
but only if, the Board and the Company have prior thereto complied, in the
case of clause (i), with the following clauses (A) through (C), and, in the
case of clause (ii), the following clauses (A) through (D): (A) the
Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that such action is necessary for the Board to comply with its
fiduciary duties imposed by Delaware law, (B) the Company has given Purchaser
and Merger Sub four business days prior written notice (the " **Notice
Period** ") of its intention to take such action, which notice shall attach
the most recent draft of any agreement with respect to, and specify the terms
and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the
Person or group of Persons making the Superior Proposal) and any material
modifications to any of the foregoing, and during the Notice Period, the
Company shall, and shall direct its financial advisors and outside counsel
to, negotiate with Purchaser in good faith (to the extent Purchaser desires
to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute (in
the judgment of the Board, after consultation with a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation and with outside legal counsel), a
Superior

  



        
   

  



  

Proposal, and if during the Notice Period any revisions are made to the
Superior Proposal and the Board in its good faith judgment determines, after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
with outside legal counsel, that such revisions are material (it being
understood that any change in the purchase price or form of consideration in
such Superior Proposal shall be deemed a material revision), the Company
shall deliver a new written notice to Purchaser and shall comply with the
requirements of this _Section 7.10(d)_ with respect to such new written
notice except that the new Notice Period shall be three business days, (C)
the Company has complied in all material respects with its other obligations
under this _Section 7.10_, and (D) simultaneously with entering into any
such Acquisition Agreement, the Company shall pay Purchaser the Termination
Fee in accordance with _Section 9.2(b)_. Nothing in this _Section
7.10_ shall prohibit the Company or the Board from taking and disclosing to
the stockholders of the Company a position with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal by a Third Party to the extent the Company determines to be required
under Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act;
_provided_ , that unless and until this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with _Section 9.1_ hereof, nothing in this sentence shall affect the
obligations of the Company or the rights of Purchaser or Merger Sub under any
other provision of this Agreement.

  



  

(e) In addition, and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this
Agreement, at any time prior to the Stockholder Approval the Board may, in
response to a fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances with
respect to or otherwise affecting Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or its
or their business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operation or
condition (financial or otherwise) occurring or arising after the date hereof
that is materially adverse to Purchaser and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole
and that was not known to the Board prior to the execution of this Agreement
(such fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances, an "
**Intervening Event** "), make an Adverse Recommendation Change if the
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that, in light of such Intervening Event, such action is necessary
for the Board to comply with its fiduciary duties imposed by Delaware law;
_provided_  that no fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances
shall constitute an Intervening Event if such fact, event, change,
development or set of circumstances resulted from or arose out of  any
action taken or omitted to be taken by the Purchaser or any of
its Subsidiaries at the written request or with the written consent of the
Company given after the date hereof; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Board shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section 7.10(e)_ unless the Company
has (A) given Purchaser and Merger Sub at least four business days
prior written notice advising Purchaser and Merger Sub that the Board intends
to take such action and specifying the facts underlying the Boards
determination that an Intervening Event has occurred, and the reasons for the
Adverse Recommendation Change, in reasonable detail, and (B) during such
four business day period, if requested by Purchaser, engaged in good
faith negotiations with Purchaser to amend this Agreement in such manner
that obviates the need for such an Adverse Recommendation Change as a result
of the Intervening Event. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) in no event shall
the receipt, existence or terms of an Acquisition Proposal or any matter
relating thereto or the consequences thereof constitute an Intervening Event
and (ii) the Board has considered and understands that the announcement of
both this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (and limited to
the announcement of both this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby) could affect the value of the Stock Merger Consideration.

  



        
   

  



  

7.11 _Transfer Taxes_. Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns,
applications, questionnaires or other documents, regarding any real property
transfer, stamp, recording, documentary, gains, sales, use, value added,
stock transfer or other taxes and any other fees and similar taxes which
become payable in connection with the Merger (collectively, " **Transfer
Taxes** "). From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall pay or cause to be paid, without deduction or withholding from any
amounts payable to the holders of Company Common Stock, all Transfer Taxes.

  



  

7.12 _Treatment of 7.75% Senior Subordinated Notes_.

  



  

(a) Without limiting the obligations set forth in _Section 7.5_, Purchaser
and Merger Sub shall, subject to compliance of the Company and its
Subsidiaries with their obligations under _Section 7.12(b)_, substantially
concurrently with the Closing, (i) cause the defeasance of the 7.75% Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2014 (the " **Notes** ") issued pursuant to the
Indenture, dated as of February 6, 2004, as supplemented by a First
Supplemental Indenture thereto, dated as of February 24, 2004, and as
supplemented by a Second Supplemental Indenture thereto, dated as of February
14, 2005, by and among FTD, Inc. (as successor to Nectar Merger Corporation),
the guarantors party thereto (including the Company), and U.S. Bank National
Association, as trustee (the " **Indenture** ") pursuant to the defeasance
provisions of the Indenture (the " **Defeasance** "); or, in Purchasers
discretion, (ii) fund the purchase of all of the Notes validly tendered and
not withdrawn pursuant to an offer to purchase by the Company (the "
**Offer** "), and a related consent solicitation by the Company (the "
**Consent Solicitation** " and, together with the Offer, the " **Debt Tender
Offer** ") and, to the extent any Notes are not validly tendered or are
withdrawn in connection with the Debt Tender Offer, cause the Defeasance of
such Notes; _provided_ that the closing of the Debt Tender Offer shall be
conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, and the parties shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt Tender Offer and Defeasance (as
applicable) to close on the Closing Date.

  



  

(b) In addition, without limiting the obligations set forth in _Section
7.5_, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested
by Purchaser and to take all actions reasonably requested by Purchaser that
are necessary, appropriate or desirable to facilitate (and, to the extent
reasonably requested by Purchaser, not take or fail to take any actions that
would impair, prevent or are contrary to) such Defeasance or such
commencement and consummation of the Debt Tender Offer, including, executing
officers certificates and, in the case of the Debt Tender Offer, executing a
supplemental indenture to the Indenture at such time as requested by
Purchaser or Merger Sub, amending the terms and provisions of the Indenture
as reasonably requested by Purchaser and as set forth in the Debt Tender
Offer documents sent to holders of Notes (which amendment may include the
elimination of all or substantially all of the covenants contained in
such Notes or the Indenture, in each case, which can be eliminated or
released, as applicable, upon the approval of the holders of the principal
amount of Notes which properly delivered consents in the Consent
Solicitation), which supplemental indenture may be effective but shall not
become operative until the consummation of the Debt Tender Offer in
connection with the Closing, using all reasonable efforts to cause the
trustee under the Indenture to enter into such supplemental indenture prior
to or substantially simultaneously with the Closing and irrevocably taking
all corporate actions necessary for such Defeasance and Debt Tender Offer;
_provided_ that Purchaser shall be responsible for depositing, or causing to
be deposited, with the trustee under

  



        
   

  



  

the Indenture sufficient funds to effect such Defeasance and for providing,
or causing to be provided, immediately available funds for the full payment
(including any applicable premiums or consent solicitation fees, and all
related fees and expenses) at the Closing Date of all Notes properly tendered
and not withdrawn (or consents received and not withdrawn) required pursuant
to the terms of such Debt Tender Offer.

  



  

7.13 _FIRPTA Certificate_. At Closing, the Company shall have delivered to
Purchaser a copy of a notice to the Internal Revenue Service prepared
in accordance with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section
1.897-2 (h)(2) in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto (the " **FIRPTA
Certificate** ") that the Company shall have delivered to the Internal
Revenue Service. The Companys obligation to deliver the FIRPTA Certificate
shall not be considered an obligation under this Agreement for purposes of
_Section 8.3(a)(i)_, but if the FIRPTA Certificate is not delivered,
Purchaser shall withhold from the Merger Consideration and pay over to the
appropriate taxing authorities any amounts required to be withheld as
permitted under _Section 4.3(o)_.

  



  

7.14 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Purchaser shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Purchaser Common Stock to be issued in connection with
the Merger to be authorized for listing on The NASDAQ Global Select Market,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

7.15 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company
and Purchaser shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent
permitted under applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Company Common
Stock or acquisitions of Purchaser Common Stock (including, in each case,
derivative securities) resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby by
each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company or any employee or director
of the Company who may become an officer or director of Purchaser to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

9.2 _Effect of Termination_.

  



  

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or
Purchaser as provided in  _Section 9.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of the
Company or Purchaser or their respective Subsidiaries, officers or directors
except (i) with respect to _Section 7.4_, the penultimate sentence of
_Section 7.9(a)_, this _Section 9.2_, Purchasers obligations under the
third sentence of _Section 7.5(c)_ and ARTICLE X and (ii) with respect
to any liabilities for damages incurred or suffered by a party as a result of
the willful and material breach by the other party of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this
Agreement or any Ancillary Document.

  



  

(b) (i)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company
and Purchaser agree that if (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 9.1(e)(ii)_ or  _Section 9.1(e)(iii)_ then the Company shall
immediately pay to Purchaser the Termination Fee, and (ii) this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_, then the Company shall
simultaneously with such termination pay to Purchaser the Termination Fee,
which in each case shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Purchaser and
Merger Sub under this Agreement.

  



  

(ii) Subject to and without duplication of _Section 9.2(b)(iii)_, the
Company and Purchaser agree that if this Agreement is terminated

  



        
   

  



  

pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)(i)_ then the Company shall pay to Purchaser an
amount equal to the reasonably documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) actually incurred by Purchaser
and its affiliates on or prior to the termination of this Agreement in an
amount up to but not greater than $3.75 million (the "
**Purchaser Expenses** ") within one business day after such termination,
which shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Purchaser and Merger Sub
under this Agreement.

  



  

(iii) If this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser or the Company pursuant to
_Section 9.1(b)(iii)_ or by the Purchaser pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)(i)_
and prior to such termination an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
received by the Company and publicly announced and not withdrawn or
abandoned, then the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Purchaser in
immediately available funds the Purchaser Expenses within one business day
after such termination, and if, within 12 months following any such
termination of this Agreement (a) an Acquisition Proposal is consummated
(and, provided, that in the case of a termination of this Agreement by the
Purchaser pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)(i)_, at least one of the parties to
such Acquisition Proposal that is consummated is the same as, or an affiliate
of, a party to the Acquisition Proposal that had been received by the Company
and not withdrawn or abandoned prior to such termination), or (b) in the case
of a termination of this Agreement by Purchaser or the Company pursuant to
_Section 9.1(b)(iii)_, the Company enters into a definitive agreement
providing for an Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay or cause to
be paid to Purchaser in immediately available funds an amount equal to the
Termination Fee within one business day after the Company enters into such
definitive agreement, in the case of a termination of this Agreement by
Purchaser or the Company pursuant to  _Section 9.1(b)(iii)_, or within one
business day after such transaction is consummated, whichever is earlier;
_provided_ , _however_ , that set-off against the Termination Fee owed under
this _Section 9.2(b)(iii)_ shall be the amount of all Purchaser Expenses
paid by the Company. The payment of the Purchaser Expenses and,
if applicable, the Termination Fee, pursuant to this _Section 9.2(b)(iii)_
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Purchaser and Merger Sub under
this Agreement. For purposes of this _Section 9.2(b)(iii)_, each reference
to "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed a reference to an
"Acquisition Proposal" as defined herein, provided that each reference to
fifteen percent (15%) in the definition thereof shall be replaced with fifty
percent (50%).

  



  

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated
to pay the Termination Fee or the Purchaser Expenses on more than one
occasion.

  



  

(c) Each of Purchaser and the Company acknowledges that the agreements set
forth in this _Section 9.2_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that without these agreements, Purchaser
and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if
the Company fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section
9.2_, and, in order to obtain the payment, Purchaser commences a suit which

  



        
   

  



  

results in a judgment against the Company for the payment set forth in this
_Section 9.2_, the Company shall pay to Purchaser its reasonable and
documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys
fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount at
the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made through the date of payment.

10.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party

power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Law.

  



  

10.5 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the

parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties, except that Purchaser and Merger Sub
may assign all or any of their respective rights hereunder and thereunder to
any affiliate, _provided_ that no such assignment shall relieve Purchaser of
its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, except for the provisions of
_Section 7.6_ above (which third party beneficiary rights shall not arise
until the Effective Time), nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied
(including _Section 7.7_), is intended to confer on any Person other than
the parties hereto or their respective heirs, successors, executors,

unconditionally consents to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court

Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to
commence any litigation relating thereto except in such courts), waives any
objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation in the Delaware
Courts and agrees not to plead or claim in any Delaware Court that such
litigation brought therein has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

  



  

10.9 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

for the convenience of the parties only, and shall be given no substantive or
interpretive effect whatsoever.

Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter and the Purchaser Disclosure
Letter), unless the context otherwise requires, words describing the singular
number shall include the plural and vice versa, and words denoting any gender
shall include all genders and words denoting natural persons shall

Agreement and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement; (i) "or" is disjunctive but not necessarily exclusive; and
(j) terms used herein that are defined in GAAP have the meanings ascribed to
them therein.

  



  

10.12 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability
without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions
of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the
terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any
provision of this Agreement is so

  



        
   

  



  

broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only
so broad as is enforceable.

  



  

10.13 _Enforcement of Agreement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any Delaware Court,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity. The prevailing party in any judicial action shall be entitled
to receive from the other party reimbursement for the prevailing partys
reasonable and documented attorneys fees and out-of-pocket disbursements,
and court costs.  Additionally, each party hereto irrevocably waives any
defenses based on adequacy of any other remedy, whether at law or in equity,
that might be asserted as a bar to the remedy of specific performance of any
of the terms or provisions hereof or injunctive relief in any action brought
therefor. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein and for the
avoidance of doubt, this _Section 10.13_ does not supersede or modify the
exclusive remedy provisions set forth in ARTICLE IX in respect of the subject
matter covered thereby.

  



  

10.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by the parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be
an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the
same instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies hereof
each signed by less than all, but together signed by all, of the parties
hereto. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall
have received counterparts hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto.

  



  

10.15 _Obligation of Purchaser_. Whenever this Agreement requires Merger Sub
to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an
undertaking on the part of Purchaser to cause Merger Sub to take such action.

such enforcement is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).

  



  

(e) Other than as required or permitted by this Agreement, the applicable
Shares are now and shall at all times during the term of this Agreement be

respect to the ownership, transfer or voting of such Shares, and there are no
outstanding options, warrants or rights to purchase or acquire, or agreements
or arrangements relating to the voting of, any of such Shares other than this

local or foreign (each, a "Governmental Entity") or other party and except
for the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission")
of any Schedules 13D or 13G or amendments to Schedules 13D or 13G and filings
under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, as may be required in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby;

under, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration
or any payments under, or result in a loss of a benefit or in the creation or
imposition of a lien under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
note, lease, mortgage, indenture, license, agreement or other instrument or
obligation to which such Principal Stockholder is a party or by which such
Principal Stockholder or any of its assets is bound; or

  



  

(iv) violate the provisions of any order, writ, injunction, judgment, decree,
statute, rule or regulation applicable to such Principal Stockholder in such
a manner as would, individually or in the aggregate, or reasonably be
expected to materially impair the ability of such Principal Stockholder to
perform its obligations under this Agreement or prevent or delay the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(g) Such Principal Stockholder acknowledges receipt and review of the Merger
Agreement and understands the terms and conditions thereof. Such Principal
Stockholder has had the opportunity to review this Agreement and the Merger
Agreement with counsel of its own choosing. Such Principal Stockholder

Agreement in reliance upon such Principal Stockholders execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement.

  



  

(h) Such Principal Stockholder hereby waives, and agrees not to assert or
perfect, any dissenters rights or any similar rights that it may have by
virtue of ownership of the Shares.

  



  

(i) As of the date hereof, there is no action, suit, investigation or
proceeding pending, or, to the knowledge of such Principal Stockholder,
threatened, against or affecting, such Principal Stockholder or any of its
properties or assets (including the Shares) that could reasonably be expected
to impair the ability of such Principal Stockholder to perform its
obligations hereunder or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
on a timely basis.

  



  

3\. _Agreement to Vote Shares. _During the period commencing on the date
hereof and continuing until the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms (except as provided in the last sentence of this Section
3), each Principal Stockholder agrees to: (i) appear, or cause the
record holder of any Shares on the applicable record date (each a "Record
Holder") to appear (in person or by proxy), at any annual or special meeting
of the stockholders of the Company for the purpose of obtaining a quorum, or,
if stockholders of the Company are requested to vote their shares through the
execution of an action by written consent in lieu of any such annual or
special meeting of stockholders of the Company, such Principal Stockholder
agrees to execute or cause all Record Holders to execute such consent, and
(ii) vote (or, if requested, execute consents or proxies with respect to), or
cause each Record Holder to vote (or, if requested, execute consents or
proxies with respect to), the Shares and any New Shares (as defined in
Section 8 hereof): (A) in favor of adoption and approval of the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, at
every meeting (or in connection with any action by written consent) of the
stockholders of the Company at which such matters are considered and at every
adjournment or postponement thereof; (B) against any Acquisition

  



        
   

  



  

Proposal; (C) against any action, proposal, transaction or agreement which
would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of any covenant,
representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the
Company under the Merger Agreement or of such Principal Stockholder
under this Agreement; (D) against any liquidation,
dissolution, recapitalization, extraordinary dividend or significant
corporate reorganization of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; (E)
except as otherwise agreed to in writing in advance by Purchaser, against any
other action, proposal, transaction or agreement that would reasonably be
expected to compete or interfere with, or would reasonably be expected to
delay, discourage, adversely affect or inhibit the timely consummation of,
the Merger; and (F) in favor of any other matter necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement which
is considered at any such meeting of stockholders. Each Principal
Stockholder agrees not to enter into any agreement, letter of
intent, agreement in principle or understanding whatsoever with any Person
that would reasonably be expected to violate, conflict or interfere with the
provisions of this Agreement or that would reasonably be expected to delay,
discourage, adversely affect or inhibit the timely consummation of the
Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Principal Stockholder shall
remain free to vote (or execute consents or proxies with respect to) the
Shares with respect to any matter not covered by this Section 3 in any manner
it deems appropriate, _provided_ that such vote (or execution of consents or
proxies with respect thereto) would not reasonably be expected to (i) violate
or conflict with the provisions of this Agreement or (ii) materially impair
the ability of such Principal Stockholder to perform its obligations under
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary
contained herein, the obligations of the Principal Stockholders under this
Section 3 shall be suspended during the pendency of an Adverse Recommendation
Change due to an Intervening Event (provided that such obligations shall be
reinstated at such time, if any, that the Board or a committee thereof
withdraws the Adverse Recommendation Change or approves or recommends the
Merger Agreement subsequent to the Adverse Recommendation Change).

  



  

4\. _Representations of Purchaser_. Purchaser hereby represents and warrants
to the Principal Stockholders as follows:

  



  

(a) Purchaser is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of Purchaser and no
other corporate proceedings on the part of Purchaser are necessary to
authorize this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
Purchaser and is a valid and binding agreement of Purchaser enforceable
against it in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability relating
to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles
(regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding at law
or in equity).

  



        
   

  



  

(c) The execution, delivery and performance by Purchaser of this Agreement
and the consummation by Purchaser of the transactions contemplated hereby do
not and shall not (including with notice or lapse of time or both):

  



  

(i) contravene or conflict with the certificate of incorporation or the
bylaws of Purchaser;

  



  

(ii) result in any violation or the breach of, or constitute a default under,
or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration or any
payments under, or result in a loss of a benefit or in the creation or
imposition of a lien under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
note, lease, mortgage, indenture, license, agreement or other instrument or
obligation to which Purchaser is a party or by which Purchaser or any of its
assets may be bound;

  



  

(iii) violate the provisions of any order, writ, injunction, judgment,
decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to Purchaser in such a manner
as would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
materially impair the ability of Purchaser to perform its obligations under
this Agreement or prevent or delay the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or

  



  

(iv) require any consent, approval, order, authorization or permit of, or
registration or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Entity or
other party.

  



  

(d) Purchaser does not, and will not at any time during the term of this
Agreement, directly or indirectly, own, beneficially or of record, any shares
of Company Common Stock **.**

  



  

5\. _No Solicitations_. Subject to Section 12 hereof, each Principal
Stockholder, in its capacity as a beneficial owner of Shares and New Shares,
agrees that it shall not, (a) solicit or initiate or knowingly encourage or
facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-public information) any
proposal, inquiry, offer or request that constitutes, or that is
reasonably likely to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (b) enter into,
participate in, continue or engage in discussions or negotiations with any
Person regarding an Acquisition Proposal, or any proposal, inquiry, offer or
request that is reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or (c)
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or enter
into any agreement or agreement in principle regarding an Acquisition
Proposal, or any proposal, inquiry, offer or request that is reasonably
likely to lead to an Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

6\. _Transfer and Encumbrance_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, during the term of this
Agreement, each Principal Stockholder agrees not to, directly or indirectly,
transfer, sell, offer, hypothecate, assign, gift, pledge or otherwise dispose
of or encumber ("Transfer"), or enter into any contract, option or other
agreement with respect to, or consent to, a Transfer of, any of the Shares or
New Shares or such Principal Stockholders voting or economic interest
therein. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, during the term of this
Agreement, each Principal Stockholder agrees not to (i) grant any proxies,
options or rights of first offer or refusal with respect to any of the Shares
or New Shares, (ii) permit

  



        
   

  



  

any such Shares or New Shares to be, or become subject to, any pledges,
liens, preemptive rights, security interests, claims, charges or other
encumbrances or arrangements or (iii) enter into any voting agreement, voting
trust or other voting arrangement with respect to any of the Shares or New
Shares.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Principal Stockholder may take
any action described in the first sentence of this Section 6(a) or
clause (ii) of the second sentence of this Section 6(a), so long as
such Principal Stockholder provides Purchaser with prior written notice and
the other party (a "transferee") to such Transfer executes this Agreement (or
a joinder thereto in a form reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser) and agrees
to be bound by its terms; provided, however, that notwithstanding such
Transfer or arrangement, such Principal Stockholder shall continue to be
liable for any breach by such transferee of its agreements and covenants
under this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Any attempted Transfer of the Shares or the New Shares or any interest
therein, or any other attempted action or arrangement, in violation of this
Section 6 shall be null and void.

  



  

7\. _Additional Covenant of Principal Stockholders_. The Principal
Stockholders shall notify Purchaser of any development occurring after the
date of this Agreement that causes, or that would reasonably be expected to
cause, any breach of any of the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 2 hereof.

  



  

8\. _Additional Purchases_. Each Principal Stockholder agrees that it will
notify Purchaser in the event (a) any shares of Company Common Stock or other
voting securities of the Company are issued pursuant to any stock dividend,
stock split, recapitalization, reclassification, combination or exchange of
shares of capital stock of the Company on, of or affecting the Shares of such
Principal Stockholder or otherwise; (b) such Principal Stockholder purchases
or otherwise acquires beneficial ownership of any shares of Company Common
Stock or other voting securities of the Company after the execution of this
Agreement; or (c) such Principal Stockholder acquires the right to vote or
share in the voting of any shares of Company Common Stock or other voting
securities of the Company after the execution of this Agreement (such
additional Company Common Stock and other voting securities of the Company,
collectively, the "New Shares"). Each Principal Stockholder agrees that any
New Shares acquired or purchased by such Principal Stockholder shall be
subject to the terms of this Agreement to the same extent as if they
constituted Shares, and that it shall vote any such New Shares in the same
manner as the Shares.

  



  

9\. _Irrevocable Proxies_. Each Principal Stockholder hereby
irrevocably appoints Purchaser, or any nominee of Purchaser, with full power
of substitution, its proxy with full power and authority, in the event that
such Principal Stockholder shall at any time fail to perform its obligations
under Section 3 hereof, to vote or act by consent in respect of such
Principal Stockholders Shares exclusively as provided in Section 3 hereof.
Each proxy hereby granted shall, for the term of this Agreement, be
irrevocable and shall be deemed coupled with an interest in accordance with
Section 212 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything to the contrary contained herein, each proxy granted to
Purchaser under this Section 9 shall be suspended during the pendency of an
Adverse Recommendation Change due to an Intervening Event (provided that such
proxy shall be reinstated at such time, if any,

  



        
   

  



  

that the Board or a committee thereof withdraws the Adverse Recommendation
Change or approves or recommends the Merger Agreement subsequent to the
Adverse Recommendation Change).

  



  

10\. _Covenants of the Principal Stockholders_.

  



  

(a) Each Principal Stockholder agrees that it shall not seek to avoid the
observance or performance of any of the covenants, stipulations or conditions
to be observed or performed hereunder by such Principal Stockholder.

  



  

(b) Each Principal Stockholder will, in its capacity as a beneficial owner of
Shares and New Shares, (1) use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the
Company and Purchaser in connection with the Merger, (2) provide any
information reasonably requested by the Company or Purchaser for any
regulatory application or filing made, or approval sought, for the Merger
(including, without limitation, the Proxy/Prospectus and any Other Filings),
and (3) to the extent required by law, consent to and authorize the
publication and disclosure by Purchaser of such Principal Stockholders
identity and the holding of Shares and New Shares, and the nature of its
commitments, arrangements and understandings under this Agreement.

  



  

11\. _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each
of the parties hereto shall bear and pay all costs and expenses incurred by
it or on its behalf in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereunder, including fees and expenses of their own financial consultants,
investment bankers, accountants and counsel.

  



  

12\. _Fiduciary Duties_. Nothing contained herein shall limit or affect any
actions taken by a Principal Stockholder or any person or entity controlling
or under the control of a Principal Stockholder of the types described in the
first proviso of the first sentence of Section 7.10(b) of the Merger
Agreement in response to an Acquisition Proposal, to the extent that the
Company is permitted to take such actions under the aforementioned proviso,
nor shall anything contained herein limit or affect any actions taken by any
person in his or her capacity as a director of the Company, and none of such
actions taken in accordance with the provisions of this Section 12 or in
accordance with the provisions of the Merger Agreement shall constitute or be
deemed to constitute a breach of this Agreement.

  



  

13\. _Specific Performance_. Each party hereto acknowledges that it will be
impossible to measure in money the damages to the other parties if a party
hereto fails to comply with any of the obligations imposed by this Agreement,
that every such obligation is material and that, in the event of any such
failure, the other parties will not have an adequate remedy at law or in
damages.  Accordingly, each party hereto agrees that injunctive relief or
any other equitable remedy, in addition to remedies at law or in damages, is
the appropriate remedy for any such failure and will not oppose the granting
of such relief on the basis that the other party has an adequate remedy at
law or in damages. Each party hereto agrees that it will not seek, and
agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in
connection with any other partys seeking or obtaining such equitable relief.

  



        
   

  



  

14\. _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their
respective successors, assigns, heirs and devises, as applicable; and, other
than in respect of Section 6, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. This Agreement shall
not be assignable without the written consent of the other parties hereto,
except that Purchaser may assign all or any of its respective rights
hereunder to any affiliate, _provided_ that no such assignment shall relieve
Purchaser of its obligations hereunder.

  



  

15\. _Termination_. This Agreement will terminate on the earlier of (a) the
mutual agreement of Purchaser and GEI, (b) the Effective Time, (c) the
termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms, and (d) the
execution by the Company of any amendment, supplement, waiver or modification
to the Merger Agreement that has not previously been approved in writing by
GEI.

  



  

16\. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and the
instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

  



  

17\. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. This Agreement
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State
of Delaware without regard to its rules of conflict of laws.  Each of the
Principal Stockholders and the Purchaser hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally consents to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware, County of New Castle and of the United
States of America located in the District of Delaware (collectively,
the "Delaware Courts") for any litigation arising out of or relating to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to
commence any litigation relating thereto except in such courts), waives any
objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation in the Delaware
Courts and agrees not to plead or claim in any Delaware Court that such
litigation brought therein has been brought in an inconvenient forum. EACH OF
THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

  



  

18\. _Notices_. Any notice required to be given hereunder shall be sufficient
if in writing, and shall be deemed given and received when sent by facsimile

 **DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

  

 ** **

  

In this description, the word "UOL" refers only to United Online, Inc. or its
successors, and not to any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

UOL will issue the notes under an indenture among itself, the Guarantors and
a trustee to be selected by UOL that is reasonably acceptable to FTD. The
terms of the notes will include those stated in the indenture and those made
part of the indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended. The Collateral Documents referred to below under the caption
"Security" define the terms of the security arrangements that will secure
the notes.

  



  

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the
indenture and the Collateral Documents. It does not summarize those agreements
in their entirety. Certain defined terms used in this description but not
defined herein will have the meanings assigned to them in the indenture and
the Collateral Documents.

  



  

The registered holder of a note will be treated as the owner of it for all
purposes. Only registered holders will have rights under the indenture.

  



  

 **Brief Description of the Notes and the Note Guarantees**

  

 ** **

  

 ** _The Notes_**

  

 ** _ _**

  

The notes:

  



  

 will be general obligations of UOL;

  



  

 will be secured (equally and ratably with any Secured Senior Debt) by a
first priority pledge of the Capital Stock of CMC directly or indirectly,
owned by UOL, as set forth under "Security" below;

  



  

 will be secured (equally and ratably with any Secured Senior Debt) by other
collateral that may be pledged to secure such Secured Senior Debt; _provided_
that the notes will not be secured by Capital Stock of any Subsidiary of
UOL other than CMC or pledges of or Liens upon any intercompany notes of CMC,
UOL or any other Subsidiary of UOL;

  



  

 will be _pari passu_ in right of payment with all existing and future
Senior Debt of UOL;

  



  

 will be senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness
of UOL; and

  



  

 will be unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantors.

        
   

  



  

 ** _The Note Guarantees_**

  

 ** _ _**

  

The notes will be guaranteed by each of UOLs current and future Domestic
Subsidiaries, other than Intermediate Co., Merger Co., FTD and their
respective Subsidiaries.

  



  

Each Guarantee of the notes:

  



  

 will be a general obligation of the Guarantor;

  



  

 will be _pari passu_ in right of payment with all existing and future
Senior Debt of that Guarantor; and

  



  

 will be senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness
of that Guarantor.

  



  

As of the date of the indenture, all of UOLs Subsidiaries, other than
Intermediate Co., Merger Co., FTD and their respective Subsidiaries, will be
"Restricted Subsidiaries," and CMC will be a direct or indirect Wholly Owned
Restricted Subsidiary of UOL, except in the event of a CMC IPO or a
transaction of the type described in clause 2(b) of the first paragraph under
the caption "Repurchase at the Option of HoldersAsset Sales," or the
issuance of Equity Interests of CMC in accordance with clause 8(b) of the
second paragraph of the definition of "Asset Sale." However, under the
circumstances described below under the caption "Certain
CovenantsDesignation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries," UOL will
be permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as "Unrestricted
Subsidiaries."  In addition, CMC and its Subsidiaries will automatically
become Unrestricted Subsidiaries upon consummation of a CMC IPO. Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the covenants or defaults in the
indenture. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not guarantee the notes.

  



  

 **Principal, Maturity and Interest**

  

 ** **

  

UOL will issue $100 million in aggregate principal amount of notes. UOL may
not issue additional notes under the indenture.  UOL will issue notes in
denominations of $1.00 and integral multiples of $1.00 in excess of $1.00.
The notes will mature on the fifth anniversary of the date of the indenture.

  



  

Interest on the notes will accrue at the rate of 13.0% per annum and will be
payable quarterly in arrears on  , 
,   and , commencing on 
, 2008. Interest on overdue principal and interest will accrue at a rate
that is 1% higher than the interest rate on the notes. UOL will make each
interest payment to the holders of record on the immediately preceding 
,  ,   and  .

  



  

Interest on the notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if
interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid.
Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve
30-day months.

  



        
   

  

 ** **

  

 **Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

  

 ** **

  

If (a) any holder has requested payment by mail or (b) a holder of at least
$100,000 in principal amount of notes has given wire transfer instructions to
UOL, then UOL will pay all principal, interest and premium, if any, on that
holders notes in accordance with those instructions. All other payments on
the notes will be made at the office or agency of the paying agent and
registrar within the City and State of New York unless UOL elects to make
interest payments by check mailed to the noteholders at their address set
forth in the register of holders.

  



  

 **Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

  

 ** **

  

The trustee will initially act as paying agent and registrar. UOL may change
the paying agent or registrar without prior notice to the holders of the
notes, and UOL or any of its Subsidiaries may act as paying agent or
registrar.

  



  

 **Transfer and Exchange**

  

 ** **

  

A holder may transfer or exchange notes in accordance with the provisions of
the indenture. The registrar and the trustee may require a holder, among
other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in
connection with a transfer of notes.  Holders will be required to pay all
taxes due on transfer. UOL will not be required to transfer or exchange any
note selected for redemption.  Also, UOL will not be required to transfer or
exchange any note for a period of 15 days before a selection of notes to be
redeemed.

  



  

 **Note Guarantees**

  

 ** **

  

The notes will be guaranteed by each of UOLs current and future Domestic
Subsidiaries, other than Intermediate Co., Merger Co., FTD and their
respective Subsidiaries.  These Note Guarantees will be joint and several
obligations of the Guarantors. The obligations of each Guarantor under its
Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent that Note Guarantee
from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law.

  



  

A Guarantor will not, directly or indirectly, consolidate or merge with or
into another Person or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise
dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets, in one or
more related transactions, to another Person, other than UOL or another
Guarantor, unless:

  



  

(1) immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default
exists; and

  



  

(2) either:

  



  

(a) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger
(if other than the Guarantor) or the Person to which such sale,
assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition has been made
assumes all the obligations of the Guarantor under its Note Guarantee, the
indenture and appropriate Collateral Documents pursuant to agreements
reasonably satisfactory to the trustee; or

  



        
   

  



  

(b) the transaction is otherwise permitted by the indenture.

  



  

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be released:

  



  

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or substantially
all of the assets of that Guarantor (including by way of merger or
consolidation) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect
to such transaction) UOL or a Restricted Subsidiary of UOL that is a
Guarantor, if the sale or other disposition is otherwise permitted by the
indenture;

  



  

(2) in connection with any sale or other disposition of the Capital Stock of
that Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect
to such transaction) UOL or a Restricted Subsidiary of UOL, if:

  



  

(a) the sale or disposition is otherwise permitted by the indenture; and

  



  

(b) that Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary upon completion
of such sale or disposition;

  



  

(3) if UOL designates any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor to be an
Unrestricted Subsidiary or, in the case of CMC and its Subsidiaries, upon
consummation of a CMC IPO; or

  



  

(4) upon legal or covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the
indenture as provided below under the captions "Legal Defeasance and
Covenant Defeasance" and "Satisfaction and Discharge."

  



  

 **Security**

  

 ** **

  

The notes will be secured (equally and ratably with any Secured Senior Debt)
by a first priority pledge of the Capital Stock of CMC directly or indirectly
owned by UOL. If any Restricted Subsidiary of UOL owns Capital Stock of CMC,
such Restricted Subsidiary will be required to pledge such Capital Stock of
CMC on the same equal and ratable basis as the pledge by UOL of the Capital
Stock of CMC owned by UOL described herein. The notes are also required to be
secured, together with any Secured Senior Debt of UOL, equally and ratably by
first priority Liens on the Collateral granted to the collateral trustee for
the benefit of the holders of the Secured Senior Debt (and the Note
Guarantees of any Guarantor granting Liens on Collateral to secure such
Guarantors obligations in respect of Secured Senior Debt are required to be
to secured equally and ratably by first priority Liens on such Collateral),
subject to Permitted Liens and excluding (i) Liens in respect of the Capital
Stock of any Subsidiary of UOL other than CMC and (ii) Liens in respect
of intercompany notes of CMC, UOL or any other Subsidiary of UOL. To the
extent that the Secured Senior Debt is secured by the Capital Stock of any
Subsidiary of UOL other than CMC or by intercompany notes of CMC, UOL or any
Subsidiary of UOL, the holders of the notes will not have any rights with
respect to such Capital Stock or intercompany notes. The Collateral
in respect of which Liens are granted to the collateral trustee to secure
both the notes and the Note Guarantee, on the one hand, and the Secured
Senior Debt, on the other hand, is referred to as the " _Joint Collateral_."
The Joint Collateral shall not include pledges of or Liens upon the Capital
Stock of any Subsidiary of UOL

  



        
   

  



  

other than CMC or pledges of or Liens upon any intercompany notes of CMC, UOL
or any other Subsidiary of UOL. " _Secured Senior Debt Collateral_ " shall
mean assets securing the Secured Senior Debt, which assets do not secure the
notes and the Note Guarantees.

  



  

On the date of the indenture, UOL and the trustee will enter into a pledge
agreement defining the terms of the pledge of the Capital Stock of CMC
directly or indirectly owned by UOL that secures the notes ( _provided_
 that if Secured Senior Debt is to be incurred on the date of the
indenture, such pledge agreement will instead be entered into directly by the
collateral trustee). Upon the incurrence by UOL or any Guarantor of Secured
Senior Debt, the trustee will assign its pledge to a collateral trustee
pursuant to documentation in respect of such assignment attached to the
indenture. Concurrently therewith, UOL, the Guarantors granting Liens on
Collateral, representatives of the holders of Secured Senior Debt, the
trustee and a collateral trustee to be selected by UOL and reasonably
acceptable to the trustee and such representatives, will enter into
Collateral Documents defining the terms of the Liens granted on the Joint
Collateral.  The Liens created by the Collateral Documents will secure the
payment and performance when due of all of the Obligations of UOL and the
Guarantors under the Secured Senior Debt, all Obligations of UOL (to the
extent granting such Liens) under the indenture and the notes and all
Obligations of the Guarantors (to the extent granting such Liens) under the
Note Guarantees, as provided in the Collateral Documents. If additional
Collateral is to be provided in the future to secure the notes or the Note
Guarantees, UOL or any or all of the Guarantors, as the case may be, the
trustee, the collateral trustee and the representatives of the holders of the
Secured Senior Debt will enter into such additional Collateral Documents
as UOL may request from time to time.

  



  

The trustee and collateral trustee shall execute all Collateral Documents
requested by UOL if such Collateral Documents collectively provide for (i) an
equal and ratable first priority Lien (subject to Permitted Liens) on the
Joint Collateral to secure the payment and performance when due of all of
the Obligations of UOL and the Guarantors granting such Liens under the
Secured Senior Debt, the indenture, the notes and the Note Guarantees, (ii)
allocation of the proceeds of the Joint Collateral on an equal and ratable
basis in accordance with the outstanding principal amounts of the notes and
the Secured Senior Debt (including letters of credit, but subject to payment
of expenses, of collection and of other Collateral maintenance
and enforcement costs), (iii) all instructions with respect to enforcement
of remedies in respect of the Capital Stock of CMC directly or indirectly
owned by UOL and, except as provided below or as otherwise provided in the
indenture, any release of the Liens thereon to be provided by the holders of
more than 50% of the outstanding principal amount of the notes, (iv) all
required instructions with respect to all other Joint Collateral (including,
without limitation, in connection with the enforcement of remedies with
respect thereto or any release of the Liens thereon) to be provided by the
holders of more than 50% of the outstanding principal amount of the Secured
Senior Debt (including unfunded commitments that remain in effect) or the
representative thereof, or as otherwise specified in documents governing
Secured Senior Debt, (v) no limitations on the ability of the trustee to
accelerate the notes or the Note Guarantees or on the ability of the
collateral trustee to exercise remedies against the Capital Stock of CMC
directly or indirectly owned by UOL on behalf of the holders of the notes or
the trustee (in each case, following the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default and in accordance with the indenture), and
(vi) no limitations on the ability of the holders of the Secured Senior Debt
(or representatives thereof) to accelerate the Secured Senior Debt or on the
ability of the

  



        
   

  



  

collateral trustee to exercise remedies against the other Joint Collateral
following the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default
under the Secured Senior Debt in accordance with the documentation in respect
of the Secured Senior Debt.

  



  

The Collateral Documents will provide that all remedies with respect to
Secured Senior Debt Collateral will be exercised as determined by holders of
the Secured Senior Debt and all proceeds relating thereto will be applied
solely to the satisfaction of the Secured Senior Debt and payment of related
expenses. The trustee will not be a party to or have rights with respect to
the documentation relating to the Secured Senior Debt Collateral.

  



  

The Collateral Documents will set forth rights of holders of Secured Senior
Debt to provide debtor-in-possession financing, permit the use of cash
collateral, and secure Liens on the Joint Collateral as security therefor
with priority to the Liens in favor of the collateral trustee and the Secured
Senior Debt. The Collateral Documents will also contain other provisions
consistent with the provisions of the indenture described in this section
entitled "Security" relating to the rights of the holders of the notes and
the holders of the Secured Senior Debt with respect to the Joint Collateral,
following the commencement of an insolvency proceeding.

  



  

UOL will be entitled to receive all cash dividends made upon or with respect
to the Capital Stock of CMC directly or indirectly owned by UOL and pledged
by UOL, and to exercise any voting and other consensual rights pertaining to
the Capital Stock of CMC directly or indirectly owned by UOL and pledged by
UOL until (i) the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default
and (ii) notice from the trustee that UOL is not permitted to
receive dividends or exercise such rights ( _provided_ that no such notice
shall be required in the context of an insolvency Event of Default).

  



  

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and
after the giving of notice by the collateral trustee of its intent to
exercise such remedies ( _provided_ that no such notice shall be required in
the context of an insolvency Event of Default):

  



  

(1) all rights of UOL to exercise such voting or other consensual rights will
cease, and all such rights will become vested in the trustee or the
collateral trustee, as the case may be, which, to the extent permitted by
law, will have the sole right to exercise such voting and other consensual
rights;

  



  

(2) all rights of UOL to receive cash dividends made upon or with respect to
the Capital Stock of CMC directly or indirectly owned by UOL will cease and
such cash dividends will be paid to the trustee or the collateral trustee, as
the case may be; and

  



  

(3) the trustee or the collateral trustee, as the case may be, may sell the
Collateral or any part of the Collateral in accordance with the terms of
Collateral Documents. In the event any Secured Senior Debt is outstanding,
the trustee or the collateral trustee, as the case may be, in accordance with
the Collateral Documents will distribute all funds realized with respect to
the Joint Collateral for the benefit of the holders of the notes and the
holders of the Secured Senior Debt (subject to payment of enforcement and
administrative costs).  In the event no Secured Senior Debt is outstanding,
the trustee will distribute all funds realized with respect to the Collateral
for the benefit of the holders of the notes (subject to

  



        
   

  



  

payment of enforcement and administrative costs) until the notes have been
repaid in full, with any excess funds to be distributed in accordance with
the Collateral Documents.

  



  

Prior to execution of the collateral trust agreement or other
intercreditor agreement, the trustee will determine, in accordance with the
indenture, the circumstances and manner in which the Collateral will be
disposed of following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
of Default, including, but not limited to, the determination of whether to
release all or any portion of the Collateral from the Liens created by the
Collateral Documents and whether to foreclose on the Collateral following the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default. Upon execution
of the collateral trust agreement or other intercreditor agreement, the
collateral trustee will determine the circumstances and manner in which
the Collateral will be disposed of following the occurrence of an Event of
Default, including, but not limited to, the determination of whether to
release all or any portion of the Collateral from the Liens created by the
security documents and whether to foreclose on the Collateral following an
Event of Default (based on instructions from the trustee, in the case of the
Collateral consisting of Capital Stock of CMC and, in all other cases, based
on instructions from the holders of Secured Senior Debt or their
representative).

  



  

Under the Collateral Documents, if the collateral trustee at any time
receives written notice that any event has occurred that constitutes an Event
of Default under the indenture or any Secured Senior Debt document entitling
the collateral trustee to foreclose upon, collect or otherwise enforce its
Liens thereunder, it will promptly deliver written notice thereof to the
trustee under the indenture and each representative of the Secured Senior
Debt. Thereafter, the collateral trustee shall await direction by (i) in the
case of the Capital Stock of CMC directly or indirectly owned by UOL, holders
of the notes as required under the indenture and (ii) in the case of all
other Collateral (including all other Joint Collateral) subject to the
Collateral Documents, holders of the Secured Senior Debt in accordance with
the documentation in respect of the Secured Senior Debt, and will act, or
decline to act, as directed by the applicable holders under clause (i) or
(ii) above, in the exercise and enforcement of the collateral trustees
interests, rights, powers and remedies in respect of the Collateral or under
the Collateral Documents or applicable law and, following the initiation of
such exercise of remedies, the collateral trustee will act, or decline to
act, with respect to the manner of such exercise of remedies as directed by
the applicable holders under clause (i) or (ii) above.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary expressed or implied herein, the
Liens securing the notes and Note Guarantees will be released without any act
by or notice to the holders of the notes:

  



  

(1) upon the full and final payment and performance of all Obligations of UOL
under the indenture and the notes;

  



  

(2) if, and to the extent, the Capital Stock of CMC directly or indirectly
 owned by UOL is sold in accordance with the terms of the indenture;

  



  

(3) with respect to Collateral other than Capital Stock of CMC owned by UOL,
(i) in the event the holders of Secured Senior Debt release their Lien on
such Collateral or the Secured Senior Debt is paid in full, (ii) as provided
in the Collateral

        
   

  



  

Documents relating to such Collateral or the agreements governing such
Secured Senior Debt or (iii) upon the sale or disposition of such Collateral
to a Person other than UOL or a Guarantor in accordance with the terms of the
indenture; and

  



  

(4) upon legal or covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the
indenture as provided below under the captions "Legal Defeasance and
Covenant Defeasance" and "Satisfaction and Discharge."

  



  

The trustee and the collateral trustee are authorized to release the Liens
securing the Collateral pursuant to any of the foregoing and as otherwise set
forth in the Collateral Documents, and will be obligated to execute such
documents and instruments as UOL may require to effectuate any such release.

  



  

To the extent applicable, UOL will cause TIA § 313(b), relating to reports,
and TIA § 314(d), relating to the release of property or securities or
relating to the substitution therefor of any property or securities to be
subjected to the Lien of the security documents, to be complied with. Any
certificate or opinion required by TIA § 314(d) may be made by an officer of
UOL except in cases where TIA § 314(d) requires that such certificate or
opinion be made by an independent Person, which Person will be an independent
engineer, appraiser or other expert selected or reasonably satisfactory to
the trustee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, UOL
will not be required to comply with all or any portion of TIA § 314(d) if it
determines, in good faith, that under the terms of TIA § 314(d) and/or any
interpretation or guidance as to the meaning thereof of the SEC and its
staff, including "no action" letters or exemptive orders, all or any portion
of TIA § 314(d) is inapplicable to one or a series of released Collateral.

  



  

 **Redemption of Notes**

  



  

 ** _Optional Redemption_**

  

 ** _ _**

  

UOL may redeem all or a part of the notes (equal to $1.00 or an integral

Unless UOL defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will

applicable redemption date.

  



        
   

  



  

 ** _Mandatory Redemption_**

  

 ** _ _**

  

Within one business day following consummation of a CMC IPO, UOL shall
deposit with the trustee an amount in cash equal to the lesser of (i) $50
million and (ii) the then-outstanding principal amount of notes plus accrued
interest to the date of redemption, and will direct the trustee to issue a
notice to the holders of notes for the redemption of the maximum principal
amount of notes (equal to $1.00 or an integral multiple of $1.00 in excess
thereof) that may be redeemed with respect to such amount deposited, at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption, subject
to the right of holders of notes on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Such redemption shall be
required no later than 45 days following consummation of a CMC IPO. Unless
UOL defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to
accrue on the notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the
applicable redemption date.

  



  

 ** _Selection and Notice_**

  

 ** _ _**

  

If less than all of the notes are to be redeemed at any time, the trustee
will select notes for redemption on a _pro rata_ basis unless otherwise
required by law or applicable stock exchange or depositary requirements.

  



  

Notices of redemption will be mailed by first-class mail at least 30 but not
more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of notes to be
redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be
mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued
in connection with a legal or covenant defeasance or a satisfaction and
discharge of the indenture.  Notices of redemption may not be conditional.

  



  

If any note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that
relates to that note will state the portion of the principal amount of that
note that is to be redeemed. A new note in principal amount equal to
the unredeemed portion of the original note will be issued in the name of
the holder of notes upon cancellation of the original note. Notes called for
redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption.

  



  

 **Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

  

 ** **

  

 ** _Change of Control_**

  

 ** _ _**

  

If a Change of Control occurs, each holder of notes will have the right to
require UOL to repurchase all or any part (equal to $1.00 or an integral
multiple of $1.00 in excess thereof) of that holders notes for an amount in
cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, _plus_ accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (the " _Change of
Control Offer_ "), subject to the rights of holders of notes on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.
Within 30 days following any Change of Control, UOL will mail a notice to
each holder describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the
Change of Control and offering to repurchase notes on the payment date
specified in the notice (the " _Change of Control Payment Date_ "), which
date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date
such notice is mailed, pursuant to the procedures required by the indenture
and described in such notice.

  



        
   

  



  

On the Change of Control Payment Date, UOL will, to the extent lawful:

  



  

(1) accept for payment all notes or portions of notes properly tendered
pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

  



  

(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount for the payment of all notes or
portions of notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;
and

  



  

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the trustee the notes properly
accepted together with an Officers Certificate stating the aggregate
principal amount of notes or portions of notes being purchased by UOL.

  



  

The paying agent will promptly mail to each holder of notes properly tendered
and accepted for payment in the Change of Control Offer payment for such
notes, and the trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be
transferred by book entry) to each holder a new note equal in principal
amount to any unpurchased portion of the notes surrendered, if any. UOL will
publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer within 90 days
after the Change of Control Payment Date. The provisions described above
that require UOL to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of
Control will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of
the indenture are applicable.

  



  

UOL will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of
Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner,
at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in
the indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by UOL and
purchases all notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of
Control Offer, or (2) notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the
indenture as described above under the caption "Redemption of NotesOptional
Redemption," unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable
redemption price.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control,
conditional upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive
agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of
Control Offer is made.

  



  

Notes purchased by UOL pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will have the
status of notes issued but not outstanding or will be retired and canceled at
the option of UOL.  Notes purchased by a third party pursuant to the
preceding paragraph will have the status of notes issued and outstanding.

  



  

UOL will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act
and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those
laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of
notes pursuant to any Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of
Control Offer provisions of the indenture, UOL will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have
breached its obligations under such provisions by virtue of such compliance.

  



  

This Change of Control provision is a result of negotiations between UOL and
FTD. UOL has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a
Change of Control,

  



        
   

  



  

although it is possible that UOL could decide to do so in the future. Subject
to the limitations discussed below, UOL could, in the future, enter into
certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other
recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the
indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at
such time or otherwise affect UOLs capital structure or credit rating.

  



  

Future Indebtedness of UOL may contain prohibitions on certain events that
would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be
repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders
of their right to require UOL to repurchase the notes could cause a default
under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due
to the financial effect of such repurchase on UOL.  Finally, UOLs ability
to pay cash to the holders upon a repurchase may be limited by UOLs then-
existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds
will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases.

  



  

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the sale,
lease or transfer of "all or substantially all" of the assets of UOL and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a developing body of
case law interpreting the phrase "substantially all," under New York law,
which governs the indenture, there is no precise established definition of
the phrase. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of notes to require UOL to
repurchase such notes as a result of a sale, lease or transfer of less than
all of the assets of UOL and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another
Person or group may be uncertain.

  



  

 ** _Excess Cash Flow Offer_**

  

 ** _ _**

  

If the Excess Cash Flow of UOL for any Excess Cash Flow Period is greater
than zero, UOL will make an offer (an " _Excess Cash Flow Offer_ ") to all
holders of notes to purchase the maximum principal amount of notes (equal to
$1.00 or an integral multiple of $1.00 in excess thereof) that may be
purchased out of such Excess Cash Flow for such Excess Cash Flow Period, for
an amount in cash equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase, subject to
the rights of holders of notes on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date; _provided_ that the
maximum principal amount of notes required to be purchased in such Excess
Cash Flow Offer (the " _Required Amount_ ") shall be (a) for the Excess Cash
Flow Period ending on September 30, 2009, the lesser of (i) $20 million and
(ii) the amount of Excess Cash Flow for such Excess Cash Flow Period, and (b)
for any Excess Cash Flow Period ending after September 30, 2009, the lesser
of (i) $10 million and (ii) the amount of Excess Cash Flow for such Excess
Cash Flow Period; _provided_ , _further_ , that UOL may, in its sole
discretion, increase the amount of any such Excess Cash Flow Offer (the
amount of such increase, the " _Optional Amount_ ," and together with the
Required Amount, the " _Total Amount_ "). If an Excess Cash Flow Offer is
required to be made, UOL will mail a notice to each holder (x) on or
before May 15 following any Excess Cash Flow Period ending on March 31
of the same year, and (y) on or before November 15 following any Excess Cash
Flow Period ending on September 30 of the same year, offering to repurchase
notes on the payment date specified in the notice (the " _Excess Cash Flow
Payment Date_ "), which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later
than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, pursuant to the procedures
required by the indenture and described in such notice.

  



        
   

  



  

On the Excess Cash Flow Payment Date, UOL will, to the extent lawful:

  



  

(1) accept for payment all notes or portions of notes properly tendered
pursuant to the Excess Cash Flow Offer (up to the Total Amount);

  



  

(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount for the payment of all notes or
portions of notes properly tendered pursuant to the Excess Cash Flow Offer
(up to the Total Amount plus accrued and unpaid interest on the notes so
accepted); and

  



  

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the trustee the notes properly
accepted together with an Officers Certificate stating the aggregate
principal amount of notes or portions of notes being purchased by UOL.

  



  

The paying agent will promptly mail to each holder of notes properly tendered
and accepted for payment in the Excess Cash Flow Offer payment for such
notes, and the trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be
transferred by book entry) to each holder a new note equal in principal
amount to any unpurchased portion of the notes surrendered, if any. UOL will
publicly announce the results of the Excess Cash Flow Offer within 90 days
after the related Excess Cash Flow Payment Date.

  



  

If any Excess Cash Flow remains after consummation of an Excess Cash Flow
Offer, UOL may use that Excess Cash Flow for any purpose not otherwise
prohibited by the indenture.  If the aggregate principal amount of notes
tendered pursuant to an Excess Cash Flow Offer exceeds the amount of such
Excess Cash Flow Offer, the trustee will select the notes to be purchased on
a _pro rata_ basis unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock
exchange or depositary requirements.

  



  

UOL will not be required to make an Excess Cash Flow Offer if notice of
redemption has been given pursuant to the indenture as described above under
the caption "Redemption of NotesOptional Redemption," unless and until
there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price.

  



  

UOL will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act
and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those
laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of
notes pursuant to any Excess Cash Flow Offer. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Excess
Cash Flow Offer provisions of the indenture, UOL will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have
breached its obligations under such provisions by virtue of such compliance.

  



  

 ** _Asset Sales_**

  

 ** _ _**

  

UOL will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
consummate an Asset Sale unless:

  



  

(1) UOL (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives
consideration at the time of the Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market
Value of the assets or Equity Interests

  



        
   

  



  

issued or sold or otherwise disposed of (as determined in good faith by UOLs
Board of Directors); and

  



  

(2) (a) at least 75% of the consideration therefor received in the Asset Sale
by UOL or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash or Cash
Equivalents, _provided_ that the amount of:

  



  

(i) any liabilities, as shown on UOLs most recent consolidated balance
sheet, of UOL or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities
and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the notes or any Note
Guarantee) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets pursuant to
a customary novation or indemnity agreement that releases UOL or such
Restricted Subsidiary from or indemnifies against further liability; or

  



  

(ii) any securities, notes or other obligations received by UOL or any
such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by UOL or
such Restricted Subsidiary into cash within 90 days following the receipt
thereof, to the extent of the cash received in that conversion,

  



  

shall be deemed to be Cash Equivalents for the purposes of this provision; or

  



  

(b) with respect to any Asset Sale that involves the issuance or transfer
(including in any merger or consolidation) of Capital Stock of a Restricted
Subsidiary, the consideration received therefor is in the form of (i) Capital
Stock of another Person, or (ii) cash or Cash Equivalents, and any
combination thereof, and, after giving effect to any such acquisition of
Capital Stock, such other Person (A) is or becomes a Wholly Owned Restricted
Subsidiary of (x) UOL or (y) a Restricted Subsidiary of UOL that is a
Guarantor, and (B) is or becomes a Guarantor.

  



        
   

  



  

Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not in the form provided in clause
(2)(b)(i) of the first paragraph of this covenant will constitute " _Excess
Proceeds_." When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $10 million,
UOL will, within 15 days thereof, make an offer (an " _Asset Sale Offer_ ") to
all holders of notes to purchase the maximum principal amount of notes (equal
to $1.00 or an integral multiple of $1.00 in excess thereof) that may be
purchased out of the Excess Proceeds in an amount equal to:

  



  

(1) the Excess Proceeds, _multiplied by_

  



  

(2) a fraction (a) the numerator of which is equal to the outstanding
principal amount of the notes and (b) the denominator of which is equal to
the outstanding principal amount of notes and all Secured Senior Debt and
other _pari passu_ Indebtedness (excluding intercompany Indebtedness) that
has been or is required to be repaid, redeemed or tendered for in connection
with the Asset Sale (such product, the " _Excess Proceeds Amount_ "),

  



  

for an amount in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase, subject to the
right of the holders of notes on the relevant record date to receive interest
due. If an Asset Sale Offer is required to be made, UOL will mail a notice to
each holder, offering to repurchase notes on the payment date specified in
the notice (an " _Asset Sale Payment Date_ "), which date will be no earlier
than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed,
pursuant to the procedures required by the indenture and described in such
notice.

  



  

If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, UOL
may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the
indenture.  In addition, if holders of _pari passu_  Indebtedness do not
accept any such offers, UOL may use such amounts for any purpose not
prohibited by the indenture.  If the aggregate principal amount of notes
tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer exceeds the Excess Proceeds Amount,
the trustee will select the notes to be purchased on a _pro rata_  basis
unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or
depositary requirements. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the
amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero.

  



  

On the Asset Sale Payment Date, UOL will, to the extent lawful:

  



  

(1) accept for payment all notes or portions of notes properly tendered (up
to the Excess Proceeds Amount) pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer;

  



  

(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount for the payment of all notes or
portions of notes properly tendered (up to the Excess Proceeds Amount plus
accrued and unpaid interest on the notes so accepted) pursuant to the Asset
Sale Offer; and

  



         
 

  



  

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the trustee the notes properly
accepted together with an Officers Certificate stating the aggregate
principal amount of notes or portions of notes being purchased by UOL.

  



  

The paying agent will promptly mail to each holder of notes properly tendered
and accepted for payment in the Asset Sale Offer payment for such notes, and
the trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred
by book entry) to each holder a new note equal in principal amount to any
unpurchased portion of the notes surrendered, if any. UOL will publicly
announce the results of the Asset Sale Offer within 90 days after the Asset
Sale Payment Date.

  



  

UOL will not be required to make an Asset Sale Offer if notice of redemption
has been given pursuant to the indenture as described above under the caption
"Redemption of NotesOptional Redemption," unless and until there is a
default in payment of the applicable redemption price.

  



  

UOL will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act
and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those
laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of
notes pursuant to any Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of
any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale Offer
provisions of the indenture, UOL will comply with the applicable securities
laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations
under such provisions by virtue of such compliance.

  



  

 ** _Subordinated Debt Issuances_**

  

 ** _ _**

  

Within 90 days following consummation of any Subordinated Debt Issuance, UOL
(or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may apply the
Net Proceeds from such Subordinated Debt Issuance to acquire all or
substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, a Person, if,
after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Person is
or becomes a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary of UOL that is a Guarantor.

  



  

Within 95 days following the consummation of such Subordinated Debt Issuance,
UOL will make an offer (a " _Debt Repurchase_ _Offer_ ") to all holders of
notes to purchase the maximum principal amount of notes (equal to $1.00 or an
integral multiple of $1.00 in excess thereof) that may be purchased out of
any Net Proceeds of such Subordinated Debt Issuance remaining after
the acquisitions permitted by the first paragraph of this covenant in an
amount equal to:

  



  

(1) the Net Proceeds, _multiplied by_

  



  

(2) a fraction (a) the numerator of which is equal to the outstanding
principal amount of the notes and (b) the denominator of which is equal to
the outstanding principal amount of notes and all Secured Senior Debt and
other _pari passu_ Indebtedness (excluding intercompany Indebtedness) that
has been or is required to be repaid, redeemed or tendered for in connection
with the Subordinated Debt Issuance (such product, the " _Debt Repurchase
Amount_ "),

  



        
   

  



  

for an amount in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase, subject to the
right of the holders of notes on the relevant record date to receive interest
due. If a Debt Repurchase Offer is required to be made, UOL will mail a
notice to each holder, offering to repurchase notes on the payment date
specified in the notice (a " _Debt Repurchase Payment Date_ "), which date
will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such
notice is mailed, pursuant to the procedures required by the indenture and
described in such notice.

  



  

If any Net Proceeds remain after consummation of a Debt Repurchase Offer, UOL
may use those Net Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the
indenture.  In addition, if holders of _pari passu_  Indebtedness do not
accept any such offers, UOL may use such amounts for any purpose not
prohibited by the indenture.  If the aggregate principal amount of notes
tendered pursuant to a Debt Repurchase Offer exceeds the Debt Repurchase
Amount, the trustee will select the notes to be purchased on a _pro rata_
 basis unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange
or depositary requirements. Upon completion of each Debt Repurchase Offer,
the amount of Net Proceeds will be reset at zero.

  



  

On the Debt Repurchase Payment Date, UOL will, to the extent lawful:

  



  

(1) accept for payment all notes or portions of notes properly tendered (up
to the Debt Repurchase Amount) pursuant to the Debt Repurchase Offer;

  



  

(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount for the payment of all notes or
portions of notes properly tendered (up to the Debt Repurchase Amount plus
accrued and unpaid interest on the notes so accepted) pursuant to the Debt
Repurchase Offer; and

  



  

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the trustee the notes properly
accepted together with an Officers Certificate stating the aggregate
principal amount of notes or portions of notes being purchased by UOL.

  



  

The paying agent will promptly mail to each holder of notes properly tendered
and accepted for payment in the Debt Repurchase Offer payment for such notes,
and the trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be
transferred by book entry) to each holder a new note equal in principal
amount to any unpurchased portion of the notes surrendered, if any. UOL will
publicly announce the results of the Debt Repurchase Offer within 90 days
after the Debt Repurchase Payment Date.

  



  

UOL will not be required to make a Debt Repurchase Offer if notice of
redemption has been given pursuant to the indenture as described above under
the caption "Redemption of NotesOptional Redemption," unless and until
there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price.

  



  

UOL will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act
and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those
laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of
notes pursuant to any Debt Repurchase Offer. To the extent that the provisions
of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Debt Repurchase
Offer provisions of the indenture, UOL will comply with the applicable

  



        
   

  



  

securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its
obligations under such provisions by virtue of such compliance.

  



  

 ** _Equity Issuances_**

  

 ** _ _**

  

Within 90 days following consummation of any Equity Issuance, UOL may apply
the Net Proceeds from such Equity Issuance:

  



  

(1) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets, or any Capital Stock,
of a Person, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital
Stock, the Person is or becomes a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary of UOL
that is a Guarantor; or

  



  

(2) to acquire other assets that are not classified as current assets under
GAAP; _provided_ that such assets must be held by a Wholly Owned Restricted
Subsidiary of UOL that is a Guarantor.

  



  

Within 95 days following the consummation of such Equity Issuance, UOL will
make an offer (an " _Equity_   _Repurchase_ _Offer_ ") to all holders of
notes to purchase the maximum principal amount of notes (equal to $1.00 or an
integral multiple of $1.00 in excess thereof) up to 50% of any Net Proceeds
of such Equity Issuance remaining after the acquisitions permitted by the
first paragraph of this covenant in an amount equal to:

  



  

(1) 50% of the Net Proceeds remaining after such acquisitions permitted by
the first paragraph of this covenant, _multiplied by_

  



  

(2) a fraction (a) the numerator of which is equal to the outstanding
principal amount of the notes and (b) the denominator of which is equal to
the outstanding principal amount of notes and all Secured Senior Debt and
other _pari passu_ Indebtedness (excluding intercompany Indebtedness) that
has been or is required to be repaid, redeemed, prepaid or tendered for in
connection with the Equity Issuance (such product, the " _Equity Repurchase
Amount_ "),

  



  

for an amount in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase, subject to the
right of the holders of notes on the relevant record date to receive interest
due. If an Equity Repurchase Offer is required to be made, UOL will mail a
notice to each holder, offering to repurchase notes on the payment date
specified in the notice (an " _Equity Repurchase Payment Date_ "), which date
will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such
notice is mailed, pursuant to the procedures required by the indenture and
described in such notice.

  



  

If any Net Proceeds remain after consummation of an Equity Repurchase Offer,
UOL may use those Net Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by
the indenture.  In addition, if holders of _pari passu_  Indebtedness do not
accept any such offers, UOL may use such amounts for any purpose not
prohibited by the indenture.  If the aggregate principal amount of notes
tendered pursuant to an Equity Repurchase Offer exceeds the Equity Repurchase
Amount, the trustee will select the notes to be purchased on a _pro rata_
basis unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or
depositary requirements.  Upon completion of each Equity Repurchase Offer,
the amount of Net Proceeds will be reset at zero.

  



        
   

  



  

On the Equity Repurchase Payment Date, UOL will, to the extent lawful:

  



  

(1) accept for payment all notes or portions of notes properly tendered (up
to the Equity Repurchase Amount) pursuant to the Equity Repurchase Offer;

  



  

(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount for the payment of all notes or
portions of notes properly tendered (up to the Equity Repurchase Amount plus
accrued and unpaid interest on the notes so accepted) pursuant to the Equity
Repurchase Offer; and

  



  

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the trustee the notes properly
accepted together with an Officers Certificate stating the aggregate
principal amount of notes or portions of notes being purchased by UOL.

  



  

The paying agent will promptly mail to each holder of notes properly tendered
and accepted for payment in the Equity Repurchase Offer payment for such
notes, and the trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be
transferred by book entry) to each holder a new note equal in principal
amount to any unpurchased portion of the notes surrendered, if any. UOL will
publicly announce the results of the Equity Repurchase Offer within 90 days
after the Equity Repurchase Payment Date.

  



  

UOL will not be required to make an Equity Repurchase Offer if notice of
redemption has been given pursuant to the indenture as described above under
the caption "Redemption of NotesOptional Redemption," unless and until
there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price.

  



  

UOL will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act
and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those
laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of
notes pursuant to any Equity Repurchase Offer. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Equity
Repurchase Offer provisions of the indenture, UOL will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have
breached its obligations under such provisions by virtue of such compliance.

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on
account of UOLs or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries Equity Interests
(including, without limitation, any payment in connection with any merger or
consolidation involving UOL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) or to the
direct or indirect holders of UOLs or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
Equity Interests in their capacity as such (other than dividends or
distributions payable in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of
UOL and other than dividends or distributions payable to UOL or a Restricted
Subsidiary of UOL);

  



        
   

  



  

(2) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value (including,
without limitation, in connection with any merger or consolidation involving
UOL) any Equity Interests of UOL or any direct or indirect parent of UOL;

  



  

(3) make any payment on or with respect to, or purchase, redeem, defease or
otherwise acquire or retire for value any Indebtedness of UOL or any
Guarantor that is contractually subordinated to the notes or to any Note
Guarantee (excluding any intercompany Indebtedness payable to UOL or any of
its Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Guarantor), except a
payment of interest or principal at the Stated Maturity thereof; or

  



  

(4) make any Restricted Investment

  



  

(all such payments and other actions set forth in these clauses (1) through
(4) above being collectively referred to as " _Restricted Payments_ "),
unless, at the time of and after giving effect to such Restricted Payment:

  



  

(1) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would
occur as a consequence of such Restricted Payment;

  



  

(2) at the time of such Restricted Payment and after giving _pro forma_
effect thereto as if such Restricted Payment had been made at the beginning
of the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal
financial statements are available immediately prior to such Restricted
Payment, UOLs Total Indebtedness Leverage Ratio is less than 1.0 to 1.0; and

  



  

(3) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other
Restricted Payments made by UOL and its Restricted Subsidiaries since the
date of the indenture (excluding Restricted Payments permitted by clauses
(2), (3), (4), (6), (7), (8), (9), (12), (13) and (14) of the next succeeding
paragraph) is less than the sum, without duplication, of:

  



  

(a) 100% of the Excess Cash Flow of UOL for the period (taken as one
accounting period) beginning on the first day of the first month commencing
after the date of the indenture to the end of UOLs most recently ended
fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available at the
time of such Restricted Payment (or, if Excess Cash Flow for such period is a
deficit, less 100% of such deficit); _plus_

  



  

(b) 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds received by UOL since the date of
the indenture as a contribution to its common equity capital or from the
issue or sale of Equity Interests of UOL or from the issue or sale of
convertible or exchangeable Disqualified Stock of UOL or convertible or
exchangeable debt securities of UOL, in each case that have been converted
into or exchanged for such Equity Interests (other than Equity Interests or
Disqualified Stock or debt securities sold to a Subsidiary of UOL); _plus_

  



        
   

  



  

(c) to the extent that any Restricted Investment that was made after the date
of the indenture is sold for cash or otherwise cancelled, liquidated or
repaid for cash, the initial amount of such Restricted Investment (or if
less, the amount of cash received upon repayment or sale); _plus_

  



  

(d) to the extent that any Unrestricted Subsidiary of UOL (excluding
Intermediate Co. and its Subsidiaries and, after a CMC IPO, CMC and its
Subsidiaries) designated as such after the date of the indenture is
redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary after the date of the indenture, the
lesser of (i) the Fair Market Value of UOLs Investment in such Subsidiary as
of the date of such redesignation or (ii) such Fair Market Value as of the
date on which such Subsidiary was originally designated as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary after the date of the indenture; _plus_

  



  

(e) to the extent of any Restricted Investment made after the date of the
indenture made in an entity that subsequently becomes a Wholly Owned
Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor and such Restricted Investment
remains outstanding, the aggregate amount of such Restricted Investment;
_plus_

  



  

(f) $40 million.

  



  

The preceding provisions will not prohibit:

  



  

(1) the payment of any dividend or the consummation of any irrevocable
redemption within 60 days after the date of declaration of the dividend or
giving of the redemption notice, as the case may be, if at the date of
declaration or notice, the dividend or redemption payment would have complied
with the provisions of the indenture;

  



  

(2) the making of any Restricted Payment in exchange for, or out of or with
the net cash proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale (other than to a
Subsidiary of UOL) of, Equity Interests of UOL (other than Disqualified
Stock) or from the substantially concurrent contribution of common equity
capital to UOL; _provided_ that the amount of any such net cash proceeds that
are utilized for any such Restricted Payment will not be considered to be net
proceeds of Equity Interests for the purpose of clause 3(b) of the preceding
paragraph;

  



  

(3) the repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement
for value of Indebtedness of UOL or any Guarantor that is contractually
subordinated to the notes or to any Note Guarantee with the net cash proceeds
from a substantially concurrent incurrence of Permitted Refinancing
Indebtedness;

  



  

(4) the payment of any dividend (or, in the case of any partnership or
limited liability company, any similar distribution) by a Restricted
Subsidiary of UOL to the holders of its Equity Interests on a _pro rata_
basis;

  



  

(5) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement for value of
any Equity Interests of UOL or

  



        
   

  



  

any Restricted Subsidiary of UOL held by any current or former officer,
director or employee of UOL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant to
any equity subscription agreement, stock option agreement, stockholders
agreement or similar agreement; _provided_  that the aggregate price paid for
all such repurchased, redeemed, acquired or retired Equity Interests may not
exceed $5 million;

  



  

(6) the repurchase of Equity Interests deemed to occur upon the exercise of
stock options to the extent such Equity Interests represent a portion of the
exercise price of those stock options;

  



  

(7) payments required to be made under the Tax Sharing Agreements or other
similar tax sharing agreements with any Subsidiary of UOL on terms no less
favorable to UOL in any material respect, taken as a whole, than the FTD Tax
Sharing Agreement as in effect as of the date of the indenture;

  



  

(8) payments made in connection with the acquisition by UOL of FTD,
including, without limitation, payments made concurrently with the issuance
of the notes (including, without limitation, fees and expenses), and payments
following the issuance of the notes, including, without limitation, payments
in connection with any appraisal or dissenters rights exercised by the
former stockholders of FTD;

  



  

(9) payments of cash, dividends, distributions, advances or other Restricted
Payments by UOL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to allow the payment of
cash in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares upon (i) the exercise of
options or warrants or (ii) the conversion or exchange of Capital Stock of
any such Person;

  



  

(10) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement for
value of any Subordinated Indebtedness pursuant to provisions similar to
those described under the captions "Change of Control" or "Asset Sales";
_provided_ that all notes tendered by holders in connection with a Change of
Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer, as applicable, have been repurchased,
redeemed or acquired for value;

  



  

(11) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, other Restricted Payments made prior to September 30, 2009 in an
aggregate amount not to exceed $20 million since the date of the indenture;
_provided_ that at the time of any such Restricted Payment and after giving
_pro forma_  effect thereto as if such Restricted Payment had been made at
the beginning of the end of the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters
for which internal financial statements are available immediately prior to
such Restricted Payment, UOLs Total Indebtedness Leverage Ratio is greater
than 1.0 to 1.0 and less than 1.25 to 1.0;

  



  

(12) cash payments in respect of purchases of options to purchase Capital
Stock of UOL acquired substantially concurrently with and in connection with
an offering of convertible debt securities of UOL in an amount not to exceed
15% of the gross proceeds to UOL of such convertible debt securities
(determined net of concurrent sales of any warrants with

  



        
   

  



  

respect to (or options to acquire) UOLs Capital Stock) and subsequent
acquisitions of Capital Stock by UOL pursuant to the exercise of such
options;

  



  

(13) acquisitions of Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary of UOL to the
extent such Restricted Subsidiary becomes a Wholly Owned Restricted
Subsidiary that is a Guarantor promptly following such acquisition; and

  



  

(14) effective repurchases of restricted stock or restricted stock units from
employees for the purposes of satisfying withholding tax obligations.

  



  

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) will be the Fair
Market Value on the date of the Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or
securities proposed to be transferred or issued by UOL or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted Payment. For the
avoidance of doubt, the distribution of Capital Stock of any Unrestricted
Subsidiary (including CMC or any of its Subsidiaries after a CMC IPO) to
stockholders of UOL shall constitute a Restricted Payment. If, pursuant to
the definition of "Fair Market Value," the Board of Directors is required to
determine the Fair Market Value of any assets or securities that are required
to be valued by this covenant, such determination by the Board of Directors
must be based upon an opinion or appraisal issued by an accounting, appraisal
or investment banking firm of national standing if the Fair Market Value
exceeds $20 million.

UOL will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise
become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise, with respect
to (collectively, " _incur_ ") any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt),
and UOL will not issue any Disqualified Stock and will not permit any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any shares of preferred stock; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that:

  



  

(a) UOL and the Guarantors may incur Senior Debt or Guarantor Senior Debt
(including Acquired Debt) if on the date of such incurrence, after giving
effect to such incurrence on a _pro forma_ basis (including a _pro forma_
application of the net proceeds therefrom), the Senior Debt Leverage Ratio is
less than 1.5 to 1.0; _provided_  that the Senior Debt and Guarantor Senior
Debt incurred pursuant to this clause (a) (including all Permitted
Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to renew, refund, refinance, replace,
defease or discharge any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (a))
shall not, without duplication, exceed $60 million at any time outstanding;
and

  



  

(b) UOL and the Guarantors may incur Subordinated Indebtedness (including
Acquired Debt) if the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio for UOLs most
recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial
statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such
additional Subordinated Indebtedness is incurred would have been at least 2.0
to 1.0, determined on a _pro forma_ basis (including a _pro forma_
application of the Net Proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Subordinated
Indebtedness had been incurred at the beginning of such four-quarter period;
_provided_ that (i) Subordinated Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this
clause (b) (including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to
renew,

  



        
   

  



  

refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge any Subordinated
Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (b)), shall not exceed $100
million at any time outstanding and (ii) the Stated Maturity of such
Subordinated Indebtedness with respect to the principal amount thereof shall
not in any event be earlier than the 91st day following the final maturity of
the notes.

  



  

This covenant will not prohibit the incurrence of any of the following items
of Indebtedness (collectively, " _Permitted Debt_ "):

  



  

(1) (a) the incurrence by UOL and its Restricted Subsidiaries of up to $5
million of unsecured Indebtedness existing on the date of the indenture and
(b) other Indebtedness existing on the date of the indenture; _provided_
that Indebtedness incurred under this sub-clause (b) shall be deemed to
have been incurred on the day after the date of the indenture for purposes of
this covenant;

  



  

(2) the incurrence by UOL and the Guarantors of Indebtedness represented by
the notes and the related Note Guarantees to be issued on the date of the
indenture;

  



  

(3) the incurrence by UOL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of
Indebtedness represented by Capital Lease Obligations, mortgage financings or

completion of such design, construction, installation or improvement) all or
any part of the purchase price or cost of design, construction, installation
or improvement of property, plant or equipment used in the business of UOL or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, in an aggregate principal amount,
including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to renew, refund,
refinance, replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness incurred pursuant
to this clause (3), not to exceed $20 million at any time outstanding;

  



  

(4) the incurrence by UOL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Permitted
Refinancing Indebtedness in exchange for, or the Net Proceeds of which are
used to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge any
Indebtedness (other than intercompany Indebtedness) that was permitted by the
indenture to be incurred under clauses (1), (2) or (4) of this paragraph;

  



  

(5) the incurrence by UOL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of
intercompany Indebtedness between or among UOL and any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that:

  



  

(a) if UOL or any Guarantor is the obligor on such Indebtedness and the payee
is not UOL or a Guarantor, such Indebtedness must be unsecured and expressly
subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all Obligations then due
with respect to the notes, in the case of UOL, or the Note Guarantee, in the
case of a Guarantor; and

  



  

(b) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results
in any such Indebtedness being held by a Person other than UOL or a
Restricted Subsidiary of UOL and (ii) any sale or other transfer of any

  



        
   

  



  

such Indebtedness to a Person that is not either UOL or a Restricted
Subsidiary of UOL,

  



  

will be deemed, in each case, to constitute an incurrence of such
Indebtedness by UOL or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that
was not permitted by this clause (5);

  



  

(6) the issuance by any of UOLs Restricted Subsidiaries to UOL or to any of
its Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiaries that are Guarantors of shares of
preferred stock; _provided_ , _however_ , __ that:

  



  

(a) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results
in any such preferred stock being held by a Person other than UOL or a
Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary of UOL that is a Guarantor; and

  



  

(b) any sale or other transfer of any such preferred stock to a Person
that is not either UOL or a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary of UOL that is
a Guarantor,

  



  

will be deemed, in each case, to constitute an issuance of such preferred
stock by such Restricted Subsidiary that was not permitted by this clause
(6);

  



  

(7) the incurrence by UOL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Hedging
Obligations in the ordinary course of business;

  



  

(8) the Guarantee by UOL or any of the Guarantors of Indebtedness of UOL or a
Guarantor that was permitted to be incurred by another provision of this
covenant; _provided _ that if the other Indebtedness being guaranteed is
subordinated to or _pari passu_ with the notes, then the Guarantee must be
subordinated or _pari passu_ , as applicable, to the same extent as the
Indebtedness guaranteed;

  



  

(9) the incurrence by UOL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of
Indebtedness in respect of (including the issuance of letters of credit to
secure obligations or insurance related thereto) workers compensation claims
or reimbursement type obligations regarding workers compensation claims,
health, disability or other benefits to employees or former employees or
their families or property, casualty or liability insurance or self-insurance
obligations, bankers acceptances, performance, bid, appeal and surety bonds
and completion guarantees in the ordinary course of business, or maintenance
of, or pursuant to the requirements of, environmental or other permits or
licenses from governmental authorities;

  



  

(10) the incurrence by UOL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of
Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial
institution of a check, draft or similar instrument inadvertently drawn
against insufficient funds, so long as such Indebtedness is covered within
five business days;

  



  

(11) the incurrence by UOL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of
additional unsecured Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount (or
accreted value, as applicable) at any

  



        
   

  



  

time outstanding, including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred
to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness
incurred pursuant to this clause (11), not to exceed $15 million;

  



  

(12) the Guarantee by any Restricted Subsidiary of UOL that is not a
Guarantor of Indebtedness of another Restricted Subsidiary of UOL that is not
a Guarantor;

  



  

(13) the incurrence by UOL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of
Indebtedness in respect of the financing of insurance premiums; and

  



  

(14) the incurrence of Indebtedness arising from agreements of UOL or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries providing for indemnification, adjustment of
purchase price or similar obligations, in each case, incurred in connection
with the Merger or any other acquisition or disposition of any business,
assets or a Subsidiary of UOL in accordance with the terms of the indenture,
other than Guarantees of Indebtedness incurred by any Person acquiring all or
any portion of such business, assets or Subsidiary for the purpose of
financing such acquisition.

  



  

For purposes of determining compliance with this "Incurrence of Indebtedness
and Issuance of Preferred Stock" covenant, in the event that an item of
Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories
of Permitted Debt described in clauses (1) through (14) above, or is
entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, UOL
will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its
incurrence, or later reclassify all or a portion of such item of
Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this covenant.  The accrual
of interest, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the
payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional
Indebtedness with the same terms, the reclassification of preferred stock as
Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles, and the payment of
dividends on preferred stock or Disqualified Stock in the form of additional
shares of the same class of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock will not be
deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of preferred stock
or Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant; _provided_ , in each
such case, that the amount of any such accrual, accretion or payment
is included in the Consolidated Interest Expense of UOL as accrued.

  



  

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-
denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-
equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency
shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on
the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term debt, or first
committed or first incurred (whichever yields the lower U.S. dollar
equivalent), in the case of revolving credit debt; _provided_ that if such
Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a
foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-
denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency
exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-
denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as
the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the
principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that UOL
or any Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall

  



        
   

  



  

not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange
rates or currency values.

  



  

The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:

  



  

(1) the accreted value of the Indebtedness, in the case of any Indebtedness
issued with original issue discount;

  



  

(2) the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other
Indebtedness; and

  



  

(3) in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the
assets of the specified Person, the lesser of:

  



  

(a) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and

  



  

(b) the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person.

  



  

 ** _Liens_**

  

 ** _ _**

  

UOL will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien of
any kind securing Indebtedness on any asset now owned or hereafter acquired,
except Permitted Liens.

  



  

 ** _Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted
Subsidiaries_**

  

 ** _ _**

  

UOL will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, create or permit to exist or become effective any
consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary to:

  



  

(1) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock to UOL
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, or with respect to any other interest
or participation in, or measured by, its profits, or pay any Indebtedness
owed to UOL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

  



  

(2) make loans or advances to UOL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or

  



  

(3) sell, lease or transfer any of its properties or assets to UOL or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries.

  



  

However, the preceding restrictions will not apply to encumbrances or
restrictions existing under or by reason of:

  



  

(1) agreements governing Existing Indebtedness and any amendments,
restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements
or refinancings of those agreements; _provided_ that the amendments,
restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements
or refinancings are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, with
respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained
in those agreements on the date of the indenture;

  



        
   

  



  

(2) the indenture, the notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral
Documents;

  



  

(3) applicable law, rule, regulation or order;

  



  

(4) any agreement or other instrument governing Indebtedness or Capital Stock
of a Person acquired by UOL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as in
effect at the time of such acquisition (except to the extent such
Indebtedness or Capital Stock was incurred in connection with or in
contemplation of such acquisition), which encumbrance or restriction is not
applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person,
other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired;
_provided_ that, in the case of Indebtedness, such Indebtedness was permitted
to be incurred by the terms of the indenture;

  



  

(5) customary nonassignment provisions in contracts and licenses entered into
in the ordinary course of business;

  



  

(6) Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph of
the covenant entitled "Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred
Stock" that imposes restrictions on the property purchased, leased,
constructed, designed, improved, installed or otherwise financed as described
in clause (3) of the preceding paragraph;

  



  

(7) any agreement for the sale or other disposition of a Restricted
Subsidiary that restricts distributions by that Restricted Subsidiary pending
its sale or other disposition;

  



  

(8) Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness; _provided_ that the restrictions
contained in the agreements governing such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness
are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, than those contained
in the agreements governing the Indebtedness being refinanced;

  



  

(9) Liens permitted to be incurred under the provisions of the covenant
described above under the caption "Liens" that limit the right of the debtor
to dispose of the assets subject to such Liens;

  



  

(10) provisions limiting the disposition or distribution of assets or
property in joint venture agreements, asset sale agreements, sale-leaseback
agreements, stock sale agreements and other similar agreements entered into
with the approval of UOLs Board of Directors, which limitation is applicable
only to the assets that are the subject of such agreements;

  



  

(11) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers
under contracts or imposed by landlords, utilities or other similar entities,
entered into in the ordinary course of business;

  



  

(12) agreements governing Indebtedness incurred by UOL or its Restricted
Subsidiaries in accordance with the indenture (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness);

  



  

(13) agreements governing Subordinated Indebtedness; _provided_ that such
agreements are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, with
respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained
in the indenture;

  



        
   

  



  

(14) any Restricted Investment not prohibited by the covenant described under
"Restricted Payments" and any Permitted Investment; and

  



  

(15) any encumbrances or restrictions of the type referred to in clauses
(1), (2) and (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant by any amendments,
modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings,
replacements or refinancings of the contracts, instruments or obligations
referred to in clauses (1) through (14) of the second paragraph of this
covenant; _provided_ that such amendments, modifications, restatements,
renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings
are, in the good faith judgment of UOL, no more restrictive with respect to
such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in the
dividend or other payment restrictions prior to such amendment, modification,
restatement, renewal, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement or
refinancing.

  



  

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, the subordination
of loans or advances made to UOL or a Restricted Subsidiary of UOL to other
Indebtedness incurred by UOL or any such Restricted Subsidiary of UOL shall
not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make loans or advances.

  



  

 ** _Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets_**

  

 ** _ _**

  

UOL will not, directly or indirectly, consolidate or merge with or into
another Person or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose
of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of UOL and its
Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more
related transactions, to another Person, unless:

  



  

(1) either (a) UOL is the surviving Person or (b) the Person formed by or
surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than UOL) or to which
such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition has
been made is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company
organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state of the
United States or the District of Columbia; _provided_ that in the case where
the surviving Person is not a corporation, a co-obligor of the notes is a
corporation;

  



  

(2) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if
other than UOL) or the Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer,
conveyance or other disposition has been made assumes all the obligations of
UOL under the notes, the indenture and the Collateral Documents pursuant to
agreements reasonably satisfactory to the trustee;

  



  

(3) immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default
exists; and

  



  

(4) UOL or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger
(if other than UOL), or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance
or other disposition has been made would, on the date of such transaction
after giving _pro forma_  effect thereto and any related financing
transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable
four-quarter period, have a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio equal to or
greater than 2.0 to 1.0.

  



        
   

  



  

This "Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets" covenant will not apply to:

  



  

(1) any consolidation or merger, or any sale, assignment, transfer,
conveyance, lease or other disposition of assets between or among UOL and its
Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiaries that are Guarantors; or

  



  

(2) except for clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, a
merger of UOL with an Affiliate solely for the purpose of reincorporating UOL
in another jurisdiction.

  



  

 ** _Transactions with Affiliates_**

  

 ** _ _**

  

UOL will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make
any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its
properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter
into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, loan, advance or
guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of UOL, involving
consideration in excess of $1 million (each, an " _Affiliate Transaction_ "),
unless:

  



  

(1) the Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable to UOL
or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been
obtained in a comparable transaction by UOL or such Restricted Subsidiary
with an unrelated Person; and

  



  

(2) UOL delivers to the trustee:

  



  

(a) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate
Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of $5 million, a
resolution of the Board of Directors of UOL set forth in an Officers
Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with this
covenant and that such Affiliate Transaction has been approved by a majority
of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of UOL; and

  



  

(b) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate
Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of $15 million, an
opinion as to the fairness to UOL or such Restricted Subsidiary of such
Affiliate Transaction from a financial point of view issued by an accounting,
appraisal or investment banking firm of national standing.

  



  

The following items will not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions and,
therefore, will not be subject to the provisions of the prior paragraph:

  



  

(1) any employment agreement, employee benefit plan, officer or director
indemnification agreement or any similar arrangement entered into by UOL or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business and
payments or issuances of Equity Interests pursuant thereto;

  



  

(2) transactions between or among UOL and/or its Restricted Subsidiaries;

  



         
 

  



       

(3)

    |  

transactions with a Person  (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary of UOL)
that is an Affiliate of UOL  solely because UOL owns, directly or through a
Restricted Subsidiary, an  Equity Interest in, or controls, such Person;

    
---|--- 
     



    |  



    
     

(4)

Affiliates of UOL;

    
     



    |  



    
     

(5)

    |

    |  

the payment of reasonable  and customary fees and reimbursement of expenses
paid to, and indemnity  provided on behalf of, officers, directors, employees
or consultants of UOL  or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

    
     



    |  



    
     

(8)

    |  

the Tax Sharing Agreements  or other similar tax sharing agreements of UOL
entered into with any  Subsidiary of UOL on terms no less favorable to UOL in
any material respect,  taken as a whole, than the FTD Tax Sharing Agreement
in effect as of the date  of the indenture and all payments required to be
made under the Tax Sharing  Agreements (and such other similar agreements);

    
     



    |  



    
     

(9)

    |  

transactions in which UOL  or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case
may be, delivers to the  trustee a letter from an independent financial
advisor of national standing  stating that such transaction is fair to UOL or
such Restricted Subsidiary  from a financial point of view or that such
transaction meets the  requirements of clause (1) of the preceding paragraph;

    
     



    |  



    
     

(10)

    |  

any agreement or  transaction to which UOL or a Restricted Subsidiary of UOL
is a party  described in UOLs filings with the SEC under Section 13 or 
15(d) of the Exchange Act as of the date of the indenture, and any  renewals
or replacements thereof or amendments thereto so long as the terms  of such
agreement, together with such renewals, replacements or amendments,  are not
less favorable to UOL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in any  material
respect, taken as a whole, as compared to such agreement as in  effect on the
date of the indenture;

    
     



    |  



    
     

(11)

    |  

the existence of, or the  performance by UOL or any of its Restricted

(12)

    |  

agreements and  transactions with customers, clients, suppliers, purchasers
or sellers of  goods or services of UOL or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries, in each case  (a) in the ordinary course of business and (b) in
compliance with  clause (1) or clause (2)(a) of the first paragraph of this 
covenant, as applicable;

    
     



    |

    |  

any agreement or  transaction between UOL or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries and (a) a  joint venture of either UOL or a Restricted

Intermediate Co. and their  respective Subsidiaries,

    
   



        
   

  



       



    |  

and upon the consummation  of a CMC IPO, CMC or any of its Subsidiaries), in
each case on terms  (i) that are not less favorable to UOL and its Restricted
Subsidiaries,  taken as a whole, in any material respect, as compared to the
terms contained  in the forms of agreements filed as exhibits to the Form S-1
of CMC filed  with the SEC on or prior to the date of the Merger Agreement
(without regard  to dates or durational limitations set forth in such forms
of agreements) or  (ii) that involve the provision of services by UOL or any
of its  Restricted Subsidiaries at or above any out-of-pocket cost of such
agreement  or transaction incurred by UOL or any such Restricted Subsidiary,
as  applicable, including an allocation of any applicable departmental and
other  overhead costs (x) in a manner reasonably consistent with UOLs
segment  reporting practices or (y) as otherwise reasonably determined by
the  Board of Directors of UOL;

(14)

    |  

marketing, advertising and  cross-promotional arrangements (including,
without limitation, arrangements  regarding the promotion and sale of the
products and services of UOL or any  of its Subsidiaries) provided by (a) UOL
and any of its Restricted  Subsidiaries to any Unrestricted Subsidiaries at
or above any out of pocket  cost of such arrangements incurred by UOL or any
such Restricted Subsidiary, as  applicable, including an allocation of any
applicable departmental and other  overhead costs of UOL and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, or (b) any  Unrestricted Subsidiary to UOL or any Restricted

(i) in a manner  reasonably consistent with UOLs segment reporting practices
or (ii) as  otherwise reasonably determined by the Board of Directors of UOL;
and

    
     



    |  



    
     

(15)

    |  

the issuance of Equity  Interests of CMC in accordance with clause 8(b) of
the second paragraph  of the definition of "Asset Sale."

    
   



  

 ** _Additional Note Guarantees_**

  

 ** _ _**

  

If UOL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries acquires or creates another
Domestic Subsidiary after the date of the indenture, then that newly acquired
or created Domestic Subsidiary will become a Guarantor and execute and
deliver to the trustee a supplemental indenture pursuant to which such
Domestic Subsidiary will guarantee payment of the notes. The obligations of
each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to
prevent that Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under
applicable law. Each Note Guarantee shall be released in accordance with the
provisions of the indenture described under "Note Guarantees."

  



  

 ** _Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

  

 ** _ _**

  

CMC and its Subsidiaries shall automatically become Unrestricted
Subsidiaries, without designation, upon consummation of a CMC IPO. Except in
connection with a CMC IPO, CMC, Classmates, and MyPoints shall not be
designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Intermediate Co., Merger Sub, FTD
and their respective Subsidiaries shall constitute Unrestricted Subsidiaries,
without designation, on the date of the indenture.

  



  

The Board of Directors of UOL may designate any other Restricted Subsidiary
to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a
Default.  If a Restricted

  



        
   

  



  

Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair
Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by UOL and its Restricted
Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will
be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will
reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the covenant
described above under the caption "Restricted Payments" or under one or more
clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by UOL (for
the avoidance of doubt, this provision will not apply to CMC or
its Subsidiaries upon a CMC IPO, Intermediate Co., Merger Co., FTD or
their respective Subsidiaries). That designation will only be permitted if
the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted
Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The
Board of Directors of UOL may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a
Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default. UOL
and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall cause their Unrestricted Subsidiaries
to meet the requirements of the definition of "Unrestricted Subsidiary."
 Any designation of a Subsidiary of UOL as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will
be evidenced to the trustee by filing with the trustee a certified copy of a
resolution of the Board of Directors of UOL giving effect to such
designation and an Officers Certificate certifying that such designation
complied with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant
described above under the caption "Restricted Payments." If, at any time,
any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as
an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted
Subsidiary for purposes of the indenture and any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of UOL as
of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as
of such date under the covenant described under the caption "Incurrence
of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock," UOL will be in default of
such covenant (for the avoidance of doubt, this provision will not apply to
CMC and its Subsidiaries upon a CMC IPO, Intermediate Co., Merger Co., FTD
and their respective Subsidiaries). The Board of Directors of UOL may at any
time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary of
UOL; _provided_ that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of
Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of UOL of any outstanding
Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only
be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant
described under the caption "Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Preferred Stock," calculated on a _pro forma_ basis as if such designation
had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; and (2) no
Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation.

  



  

 ** _Taxes_**

  

 ** _ _**

  

UOL shall cause FTD and, following a CMC IPO, CMC, to pay timely to either
(i) the relevant tax authority or (ii) UOL or the relevant Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, all amounts required to be paid under the Tax
Sharing Agreements.

  



  

 ** _Other Covenants_**

  

 ** _ _**

  

The indenture will also contain customary covenants with respect to payment
of notes; maintenance of office or agency; taxes; stay, extension and usury
laws; and corporate existence.

  



        
   

  

 ** **

  

 **Reports**

  

 ** **

  

UOL shall furnish to the trustee, within 15 days after UOL files the same
with the SEC, copies of the annual and quarterly reports and of the
information, documents and other reports that UOL is required to file with
the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, UOL will be deemed to have furnished such reports referred to
above to the trustee if UOL has filed such reports with the SEC via the EDGAR
filing system and such reports are publicly available.  All such reports
will be prepared in all material respects in accordance with all of the rules
and regulations applicable to such reports.

  



  

If, at any time, UOL is no longer subject to the periodic reporting
requirements of the Exchange Act for any reason, UOL will nevertheless
continue filing the reports specified in the preceding paragraphs of this
covenant with the SEC within 15 days after the time periods that would apply
if UOL were required to file those reports with the SEC unless the SEC will
not accept such a filing. UOL will not take any action for the purpose of
causing the SEC not to accept any such filings. If, notwithstanding
the foregoing, the SEC will not accept UOLs filings for any reason, UOL will
post the reports referred to in the preceding paragraphs on its website
within 15 days after the time periods that would apply if UOL were required
to file those reports with the SEC.

  



  

In addition, UOL and the Guarantors agree that, for so long as any notes
remain outstanding, if at any time they are not required to file with the SEC
the reports required by the preceding paragraphs, they will furnish to the
holders of notes and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon
their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule
144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

Sales";

    |  



    
     

(7)

    |  

default under any  mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be
issued or by which  there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for
money borrowed by UOL  or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (or the payment
of which is guaranteed  by UOL or any of its Significant Subsidiaries),
whether such Indebtedness or  Guarantee now exists, or is created after the
date of the indenture, if that  default:

    
     



    |  



    
     



    |  

(a)

    |  

is caused by a failure to  pay principal at final maturity thereof (a "
_Payment  Default_ "); or

    
     



    |  



    |  



    
     



    |  

(b)

    |  

results in the  acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express
maturity,

    
     



    |  



    |  



    
     



    |  



    
     



    |  

and, in each case, the  principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together
with the principal amount  of any other such Indebtedness under which there
has been a Payment Default  or the maturity of which has been so accelerated,
exceeds $10 million or its  foreign currency equivalent;

    
     



    |  



    
     

(8)

    |  

failure by UOL or any of  its Significant Subsidiaries to pay final judgments
entered by a court or  courts of competent jurisdiction aggregating in excess

judgments are not  paid, discharged, waived or stayed for a period of 60
days;

    
     



    |  



    
     

(9)

    |  

any security interest with  respect to Collateral created by the Collateral
Documents shall cease to be  in full force and effect (except as permitted by
the terms of the indenture  or Collateral Documents), or shall cease to give
the collateral trustee, for  the benefit of the holders of the notes, the
security interests, rights,  powers and privileges purported to be created
and granted under the  Collateral Documents (including a perfected first
priority (subject to  Permitted Liens) security interest in all of the
Collateral thereunder (except  as otherwise provided in the indenture or the
Collateral Documents)) in favor  of the collateral trustee, or shall be
asserted by UOL or any of its  Restricted Subsidiaries not to be a valid,
perfected, first priority (except  as otherwise provided in the indenture or
the Collateral Documents and  subject to Permitted Liens) security interest
in the Collateral covered  thereby;

    
     



    |  



    
     

(10)

    |  

except as permitted by the  indenture, any Note Guarantee of a Guarantor that
is a Significant Subsidiary  is held in any judicial proceeding to be
unenforceable or invalid or

    
   



        
   

  



       



    |  

ceases for any reason to  be in full force and effect, or any Guarantor, or
any Person acting on behalf  of any Guarantor, denies or disaffirms its
obligations under its Note  Guarantee; and

    
---|--- 
     



    |  



    
     

(11)

    |  

certain events of  bankruptcy or insolvency described in the indenture with
respect to UOL or  any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant
Subsidiary or any  group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together,
would constitute a  Significant Subsidiary.

    
   



  

In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy
or insolvency, with respect to UOL or, prior to a CMC IPO, CMC, all
outstanding notes will become due and payable immediately without further
action or notice. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the
trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the
then-outstanding notes may declare all the notes to be due and payable
immediately.

  



  

Subject to certain limitations, holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the then-outstanding notes may direct the trustee in its exercise
of any trust or power. The trustee may withhold from holders of the notes
notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that
withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default
relating to the payment of principal, interest or premium, if any.

  



  

Subject to the provisions of the indenture relating to the duties of the
trustee, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the trustee
will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the
indenture at the request or direction of any holders of notes unless such
holders have offered to the trustee reasonable indemnity or security against
any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to
receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest when due, no
holder of a note may pursue any remedy with respect to the indenture or the
notes unless:

  



       

(1)

    |  

such holder has previously  given the trustee notice that an Event of Default
is continuing;

    
---|--- 
     



    |  



    
     

(2)

    |  

holders of at least 25% in  aggregate principal amount of the then-
outstanding notes have requested the  trustee to pursue the remedy;

    
     



    |  



    
     

(3)

    |  

such holders have offered  the trustee reasonable security or indemnity
against any loss, liability or  expense;

    
     



    |  



    
     

(4)

    |  

the trustee has not  complied with such request within 60 days after the
receipt of the  request and the offer of security or indemnity; and

    
     



    |  



    
     

(5)

    |  

holders of a majority in  aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding
notes have not given the  trustee a direction inconsistent with such request
within such 60-day period.

    
   



  

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then-
outstanding notes by notice to the trustee may, on behalf of the holders of
all of the notes, rescind an acceleration or waive any existing Default or
Event of Default and its consequences under the indenture except a continuing
Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest or premium, if any,
on, or the principal of, the notes.

  



        
   

  



  

UOL is required to deliver to the trustee annually a statement regarding
compliance with the indenture. Upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of
Default, UOL is required to deliver to the trustee a statement
specifying such Default or Event of Default.

  



  

 **No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

  

 ** **

  

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of UOL or any
Guarantor, as such, will have any liability for any obligations of UOL or the
Guarantors under the notes, the indenture, the Note Guarantees, the
Collateral Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason
of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder of notes by accepting a
note waives and releases all such liability.  The waiver and release are
part of the consideration for issuance of the notes. The waiver may not be
effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws.

  



  

 **Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

  

 ** **

  

UOL may at any time, at the option of its Board of Directors evidenced by a
resolution set forth in an Officers Certificate, elect to have all of its
obligations discharged with respect to the outstanding notes and all
obligations of the Guarantors discharged with respect to their Note
Guarantees (" _Legal Defeasance_ ") except for:

  



       

(1)

    |  

the rights of holders of  outstanding notes to receive payments in respect of
the principal of, or  interest or premium, if any, on, such notes when such
payments are due from  the trust referred to below;

    
---|--- 
     



    |  



    
     

(2)

    |  

UOLs obligations with  respect to the notes concerning issuing temporary
notes, registration of  notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen notes and
the maintenance of an  office or agency for payment and money for security
payments held in trust;

    
     



    |  



    
     

(3)

    |  

the rights, powers,  trusts, duties and immunities of the trustee, and UOLs
and the Guarantors  obligations in connection therewith; and

    
     



    |  



    
     

(4)

    |  

the Legal Defeasance and  Covenant Defeasance provisions of the indenture.

    
   



  

In addition, UOL may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the
obligations of UOL and the Guarantors released with respect to certain
covenants (including, among others, its obligation to make Change of Control
Offers, Excess Cash Flow Offers, Asset Sale Offers, Debt Repurchase Offers
and Equity Repurchase Offers) that are described in the indenture (" _Covenant
Defeasance_ ") and thereafter any omission to comply with those covenants
will not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to the notes.
In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including
nonpayment, bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events
with respect to UOL) described under "¾Events of Default and Remedies" will
no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the notes. In
addition, certain undertakings and covenants described under "Merger,
Consolidation or Sale of Assets" will not apply. The Liens securing the notes
and the Note Guarantees will be released without any act by or notice to
the holders of the notes upon the occurrence of Legal Defeasance or
Covenant Defeasance.

  



        
   

  



  

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

  



       

(1)

    |  

UOL must irrevocably  deposit with the trustee, in trust, for the benefit of
the holders of the  notes, cash in U.S. dollars, noncallable Government
Securities, or a  combination of cash in U.S. dollars and noncallable
Government Securities, in  amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a
nationally recognized  investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent
public accountants, to  pay the principal of, or interest and premium, if
any, on, the outstanding  notes on the stated date for payment thereof or on
the redemption date  selected by UOL, as the case may be (and UOL must
specify whether the notes  are being defeased to such stated date for payment
or to a particular redemption  date);

    
---|--- 
     



    |  



    
     

(2)

    |  

in the case of Legal  Defeasance, UOL must deliver to the trustee an opinion
of counsel reasonably  acceptable to the trustee confirming that (a) UOL has
received from, or  there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service
a ruling or  (b) since the date of the indenture, there has been a change in
the  applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect
that,  and based thereon such opinion of counsel will confirm that, the
holders of  the outstanding notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for
U.S.  federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and
will be  subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same

such deposit (other  than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the
borrowing of funds to  be applied to such deposit and any similar deposit
relating to other  Indebtedness, and in each case the granting of Liens to
secure such  borrowings);

    
     



    |  



    
     

(5)

    |  

such Legal Defeasance or  Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or
violation of, or  constitute a default under, any material agreement or
instrument (other than  the indenture and other Indebtedness being defeased,
discharged or replaced)  to which UOL or any of its Guarantors is a party or
by which UOL or any of  its Guarantors is bound (other than with respect to
the borrowing of funds to  be applied to make the deposit required to effect
such Legal Defeasance or  Covenant Defeasance and any similar deposit
relating to other Indebtedness,  and in each case the granting of Liens to
secure such borrowings);

(6)

    |  

UOL must deliver to the  trustee an Officers Certificate stating that the
deposit was not made by UOL  with the intent of preferring the holders of
notes over the other creditors  of UOL with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying or defrauding any  creditors of UOL or others; and

    
   



        
   

  



       

(7)

    |  

UOL must deliver to the  trustee an Officers Certificate and an opinion of
counsel, each stating that  all conditions precedent relating to the Legal
Defeasance or the Covenant  Defeasance have been complied with.

 **Satisfaction and Discharge**

  

 ** **

  

The indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to
all notes issued thereunder, when:

  



       

(1)

    |  

either:

    
---|--- 
     



    |  



    |  



    
     



    |  

(a)

    |  

all notes that have been  authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed
notes that have been replaced  or paid and notes for whose payment money has
been deposited in trust and  thereafter repaid to UOL, have been delivered to
the trustee for  cancellation; or

    
     



    |  



    |  



    
     



    |  

(b)

    |  

all notes that have not  been delivered to the trustee for cancellation have
become due and payable by  reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or
otherwise or will become  due and payable within one year and UOL or any
Guarantor has irrevocably  deposited or caused to be deposited with the
trustee as trust funds in trust  solely for the benefit of the holders, cash
in U.S. dollars, noncallable  Government Securities, or a combination of cash
in U.S. dollars and  noncallable Government Securities, in amounts as will be
sufficient, without  consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay
and discharge the  entire Indebtedness on the notes not delivered to the
trustee for cancellation  for principal, premium, if any, and accrued
interest to the date of maturity  or redemption;

    
     



    |  



    
     

(2)

    |  

in respect of clause 1(b),  no Default or Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing on the date of  the deposit (other than a Default or Event of
Default resulting from the  borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit
and any similar deposit  relating to other Indebtedness, and in each case the
granting of Liens to  secure such borrowings) and the deposit will not result
in a breach or violation  of, or constitute a default under, any other
instrument to which UOL or any  Guarantor is a party or by which UOL or any
Guarantor is bound (other than  with respect to the borrowing of funds to be
applied to make the deposit  required to effect such satisfaction and
discharge and any similar deposit  relating to other Indebtedness, and in
each case the granting of Liens to  secure such borrowings);

    
     



    |  



    
     

(3)

    |  

UOL or any Guarantor has  paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it
under the indenture; and

    
     



    |  



    
     

(4)

    |  

UOL has delivered  irrevocable instructions to the trustee under the
indenture to apply the  deposited money toward the payment of the notes at
maturity or on the  redemption date, as the case may be.

    
   



  

In addition, UOL must deliver an Officers Certificate and an opinion of
counsel to the trustee stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction
and discharge have been

  



        
   

  



  

satisfied.  The Liens securing the notes and the Note Guarantees will be
released without any act by or notice to the holders of the notes upon
the consummation of satisfaction and discharge as described above.

  



  

 **Concerning the Trustee**

  

 ** **

  

If the trustee becomes a creditor of UOL or any Guarantor, the indenture will
limit the right of the trustee to obtain payment of claims in certain cases,
or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as
security or otherwise. The trustee will be permitted to engage in other
transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it
must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the SEC for permission
to continue as trustee (if the indenture has been qualified under the
Trust Indenture Act) or resign.

  



  

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then-
outstanding notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of
conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the trustee,
subject to certain exceptions. The indenture provides that in case an
Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the trustee will be required, in
the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent man in
the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the trustee will
be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the
indenture at the request of any holder of notes, unless such holder has
offered to the trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any
loss, liability or expense.

operations, as determined in accordance with GAAP, and operations or
businesses (and ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the

Interest Expense will not be obligations of the specified Person or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries following the Consolidated Interest Coverage
Ratio Calculation Date;

Interest Coverage Ratio Calculation Date will be deemed not to have been a
Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such four-quarter period; and

  



  

(6) if _pro forma_  effect is to be given to any Indebtedness that bears a
floating rate of interest, the interest expense on such Indebtedness will be
calculated as if the rate in effect on the Consolidated Interest Coverage
Ratio Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period

if such Hedging Obligation has a remaining term as at the Consolidated
Interest Coverage Ratio Calculation Date in excess of 12 months).
