proper surrender of the Certificated SuperMedia Shares to the Exchange Agent
and which shall otherwise be in customary form and shall include customary

transfer of Uncertificated SuperMedia Shares for use in such exchange. Each
holder of record of SuperMedia Common Stock whose shares have been converted
into the right to receive the SuperMedia Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.2_ shall be entitled to 

 



8  receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of one or more
Certificated SuperMedia Shares, together with a properly completed letter of
transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent
(or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated
SuperMedia Shares, (x) shares (including fractions of a share) of Newco

payable pursuant to _Section 2.8(h)(i)_, and the Certificated SuperMedia

of Newco Common Stock constituting such SuperMedia Merger Consideration shall
be in uncertificated book-entry form. No interest will be paid or accrued on
any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of
Certificated SuperMedia Shares or Uncertificated SuperMedia Shares. Until so

SuperMedia Share or Uncertificated SuperMedia Share shall represent after the
SuperMedia Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the
SuperMedia Merger Consideration and the right to receive any dividends or
other distributions pursuant to _Section 2.8(h)_.

(c) _Exchange Procedures for Dex Common Stock_. At the Dex Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent shall exchange by book entry transfer all uncertificated shares
of Dex Common Stock (excluding any shares of Dex Common Stock to be cancelled

(d) _Issuance or Payment to Persons Other Than the Registered Holder_. If any
portion of the SuperMedia Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificated SuperMedia
Share or the transferred Uncertificated SuperMedia Share is registered, it
shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificated
SuperMedia Share shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper
form for transfer or such Uncertificated SuperMedia Share shall be properly
transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificated
SuperMedia Share or Uncertificated SuperMedia Share or establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " means any
individual, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, association,
joint venture, trust, unincorporated organization, other entity or group (as
defined in the Exchange Act), including any Governmental Entity.

(e) _No Further Rights in Dex Common Stock or SuperMedia Common Stock_. All
Dex Merger Consideration and SuperMedia Merger Consideration paid in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such surrendered or transferred
shares of Dex Common Stock or SuperMedia Common Stock, as applicable. From and
after the Closing Date, the holders of Certificated SuperMedia
Shares Uncertificated SuperMedia Shares and Uncertificated Dex Shares
(together with the Uncertificated SuperMedia Shares, the " _Uncertificated
Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of
SuperMedia Common Stock or Dex Common Stock, as applicable, except as
otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law.

 



9 (f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund deposited
with or otherwise made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section
2.8(a)_ that remains unclaimed by the holders of SuperMedia Common Stock
twelve (12) months after the SuperMedia Effective Time shall be returned to

look only to Dex Surviving Company for, and Dex Surviving Company shall
remain liable for, payment of the SuperMedia Merger Consideration, and any
dividends and distributions with respect thereto pursuant to _Section
2.8(h)_, in respect of such shares without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Dex Surviving Company shall not be liable to
any holder of SuperMedia Common Stock for any amounts properly paid to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of SuperMedia Common Stock
five (5) years after the SuperMedia Effective Time (or such earlier date,
immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity) shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of Dex Surviving Company, free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificated SuperMedia Share shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificated SuperMedia Share to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Dex Surviving Company or Newco, the posting by
such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as
Dex Surviving Company or Newco may direct, as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificated SuperMedia Share and the payment of any ordinary and customary
processing fees, the Exchange Agent will cause to be paid, in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificated SuperMedia Share, the SuperMedia
Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect thereto
pursuant to _Section 2.8(h)_, in accordance with this _Section 2.8(g)_.

(h) _Dividends and Distributions_. No dividends or other distributions with
respect to securities of Newco constituting part of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration shall be paid to the holder of any Certificated SuperMedia
Shares not surrendered or of any Uncertificated Shares not transferred until
such Certificated SuperMedia Shares or Uncertificated Shares are surrendered
or transferred, as the case may be, as provided in _Section 2.8(b)_.
Following such surrender or transfer, there shall be paid, without interest,
to the Person in whose name the securities of Newco have been registered, (i)
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
SuperMedia Effective Time theretofore paid, without any interest thereon, with
respect to the shares of Newco Common Stock represented by such Certificated
SuperMedia Shares or Uncertificated Shares and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the SuperMedia Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date
subsequent to surrender, with respect to shares of Newco Common Stock
represented by such Certificated SuperMedia Shares or Uncertificated Shares.

 



10 (i) _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the
contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, SuperMedia Surviving Company and Dex
Surviving Company shall be entitled to deduct or withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this _Section
2.8(i)_ such amounts as it is required to deduct or withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or
foreign tax law. SuperMedia Surviving Company shall, and shall cause its
respective Affiliates to, assist Dex Surviving Company and/or Newco in making
such deductions and withholding as reasonably requested by Dex Surviving
Company and/or Newco. If the Exchange Agent, SuperMedia Surviving Company or
Dex Surviving Company, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of the shares of SuperMedia Common Stock or Dex Common Stock in
respect of which the Exchange Agent, SuperMedia Surviving Company or Dex
Surviving Company, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or
warranties contained in this  _Article III_, or to one or more of
SuperMedias covenants contained herein; _provided_ that, notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the mere inclusion of an item in

warrants to Dex and Merger Subs as follows:

 

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

(a) SuperMedia is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware. SuperMedia has the corporate

qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,

and qualified is not reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on SuperMedia.

 



11 (b) True and complete copies of the restated certificate of incorporation of
SuperMedia (the " _SuperMedia Charter_ ") and the amended and restated bylaws

qualified and (iii) has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority
to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now
conducted, except in each of (i)  (iii) as would not be reasonably likely to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
SuperMedia.

Merger Sub, Dex Surviving Company or SuperMedia Surviving Company, as the
case may be, a material adverse effect on (A) the business, assets,
properties, results of operations or financial condition of such Party and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole ( _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to

(d) With respect to each SuperMedia Plan, SuperMedia and the SuperMedia
Subsidiaries have complied, and are now in compliance, with all provisions of
ERISA, the Code and all Laws applicable to such SuperMedia Plans, except for
instances that would not have a Material Adverse Effect on SuperMedia. Each
SuperMedia Plan has been administered in all respects in accordance with its
terms, except for instances that would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
SuperMedia. There is not now nor, to the Knowledge of SuperMedia, do any
circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected to give rise to, any
requirement for the posting of security with respect to a SuperMedia Plan or
the imposition of any lien on the assets of SuperMedia or any SuperMedia
Subsidiary under ERISA or the Code. _Section 3.11(d)_ of the SuperMedia
Disclosure Schedule identifies each SuperMedia Plan that is intended to be a
"qualified plan" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code ("
_SuperMedia Qualified Plans_ "). Each SuperMedia Qualified Plan (A)(i) has
received a favorable determination letter from the IRS with respect to such
qualification or (ii) is a prototype plan that is the subject of a favorable
opinion letter from the IRS on which SuperMedia is entitled to rely, and (B)
unless clause (A)(ii) applies, has been submitted to the IRS for a
determination letter within the applicable remedial amendment period under
Section 401(b) of the Code or has a remedial amendment period that has not yet
expired, and to the Knowledge of SuperMedia, there are no existing
circumstances and no events have occurred that would reasonably be expected
to adversely affect the qualified status of any SuperMedia Qualified Plan or
the tax-exempt status of its related trust. _Section 3.11(d)_ of the
SuperMedia Disclosure Schedule identifies each trust funding any SuperMedia
Plan which is intended to meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the
Code, and each such trust meets such requirements and provides no disqualified
benefits (as such term is defined in Code Section 4976(b)). None of
SuperMedia and the SuperMedia Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of
SuperMedia, any other Person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in any
"prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section
406 of ERISA), which would reasonably be expected to subject any of the
SuperMedia Plans or their related trusts, SuperMedia, any SuperMedia
Subsidiary or, to the Knowledge of SuperMedia, any Person that SuperMedia or
any SuperMedia Subsidiary has an obligation to indemnify, to any material Tax
or penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

(e) With respect to each SuperMedia Plan that is subject to Title IV or
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code, (i) SuperMedia and
each ERISA Affiliate have satisfied all minimum funding obligations under
Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, and no waiver or variance of
such obligations has been requested; (ii) no reportable event within the
meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the 30-day notice requirement
has not been waived has occurred; (iii) all premiums to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (the " _PBGC_ ") have been timely paid in full; (iv) no
liability (other than for premiums to the PBGC) under Title IV of ERISA has
been or would reasonably be expected to be incurred by SuperMedia or any
SuperMedia Subsidiary or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates; (v) the
PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any such SuperMedia Plan
and, to the Knowledge of SuperMedia, no condition exists which would
reasonably be expected

 



22  to constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or
the appointment of a trustee to administer, any such SuperMedia Plan; and (vi)
there has been no determination that a SuperMedia Plan is or is expected to
be in "at risk" status within the meaning of Section 303(i) of ERISA or
Section 430(i) of the Code.

 

(f) (i) No SuperMedia Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a plan that has
two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common
control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a " _Multiple Employer
Plan_ "); (ii) none of SuperMedia and the SuperMedia Subsidiaries nor any of
their respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years,
contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or
Multiple Employer Plan; and (iii) none of SuperMedia and the SuperMedia
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred any
Withdrawal Liability that has not been satisfied in full. There does not now
exist, nor, to the Knowledge of SuperMedia, do any circumstances exist that
would reasonably be expected to result in, any Controlled Group
Liability that would be a liability of SuperMedia or any SuperMedia
Subsidiary following the SuperMedia Effective Time. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, none of SuperMedia, any SuperMedia Subsidiary, or
any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has engaged in any transaction
described in Section 4069 or Section 4204 or 4212 of ERISA.

(g) SuperMedia and the SuperMedia Subsidiaries have no liability for life,
health, medical or other welfare benefits to former employees or beneficiaries
or dependents thereof, except for health continuation coverage as required by
Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA and at no expense to
SuperMedia and the SuperMedia Subsidiaries or as otherwise set forth on
_Section 3.11(g)_ of the SuperMedia Disclosure Schedule.

 

(h) Neither the execution nor the delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will, either
alone or in conjunction with any other event (whether contingent or
otherwise), (i) result in any payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or
required to be provided, to any director, employee or independent contractor
of SuperMedia or any SuperMedia Subsidiary, (ii) increase the amount or value
of any benefit or compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to
any such director, employee or independent contractor, (iii) result in
the acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any such
benefit or compensation or (iv) result in any amount failing to be deductible
by reason of Section 280G of the Code.

 

(i) Each SuperMedia Benefit Plan and each SuperMedia Employment Agreement that
is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section
409A of the Code and any award thereunder, in each case that is subject to
Section 409A of the Code, has been established and maintained in all material
respects in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Neither SuperMedia nor any SuperMedia
Subsidiary has any obligation to provide any "gross up" or similar payment to
any Person in the event that such SuperMedia Benefit Plan or SuperMedia
Employment Agreement fails to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

 



23 3.12 _Compliance with Law; Permits_. (a) SuperMedia and each SuperMedia
Subsidiary is, and at all times since the later of January 1, 2010 or its
respective date of formation or organization has been, in compliance with all
applicable federal, state, local or foreign or provincial laws, statutes,
ordinances, rules, regulations, requirements or Orders of or with any
Governmental Entity, including common law (collectively, " _Laws_ " and each,
a " _Law_ ") and is not in default under or in violation of any applicable
Laws, except where such noncompliance, default or violation would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on SuperMedia.

(b) SuperMedia and the SuperMedia Subsidiaries are in possession of all
franchises, tariffs, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements,
variances, exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any
Governmental Entity (collectively, " _Permits_ ") necessary for SuperMedia and
the SuperMedia Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their properties and
assets or to carry on their businesses as they are now being conducted (the "
_SuperMedia Permits_ ") and no suspension or cancellation of any of the
SuperMedia Permits is pending or, to the Knowledge of SuperMedia, threatened,
except where the failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation of, any
of the SuperMedia Permits would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on SuperMedia. All
SuperMedia Permits are in full force and effect, except where such failure to
be in full force and effect would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on SuperMedia. SuperMedia
and the SuperMedia Subsidiaries are not, and since January 1, 2010 have not
been, in violation or breach of, or default under, any SuperMedia Permit,
except where such violation, breach or default would not, individually or in
the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
SuperMedia.

 

(c) This _Section 3.12_ does not relate to matters with respect to Taxes and
Tax Returns (which are the subject of  _Section 3.10_), Employee Benefits
(which are the subject of _Section 3.11_) or Environmental Liabilities (which
are the subject of _Section 3.15_).

_SuperMedia Material Contracts_ ").

 

(b) With such exceptions that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on SuperMedia:



     | (i) | Each SuperMedia Material Contract is valid and binding on
SuperMedia (or, to the extent a Subsidiary of SuperMedia is a party, such
Subsidiary) and, to the Knowledge of SuperMedia, any other party thereto, and
is in full force and effect and enforceable against SuperMedia or a SuperMedia
Subsidiary, as applicable (except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the rights of creditors
generally and the availability of equitable remedies); and 
---|---|---

such Person evidenced by bonds, debentures, notes and similar agreements,
(iii) all leases of such Person capitalized pursuant to GAAP, and (iv)
all obligations of such Person under sale-and-lease back transactions,
agreements to repurchase securities sold and other similar financing
transactions.

3.14 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither SuperMedia nor any SuperMedia
Subsidiary has incurred any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due),
except for (i) liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the
consolidated balance sheet of SuperMedia included in SuperMedias Annual
Report on Form 10-K filed for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 (the "
_SuperMedia 2011 10-K_ ") (including any notes thereto), (ii) liabilities
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (iii) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since December 31, 2011 that have not had and

Material Adverse Effect on SuperMedia.

 

3.15 _Environmental Liability_. Except for matters that, individually or in
the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
SuperMedia, (i) there are no legal, administrative, arbitral or other
proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action,

 



25  private environmental investigations or remediation activities or
governmental investigations of any nature seeking to impose, or that are
reasonably likely to result in the imposition, on SuperMedia of any liability
or obligation under Environmental Laws, or pending or, to the Knowledge of
SuperMedia, threatened against SuperMedia; (ii) SuperMedia is not subject to
any Order or party to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or

liabilities under Environmental Laws. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Environmental Laws_ " means any common law or local, state, federal or
foreign statute, regulation, ordinance or similar provision having the force

3.16 _Real Property_.

(a) Each of SuperMedia and the SuperMedia Subsidiaries has good title free and
clear of all Liens to all real property owned by such entities (the "

detract from the present use of such real property.

(b) A true and complete copy of each agreement pursuant to which SuperMedia
or any SuperMedia Subsidiary leases any material real property (such
agreements, together with any amendments, modifications and other supplements

against SuperMedia or an applicable SuperMedia Subsidiary in accordance with
its terms and is in full force and effect (except as may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting
the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies),
except where the failure to be valid, binding, enforceable and in full force
and effect, individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have
a Material Adverse Effect on SuperMedia. There are no defaults by SuperMedia
or any SuperMedia Subsidiary, as applicable, under any of the SuperMedia
Leases which, individually or in the aggregate, would have a Material Adverse
Effect on SuperMedia. To the Knowledge of SuperMedia, no event has occurred
that with or without notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a breach
or default thereunder by any party thereto or would permit the termination,
modification or acceleration of rent thereunder, except, in each case, for
such breaches, defaults, terminations, modifications or accelerations that can
not, individually or in aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on SuperMedia.

(c) The SuperMedia Owned Properties and the properties leased pursuant to the
SuperMedia Leases (the " _SuperMedia Leased Properties_ ") constitute all of
the real estate on which SuperMedia and the SuperMedia Subsidiaries maintain
their facilities or conduct their business as of the date of this Agreement,
except for locations the loss of which would not result in a Material Adverse
Effect on SuperMedia.

 



26 3.17 _State Takeover Laws; Rights Agreement_. SuperMedia has, or will have
prior to the SuperMedia Effective Time, taken all necessary action so that,
assuming compliance by Dex and Merger Sub with their respective obligations
hereunder and the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by Dex
and Merger Subs herein, no "business combination," "moratorium," "fair
price," "control share acquisition" or other state anti-takeover statute or
regulation, nor any takeover-related provision in the SuperMedia Charter or
the SuperMedia Bylaws, would (i) prohibit or restrict SuperMedias ability to
perform its obligations under this Agreement, any related agreement, or the
SuperMedia Certificate of Merger or its ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (ii) have the effect of
invalidating or voiding this Agreement, or the SuperMedia Certificate of
Merger, or any provision hereof or thereof, or (iii) subject Dex, Newco or
Merger Sub to any impediment or condition in connection with the exercise of
any of its rights under this Agreement or the Certificates of Merger.
SuperMedia does not have any stockholder rights plan in effect.

controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting (as
such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule

Act. SuperMedias disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in SuperMedias periodic reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the required time periods. SuperMedia and its Subsidiaries
have implemented and maintain a system of internal controls over financial
reporting that is sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
in accordance with GAAP. SuperMedia is in compliance in all material respects
with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of NASDAQ. Since
December 31, 2011 through the date hereof, SuperMedia has not identified (i)
any significant deficiency or material weakness in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting which is reasonably likely to
adversely affect SuperMedias ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information or (ii) any fraud or allegation of fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in SuperMedias internal control over financial reporting.

 

3.20 _Insurance_. SuperMedia and the SuperMedia Subsidiaries are insured with
reputable insurers against such risks and in such amounts as its management
reasonably has determined to be prudent in accordance with industry practices.
To the Knowledge of SuperMedia, neither SuperMedia nor any SuperMedia
Subsidiary is in material breach or 

 



27  material default of any insurance policies maintained by SuperMedia or any
SuperMedia Subsidiary or has taken any action or failed to take any action
that, with notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such a breach or
default or permit termination (prior to the scheduled termination or
expiration thereof) or modification of any such insurance policies. To the
Knowledge of SuperMedia, neither SuperMedia nor any SuperMedia Subsidiary
has received any notice of termination or cancellation (prior to the
scheduled termination or expiration thereof) or denial of coverage with
respect to any such insurance policy.

declared effective, the time the Joint Proxy Statement is first mailed to
stockholders of SuperMedia and Dex and the time of the SuperMedia Stockholders
Meeting and the Dex Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the

with any other Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not
misleading. All documents that SuperMedia is responsible for filing with the
SEC in connection with the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Joint Proxy Statement) (except for such portions thereof
that relate only to Dex, Merger Subs or any of their Subsidiaries) will comply
as to form and substance in all material respects with the provisions of the

any SuperMedia Subsidiary of any other Persons Intellectual Property that,

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on SuperMedia, SuperMedia and each
SuperMedia Subsidiary (i) is and has been in compliance with all applicable
Laws regarding employment and employment practices, including without
limitation those Laws relating to terms and conditions of employment, wages
and hours, collective bargaining, equal employment, occupational safety and
health and workers compensation, and (ii) has no charges or complaints

with respect to Dex or Newco within the meaning of Section 203 of the DGCL.

(a) Except for the representations and warranties made by SuperMedia in this

32 ARTICLE IV

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF DEX AND MERGER SUBS

Except (i) as disclosed in, and reasonably apparent from, any Dex Report
filed with, or furnished to, the SEC by Dex and publicly available prior to
the date of this Agreement (excluding, in each case, any disclosures set forth
in any risk factor section and in any section relating to forward-looking
statements to the extent that they are cautionary, predictive or forward-
looking in nature), or (ii) as disclosed in a correspondingly numbered section
of the disclosure schedule (the " _Dex Disclosure Schedule_ ") delivered by
Dex and Merger Subs to SuperMedia prior to the execution of this Agreement
(which schedule sets forth, among other things, items the disclosure of which
is necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure
requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more
representations or warranties contained in this _Article IV_, or to one or
more of Dexs, Newcos or Merger Subs covenants contained herein; _provided_
that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the mere
inclusion of an item in such schedule shall not be deemed an admission that
such item is required to be disclosed therein or represents a material
exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or
is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Dex, Newco or Merger
Sub; _provided_ , _further_ , that the disclosure of any item in any section
of the Dex Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosed with respect to any
other section of the Dex Disclosure Schedule to which such item is relevant,
whether or not a specific cross reference appears, so long as the relevance
is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure), Dex and Merger
Subs, jointly and severally, hereby represent and warrant to SuperMedia as
follows:

4.1 _Corporate Organization_.

(a) Dex is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware. Dex has the corporate power
and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified
to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets
owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except
where the failure to have such power and authority or to be so licensed and
qualified is not reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Dex.

 

(b) True and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation (the " _Dex
Charter_ ") and bylaws (the " _Dex Bylaws_ ") of Dex, as in effect as of the
date of this Agreement, have previously been made available to SuperMedia.

 

(c) Each Dex Subsidiary (including Newco and Merger Sub) (i) is duly organized
and validly existing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii)
is duly qualified to do business and in good standing (where such concept is
recognized) in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign)
where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its business
requires it to be so qualified, and (iii) has all requisite corporate or
similar power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as now conducted, except in each of (i)  (iii) as
would not be reasonably likely to have, either

 



33  individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Dex. Each of
Newco and Merger Sub (x) was formed solely for the purposes of engaging in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (y) since its date of formation,
has not engaged in any activities or conducted its operation other than in
connection with or as contemplated by this Agreement, and (z) is and will

affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable
remedies).

 



35 (b) Each of Newco and Merger Sub has full corporate power and authority to

respective properties or assets of Dex or any Dex Subsidiary under, any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract to which Dex or any Dex
Subsidiary is a party, or by which they or any of their respective properties
or assets may be bound or affected, except for such violations, conflicts,
breaches or defaults with respect to clause (ii) that are not
reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Dex.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent

respect to the assessment or collection of any Taxes (other than pursuant to
extensions of time to file Tax Returns obtained in the ordinary course of
business).

appropriate Governmental Entity all Taxes required to have been withheld and

meaning of Section 280G of the Code in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) any amount that will not be fully
deductible as a result of Section 162(m) of the Code. There is no Contract to

Subsidiary is bound to compensate any employee, independent contractor or
director of Dex or any Dex Subsidiary for excise taxes paid pursuant to

4.11 _Employee Benefits_. For purposes hereof, the following terms shall have
the following meaning:

" _Dex Benefit Plan_ " means any employee benefit plan, program, policy,
practice, or other arrangement (other than any Dex Employment Agreement)
providing benefits to any current or former employee, officer or director of
Dex or any Dex Subsidiary or any beneficiary or dependent thereof that is
sponsored or maintained by Dex or any Dex Subsidiary or to which Dex or any
Dex Subsidiary contributes or is obligated to contribute, or otherwise with
respect to which Dex or any Dex Subsidiary has any liability or obligation, in
each case whether or not written, including any employee welfare benefit plan
within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, any employee pension benefit
plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (whether or not such plan is
subject to ERISA) and any bonus, incentive, deferred compensation, vacation,
stock purchase, stock option, severance, change of control or fringe
benefit plan, program or policy.

" _Dex Employment Agreement_ " means a contract, offer letter or agreement of
Dex or any Dex Subsidiary with or addressed to any individual who is
rendering or has rendered services thereto as an employee or consultant
pursuant to which Dex or any Dex Subsidiary has any actual or contingent
liability or obligation to provide compensation and/or benefits in
consideration for past, present or future services.

" _Dex Plan_ " means (i) each Dex Benefit Plan that is not a Multiemployer
Plan and (ii) each Dex Employment Agreement.

(a)  _Section 4.11(a)_ of the Dex Disclosure Schedule includes a true and
complete list of all material Dex Benefit Plans and all material Dex
Employment Agreements.

(b) With respect to each Dex Plan, Dex has delivered or made available to
SuperMedia a true, correct and complete copy of (as applicable): (i) each
writing constituting a part of such Dex Plan, including the plan document
currently in effect, material employee communications, benefit schedules,
trust agreements, and insurance contracts and other funding vehicles; (ii) the
most recent Annual Report (Form 5500 Series) and accompanying schedules;
(iii) the current summary plan description and any material modifications
thereto, if any (in each case, whether or not required to be furnished under
ERISA); (iv) the most recent annual financial report, if any; (v) the most
recent actuarial report, if any; (vi) any notices to or from the Internal

 



41  Revenue Service or any office or representative of the Department of Labor
or any similar Governmental Entity relating to any material compliance issues
in respect of any such Dex Plan; and (vii) the most recent determination
letter from the IRS, if any. Dex has delivered or made available to SuperMedia
a true, correct and complete copy of each material Dex Employment Agreement.

 

(c) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in material liability
to SuperMedia or Dex, all contributions required to be made to any Dex Plan
by applicable law or regulation or by any plan document or other contractual
undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance
policies funding any Dex Plan, for any period through the date hereof have
been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required to be made or
paid on or before the date hereof, have been reflected on the financial

(d) With respect to each Dex Plan, Dex and the Dex Subsidiaries have complied,
and are now in compliance, with all provisions of ERISA, the Code and all
Laws applicable to such Dex Plans, except for instances that would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on Dex. Each Dex Plan has been administered in all
respects in accordance with its terms, except for instances that would not
have a Material Adverse Effect on Dex. There is not now nor, to the Knowledge
of Dex, do any circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected to give
rise to, any requirement for the posting of security with respect to a Dex
Plan or the imposition of any lien on the assets of Dex or any Dex Subsidiary
under ERISA or the Code. _Section 4.11(d)_ of the Dex Disclosure Schedule
identifies each Dex Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan" within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (" _Dex Qualified Plans_ "). Each Dex
Qualified Plan (A)(i) has received a favorable determination letter from the
IRS with respect to such qualification or (ii) is a prototype plan that is
the subject of a favorable opinion letter from the IRS on which Dex is
entitled to rely, and (B) unless clause (A)(ii) applies, has been submitted to
the IRS for a determination letter within the applicable remedial amendment
period under Section 401(b) of the Code or has a remedial amendment period
that has not yet expired, and, to the Knowledge of Dex, there are no existing
circumstances and no events have occurred that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the qualified status of any Dex Qualified Plan or the tax-
exempt status of its related trust. _Section 4.11(d)_ of the Dex Disclosure
Schedule identifies each trust funding any Dex Plan which is intended to meet
the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, and each such trust meets
such requirements and provides no disqualified benefits (as such term is
defined in Code Section 4976(b)). None of Dex and the Dex Subsidiaries nor, to
the Knowledge of Dex, any other Person, including any fiduciary, has engaged
in any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 406 of ERISA), which would reasonably be expected to subject any of
the Dex Plans or their related trusts, Dex, any Dex Subsidiary or, to the
Knowledge of Dex, any Person that Dex or any Dex Subsidiary has an obligation
to indemnify, to any material Tax or penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the
Code or Section 502 of ERISA. 

(e) With respect to each Dex Plan that is subject to Title IV or Section 302
of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code, (i) Dex and each ERISA Affiliate
have satisfied all minimum funding obligations under Section 412 of the Code
or Section 302 of ERISA, and no

 



42  waiver or variance of such obligations has been requested; (ii) no
reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the
30-day notice requirement has not been waived has occurred; (iii) all
premiums to the PBGC have been timely paid in full; (iv) no liability (other
than for premiums to the PBGC) under Title IV of ERISA has been or would
reasonably be expected to be incurred by Dex or any Dex Subsidiary or any of
their respective ERISA Affiliates; (v) the PBGC has not instituted proceedings
to terminate any such Dex Plan and, to the Knowledge of Dex, no condition
exists which would reasonably be expected to constitute grounds under Section
4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to
administer, any such Dex Plan; and (vi) there has been no determination that a
Dex Plan is or is expected to be in "at risk" status within the meaning of
Section 303(i) of ERISA or Section 430(i) of the Code.

(f) (i) No Dex Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a Multiple Employer
Plan; (ii) none of Dex and the Dex Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years, contributed to or
been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer
Plan; and (iii) none of Dex and the Dex Subsidiaries nor any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred any Withdrawal Liability that has not
been satisfied in full. There does not now exist, nor, to the Knowledge of
Dex, do any circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected to result
in, any Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of Dex or any Dex
Subsidiary following the Dex Effective Time. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, none of Dex, any Dex Subsidiary or any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates has engaged in any transaction described in Section 4069 or
Section 4204 or 4212 of ERISA.

 

(g) Dex and the Dex Subsidiaries have no liability for life, health, medical
or other welfare benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or dependents
thereof, except for health continuation coverage as required by Section 4980B
of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA and at no expense to Dex and the Dex
Subsidiaries or as otherwise set forth on  _Section 4.11(g)_ of the Dex
Disclosure Schedule.

(h) Neither the execution nor the delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will, either
alone or in conjunction with any other event (whether contingent or
otherwise), (i) result in any payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or
required to be provided, to any director, employee or independent contractor
of Dex or any Dex Subsidiary, (ii) increase the amount or value of any benefit
or compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to any such
director, employee or independent contractor, (iii) result in the
acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any such benefit or
compensation or (iv) result in any amount failing to be deductible by reason
of Section 280G of the Code. 

(i) Each Dex Benefit Plan and each Dex Employment Agreement that is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A
of the Code and any award thereunder, in each case that is subject to Section
409A of the Code, has been established and maintained in all material respects
in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder. Neither Dex nor any Dex Subsidiary has any
obligation to provide any "gross up" or similar payment to any Person in the
event that such Dex Benefit Plan or Dex Employment Agreement fails to comply
with Section 409A of the Code.

 



43 4.12 _Compliance with Law; Permits_.

 

(a) Dex and each Dex Subsidiary is, and at all times since the later of
January 30, 2010 or its respective date of formation or organization has
been, in compliance with all applicable Laws and is not in default under or in
violation of any applicable Laws, except where such noncompliance, default, or
violation would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Dex.

(b) Dex and the Dex Subsidiaries are in possession of all Permits
necessary for Dex and the Dex Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their
properties and assets or to carry on their businesses as they are now being
conducted (the " _Dex Permits_ ") and no suspension or cancellation of any of
the Dex Permits is pending or, to the Knowledge of Dex, threatened, except
where the failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation of, any of the
Dex Permits would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Dex. All Dex Permits are in
full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and effect
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Dex. Dex and the Dex Subsidiaries are not, and
since January 30, 2010 have not been, in violation or breach of, or default
under, any Dex Permit, except where such violation, breach or default would
not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Dex.

(c) This _Section 4.12_ does not relate to matters with respect to Taxes and
Tax Returns (which are the subject of _Section 4.10_), Employee Benefits
(which are the subject of _Section 4.11_) or Environmental Liabilities (which
are the subject of _Section 4.15_).

 

4.13 _Certain Contracts_. (a) Except as set forth in the exhibit index to the
Dex 2011 10-K or as set forth on  _Section 4.13_ of the Dex Disclosure

Contract relating to the incurrence or guarantee of Indebtedness by Dex or any
Dex Subsidiary in an amount in excess in the aggregate of $10,000,000

and the Dex Subsidiaries, including, following consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, SuperMedia and the SuperMedia
Subsidiaries, is or would be conducted, (iv) any Contract providing for any
payments to an officer, director or Affiliate of Dex or, in excess of
$1,000,000, to any other Person that are conditioned, in whole or in part, on
a change of control of Dex or any Dex Subsidiary, (v) any
collective bargaining agreement or other agreement or arrangement with any
labor organization, (vi) any joint venture or partnership agreement related to
the formation, creation, operation or management or any joint venture or

favored nation" or other term providing preferential pricing or treatment to a
third party, and (ix) any Contract not made in the ordinary course of

consummation of the Mergers or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (collectively, the " _Dex Material Contracts_ ").

(b) With such exceptions that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Dex:



     | (i) | Each Dex Material Contract is valid and binding on Dex (or,
to the extent a Subsidiary of Dex is a party, such Subsidiary) and, to the
Knowledge of Dex, any other party thereto, and is in full force and effect
and enforceable against Dex or a Dex Subsidiary, as applicable (except as may
be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar
Laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability of
equitable remedies); and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | Neither Dex nor any Dex Subsidiary is, and, to the
Knowledge of Dex, no other party is, in breach or default under any Dex
Material Contract.

contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due), except for (i)
liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance
sheet of Dex included in Dexs Annual Report on Form 10-K filed for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 (the " _Dex 2011 10-K_ ") (including any
notes thereto), (ii) liabilities incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) liabilities incurred in

Agreement, neither Newco nor Merger Sub has any liabilities other than the
obligations incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

4.15 _Environmental Liability_. Except for matters that, individually or in
the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Dex, (i) there are no legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings,
claims, actions, causes of action, private environmental investigations or

any Order or party to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or

or waste in a manner reasonably anticipated to give rise to any current or
future liabilities under Environmental Laws.

4.16 _Real Property_.

(a) Each of Dex and the Dex Subsidiaries has good title free and clear of all
Liens to all real property owned by such entities (the " _Dex Owned
Properties_ "), except for Liens that do not materially detract from the
present use of such real property.

 

(b) A true and complete copy of each agreement pursuant to which Dex or any
Dex Subsidiary leases any material real property (such agreements, together
with any amendments, modifications and other supplements thereto,
collectively, the " _Dex Leases_ ") has heretofore been made available to
SuperMedia. Each Dex Lease is valid, binding and enforceable against Dex
or an applicable Dex Subsidiary in accordance with its terms and is in full
force and effect (except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the rights of creditors
generally and the availability of equitable remedies), except where the
failure to be valid, binding, enforceable and in full force and effect,
individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Dex. There are no defaults by Dex or any Dex Subsidiary, as
applicable, under any of the Dex Leases which, individually or in the
aggregate, would have a Material Adverse Effect on Dex. To the Knowledge of
Dex, no event has occurred that with or without notice or lapse of time or
both would constitute a breach or default thereunder by any party thereto or
would permit the termination, modification or acceleration of rent thereunder,
except, in each case, for such breaches, defaults, terminations, modifications
or accelerations that can not, individually or in aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Dex.

 

(c) The Dex Owned Properties and the properties leased pursuant to the Dex
Leases (the " _Dex Leased Properties_ ") constitute all of the real estate on
which Dex and the Dex Subsidiaries maintain their facilities or conduct their
business as of the date of this Agreement, except for locations the loss of
which would not result in a Material Adverse Effect on Dex.

4.17 _State Takeover Laws; Rights Agreement_. Each of Dex and the Merger Subs
has, or will have prior to the Dex Effective Time, taken all necessary action
so that, assuming compliance by SuperMedia with its obligations hereunder and
the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by SuperMedia herein,
no "business combination," "moratorium," "fair price," "control share
acquisition" or other state anti-takeover statute or regulation, nor any
takeover-related provision in the Dex Charter or the Dex Bylaws, would (i)
prohibit or restrict the ability of Dex and the Merger Subs to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement, any related agreement, or the
Certificates of Merger or their ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, (ii) have the effect of invalidating or
voiding this Agreement, or the Certificates of Merger, or any provision hereof
or thereof, or (iii) subject SuperMedia to any impediment or condition in
connection with the exercise of any of its rights under this Agreement or the
Certificates of Merger. Dex does not have any stockholder rights plan in
effect.

 



46 4.18 _Reorganization_. As of the date of this Agreement, Dex and the Merger
Subs are not aware of any fact or circumstance that could reasonably be
expected to prevent the Dex Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

4.19 _Opinion_. Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of Dex has received an opinion from Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc.
(the " _Dex Financial Advisor_ ") to the effect that, as of the date of such

the Exchange Ratio is fair to the holders of Dex Common Stock from
a financial point of view. Such opinion has not been amended or rescinded as
of the date of this Agreement.

4.20 _Internal Controls_. Dex has established and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting (as
such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15

Dexs disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in Dexs periodic reports filed or
submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the required time periods. Dex and its Subsidiaries have
implemented and maintain a system of internal controls over financial
reporting that is sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP. Dex is in compliance in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the
applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the
NYSE. Since December 31, 2011 through the date hereof, Dex has not identified
(i) any significant deficiency or material weakness in the design or operation
of internal control over financial reporting which is reasonably likely to
adversely affect Dexs ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information or (ii) any fraud or allegation of fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Dexs internal control over financial reporting.

4.21 _Insurance_. Dex and the Dex Subsidiaries are insured with reputable
insurers against such risks and in such amounts as its management reasonably
has determined to be prudent in accordance with industry practices. To the
Knowledge of Dex, neither Dex nor any Dex Subsidiary is in material breach or
material default of any insurance policies maintained by Dex or any Dex
Subsidiary or has taken any action or failed to take any action that, with
notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such a breach or default or
permit termination (prior to the scheduled termination or expiration thereof)
or modification of any such insurance policies. To the Knowledge of Dex,
neither Dex nor any Dex Subsidiary has received any notice of termination
or cancellation (prior to the scheduled termination or expiration thereof) or
denial of coverage with respect to any such insurance policy.

4.22 _Dex Information_. The information relating to Dex or any Dex Subsidiary
to be included or incorporated by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement and
the Form S-4 will not, at the time the Form S-4 is declared effective, the
time the Joint Proxy Statement is first mailed to stockholders of SuperMedia
and Dex and the time of the SuperMedia Stockholders Meeting and the Dex
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the

 



47  circumstances in which they are made, not misleading. The information

Dex or its representatives for inclusion in any document (other than the Form
S-4) filed with any other Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they
are made, not misleading. All documents that Dex is responsible for filing
with the SEC in connection with the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Joint Proxy Statement and the Form S-4)
(except for such portions thereof that relate only to SuperMedia or any of its
Subsidiaries) will comply as to form and substance in all material respects
with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

rights to use, all Intellectual Property material to their respective
businesses as currently conducted (together with all Intellectual Property set

of any Liens other than Permitted Liens (and, for the avoidance of doubt,
other than obligations to pay royalties or other amounts due under any
licenses of Intellectual Property), and all such rights shall survive the
consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement on
substantially similar terms as such rights existed prior to Closing. There are
no pending, and, to the Knowledge of Dex, there have not been threatened
within the past two years any, claims by any Person alleging infringement,
misappropriation or other violation by Dex or any Dex Subsidiary of any other
Persons Intellectual Property that, individually or in the aggregate, are
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Dex. To the Knowledge
of Dex, the conduct of the business of Dex and the Dex Subsidiaries does not
misappropriate, infringe or otherwise violate in any material respect
any Intellectual Property of any other Person. Neither Dex nor any Dex
Subsidiary has filed any claim for misappropriation, infringement or other

48 (c) With such exceptions that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Dex, (i) each Dex

Subsidiary, as applicable (except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,

(2) years in a manner that materially impaired Dex or the Dex Subsidiaries
ability to deliver Dexs core products and services to their respective
customers.

Order, and to the Knowledge of Dex, there are no Actions or Orders
threatened, that question or seek to cancel, limit, challenge or modify the

right to use Dex IP, or that would restrict, impair or otherwise materially
adversely affect Dexs or the Dex Subsidiaries use thereof or their rights
thereto.

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, _Section 4.24_ of the Dex Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of collective bargaining or
other labor union contracts applicable to any employees of Dex or any Dex
Subsidiary. As of the date hereof, there is no strike, work stoppage, lockout

occurred within the past five (5) years. As of the date hereof, (i) neither
Dex nor any Dex Subsidiary has breached or otherwise failed to comply with
any provision of any collective bargaining or other labor union contract

Dex, threatened against Dex or any Dex Subsidiary under any such contract

 



49  except for any breaches, failures to comply, grievances or complaints that

Recommendation and the Dex Recommendation. The Joint Proxy Statement shall
also include all material disclosure relating to the SuperMedia Financial
Advisors and the Dex Financial Advisor (including, if requested, the amount of
fees each of the SuperMedia Financial Advisors and the Dex Financial Advisor
will receive upon consummation of the Mergers, and the conditions for the
payment of such fees) and to the opinions referred to in _Sections 3.18 _and
_4.19_. Each of SuperMedia, Newco and Dex shall use its reasonable best
efforts to ensure that the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement comply as to
form in all material respects with the rules and regulations promulgated by
the SEC under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, respectively. 

(b) SuperMedia, Newco and Dex shall make all necessary filings with respect to
the Mergers and the transactions contemplated hereby under the Securities Act

event no more than five (5) business days after such clearance), each of
SuperMedia and Dex shall mail the Joint Proxy Statement and all other proxy
materials to the holders of shares of SuperMedia Common Stock and Dex Common
Stock, respectively, and, if necessary in order to comply with applicable

if required in connection therewith, re-solicit proxies.

 



56 (d) Each of Dex, Newco and SuperMedia agrees, as to it and its Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives, that none of the
information supplied or to be supplied by Dex, Newco or SuperMedia, as
applicable, expressly for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Joint
Proxy Statement, Form S-4, or any other documents filed or to be filed with
the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, will, as of
the time such documents (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) are

Stock and at the time of the SuperMedia Stockholders Meeting and the Dex
Stockholders Meeting, respectively, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact, or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. Each of Dex, Newco and SuperMedia
further agrees that all documents that such Party is responsible for filing
with the SEC in connection with the Mergers will comply as to form and
substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the

contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not

or SuperMedia discovers any information relating to any Party, or any of
their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, that should be set forth
in an amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4, so
that none of those documents would include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements in
any such document, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the Party that discovers that information shall promptly
notify the other parties and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
that information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by law or regulation, disseminated to the stockholders of SuperMedia
and Dex.

(e) No amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4
will be made by Dex, Newco or SuperMedia without the approval of the other
Parties, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
_provided_ , that with respect to documents filed by a Party which are
incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement, this
right of approval shall apply only with respect to information relating to the
other Party or its business, financial condition or results of operations; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that SuperMedia, in connection with a Change in
SuperMedia Recommendation, may amend or supplement the Joint Proxy Statement
(including by incorporation by reference) pursuant to an amendment or
supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement (including by incorporation by
reference) to the extent it contains (i) a Change in SuperMedia
Recommendation, (ii) a statement of the reasons of the Board of Directors of
SuperMedia for making such a Change in SuperMedia Recommendation and (iii)
additional information reasonably related to the foregoing, and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Dex, in connection with a Change in Dex Recommendation, may

reference) pursuant to an amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy
Statement (including by incorporation by reference) to the extent it contains
(i) a Change in Dex Recommendation, (ii) a statement of the reasons of the
Board of Directors of Dex for making such a Change in Dex Recommendation and

Common Stock issuable in connection with the Mergers for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy
Statement or the Form S-4.

(a) SuperMedia and Dex shall duly call, give notice of and hold a meeting of
their respective stockholders (the " _SuperMedia Stockholder Meeting_ " and

Meeting_ ") as promptly as practicable following the date on which the Joint
Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC for the purpose of obtaining the
SuperMedia Stockholder Approval and the Dex Stockholder Approval,
respectively; _provided_ , that without the prior written consent of Dex, (i)

(45) calendar days after the date on which the Joint Proxy Statement is mailed
to SuperMedias stockholders, and (ii) SuperMedia may not adjourn or postpone
the SuperMedia Stockholder Meeting; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that without
the prior written consent of SuperMedia, (i) the Dex Stockholder Meeting shall
not be held later than forty-five (45) calendar days after the date on which
the Joint Proxy Statement is mailed to Dexs stockholders, and (ii) Dex may
not adjourn or postpone the Dex Stockholder Meeting; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, Dex may require SuperMedia to adjourn or

require Dex to adjourn or postpone the Dex Stockholder Meeting one (1) time,
in each case, for a period not to exceed 10 business days. SuperMedia and Dex
shall each use their reasonable best efforts to cause the SuperMedia

day.

(b) SuperMedia and Dex shall each establish a record date for purposes of
determining stockholders entitled to notice of and vote at the SuperMedia

_SuperMedia Record Date_ " and the " _Dex Record Date_ ," respectively and
each, a " _Record Date_ ") that is approximately five days prior to the date
on which the Joint Proxy Statement is mailed to SuperMedias stockholders and
Dexs stockholders, respectively. Once such date is established, neither
SuperMedia nor Dex shall change the Record Date or establish a different
record date for the SuperMedia Stockholder Meeting or the Dex Stockholder
Meeting without the prior written consent of Dex or SuperMedia, as
applicable, unless required to do so by applicable Law. In the event that the
date of the SuperMedia Stockholder Meeting or Dex Stockholder Meeting as
originally called is for any reason adjourned or postponed or otherwise
delayed, SuperMedia and Dex each agrees that unless the Other Party shall have

make the Dex Recommendation and Dex shall (x) take all reasonable lawful
action to solicit the Dex Stockholder Approval, and (y) publicly reaffirm the
Dex Recommendation within two (2) business days after any request by
SuperMedia. Notwithstanding (A) any Change in SuperMedia Recommendation or
Change in Dex Recommendation or (B) any Acquisition Proposal having been
publicly proposed or announced or otherwise submitted to SuperMedia, Dex or
any of their respective representatives, this Agreement and the Mergers shall
be submitted to the stockholders of SuperMedia and Dex for the purpose of
obtaining the SuperMedia Stockholder Approval and the Dex Stockholder
Approval. SuperMedia and Dex each shall, upon reasonable request, advise the
other party at least on a daily basis on each of the last ten (10) business
days prior to the date of the SuperMedia Stockholder Meeting or the
Dex Stockholder Meeting, as applicable, as to the aggregate tally of the
proxies received by SuperMedia with respect to the SuperMedia Stockholder
Approval or by Dex with respect to the Dex Stockholder Approval. Without the
prior written consent of Dex, the adoption of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Mergers) shall be the only
matter (other than procedure matters) which SuperMedia shall propose to be
acted on by the stockholders of SuperMedia at the SuperMedia Stockholder
Meeting, and without the prior written consent of SuperMedia, the adoption of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Mergers) shall be the only matter (other than procedure matters) which Dex
shall propose to be acted on by stockholders of Dex at the Dex Stockholders
Meeting, except in each case to the extent otherwise required by applicable
Law.

6.3 _Regulatory Matters_.

(a) The Parties shall cooperate with each other and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation (including Notification and Report Forms, if required, under the
HSR Act (which, if required, shall be filed within ten business days of
the date hereof) and any applicable Laws in foreign jurisdictions governing
antitrust or merger control matters), to effect all applications, notices,
petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all Permits,
consents, approvals, clearances and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Entities that are necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Mergers), to use
reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting periods, or receipt of required authorizations, as
applicable, under the HSR Act and any applicable Laws in foreign jurisdictions
governing antitrust or merger control matters, to supply as promptly as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act or any applicable Laws in foreign
jurisdictions governing antitrust or merger control matters and to comply with
the terms and conditions of all such Permits, consents, approvals, clearances
and authorizations of all such Governmental Entities. Each of SuperMedia and
Dex shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable,
each will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, all the information relating to
SuperMedia or Dex, as the case may be, and any of their respective
Subsidiaries, which appear in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing
right, each of the Parties shall act 

 



59  reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each of SuperMedia and Dex shall
consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all Permits,
consents, approvals, clearances and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and each will keep the other apprised of the
status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including promptly furnishing the Other Party with copies of
notices or other communications received by SuperMedia or Dex, as the case may
be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Dex or
SuperMedia to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any
condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing Permits,
consents, approvals, clearances and authorizations of third parties or
Governmental Entities, that would reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on Newco, Dex, SuperMedia, Dex Surviving Company or SuperMedia
Surviving Company (a " _Materially Burdensome Condition_ "). In addition,
SuperMedia and Dex agree to cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to
prepare and file such petitions and filings, and to obtain such permits,
consents, approvals, clearances and authorizations of third parties and
Governmental Entities, that may be necessary or advisable to effect any
mergers and/or consolidations of the SuperMedia Subsidiaries and the Dex
Subsidiaries following consummation of the Mergers.

(b) Each of Dex and SuperMedia shall, upon request, furnish to the other all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any statement, filing, notice or application made
by or on behalf of Dex, SuperMedia or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
any Governmental Entity in connection with the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) Each of Dex, the Merger Subs and SuperMedia shall promptly advise the
others upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity the
consent or approval of which is required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that causes such Party to believe that there is
a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Approval will not be obtained or
that the receipt of any such approval may be materially delayed, and, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, shall promptly (and in any event within 24
hours) provide the Other Party with a copy of such communication.

6.4 _Transaction Litigation_. Subject to the provisos contained in _Section
6.3_ expressly eliminating any obligation to take actions that would result in
a Materially Burdensome Condition, if any administrative or judicial action
or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, each of SuperMedia and Dex shall promptly notify the Other Party
of such action or proceeding, shall cooperate in all respects with the other
and shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist
any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed
or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of Dex and SuperMedia shall give the Other Party the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against such Party and its directors relating to the

 



60  Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No Party
shall compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to any of
the foregoing regarding any such action or proceeding unless the other
Parties have consented in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement, nothing in this _Section 6.4_ shall limit a
Partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ or
_8.1(c)_ so long as such Party has, prior to such termination, complied with
its obligations under this _Section 6.4._

6.5 _Access to Information_. (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, each of SuperMedia
and Dex shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the
officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of the
other reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior
to the SuperMedia Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts,
commitments and records, and, during such period, each of SuperMedia and Dex
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to the Other Party
all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
the other may reasonably request. Each of SuperMedia and Dex shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, provide to the Other Party a copy of each
report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it during
such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities Laws. Neither
SuperMedia nor Dex nor any of their Subsidiaries shall be required to provide
access to or to disclose information where such Party determines in good
faith, after consultation with legal counsel, that such access or disclosure
would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such Party or its
Subsidiaries or contravene any Law, Order or binding agreement entered into
prior to the date of this Agreement. The Parties shall make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 

(b) All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement shall be
subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement entered into
between SuperMedia and Dex as of May 13, 2010 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ").

(c) No investigation by any of the Parties or their respective
representatives shall affect the representations and warranties of the other
set forth in this Agreement.

6.6 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject to _Section 6.3_, each of Dex,
Newco and SuperMedia shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their
reasonable best efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements
that may be imposed on such Party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the
Mergers, to cause the conditions set forth in  _Article VII_ to be satisfied
and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a
reasonably expeditious manner and (ii) to obtain (and to cooperate with the
Other Party to obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval
of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party
that is required to be obtained by SuperMedia, Newco or Dex or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.7 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Dex shall cause the shares of Newco Common
Stock to be issued in the Mergers and such other shares of Newco Common Stock
to be reserved for issuance in connection with the Mergers to be approved for
listing on the NYSE or the NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance,
prior to the Dex Effective Time.

 



61 6.8 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) For a period of at least six years following the SuperMedia Effective
Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the SuperMedia Surviving
Company shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation
and indemnification of the (as of or prior to the SuperMedia Effective Time)
former directors, officers and employees of SuperMedia than are currently
provided in the SuperMedia Charter and the SuperMedia Bylaws, as applicable,
which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such
individuals until the expiration of the statutes of limitations applicable to
such matters or unless such amendment, modification or repeal is required by
applicable Law.

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.8(a)_, in the event of any
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal or administrative, including any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation in which any individual who is now, or has been at
any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the
SuperMedia Effective Time, a director or officer of SuperMedia or any
SuperMedia Subsidiary or who is or was serving at the request of SuperMedia or
any SuperMedia Subsidiary as a director or officer of another Person (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to
(i) the fact that he is or was a director or officer of SuperMedia or any
SuperMedia Subsidiary, or of another Person at the request of SuperMedia
or any SuperMedia Subsidiary, or (ii) this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether asserted or arising
before or after the SuperMedia Effective Time, the Parties shall cooperate and
use their best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. From and after
the Effective Time, Dex Surviving Company shall indemnify and hold harmless,
as and to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and any agreement
set forth in _Section 6.8_ of the SuperMedia Disclosure Schedule (an "
_Indemnification Agreement_ "), each such Indemnified Party against any
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reimbursement
for reasonable fees and expenses incurred in advance of the final disposition
of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation upon receipt of any
undertaking required by applicable Law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation. In the event of any such proceeding, each
Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the
defense of the proceeding from Dex Surviving Company to the same extent such
Persons have the right to advancement of expenses from SuperMedia as of the
date of this Agreement pursuant to the SuperMedia Charter and SuperMedia
Bylaws or such Persons Indemnification Agreement (provided that any Person to
whom expenses are advanced shall have provided an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is finally determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification).

(c) SuperMedia may purchase prior to the SuperMedia Effective Time a fully
pre-paid six-year tail policy providing coverage and benefits that is
substantially equivalent to the current directors and officers liability
insurance policies maintained on the date of this

 



62  Agreement by SuperMedia (complete and accurate copies of which shall have
been made available to Dex before such purchase). If such policies have been
obtained, Dex Surviving Company shall or shall cause SuperMedia Surviving
Company to maintain such policies in full force and effect. If SuperMedia does
not obtain a tail policy, Dex Surviving Company shall cause to be maintained
for a period of six years after the Closing Date the current directors and
officers liability insurance policies maintained by SuperMedia; provided,
that Dex Surviving Company may substitute therefor policies of at least the
same coverage containing terms and conditions that are not materially less
favorable from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as
SuperMedias current insurance carrier. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event shall Dex Surviving Company or SuperMedia Surviving Company be required
to expend for such policies an annual premium greater than 300% of the
existing annual premium on SuperMedias current directors and officers
liability insurance policies (the " _Maximum Amount_ "); provided, that
if SuperMedia Surviving Company is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance
called for by this _Section 6.8(c)_, Dex Surviving Company shall cause
SuperMedia Surviving Company to obtain as much comparable insurance as
available for the applicable Maximum Amount.

(d) In the event that Dex Surviving Company or SuperMedia Surviving Company or
any of their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and other assets to any Person, then, in each such
case, Dex Surviving Company shall, and shall cause (as applicable) SuperMedia
Surviving Company to, cause proper provision to be made so that the successors
and assigns of Dex Surviving Company or SuperMedia Surviving Company, as
applicable, shall expressly assume the obligations of such entity as set forth
in this _Section 6.8_.

(e) The provisions of this _Section 6.8_ shall survive the SuperMedia
Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives.

6.9 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the SuperMedia
Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of Dex
Surviving Company, on the one hand, and a SuperMedia Subsidiary, on the other)
or to vest Dex Surviving Company or SuperMedia Surviving Company with full
title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises
of any party to the Mergers, the proper officers and directors of each Party
and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may
be reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense of, Dex.

6.10 _Advice of Changes_. Each of Dex, the Merger Subs and SuperMedia shall
promptly advise the other Parties of any change or event (i) having or
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) that it
believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a breach
of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties (or
remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the
Parties under this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that a failure to
comply with this _Section 6.10_ shall not constitute the failure of
any condition set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied unless the
underlying Material Adverse Effect or breach would independently result in the
failure of a condition set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied.

 



63 6.11 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Prior to the Closing
Date, Dex and SuperMedia shall take all such steps as may be required to
cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any
dispositions of SuperMedia Common Stock or Dex Common Stock (including
derivative securities with respect to SuperMedia Common Stock or Dex Common
Stock) or acquisitions of Newco Common Stock (including derivative securities
with respect to Newco Common Stock), by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
SuperMedia or Dex or will become subject to such reporting requirements with
respect to Newco, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

 

6.12 _No Solicitation_.

(a) Neither SuperMedia nor Dex (each, a " _No-Shop Party_ ", and with respect
to each other, the " _Other Party_ ") shall, and each shall cause its
respective Subsidiaries not to, and each shall direct its and its
Subsidiaries officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives
(including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or
other retained representative) not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit,
initiate, encourage or facilitate, directly or indirectly (including by way of
furnishing information), or take any other action designed to facilitate, any
inquiries or proposals regarding any merger (other than the Mergers), share
exchange, consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock
(including by way of a tender offer), restructuring, recapitalization or
similar transactions involving such No-Shop Party or any of its Subsidiaries
that, if consummated, would constitute an Alternative Transaction (any of the
foregoing inquiries or proposals being referred to herein as an " _Acquisition
Proposal_ "), (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding
an Alternative Transaction, (iii) except as contemplated by _Section 6.13_,
take any action to exempt any Person from the restrictions contained in any
takeover or similar Law or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply
or (iv) enter into any merger agreement, letter of intent, agreement in
principle, share purchase agreement or other agreement regarding any
Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors
of a No-Shop Party shall be permitted, prior to the meeting of stockholders
of such No-Shop Party to be held pursuant to _Section 6.2_, and subject to
compliance with the other terms of this _Section 6.12_ and to first entering
into a confidentiality agreement with the Person proposing such Acquisition
Proposal on terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to such No-
Shop Party than, those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, to furnish
information concerning such No-Shop Party and its Subsidiaries to the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal and to consider and participate in
discussions and negotiations with respect to such Acquisition Proposal
received by such No-Shop Party, if and only to the extent that (A) such
Acquisition Proposal is an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal, (B) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach by such
No-Shop Party of this _Section 6.12_, and (C) the Board of Directors of such
No-Shop Party reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with
such No-Shop Partys outside legal counsel and independent financial advisors)
that (x) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably
be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (y) failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its duties under applicable Laws. Such No-Shop Party shall
promptly provide or make available to the Other Party and its representatives
any non-public information provided or made available to such other Person
that was not previously provided or made available to the Other Party.

 



64 As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Transaction_ " means, in respect
of either No-Shop Party, any of (i) a transaction pursuant to which any
Person (or group of Persons) other than the Other Party or its Affiliates,
directly or indirectly, acquires or would acquire more than 10 percent of the
outstanding shares of SuperMedia Common Stock or Dex Common Stock, as
applicable, or outstanding voting power or of any new series or new class of
preferred stock that would be entitled to a class or series vote with respect
to the Mergers, whether from such No-Shop Party, or pursuant to a tender
offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) any transaction pursuant to which
any Person (or group of Persons) other than the Other Party or its Affiliates
acquires or would acquire control of assets (including for this purpose the
outstanding equity securities of any Subsidiaries of such No-Shop Party and
securities of the entity surviving any merger or business combination,
including any of its Subsidiaries) of such No-Shop Party or any of its
Subsidiaries representing more than ten (10) percent of the fair market value
of all the assets, net revenues or net income of such No-Shop Party and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction, or
(iii) any other merger, consolidation, business combination, restructuring,
recapitalization or similar transaction involving such No-Shop Party or any of
its subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
as a result of which the holders of shares of SuperMedia Common Stock or Dex
Common Stock, as applicable, immediately prior to such transaction do not, in
the aggregate, own at least 90 percent of each of the outstanding shares of
common stock and the outstanding voting power of the surviving or resulting
entity in such transaction immediately after the consummation thereof in
substantially the same proportion as such holders held the shares of
SuperMedia Common Stock or Dex Common Stock, as applicable, immediately prior
to the consummation thereof.

As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means, with respect to a
No-Shop Party, a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (with the references
to 10 percent included in the definition of Alternative Transaction changed to
50 percent and the reference to 90 percent in clause (iii) of such definition
changed to 50 percent) for such No-Shop Party obtained not in violation of
this _Section 6.12_ which the Board of Directors of such No-Shop Party
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, and taking into account such facts as the Board of
Directors considers to be appropriate (including conditions to and expected
timing and risks of consummation, the ability of the Person making such
proposal to obtain financing for such Acquisition Proposal, and any break-up
fees or expense reimbursement provisions), (i) is reasonably likely to be
consummated in accordance with its terms, and (ii) if consummated, would
result in a transaction more favorable to the holders of common stock of
such No-Shop Party than the Mergers.

(b) Other than in accordance with _Section 6.12(c)_ below, the Board of
Directors of a No-Shop Party shall not (i) withdraw (or not continue to make)
or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to the Other Party, or publicly
propose to withdraw (or not continue to make) or modify or qualify in a manner
adverse to the Other Party, the SuperMedia Recommendation or the Dex
Recommendation, as the case may be, (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or
publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) fail to recommend against any Acquisition Proposal within two business
days upon the request of the Other Party, or (iv) take any other action or
make any other public statement that is

 



65  inconsistent with the SuperMedia Recommendation or Dex Recommendation, as
the case may be (any action described in clauses (i) through (iv), taken by
the Board of Directors of either SuperMedia or Dex, a " _Change in SuperMedia
Recommendation_ " or a " _Change in Dex Recommendation_ ", respectively).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.12_, at any
time prior to obtaining the SuperMedia Stockholder Approval or Dex Stockholder
Approval, as applicable, the Board of Directors of a No-Shop Party may (x)
effect a Change in SuperMedia Recommendation or a Change in Dex
Recommendation, as applicable, other than in respect of an Acquisition
Proposal or (y) effect a Change in SuperMedia Recommendation or a Change in
Dex Recommendation, as applicable, in respect of a Acquisition Proposal if the
following conditions are met:



      |  | 
---|---|--- 
    (i) |  | the No-Shop Party has complied in all material respects
with its obligations under this _Section 6.12_ and the Board of Directors of
the No-Shop Party has determined in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Laws; 
   | 
  (ii) |  | in the case of any action described in clause (x) above, (a)
the No-Shop Party has provided prior written notice to the Other Party, at
least three business days in advance, of its intention to effect a Change in
SuperMedia Recommendation or a Change in Dex Recommendation, as applicable,
which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the reasons therefor, (b)
prior to effecting such Change in SuperMedia Recommendation or a Change in
Dex Recommendation, as applicable, the No-Shop Party shall, and shall cause
its legal and financial advisors to, during such three business day period,
negotiate with the Other Party in good faith (to the extent the Other Party
desires to negotiate) and (c) the Board of Directors of the No-Shop Party
shall consider in good faith whether such modifications make a Change in
SuperMedia Recommendation or a Change in Dex Recommendation, as
applicable, unnecessary; and 
   | 
  (iii) |  | in the case of any action described in clause (y) above, (a)
the Board of Directors of such No-Shop Party has concluded in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel)
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving
effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by the Other Party
pursuant to this clause (iii) (if applicable), (b) the No-Shop Party has
provided prior written notice to the Other Party, at least three business days
in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of its intention to effect a Change in
SuperMedia Recommendation or a Change in Dex Recommendation, as applicable,
and/or to terminate the Agreement, which notice shall specify the material
terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of
the party making such Superior Proposal), and contemporaneously with
providing such notice shall have provided a copy of the relevant proposed 
 



 



66 Proposal and other material documents, and (c) prior to effecting such Change
in SuperMedia Recommendation or Change in Dex Recommendation, as applicable,
the No-Shop Party shall, and shall cause its legal and financial advisors to,
during the Notice Period, negotiate with the Other Party in good faith (to the
extent the Other Party desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal
ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal. In the event that during the Notice
Period any revisions are made to the Superior Proposal and the Board
of Directors of such No-Shop Party in its good faith judgment determines such
revisions are material (it being agreed that any change in the purchase price
in such Superior Proposal shall be deemed a material revision), the No-Shop
Party shall be required to deliver a new written notice to the Other Party
and to comply with the requirements of this _Section 6.12(c)_ with respect to
such new written notice. 
---|--- 
 

(d) Each No-Shop Party shall notify the Other Party promptly (but in no event
later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any
material modification of or material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, or
any request for nonpublic information relating to such No-Shop Party or any of
its Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of
such No-Shop Party or any of its Subsidiaries by any Person or entity that
informs the Board of Directors of such No-Shop Party or any Subsidiary of such
No-Shop Party that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition
Proposal. Such notice to the Other Party shall be made orally and in writing,
and shall indicate the identity of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal
or intending to make or considering making an Acquisition Proposal or
requesting non-public information or access to the books and records of such
No-Shop Party or any of its Subsidiaries, and the material terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal or modification or amendment to an Acquisition Proposal.
Each No-Shop Party shall keep the Other Party fully informed, on a current
basis, of any material changes in the status and any material changes or
modifications in the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or
request, and at all times shall negotiate in good faith with the Other Party
regarding possible modifications to the terms of this Agreement which may
arise in connection with any Acquisition Proposal. Each No-Shop Party shall
also promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, notify the Other Party,
orally and in writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations
concerning any Acquisition Proposal in accordance with this _Section 6.12_.

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.12_ shall prohibit a No-Shop Party
or its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

(f) Each No-Shop Party and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and cause
to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons
(other than the Other Party) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the
foregoing, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all Persons other
than the Other Party who have been furnished confidential information
regarding such No-Shop Party in connection with the solicitation of or
discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal within the 12 months prior to
the date hereof promptly to

 



67  return or destroy such information. Except as may be required by applicable
Law, each No-Shop Party agrees not to, and to cause its Subsidiaries not to,
release any third party from the confidentiality and standstill provisions of
any agreement to which such No-Shop Party or its Subsidiaries is or may become
a party, and shall immediately take all steps necessary to terminate any
approval that may have been heretofore given under any such provisions
authorizing any Person to make an Acquisition Proposal.

(g) Each No-Shop Party shall ensure that the officers, directors and all
employees, agents and representatives (including any investment bankers,
financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other retained representatives)
of such No-Shop Party or its Subsidiaries are aware of the restrictions
described in this _Section 6.12_ as reasonably necessary to avoid violations
thereof. It is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this _Section 6.12_ by any officer, director, employee, agent or
representative (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney,
accountant or other retained representative) of a No-Shop Party or its
Subsidiaries, at the direction or with the consent of such No-Shop Party or
its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.12_ by
such No-Shop Party.

6.13 _Takeover Statutes_. Each of Dex, the Merger Subs and SuperMedia shall
use its reasonable best efforts (i) to take all actions necessary so that no
"moratorium," "control share," "fair price," "anti-greenmail,"
"takeover," "interested stockholder" or similar Law is or becomes applicable
to the Mergers, or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) if any such Law is or becomes applicable to the Mergers or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to take all
actions necessary so that the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated
hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated
by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Laws on the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

6.14 _Financing Amendments and Cooperation_. Each of Dex and SuperMedia
shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, use commercially
reasonable efforts (and shall cause its and its respective Subsidiaries
officers, employees and advisors, including legal and financial advisors and
accountants, to cooperate in such efforts) to (i) obtain the consent of the
creditors (the " _Dex Creditors_ ") of Dex under (x) the Third Amended and

reasonably satisfactory to Dex and SuperMedia, and (iv) satisfy as promptly

SuperMedia Financing Amendments immediately prior to the Closing.
In furtherance of the foregoing, Dex will contact the Dex Creditors and
SuperMedia will contact the SuperMedia Creditors as soon as practicable (and
in any event within five (5) business days of the date hereof) and request a
meeting to discuss the Dex Financing Amendments and the SuperMedia Financing
Amendments. Dex shall permit SuperMedia to participate in any meeting with the
Dex Creditors, and SuperMedia shall permit Dex to participate in any meeting
with the SuperMedia Creditors, to the extent permitted by such creditors. Dex
and SuperMedia shall cooperate in the preparation of any materials to be
provided to the Dex Creditors and the SuperMedia Creditors. Each Party will
promptly provide the Other Party with copies of any communications received
from the Dex Creditors or the SuperMedia Creditors, as applicable, and will
keep the Other Party apprised of the status of discussions with the Dex
Creditors and the SuperMedia Creditors, as applicable, including any
request for information received from the Dex Creditors or the SuperMedia
Creditors, as applicable, and any requested revisions to the amendments and
extensions comprising the Dex Financing Amendments and the SuperMedia
Financing Amendments. Subject to recipients of any such information entering
into customary arrangements for confidentiality that are substantially similar
to the provisions in the Confidentiality Agreement or reasonably acceptable to
Dex or SuperMedia, as applicable, each of Dex and SuperMedia shall provide
financial and other information regarding Dex and its Subsidiaries or
SuperMedia and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by such
creditors. The Parties shall otherwise cooperate in any manner
reasonably requested in connection with the negotiation, arranging and
consummation of the Dex Financing Amendments and the SuperMedia Financing
Amendments.

6.15 _De-listing and Deregistration_. Prior to the SuperMedia Effective Time,
SuperMedia shall cooperate with Dex and use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all
things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under Applicable

after the date of this Agreement (the Party to which this clause (i) applies
is referred to in this _Section 8.3(a)_ as the " _applicable party_ "), (ii)
thereafter this Agreement is terminated (A) pursuant to _Sections 8.1(g)_ or
_8.1(c)_ , in each case following the failure to receive the requisite
approval of the applicable partys stockholders, (B) pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)_ as a result of a breach by the applicable party or (C) pursuant to

that for the purposes of this _Section 8.3_, all percentages in the

pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ or by SuperMedia pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_,

this  _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Other Party would not

pursuant to this _Section 8.3_, and, in order to obtain such payment, the
Other Party commences a suit which results in a judgment against such first
Party for the amount set forth in this _Section 8.3_, the Other Party shall
pay to such first Party its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit, together with

 



75  interest on any unpaid amount of the Expense Reimbursement at the rate on
six-month U.S. Treasury obligations plus 300 basis points in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made, calculated on a daily basis from
the date the Expense Reimbursement was required to be paid until the date of
the actual payment.

(d) In no event shall any Party be required to pay the Expense Reimbursement
on more than one occasion.

8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this Agreement may
be amended by the Parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective
Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters
presented in connection with the Mergers by the stockholders of SuperMedia or
Dex; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any approval of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by the stockholders of SuperMedia or Dex,
there may not be, without further approval of such stockholders, any amendment
of this Agreement that requires such further approval under applicable Law.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Dex Effective Time, the
Parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Board of
Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (ii)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in

of such stockholders any extension or waiver of this Agreement or any portion
hereof that changes the amount or form of the consideration to be delivered
to the holders of SuperMedia Common Stock or Dex Common Stock under this
Agreement, other than as contemplated by this Agreement. Any agreement on the
part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such Party, but such
extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

release by SuperMedia and Dex and thereafter, SuperMedia and Dex each shall
consult with the other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise
making public announcements (including conference calls with investors and
analysts) with respect to the Mergers or any other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. No Party shall issue any such press release or make
any such public statement prior to such consultation, except to the extent
the disclosing Party determines it is required to do so by applicable Law or
any listing agreement with the NYSE or NASDAQ, in which case such Party shall
use all reasonable efforts to consult with the Other Party before issuing any
such release or making any such public statement.

(b) Upon the request of either Party, (i) SuperMedia and Dex shall promptly
prepare a mutually acceptable joint written presentation to Institutional
Shareholder Services and/or Glass Lewis recommending this Agreement and the

participant (whether in written, video or oral form via webcast, hyperlink or
otherwise), or (ii) utilized by any executive officer, key employee or advisor
of SuperMedia or Dex, as applicable or any such participant, as a script in
discussions or meetings with any such Third Parties, each of SuperMedia and
Dex shall (or shall cause any such participant to) cooperate in good faith

things, determining whether that communication constitutes "soliciting
material" that is required to be filed by Rule 14a-6(b) or Rule 14a-12(b) of

SuperMedia or Dex or any Subsidiary thereof, or any document or other material
or information posted or made accessible on the website of SuperMedia or Dex
(whether in written, video or oral form via webcast, hyperlink or otherwise),
that is related to any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and,
if reviewed by a stockholder of SuperMedia or Dex, as applicable, could
reasonably be deemed to constitute a "solicitation" of "proxies" (in each
case, as defined in Rule 14a-1 of the Exchange Act) with respect to the
Mergers. " _Third Party_ " means any Person or group other than SuperMedia,
the SuperMedia Subsidiaries, Dex or the Dex Subsidiaries.

provisions of _Article II_ solely to the extent necessary to receive the

The name of its registered agent at such address is Delaware Corporation Organizers, Inc. 

 

3. _Nature of Business; Purpose_. The nature of the business or purpose to be conducted or promoted by the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (as amended, the " _DGCL_ "). 

 

4. _Capital Stock_. The total number of shares of capital stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is Three Hundred Ten Million (310,000,000) shares, consisting of: (a) Three Hundred Million (300,000,000) shares of common stock, $.001 par value per share (the " _Common Stock_ "); and (b) Ten Million (10,000,000) shares of preferred stock, $.001 par value per share (the " _Preferred Stock_ "), issuable in one or more series as hereinafter provided. 

A. _Common Stock_. Except as otherwise provided (i) by the DGCL, (ii) by
_Article 4.B_ , or (iii) by resolutions, if any, of the Board of Directors
fixing the relative powers, preferences and rights and the qualifications,
limitations or restrictions of any series of Preferred Stock, the entire
voting power of the shares of the Corporation for the election of directors
and for all other purposes shall be vested exclusively in the Common Stock.
Each share of Common Stock shall have one vote upon all matters to be voted on
by the holders of the Common Stock. Subject to the rights and preferences of
any series of Preferred Stock (as fixed by resolutions, if any, of the Board
of Directors), the holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to
receive such dividends and other distributions (payable in cash, property or
capital stock of the Corporation) when, as and if declared thereon by the
Board of Directors from time to time out of any assets or funds of the
Corporation legally available therefor and shall share equally on a per share
basis in such dividends and distributions. Each share of Common Stock shall
share equally, subject to the rights and preferences of any series of
outstanding Preferred Stock (as fixed by resolutions, if any, of the Board of
Directors), in all assets of the Corporation, in the event of any voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the
Corporation, or upon any distribution of the assets of the Corporation.

B. _Preferred Stock_. The Preferred Stock may be issued at any time and from
time to time in one or more series. Subject to the provisions of this Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is hereby
expressly authorized to fix from time to time by resolution or resolutions,
the designation of any series of Preferred Stock (which may be distinguished by number, letter or title) and the number of shares of any
series of Preferred Stock, and to determine the voting powers, designations,
preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and
the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, of any such series,
including, without limitation, to provide that any such series may be: (i)
subject to redemption (including any sinking or purchase fund) at such time or
times and at such price or prices or rate or rates, and with such adjustments;
(ii) entitled to receive dividends (which may be cumulative or non-
cumulative) at such rates, on such conditions, at such times, and payable in
preference to, or in such relation to, the dividends payable on any other
class or classes or any other series of stock; (iii) entitled to such rights
upon the dissolution of, or upon any distribution of the assets of, the
Corporation; (iv) convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other
class or classes or of any other series of the same or any other class or
classes of stock, at such price or prices or at such rate or rates of
conversion or exchange and any adjustments thereto; or (v) entitled to the
benefit of conditions and restrictions upon the creation of indebtedness of
the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation, upon the issue of any
additional stock (including additional shares of such series or of any other
class or series) and upon the payment of dividends or the making of other
distributions on, and the purchase, redemption or other acquisition by the
Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation of any outstanding stock of
the Corporation; all as may be stated in such resolution or resolutions.
Further, within the limits and restrictions stated in any resolution
or resolutions of the Board of Directors originally fixing the number of
shares constituting any such series, the Board of Directors is authorized to
increase or decrease (but not below the number of shares of such series then
outstanding) the number of shares of any such series subsequent to the
issuance of shares of that series. Shares of any series of Preferred Stock
which have been redeemed (whether through the operation of a sinking fund or
otherwise) or otherwise acquired by the Corporation, or which, if convertible
or exchangeable, have been converted into or exchanged for shares of stock of
any other class or classes or series shall have the status of authorized and
unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as a part of the
series of which they were originally a part or may be reclassified and
reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock to be created by
resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors or as part of any other
series of Preferred Stock, all subject to the conditions or restrictions on
issuance set forth in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of
Directors providing for the issue of any series of Preferred Stock and to any
filing required by law. 

5. _Board of Directors._

A. _General_. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by
or under the direction of the Board of Directors. Directors need not be
stockholders of the Corporation or residents of the State of Delaware.
Elections of directors need not be by ballot.

B. _Number_. Except as otherwise provided by resolutions, if any, of the
Board of Directors fixing the relative powers, preferences and rights and the
qualification, limitations or restrictions of any series of Preferred Stock,
the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be not less
than 3 directors, the exact number of directors to be fixed by, or in the
manner provided in, the Bylaws of the Corporation. In no case shall a decrease
in the number of directors remove or shorten the term of any incumbent
director.  C. _Committees_. The Board of Directors may, in the manner provided in the
Bylaws of the Corporation, designate one or more committees which, to the
extent provided in the Bylaws of the Corporation or any resolution of the
Board of Directors, shall have and may exercise the powers of the Board of
Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation to
the full extent permitted by law, and may authorize the seal of the
Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it. Such committee
or committees shall have such name or names as may be stated in the Bylaws of
the Corporation or as may be determined from time to time by resolution
adopted by the Board of Directors.

 

D. _Bylaws_. Subject to any limitations that may be imposed by the
stockholders, the Board of Directors shall have power to make, alter, amend
or repeal any or all of the Bylaws of the Corporation in the manner and
subject to the approval requirement set forth in the Bylaws.

6. _Preemptive Rights_. No holder of shares of stock of the Corporation of any class shall have any preemptive right or be entitled as a matter of right to subscribe for or purchase any part of any new or additional issue of stock or any securities of any kind whatsoever, whether now or hereafter authorized. 

 

7. _Stockholder Action Without a Meeting_. Except as otherwise provided by resolutions, if any, of the Board of Directors fixing the relative powers, preferences and rights and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of any series of Preferred Stock, no action may be taken by stockholders of the Corporation, except at an annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, and stockholder action by written consent is prohibited. 

8. _Personal Liability_. No person who is or was a director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or any of its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted by the DGCL as the same exists or hereafter may be amended. If the DGCL is hereafter amended to authorize corporate action further limiting or eliminating the liability of directors, then the liability of a director to the Corporation or its stockholders shall be limited or eliminated to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. Any repeal, amendment or modification of this _Article 8_ by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this _Article 8_ will, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to further limit or eliminate the liability of directors) and shall not adversely affect (or eliminate or reduce) any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of, or increase the liability of any director of the Corporation with respect to any event or act or omission of such director occurring prior to, such repeal, amendment or modification or adoption of such inconsistent provision with respect to events, acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal, amendment or modification or adoption of such inconsistent provision, or if applicable, modification of law. 9. _Right to Indemnification_. 

 

A. _Right to Indemnification of Directors and Officers_. The Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, any person (an "
_Indemnified Person_ ") who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made
a party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (hereinafter a " _Proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that
such person, or a person for whom such person is the legal representative, is
or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while a director or
officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, trustee, manager, employee or agent of
another corporation or of a partnership, company, limited liability company,
joint venture, trust, non-profit entity or other enterprise, including service
with respect to any employee benefit plan, whether the basis of such
Proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director or officer
or in any other capacity while serving, at the request of the Corporation, as
a director, officer, employee or agent, against all liability and loss
suffered (including judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and
amounts paid in settlement) and expenses (including attorneys fees) actually
and reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with such
Proceeding. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as otherwise
provided in _Article 9.C_, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify an
Indemnified Person in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) commenced
by such Indemnified Person only if the commencement of such Proceeding (or
part thereof) by the Indemnified Person was authorized in advance by the Board
of Directors.

B. _Prepayment of Expenses of Directors and Officers_. The Corporation shall
pay or reimburse (on an unsecured basis) an Indemnified Person for the
reasonable expenses (including attorneys fees) actually incurred by such
Indemnified Person in connection with any such Proceeding in advance of its
final disposition or final judicial decision (hereinafter an " _advancement of
expenses_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that, if and to the extent required by
law, such payment or reimbursement of expenses in advance of the final
disposition of or final judicial decision regarding the Proceeding shall be
made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (an "
_undertaking_ "), by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person, to repay all
amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined at final disposition
or by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal
(a " _Final Adjudication_ ") that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to
be indemnified for such expenses under this _Article 9_ or otherwise.

C. _Claims_. If a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under
this _Article 9_ is not paid in full by the Corporation within 30 days after
a written claim by the Indemnified Person has been received by the
Corporation, the Indemnified Person may at any time thereafter bring suit
against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If
successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the
Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an
undertaking, the Indemnified Person shall be entitled to be paid also the
expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In any action brought by the
Indemnified Person to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in
a suit brought by the Indemnified Person to enforce a right to an advancement
of expenses) it shall be a defense that the Indemnified Person has not met any
applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Further, in any
action brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking by an
Indemnified Person, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such
expenses upon a Final Adjudication that the Indemnified Person has not met any
applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the
failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent
legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the
commencement of such action that indemnification of the Indemnified Person has
met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an
actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) shall create a presumption
that the Indemnified Person has not met the applicable standard of conduct or,
in the case of such an action brought by the Indemnified Person, be a defense
to such action. In any action brought by the Indemnified Person to enforce a
right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or
brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to
the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the Indemnified Person
is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under
this _Article 9_ or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.

D. _Contract Right; Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights conferred by
_Article 9.A_ and  _Article 9.B_ shall be contract rights that shall fully
vest at the time the Indemnified Person first assumes such Indemnified
Persons position as a director or officer of the Corporation. The rights
conferred on any person by this  _Article 9_ shall not be exclusive of any
other rights which such person may have under the Corporations certificate of
incorporation prior to the effectiveness of this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or may have or hereafter acquire under any
statute, provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation,
the Bylaws of the Corporation, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise.

 

E. _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, trustee, manager,
employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, or of a
partnership, company, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, non-
profit entity or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan)
against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would
have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or
loss under applicable law, this _Article 9_ or otherwise.

 

F. _Indemnification of and Advancement of Expenses of Employees and Agents_.
The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board
of Directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of
expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of
the provisions of this _Article 9_ with respect to the indemnification and
advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.

G. _Limitations_. The Corporation shall not be liable under this _Article 9_
to make any payment in connection with any claim made against the Indemnified
Person (or pay or reimburse any expenses to any Indemnified Person) to the
extent the Indemnified Person has otherwise actually received payment (under
any insurance policy, other right of indemnity or agreement or otherwise) of
the amounts otherwise indemnifiable or payable hereunder. The Corporation
shall not be liable to indemnify any Indemnified Person under this _Article
9_: (a) for any amounts paid in settlement of any Proceeding effected without the
Corporations written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, or (b) for any judicial award if the Corporation was not
given a reasonably timely opportunity to participate, at its expense, in the
defense of such action, but only to the extent that the failure to be given
such reasonably timely opportunity actually and materially prejudiced the
Corporations ability to defend such action.

H. _Subrogation_. In the event of payment under this _Article 9_, the
Corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the
rights of recovery of the Indemnified Person, who shall execute all papers
required and shall do everything that may be reasonably necessary to secure
such rights, including the execution of such documents reasonably necessary to
enable the Corporation effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.

I. _Amendment or Repeal; Successors_. No amendment, modification or repeal of
the provisions of this _Article 9_, nor the adoption of any provision of
this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this
_Article 9_, nor to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any
modification of law, shall adversely affect (or eliminate or reduce) any
right or protection hereunder of any person in respect of any event, act or
omission occurring prior to the time of such amendment, modification or
repeal, or adoption of any inconsistent provision or, if applicable,
modification of law (regardless of when any Proceeding (or part thereof)
relating to such event, act or omission arises or is first threatened,
commenced or completed). The rights conferred by this _Article 9_
shall inure to the benefit of any Indemnified Person (and shall continue as
to an Indemnified Person who has ceased to be a director or officer) and such
persons legal representatives, executors, administrators, heirs, devises and
legatees. For purposes of this Article, references to "the Corporation" shall
include any constituent corporation absorbed in a merger with this Corporation
which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and
authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so
that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such
constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such
constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall
stand in the same position under this Article with respect to this Corporation
as such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its
separate existence had continued.

10. _Amendment or Repeal of Articles 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 12_. The amendment, alteration or repeal of _Articles 3_ , _5_ , _7_ , _8_ , _9_ , _10_ , or _12_ of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class; all other amendments to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class. 11. _Registered Holders_. The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the person in whose name any share of stock or any warrant, right or option is registered as the owner thereof for all purposes and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to, or interest in, such share, warrant, right or option on the part of any other person, whether or not the Corporation shall have notice thereof, save as may be expressly provided otherwise by law. 

12. _DGCL Section 203_. The Corporation hereby elects to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL.

Transfer of Corporation Securities prior to the Expiration Date and any
attempted Transfer of Corporation Securities pursuant to an agreement entered
into prior to the Expiration Date, subject to the exceptions set forth in
Article 13.C, shall be prohibited and void ab initio to the extent that, as a
result of such Transfer (or any series of related Transfers of which such
Transfer is a part), either (a) any Person or Persons would become a
4.9-percent Shareholder or (b) the Percentage Share Ownership in the
Corporation of any 4.9-percent Shareholder would be (i) increased or (ii)
decreased.

 

C. _Exceptions_. The restrictions set forth in Article 13.B shall not apply to
an attempted Transfer that is a 4.9-percent Transaction if the transferor or
the Transferee obtains the written approval of the Board of Directors or a
duly authorized committee thereof. The Board of Directors shall be deemed to
have consented to any such proposed Transfer within 20 days of receiving
written notice, unless the Board of Directors determines in good faith based
on their reasonable assessment that the proposed Transfer could jeopardize the
realization of the Tax Benefits and the transferor has been notified of
such determination; provided that the Board of Directors may grant such
approval notwithstanding the effect of such approval on the Tax Benefits if it
determines that the approval is in the best interests of the Corporation. The
Board of Directors, to the fullest extent permitted by law, may exercise the
authority granted by this Article 13 through duly authorized officers or
agents of the Corporation. Nothing in this Article 13.C shall be construed to
limit or restrict the Board of Directors in the exercise of its fiduciary
duties under applicable law.

D. _Excess Securities_.

 

(a) No employee or agent of the Corporation shall record any Prohibited
Transfer, and the purported transferee of such a Prohibited Transfer (the
"Purported Transferee") shall not be recognized as a stockholder of the
Corporation for any purpose whatsoever in respect of the Corporation
Securities which are the subject of the Prohibited Transfer (the
"Excess Securities"). Until the Excess Securities are acquired by another
person in a Transfer that is not a Prohibited Transfer, the Purported
Transferee shall not be entitled with respect to such Excess Securities to any
rights of a stockholder of the Corporation, including, without limitation,
the right to vote such Excess Securities and to receive dividends or
distributions, whether liquidating or otherwise, in respect thereof, if any,
and the Excess Securities shall be deemed to remain with the transferor
unless and until the Excess Securities are transferred to the Agent pursuant
to Article 13.E or until an approval is obtained under Article 13.C. After the
Excess Securities have been acquired in a Transfer that is not a Prohibited
Transfer, the Corporation Securities shall cease to be Excess Securities. For
this purpose, any Transfer of Excess Securities not in accordance with the
provisions of Article 13.D or Article 13.E shall also be a Prohibited
Transfer. 

(b) The Corporation may require as a condition to the registration of the
Transfer of any Corporation Securities or the payment of any distribution on
any Corporation Securities that the proposed Transferee or payee furnish to
the Corporation all information reasonably requested by the Corporation with
respect to its direct or indirect ownership interests in such Corporation
Securities. The Corporation may make such arrangements or issue such
instructions to its share transfer agent as may be determined by the Board of Directors to be necessary
or advisable to implement this Article 13, including, without limitation,
authorizing such transfer agent to require an affidavit from a Purported
Transferee regarding such Persons actual and constructive ownership of shares
and other evidence that a Transfer will not be prohibited by this Article 13
as a condition to registering any transfer.

E. _Transfer To Agent_. If the Board of Directors determines that a Transfer
of Corporation Securities constitutes a Prohibited Transfer then, upon written
demand by the Corporation sent to the Purported Transferee within 20 days of
the date on which the Board of Directors determines that the attempted
Transfer would result in Excess Securities, the Purported Transferee shall
transfer or cause to be transferred any certificate or other evidence of
ownership of the Excess Securities within the Purported Transferees
possession or control, together with any Prohibited Distributions, to an
agent designated by the Board of Directors (the " _Agent_ ").

(a) In the case of a Prohibited Transfer described in Article 13.B(b)(i), the
Agent shall thereupon sell to a buyer or buyers (which may include the
Corporation) the Excess Securities transferred to it in one or more
arms-length transactions (on the public securities market on which such
Excess Securities are traded, if possible, or otherwise privately); provided,
however, that any such sale must not constitute a Prohibited Transfer
and provided, further, that the Agent shall effect such sale or sales in an
orderly fashion and shall not be required to effect any such sale within any
specific time frame if, in the Agents discretion, such sale or sales would
disrupt the market for the Corporation Securities or otherwise would
adversely affect the value of the Corporation Securities. If the Purported
Transferee has resold the Excess Securities before receiving the Corporations
demand to surrender Excess Securities to the Agent, the Purported Transferee
shall be deemed to have sold the Excess Securities for the Agent, and shall be
required to transfer to the Agent any Prohibited Distributions and proceeds of
such sale, except to the extent that the Corporation grants written
permission to the Purported Transferee to retain a portion of such sales
proceeds not exceeding the amount that the Purported Transferee would have
received from the Agent pursuant to Article 13.F if the Agent rather than
the Purported Transferee had resold the Excess Securities.

(b) In the case of a Prohibited Transfer described in Article 13.B(b)(ii),
the transferor of such Prohibited Transfer (the "Purported Transferor") shall
also deliver to the Agent the sales proceeds from the Prohibited Transfer (in
the form received, i.e., whether in cash or other property), and the Agent
shall thereupon sell any non-cash consideration to a buyer or buyers in one or
more arms-length transactions (including over a national securities exchange,
if possible). If the Purported Transferee is determinable (other than
with respect to a transaction entered into through the facilities of a
national securities exchange), the Agent shall, to the extent possible, return
the Prohibited Distributions to the Purported Transferor, and shall reimburse
the Purported Transferee from the sales proceeds received from the Purported
Transferor (or the proceeds from the disposition of any non-cash
consideration) for the cost of any Excess Securities returned in accordance
with Article 13.F. If the Purported Transferee is not determinable, or to the
extent the Excess Securities have been resold and thus cannot be returned to
the Purported Transferor, the Agent shall use the proceeds to acquire on
behalf of the Purported Transferor, in one or more arms-length transactions
(including over a national securities exchange on which the Corporation
Securities may be traded, if possible), an equal amount of Corporation
Securities in replacement of the Excess Securities sold; provided, however,
that, to the extent the amount of proceeds is not sufficient to fund the
purchase price of such Corporation Securities and the Agents costs and
expenses (as described in Article 13.F), the Purported Transferor shall
promptly fund such amounts upon demand by the Agent. F. _Application Of Proceeds And Prohibited Distributions_. The Agent shall
apply any proceeds of a sale by it of Excess Securities and, if the Purported
Transferee has previously resold the Excess Securities, any amounts received
by it from a Purported Transferee, together, in either case, with any
Prohibited Distributions, as follows: (a) first, such amounts shall be paid
to the Agent to the extent necessary to cover its costs and expenses incurred
in connection with its duties hereunder; (b) second, any remaining amounts
shall be paid to the Purported Transferee, up to the amount paid by the
Purported Transferee for the Excess Securities (or in the event the purported
Transfer of the Excess Securities was, in whole or in part, a gift,
inheritance or similar Prohibited Transfer without consideration, the fair
market value, (1) calculated on the basis of the closing market price for the
Corporation Securities on the day before the Prohibited Transfer or, (2) if
the Corporation Securities are not listed or admitted to trading on any stock
exchange but are traded in the over-the-counter market, calculated based upon
the difference between the highest bid and lowest asked prices, as such prices
are reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers through its
NASDAQ system or any successor system on the day before the Prohibited
Transfer or, if none, on the last preceding day for which such quotations
exist, or (3) if the Corporation Securities are neither listed nor admitted to
trading on any stock exchange nor traded in the over-the-counter market, then
as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, which amount shall be
determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors); and (c) third, any
remaining amounts shall be paid to one or more organizations qualifying under
section 501(c)(3) of the Code (or any comparable successor provision) selected
by the Board of Directors. The Purported Transferee of Excess Securities shall
have no claim, cause of action or any other recourse whatsoever against any
transferor of Excess Securities. The Purported Transferees sole right with
respect to such shares shall be limited to the amount payable to the Purported
Transferee pursuant to this Article 13.F. In no event shall the proceeds of
any sale of Excess Securities pursuant to this Article 13.F inure to the
benefit of the Corporation or the Agent, except to the extent used to cover
costs and expenses incurred by the Agent in performing its duties hereunder.

G. _Modification Of Remedies For Certain Indirect Transfers_. In the event of
any Transfer which does not involve a transfer of securities of the
Corporation within the meaning of Delaware law ("Securities," and
individually, a "Security") but which would cause a 4.9-percent Shareholder to
violate a restriction on Transfers provided for in this Article 13, the
application of Article 13.E and Article 13.F shall be modified as described in
this Article 13.G.

 

(a) In such case where the Prohibited Transfer is described in Article
13.B(b)(i), no such 4.9-percent Shareholder shall be required to dispose of
any interest that is not a Security, but such 4.9-percent Shareholder and/or
any Person whose ownership of Securities is attributed to such 4.9-percent
Shareholder shall be deemed to have disposed of and shall be required to
dispose of sufficient Securities (which Securities shall be disposed of in
the inverse order in which they were acquired) to cause such 4.9-percent
Shareholder, following such disposition, not to be in violation of this
Article 13. Such disposition shall be deemed to occur simultaneously with the
Transfer giving rise to the application of this provision, and such number of
Securities that are deemed to be disposed of shall be considered Excess
Securities and shall be disposed of through the Agent as provided in Article 13.E and Article 13.F, except that
the maximum aggregate amount payable either to such 4.9-percent Shareholder,
or to such other Person that was the direct holder of such Excess Securities,
in connection with such sale shall be the fair market value of such Excess
Securities at the time of the purported Transfer. All expenses incurred by
the Agent in disposing of such Excess Securities shall be paid out of any
amounts due such 4.9-percent Shareholder or such other Person.

(b) In such case where the Prohibited Transfer is described in Article
13.B(b)(ii), no such 4.9-percent Shareholder shall be required to acquire any
interest that is not a Security, but such 4.9-percent Shareholder and/or any
Person whose ownership of Securities is attributed to such 4.9-percent
Shareholder shall be deemed to have acquired and shall be required to acquire
sufficient Securities (which Securities shall be acquired in the
inverse order in which they were disposed of) to cause such 4.9-percent
Shareholder, following such acquisition, not to be in violation of this
Article 13. Such acquisition shall be deemed to occur simultaneously with the
Transfer giving rise to the application of this provision, and such number of
Securities that are deemed to be acquired shall be considered acquired through
the Agent as provided in Article 13.E. All expenses incurred by the Agent in
acquiring such Securities shall be paid out of any amounts due such
4.9-percent Shareholder or such other Person.

The purpose of this Article 13.G is to extend the restrictions in Article
13.B and Article 13.E to situations in which there is a 4.9-percent
Transaction without a direct Transfer of Securities, and this Article 13.G,
along with the other provisions of this Article 13, shall be interpreted to
produce the same results, with differences as the context requires, as a
direct Transfer of Corporation Securities.

H. _Legal Proceedings; Prompt Enforcement_. If the Purported Transferee fails
to surrender the Excess Securities or the proceeds of a sale thereof or the
Purported Transferor fails to surrender the sale proceeds from the Prohibited
Transfer to the Agent within thirty days from the date on which the
Corporation makes a written demand pursuant to Article 13.E, then the
Corporation shall promptly take all cost effective actions which it believes
are appropriate to enforce the provisions hereof, including the institution
of legal proceedings to compel the surrender. Nothing in this Article 13.H
shall (i) be deemed inconsistent with any Transfer of the Excess Securities
provided in this Article 13 being void ab initio, (ii) preclude
the Corporation in its discretion from immediately bringing legal proceedings
without a prior demand or (iii) cause any failure of the Corporation to act
within the time periods set forth in Article 13.E to constitute a waiver or
loss of any right of the Corporation under this Article 13. The Board of
Directors may authorize such additional actions as it deems advisable to give
effect to the provisions of this Article 13.

 

I. _Obligation To Provide Information_. As a condition to the registration of
the Transfer of any Corporation Securities, any Person who is a beneficial,
legal or record holder of Corporation Securities, and any proposed Transferee
and any Person controlling, controlled by or under common control with the
proposed Transferee, shall provide such information as the Corporation
may reasonably request from time to time in order to determine compliance
with this Article 13 or the status of the Tax Benefits of the Corporation and
the Corporation shall keep such information confidential. J. _Legends_. The Board of Directors shall require that any certificates
issued by the Corporation evidencing ownership of Corporation Securities that
are subject to the restrictions on transfer and ownership contained in this
Article 13 bear the following legend:

"THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION (THE " _CERTIFICATE OF
INCORPORATION_ "), OF THE CORPORATION CONTAINS RESTRICTIONS PROHIBITING THE
TRANSFER (AS DEFINED IN THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION) OF STOCK OF THE
CORPORATION (INCLUDING THE CREATION OR GRANT OF CERTAIN OPTIONS, RIGHTS AND
WARRANTS) WITHOUT THE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE
CORPORATION (THE " _BOARD OF DIRECTORS_ ") IF SUCH TRANSFER AFFECTS THE
PERCENTAGE OF STOCK OF THE CORPORATION (WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 382 OF
THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED (THE "CODE") AND THE TREASURY
REGULATIONS PROMULGATED THEREUNDER), THAT IS TREATED AS OWNED BY A 4.9
PERCENT SHAREHOLDER (AS DEFINED IN THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION). IF THE
TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS ARE VIOLATED, THEN THE TRANSFER WILL BE VOID AB INITIO
AND, AS APPLICABLE, EITHER (I) THE PURPORTED TRANSFEREE OF THE SHARES WILL BE
REQUIRED TO TRANSFER EXCESS SECURITIES (AS DEFINED IN THE CERTIFICATE OF
INCORPORATION) TO THE CORPORATIONS AGENT OR (II) THE PURPORTED TRANSFEROR OF
THE SHARES WILL BE REQUIRED TO SURRENDER THE SALE PROCEEDS OF THE PROHIBITED
TRANSFER TO THE CORPORATIONS AGENT AND THE CORPORATIONS AGENT SHALL USE SUCH
PROCEEDS TO ACQUIRE ON BEHALF OF THE PURPORTED TRANSFEROR AN AMOUNT OF SHARES
IN REPLACEMENT OF THE EXCESS SECURITIES (AS DEFINED IN THE CERTIFICATE OF
INCORPORATION) SOLD BY THE PURPORTED TRANSFEROR. IN THE EVENT OF A TRANSFER
WHICH DOES NOT INVOLVE SECURITIES OF THE CORPORATION WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE
GENERAL CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE (" _SECURITIES_ ") BUT
WHICH WOULD VIOLATE THE TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, AS APPLICABLE, EITHER (A) THE
PURPORTED TRANSFEREE (OR THE RECORD OWNER) OF THE SECURITIES WILL BE REQUIRED
TO TRANSFER SUFFICIENT SECURITIES PURSUANT TO THE TERMS PROVIDED FOR IN THE
CORPORATIONS CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO CAUSE THE 4.9 PERCENT
SHAREHOLDER TO NO LONGER BE IN VIOLATION OF THE TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS OR (B)
THE PURPORTED TRANSFEROR OF THE SECURITIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO ACQUIRE
SUFFICIENT SECURITIES PURSUANT TO THE TERMS PROVIDED FOR IN THE CORPORATIONS
CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO CAUSE THE 4.9 PERCENT SHAREHOLDER TO NO LONGER
BE IN VIOLATION OF THE TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS. THE CORPORATION WILL FURNISH
WITHOUT CHARGE TO THE HOLDER OF RECORD OF THIS CERTIFICATE A COPY OF THE
CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, CONTAINING THE ABOVE-REFERENCED TRANSFER
RESTRICTIONS, UPON WRITTEN REQUEST TO THE CORPORATION AT ITS PRINCIPAL PLACE
OF BUSINESS."

 

K. _Authority Of Board Of Directors_. The Board of Directors shall have the
power to determine all matters necessary for assessing compliance with this
Article 13, including, without limitation, (i) the identification of
4.9-percent Shareholders, (ii) whether a Transfer is a 4.9-percent Transaction or a Prohibited Transfer, (iii) the Percentage Share
Ownership in the Corporation of any 4.9-percent Shareholder, (iv) whether an
instrument constitutes a Corporation Security, and (v) the amount (or fair
market value) due to a Purported Transferee pursuant to Article 13.F. In
addition, the Board of Directors may, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, from time to time and subject to the terms hereof and thereof, establish,
modify, amend or rescind by-laws, regulations and procedures of the
Corporation not inconsistent with the provisions of this Article 13 for
purposes of determining whether any Transfer of Corporation Securities would
jeopardize the Corporations ability to preserve and use the Tax Benefits and
for the orderly application, administration and implementation of this
Article 13.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event of a change in
law making one or more of the following actions necessary or desirable, the
Board of Directors may, by adopting a written resolution, (i) modify the
ownership interest percentage in the Corporation or the Persons or groups
covered by this Article 13, (ii) modify the definitions of any terms set
forth in this Article 13 (other than the term "Expiration Date") or (iii)
modify the terms of this Article 13 (other than the Expiration Date) as
appropriate, in each case, in order to prevent an ownership change for
purposes of Section 382 of the Code as a result of any changes in applicable
Treasury Regulations or otherwise; provided, however, that the Board of
Directors shall not cause there to be such modification unless it determines,
by adopting a written resolution, that such action is reasonably necessary or
advisable to preserve the Tax Benefits or that the continuation of these
restrictions is no longer reasonably necessary for the preservation of the Tax
Benefits. Stockholders of the Corporation shall be notified of such
determination through a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or
such other method of notice as the Secretary of the Corporation shall deem
appropriate.

 

In the case of an ambiguity in the application of any of the provisions of
this Article 13, including any definition used herein, the Board of Directors
shall have the power to determine the application of such provisions with
respect to any situation based on its reasonable belief, understanding or
knowledge of the circumstances. In the event this Article 13 requires an
action by the Board of Directors but fails to provide specific guidance with
respect to such action, the Board of Directors shall have the power to
determine the action to be taken so long as such action is not contrary to the
provisions of this Article 13. All such actions, calculations,
interpretations and determinations which are done or made by the Board of
Directors in good faith shall be conclusive and binding on the Corporation,
the Agent, and all other parties for all other purposes of this Article 13.
The Board of Directors may delegate all or any portion of its duties and
powers under this Article 13 to a committee of the Board of Directors as it
deems necessary or advisable and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, may
exercise the authority granted by this Article 13 through duly authorized
officers or agents of the Corporation. Nothing in this Article 13 shall be
construed to limit or restrict the Board of Directors in the exercise of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law.

L. _Reliance_. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Corporation and the
members of the Board of Directors shall be fully protected in relying in good
faith upon the information, opinions, reports or statements of the chief
executive officer, the chief financial officer, the chief accounting officer
or the corporate controller of the Corporation and the Corporations legal
counsel, independent auditors, transfer agent, investment bankers or other
employees and agents in making the determinations and findings contemplated by
this Article 13\. The members of the Board of Directors shall not be responsible for any
good faith errors made in connection therewith. For purposes of determining
the existence and identity of, and the amount of any Corporation Securities
owned by any stockholder, the Corporation is entitled to rely on the existence
and absence of filings of Schedule 13D or 13G under the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (or similar filings), as of any date, subject
to its actual knowledge of the ownership of Corporation Securities.

M. _Benefits Of This Article 13_. Nothing in this Article 13 shall be
construed to give to any Person other than the Corporation or the Agent any
legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Article 13. This Article
13 shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Corporation and the
Agent.

N.  _Severability_. The purpose of this Article 13 is to facilitate the
Corporations ability to maintain or preserve its Tax Benefits. If any
provision of this Article 13 or the application of any such provision to any
Person or under any circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provision of this Article 13.

 

O. _Waiver_. With regard to any power, remedy or right provided herein or
otherwise available to the Corporation or the Agent under this Article 13,
(a) no waiver will be effective unless expressly contained in a writing signed
by the waiving party; and (b) no alteration, modification or impairment will
be implied by reason of any previous waiver, extension of time, delay or
omission in exercise, or other indulgence.

BYLAWS

OF

 

DEX MEDIA INC.

_A Delaware corporation_

(Adopted as of [], 2012)

 

ARTICLE I __

 

 _OFFICES_

 

Section 1\. _Offices_. Dex Media, Inc. (the " _Corporation_ ") may have an
office or offices other than its registered office at such place or places,
either within or outside the State of Delaware, as the Board of Directors of
the Corporation (the " _Board of Directors_ ") may from time to time determine
or the business of the Corporation may require.

ARTICLE II __

_MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS_

Section 1\. _Place of Meetings_. The Board of Directors may designate a
place, if any, either within or outside the State of Delaware, as the place of
meeting for any annual meeting or for any special meeting.

Section 2\. _Annual Meeting_. An annual meeting of the stockholders shall be
held each year at such time as is specified by the Board of Directors. At the
annual meeting, stockholders shall elect directors to succeed those whose
terms expire and transact such other business as properly may be brought
before the annual meeting pursuant to Section 11 of Article II.

Section 3\. _Special Meetings_.

(a) Special meetings of the stockholders for any purpose or purposes, except
as otherwise prescribed by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation, may
be called (i) by a majority of the directors in office, the Chairman of the
Board, the Chief Executive Officer or the President, (ii) pursuant to a
resolution adopted by the Board of Directors, or (iii) by the Secretary at the
request in writing of stockholders holding shares representing at least 25% of
the voting power of shares of stock issued and outstanding and entitled to
vote on the matter(s) and for the purposes stated in the written request of
such stockholders. A written request submitted by a stockholder to call a
special meeting shall set forth the business to be transacted at such meeting
and shall be signed and dated by the stockholder submitting such written
request. A written request submitted by a stockholder to call a special
meeting shall also include all of the information that is required of a
stockholder submitting notice of business under Article II, Section 11(a) of
these Bylaws in connection with an annual meeting of stockholders. The
preceding sentence shall not apply to any stockholder that has provided a
request in response to a solicitation made pursuant to, and in accordance
with, Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act (as defined herein) by way of a
solicitation statement filed on Schedule 14A. The Secretary shall  not accept, and shall consider ineffective, a written request from a
stockholder to call a special meeting: (1) that relates to an item of business
that is not a proper subject for stockholder action under applicable law; (2)
if such written request to call a special meeting is delivered between the
time beginning on the 61st day after the earliest date of signature on a
written request to call a special meeting, that has been delivered to the
Secretary, relating to an identical or substantially similar item (such item,
a "Similar Item") and ending on the one-year anniversary of such earliest
date; (3) if a Similar Item will be submitted for stockholder approval at any
stockholder meeting to be held on or before the 90th day after the Secretary
receives such written request to call a special meeting; or (4) if a Similar
Item has been presented at the most recent annual meeting or at any special
meeting held within one year prior to receipt by the Secretary of such written
request to call a special meeting. A stockholder may revoke a request to call
a special meeting at any time before the special meeting by sending
written notice of such revocation to the Secretary of the Corporation. The
Corporation shall not be required to hold a special meeting if, prior to such
meeting, the number of unrevoked written requests constitutes less than 25% of
the stockholders who were entitled to request the call of such special
meeting. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for purposes of
determining the stockholders entitled to deliver requests to call a special
meeting (whether or not a written request has been delivered by a stockholder
prior to such record date). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of
Directors may submit its own proposal or proposals for consideration at any
special meeting.

 

(b) Special meetings of the stockholders shall only be held at such time and
at such place, within or without the State of Delaware, as shall be
designated by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief
Executive Officer or the President. The Board of Directors may, in its sole
discretion, determine that the special meeting shall not be held at any place,
but shall be held solely by means of remote communication, subject to such
guidelines and procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt, as permitted by
applicable law. The business transacted at a special meeting of the
stockholders shall be limited to the purpose or purposes stated in the notice
of the meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors
pursuant to Section 11(c) of this Article II may be made at a special meeting
of stockholders called by stockholders at which directors are to be elected;
provided that, notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, if a
stockholder delivered a written request to call such meeting, the information
required by Section 11(c) of Article II regarding such stockholder and his or
her nominees must be delivered at the time the stockholder requests a special
meeting (which information shall be updated as of the record date to determine
the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting not later than 10 days after
such record date). The record date for determining the stockholders entitled
to notice of, and to vote at, a special meeting shall be fixed in the manner
set forth in Section 12 of this Article II.

 

Section 4\. _Notice of Meetings_. Notice of the place, if any, date, and time
of all meetings of the stockholders, the means of remote communications, if
any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in
person and vote at such meeting, and the record date for determining the
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, if such date is different from
the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of the
meeting, shall be given, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the
date on which the meeting is to be held, to each stockholder entitled to vote
at such meeting as of the record date for determining the stockholders
entitled to notice of the meeting, except as otherwise provided herein or
required by law (meaning, here and hereinafter, as required from time to time
by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") or
the Corporations certificate of incorporation as then in effect (the "
_Certificate of Incorporation_ ")).

 



-2 -  (a) _Form of Notice_. All such notices shall be delivered in writing or by a
form of electronic transmission if receipt thereof has been consented to by
the stockholder to whom the notice is given. If mailed, such notice shall be
deemed given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid,
addressed to the stockholder at his, her or its address as the same appears
on the records of the Corporation. If given by facsimile telecommunication,
such notice shall be deemed given when directed to a number at which the
stockholder has consented to receive notice by facsimile. Subject to the
limitations of Section 4(c) of this Article II, if given by electronic
transmission, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered: (i) by electronic
mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder
has consented to receive notice; (ii) if by a posting on an electronic network
together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting,
upon the later of (x) such posting and (y) the giving of such separate
notice; and (iii) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when
directed to the stockholder. An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant
secretary of the Corporation, the transfer agent of the Corporation or any
other agent of the Corporation that the notice has been given shall, in the
absence of fraud, be _prima facie_ evidence of the facts stated therein.

(b) _Waiver of Notice_. Whenever notice is required to be given under any
provisions of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a
written waiver thereof, signed by the stockholder entitled to notice, or a
waiver by electronic transmission by the person or entity entitled to notice,
whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to
notice. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any
meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation need be specified in any waiver
of notice of such meeting. Attendance of a stockholder of the Corporation at a
meeting of such stockholders shall constitute a waiver of notice of such
meeting, except when the stockholder attends for the express purpose of
objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business
because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

 

(c) _Notice by Electronic Delivery_. Without limiting the manner by which
notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders of the Corporation
pursuant to the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any
notice to stockholders of the Corporation given by the Corporation under any
provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws
shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to
by the stockholder of the Corporation to whom the notice is given. Any such
consent shall be deemed revoked if: (i) the Corporation is unable to deliver
by electronic transmission two (2) consecutive notices given by the
Corporation in accordance with such consent; and (ii) such inability becomes
known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of the Corporation or to the
transfer agent or other person responsible for the giving of notice. However,
the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not
invalidate any meeting or other action. For purposes of these Bylaws, except
as otherwise limited by applicable law, the term "electronic transmission"
means any form of communication not directly involving the physical
transmission of paper that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved
and reviewed by a recipient thereof and that may be directly reproduced in
paper form by such recipient through an automated process.

 



-3 -  Section 5\. _List of Stockholders_. The officer who has charge of the stock
ledger of the Corporation shall prepare and make available, at least 10 days
before each meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders
entitled to vote at the meeting; provided, however, that if the record date
for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than 10 days before
the meeting date, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as
of the 10th day before the meeting date, arranged in alphabetical order and
showing the address of each such stockholder and the number of shares
registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the
examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during
ordinary business hours, for a period of at least 10 days prior to the
meeting: (a) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the
information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice
of the meeting, or (b) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place
of business of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation determines to
make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take
reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to
stockholders of the Corporation. The list shall also be produced and kept at
the time and place, if any, of the meeting during the whole time thereof and
may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.

 

Section 6\. _Quorum_. The holders of a majority of the outstanding voting
power of all shares of capital stock entitled to vote, present in person or
represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the
stockholders for all purposes, unless or except to the extent that the
presence of a larger number may be required by the DGCL, the Certificate
of Incorporation or the rules of any stock exchange upon which the
Corporations securities are listed. If a quorum is not present, the chairman
of the meeting or the holders of a majority of the voting power present in
person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote at the
meeting may adjourn the meeting to another time and/or place. When a specified
item of business requires a separate vote by a class or series (if the
Corporation shall then have outstanding shares of more than one class or
series) voting as a class or series, the holders of a majority of the voting
power of such class or series shall constitute a quorum (as to such class or
series) for the transaction of such item of business.

 

Section 7\. _Adjourned Meetings_. Any meeting of the stockholders may be
adjourned by the chairman of the meeting, from time to time, whether or not
there is a quorum. When a meeting is adjourned to another time and place,
notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if
any, thereof and the means of remote communications, if any, by
which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and
vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the
adjournment is taken; provided, however, that if the adjournment is for more
than 30 days, a notice of the place, if any, date and time of the adjourned
meeting and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders
and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such
adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to
vote at the meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date for
stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board of
Directors shall fix a new record date for notice of such adjourned meeting,
which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing
the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and, except as otherwise
required by law, shall not be more than 60 days nor less than 10 days before
the date of such adjourned meeting, and shall give notice of the adjourned
meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such adjourned
meeting as of the record date fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting. At
the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business which might
have been transacted at the original meeting.

 



-4 -  Section 8\. _Vote Required_. When a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of
the majority of voting power of capital stock present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter
shall be the act of the stockholders, unless a different vote is provided by
express provisions of an applicable law, the rules of any stock exchange upon
which the Corporations securities are listed, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these Bylaws, in which case such express provision shall
govern and control the decision of such question. 

Section 9\. _Voting Rights_. Except as otherwise required by the DGCL, the

relating to any outstanding class or series of preferred stock), every
stockholder shall at every meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one vote
in person or by proxy for each share of capital stock held by

Section 10\. _Proxies_.

(a) Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may
authorize another person or persons to act for him or her by proxy, but no
such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after one year from its date, unless
the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be
irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as,
it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an
irrevocable power. A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of whether the
interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an
interest in the Corporation generally.

 

(b) Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another
person to act for such stockholder as proxy, the following shall constitute a
valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority: (1) execution of
a proxy may be accomplished by the stockholder or such stockholders
authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such writing
or causing such persons signature to be affixed to such writing by any
reasonable means, including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature; and
(2) a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such
stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of an
electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or
to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent
duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive
such transmission, provided that any such electronic transmission must either
set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined
that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder.

(c) Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of the writing or
transmission authorizing another person or persons to act as proxy for a
stockholder may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or
transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or
transmission could be used; provided that such copy, facsimile or other
reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing
or transmission.

Section 12\. _Fixing a Record Date for Stockholder Meetings_. In order that
the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of any
meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may

record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the
record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall
not be more than 60 days nor less than 10 days before the date of such
meeting. If the Board of Directors so fixes a date, such date shall also be
the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such
meeting unless the Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes such
record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be
the date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the
Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to
notice of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is first given,

-10 -   Directors may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders
entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting; and in such case shall also fix as
the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting
the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders
entitled to vote in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section
11 of this ARTICLE II at the adjourned meeting. 

Section 13\. _Conduct of Meetings_.

(a) _Generally_. Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the
Chairman of the Board of Directors, or in the Chairmans absence or disability
by the Chief Executive Officer, or in the Chief Executive Officers absence
or disability, by the President, or in the Presidents absence or disability,
by the Chief Financial Officer. The Secretary shall act as secretary of the
meeting, but in the Secretarys absence or disability the chairman of the
meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.

(b) _Rules, Regulations and Procedures_. The Board of Directors may adopt by
resolution such rules, regulations and procedures for the conduct of any
meeting of stockholders of the Corporation as it shall deem appropriate,
including, without limitation, such guidelines and procedures as it may deem
appropriate regarding the participation by means of remote communication of
stockholders and proxyholders not physically present at a meeting. Except to
the extent inconsistent with such rules, regulations and procedures as
adopted by the Board of Directors, the chairman of any meeting of stockholders
shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and
procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman,
are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules,
regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or
prescribed by the chairman of the meeting, may include, without limitation,
the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for
the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting
and the safety of those present; (iii) limitations on attendance at or
participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation,
their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as shall

for the commencement thereof; and (v) limitations on the time allotted to
questions or comments by participants. Unless and to the extent determined by
the Board of Directors or the chairman of the meeting, meetings of
stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of
parliamentary procedure. The chairman of the meeting shall announce at the
meeting when the polls for each matter to be voted upon at the meeting will be
opened and closed. After the polls close, no ballots, proxies or votes or
any revocations or changes thereto may be accepted. The chairman shall have
the power to adjourn the meeting to another place, if any, date and time.

(c) _Inspectors of Elections_. The Corporation may, and to the extent required
by law shall, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more
inspectors of election to act at the meeting and make a written report
thereof. One or more other persons may be designated as alternate inspectors
to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is
able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall
appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Unless otherwise
required by law, inspectors may be officers, employees or agents of the
Corporation. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of such
inspectors duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the
duties of

 



-11 -   inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of such
inspectors ability. The inspector shall have the duties prescribed by law and
shall take charge of the polls and, when the vote is completed, shall make a
certificate of the result of the vote taken and of such other facts as may be
required by law.

Section 14\. _Voting by Fiduciaries, Pledgors and Joint Owners_. Persons
holding voting stock in a fiduciary capacity shall be entitled to vote the
shares so held, and persons whose stock is pledged shall be entitled to vote
such shares, unless in the transfer by the pledgor on the books of the
Corporation such pledgor has expressly empowered the pledgee to vote such
shares, in which case only the pledgee or such pledgees proxy may represent
said stock and vote thereon. If voting stock is held of record in the names of
two or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint
tenants, tenants-in-common, tenants by the entirety or otherwise, or if two
or more persons have the same fiduciary relationship respecting the same
shares, unless the Secretary is given written notice to the contrary and is
furnished with a copy of the instrument or order appointing them or creating
the relationship wherein it is so provided, their acts with respect to voting
shall have the following effect: (a) if only one votes, such act binds all;
(b) if more than one votes, the act of the majority so voting binds all; (c)
if more than one votes, but the vote is evenly split on any particular
matter, each faction may vote such stock proportionally, or any person voting
the shares, or a beneficiary, if any, may apply to the Court of Chancery or
such other court as may have jurisdiction to appoint an additional person to
act with the persons so voting the stock, which shall then be voted as
determined by a majority of such persons and the person appointed by such
court. If the instrument so filed shows that any such tenancy is held in
unequal interest, a majority or even-split for the purpose of this paragraph
shall be a majority or even-split in interest.

 

Section 15\. _Method of Voting_. The vote at any election or upon any question
at any meeting of stockholders need not be by written ballot, except as
required by law.

ARTICLE III __

 

 _DIRECTORS_

 

Section 1\. _General Powers_. The business and affairs of the Corporation
shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors. In
addition to such powers as are herein and in the Certificate of Incorporation
expressly conferred upon it, the Board of Directors shall have and may
exercise all the powers of the Corporation, subject to the provisions of
the laws of the State of Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation and these
Bylaws.

Section 2\. _Number and Election_. 

(a) Subject to Section 14 of this Article III, the number of directors
constituting the entire Board of Directors, which shall be not less than
three directors, shall be fixed from time to time solely by a resolution
passed by a majority of the entire Board of Directors. Subject to the terms of
any Preferred Stock of the Corporation then outstanding, directors shall be
elected at each annual meeting of stockholders. Subject to Section 14 of this
Article III and subject to the terms of any Preferred Stock of the Corporation
then outstanding, newly created directorships resulting from any increase in
the authorized number of directors or any vacancies in the Board of Directors
resulting from death, resignation, removal from office or

 



-12 -   other cause may, unless otherwise required by law or by resolution of the
Board of Directors, be filled by a majority vote of the directors then in
office, though less than a quorum. Each director elected shall hold office
until such directors successor is elected and qualified or until such
directors earlier death, resignation or removal.

(b) Each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes
cast with respect to the director at an annual meeting of stockholders at
which a quorum is present; _provided_ that if, as of the tenth day before the
Corporation first mails its notice of meeting for the meeting to elect
directors, the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be
elected, the directors shall be elected by the votes of the plurality of
the shares represented in person or by proxy at such annual meeting and
entitled to vote on the election of directors. A majority of the votes cast in
an election of a director shall mean that the number of votes cast "for" a
directors election must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that
directors election and, shares not present, "broker nonvotes" and shares
voting "abstain" or "abstentions" shall not be counted as a vote cast either
"for" or "against" a directors election for purposes of determining whether a
nominee for director has received a majority of the votes cast. Elections of
directors need not be by written ballot.

 

(c) If a nominee for director who is an incumbent director is not elected, the
director shall promptly tender such directors resignation to the Board of
Directors. The Corporate Governance Committee will make a recommendation to
the Board of Directors as to whether to accept or reject the resignation of
such incumbent director, or whether other action should be taken. The Board
of Directors will act on the Corporate Governance Committees recommendation
and publicly disclose (by a press release, a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission or other broadly disseminated means of communication)
its decision regarding the tendered resignation and the rationale behind the
decision within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election
results. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate
in the Corporate Governance Committees recommendation or the Board of
Directors decision with respect to his or her resignation. In addition, if
there are not at least two members of the Corporate Governance Committee who
were elected at the annual meeting, then each of the independent members of
the Board of Directors who were elected at the meeting shall appoint a
committee amongst themselves to consider all resignations tendered and
recommend to the Board of Directors whether to accept them (which committee
of the independent members shall act in lieu of the Corporate Governance
Committee with respect to the resignations tendered in such circumstances).

(d) If the incumbent directors resignation is not accepted by the Board of
Directors, such director shall continue to serve until the next annual meeting
and until such directors successor is elected and qualified or such
directors earlier death resignation or removal. If the Board of Directors
accepts a directors resignation pursuant to this _Section 2_, or if a
nominee for director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent
director, the Board of Directors may fill the resulting vacancy.

Section 3\. _Annual Meetings_. The annual meeting of the Board of Directors
shall be held, without other notice than this Bylaw, immediately after, and at
the same place as, the annual meeting of stockholders.

 



-13 -  Section 4\. _Regular Meetings and Special Meetings_. Regular meetings, other
than the annual meeting, of the Board of Directors may be held without notice
at such time and at such place as shall from time to time be determined by
resolution of the Board of Directors and publicized among all directors.
Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman of
the Board, if any, or upon the written request of at least a majority of the
directors then in office.

Section 5\. _Notice of Meetings_. Notice of regular meetings of the Board of
Directors need not be given except as otherwise required by law or these
Bylaws. Notice of each special meeting of the Board of Directors, and of each
regular and annual meeting of the Board of Directors for which notice shall be
required, shall be given by the Secretary as hereinafter provided in this
Section 5 of this Article III, in which notice shall be stated the time and
place of the meeting. Notice of any special meeting, and of any regular or
annual meeting for which notice is required, shall be given to each director
at least (a) twenty-four (24) hours before the meeting if by telephone or by
being personally delivered or sent by telex, telecopy, email or similar means
or (b) five (5) days before the meeting if delivered by mail to the directors
residence or usual place of business. Such notice shall be deemed to be
delivered when deposited in the United States mail so addressed, with postage
prepaid, or when transmitted if sent by telex, telecopy, email or similar
means. Notice of a meeting of the Board of Directors shall state the purpose
or purposes thereof and no other business may come before the meeting except
if the directors present and voting at the meeting constitute at least 66 2/3%
of the persons who are then directors and entitled to vote on whatever
business may come before the meeting, and such directors agree upon such
matters to be discussed and/or transacted at such special meeting. Any
director may waive notice of any meeting by a writing signed by the director
or by electronic transmission from the director entitled to the notice and
filed with the minutes or corporate records.

Section 6\. _Waiver of Notice and Presumption of Assent_. Any member of the
Board of Directors or any committee thereof who is present at a meeting shall
be conclusively presumed to have waived notice of such meeting except when
such member attends for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of
the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened. Such member shall be conclusively presumed to
have assented to any action taken unless his or her dissent shall be entered
in the minutes of the meeting or unless his or her written dissent to such
action shall be filed with the person acting as the secretary of the meeting
before the adjournment thereof or shall be forwarded by registered mail to the
secretary of the Corporation immediately after the adjournment of the
meeting. Such right to dissent shall not apply to any member who voted in

Section 7\. _Chairman of the Board, Quorum, Required Vote and Adjournment_.
Subject to Section 14 of this ARTICLE III, the Board of Directors may elect,
by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the directors then in
office (in addition to any other vote required by applicable law), a Chairman
of the Board. The Chairman of the Board may be an officer of the Corporation
and shall be a director of the Corporation. Subject to the provisions of
these Bylaws and the direction of the Board of Directors, he or she shall
perform all duties and have all powers which are commonly incident to the
position of Chairman of the Board or which are delegated to him or her by the
Board of Directors, shall preside at all meetings of the stockholders and
Board

 



-14 -  of Directors at which he or she is present and shall have such powers and
perform such duties as the Board of Directors may from time to time
prescribe. If the Chairman of the Board is not present at a meeting of the
stockholders or the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer (if the
Chief Executive Officer is a director and is not also the Chairman of the
Board) shall preside at such meeting, and, if the Chief Executive Officer is
not present at such meeting, a majority of the directors present at such
meeting shall elect one of the directors present at the meeting to so preside.
A majority of the directors then in office shall constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business; provided, however, that if a majority of the
directors then in office constitute less than one-third of the total number of
directors, then one-third of the total number of directors shall constitute a
quorum. Unless by express provision of an applicable law, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these Bylaws a different vote is required, the affirmative
vote of a majority of directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is
present shall be the act of the Board of Directors. At any meeting of the
Board of Directors, business shall be transacted in such order and manner as
the Board of Directors may from time to time determine. If a quorum shall not
be present at any meeting of the Board of Directors, a majority of the
directors present thereat may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, adjourn
the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the
meeting, until a quorum shall be present.

Section 8\. _Committees_. The Board of Directors (a) may, by resolution
passed by a majority of the directors then in office (in addition to any
other vote required by applicable law), designate one or more committees,
consisting of one or more of the directors of the Corporation, including but
not limited to a standing Audit and Finance Committee, Compensation and
Benefits Committee and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of
Directors, and (b) shall, by resolution passed by a majority of the directors
then in office (in addition to any other vote required by applicable law),
designate all committees required by, and maintain such committees in
compliance with, the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and of any exchange on which any securities of the Corporation are
listed. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as
alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified
member at any meeting of the committee. Each such committee, to the extent
provided in the resolution creating it, shall have and may exercise all the
powers and authority of the Board of Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no Committee shall have the power to: (i) approve or adopt, or recommend to
stockholders, any action or matter expressly required by the Delaware General
Corporation Law to be submitted to stockholders for approval; (ii) change the
number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors; (iii) fill any
vacancy on the Board of Directors or any Committee; or (iv) adopt, amend or
repeal these Bylaws. Each such committee shall serve at the pleasure of the
Board of Directors as may be determined from time to time by resolution
adopted by the Board of Directors or as required by the rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and of such exchange, if applicable.
Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and report the same
to the Board of Directors upon request.

 

Section 9\. _Committee Rules_. Each committee of the Board of Directors may
fix its own rules of procedure and shall hold its meetings as provided by
such rules, except as may otherwise be provided by a resolution of the Board
of Directors designating such committee or as otherwise provided herein or
required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation. Notice of each meeting
of a Committee shall be given (or waived) in the same manner as notice for a
Board of Directors meeting may be given (or waived). Unless otherwise
provided in such a resolution, the

 



-15 -  presence of at least a majority of the members of the committee shall be
necessary to constitute a quorum. All matters shall be determined by a
majority vote of the members present. Unless otherwise provided in such a
resolution, in the event that a member and that members alternate, if
alternates are designated by the Board of Directors, of such committee is or
are absent or disqualified, the member or members thereof present at any
meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or
members constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the
Board of Directors to act at the meeting in place of any such absent or
disqualified member.

Section 10\. _Action by Written Consent_. Unless otherwise restricted by the
Certificate of Incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken at
any meeting of the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may be
taken without a meeting if all members of the Board of Directors or such
committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic
transmission, and the writing or writings or electronic transmission or
transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the board
or committee. Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are
maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic form if the minutes are
maintained in electronic form.

Section 11\. _Compensation_. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of
Incorporation, the Board of Directors shall have the authority to fix the
compensation, including fees and reimbursement of expenses, of directors for
services to the Corporation in any capacity, including for attendance of
meetings of the Board of Directors or participation on any committees. No such
payment shall preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other
capacity and receiving compensation therefor.

Section 12\. _Reliance on Books and Records_. A member of the Board of
Directors, or a member of any committee designated by the Board of Directors,
shall, in the performance of such persons duties, be fully protected in
relying in good faith upon records of the Corporation and upon
such information, opinions, reports or statements presented to the
Corporation by any of the Corporations officers or employees, or committees
of the Board of Directors, or by any other person as to matters the member
reasonably believes are within such other persons professional or expert
competence and who has been selected with reasonable care by or on behalf of
the Corporation.

Section 13\. _Telephonic and Other Meetings_. Unless restricted by the
Certificate of Incorporation, any one or more members of the Board of
Directors or any committee thereof may participate in a meeting of the Board
of Directors or such committee by means of conference telephone or other
communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the
meeting can hear each other. Participation by such means shall
constitute presence in person at a meeting.

_CERTIFICATES OF STOCK_

Section 1\. _Form_. The shares of stock of the Corporation shall be
represented by certificates provided that the Board of Directors may provide
by resolution that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock
shall be uncertificated shares. If shares are represented by certificates,
the certificates shall be in such form as required by applicable law and as
determined by the Board of Directors. Each certificate shall certify the
number of shares owned by such holder in the Corporation and shall be signed
by, or in the name of the Corporation by the Chairman of the Board, or the
President or any Vice President and the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer or
the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation designated by the
Board of Directors. Any or all signatures on the certificate may be a
facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed,
whose facsimile signature has been used on or who has duly affixed a facsimile
signature or signatures to any such certificate or certificates shall cease
to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar of the Corporation whether
because of death, resignation or otherwise before such certificate or
certificates have been issued by the Corporation, such certificate
or certificates may nevertheless be issued as though the person or persons
who signed such certificate or certificates, whose facsimile signature or
signatures have been used thereon or who duly affixed a facsimile signature or
signatures thereon had not ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or
registrar of the Corporation. All certificates for shares shall be
consecutively numbered or otherwise identified. The Board of Directors may
appoint a bank or trust company organized under the laws of the United States
or any state thereof to act as its transfer agent or registrar or both in
connection with the transfer of any class or series of securities of the
Corporation. The Corporation, or its designated transfer agent or other
agent, shall keep a book or set of books to be known as the stock transfer
books of the Corporation, containing the name of each holder of record,
together with such holders address and the number and class or series of
shares held by such holder and the date of issue. When shares are represented
by certificates, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to each holder to
whom such shares have been issued or transferred, certificates representing
the shares owned by such holder, and shares of stock of the Corporation shall
only be transferred on the books of the Corporation by the holder of record
thereof or by such holders attorney duly authorized in writing, upon
surrender to the Corporation or its designated transfer agent or other agent
of the certificate or certificates for such shares endorsed by the appropriate
person or persons, with such evidence of the authenticity of such endorsement,
transfer, authorization and other matters as the Corporation may
reasonably require, and accompanied by all necessary stock transfer stamps.
In that event, it shall be the duty of the Corporation to issue a new
certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate or
certificates and record the transaction on its books. When shares are not
represented by certificates, shares of stock of the Corporation shall only be
transferred on the books of the Corporation by the holder of record thereof or
by such holders attorney duly authorized in writing, with such evidence of
the authenticity of such transfer, authorization and other matters as the
Corporation may reasonably require, and accompanied by all necessary stock
transfer stamps, and within a reasonable time after the issuance or
transfer of such shares, the Corporation shall send the holder to whom such
shares have been issued or transferred a written statement of the information
required by applicable law. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, the
Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws or any other instrument the rights
and obligations of shareholders are identical, whether or not their shares are
represented by certificates.

 



-20 -  Section 2\. _Lost Certificates_. The Corporation may issue or direct a
new certificate or certificates or uncertificated shares to be issued in
place of any certificate or certificates previously issued by the Corporation
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be
lost, stolen or destroyed. When authorizing such issue of a new certificate or
certificates or uncertificated shares, the Corporation may, in its discretion
and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of
such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates, or his or her
legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond in such sum as it may
direct, sufficient to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be
made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or
destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or
uncertificated shares.

 

Section 3\. _Registered Stockholders_. The Corporation shall be entitled to
recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its records as the
owner of shares of stock to receive dividends, to vote, to receive
notifications and otherwise to exercise all the rights and powers of an owner.
The Corporation shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim
to or interest in such share or shares of stock on the part of any other
person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except
as otherwise required by the laws of Delaware.

 

Section 4\. _Fixing a Record Date for Purposes Other Than Stockholder
Meetings_. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders
entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment
of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect
of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purposes of any
other lawful action (other than stockholder meetings which is expressly
governed by Section 11 of ARTICLE II hereof), the Board of Directors may fix a
record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be
not more than 60 days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the
record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the
close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the
resolution relating thereto.

of certificates of stock shall be governed by such other regulations as the
Board of Directors may establish.

Corporation may hold securities and otherwise to exercise any and all rights
and powers which this Corporation may possess by reason of its ownership of

involved or threatened to be involved (including involvement, without
limitation, as a witness) in any actual or threatened action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "
_proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation,
is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as an employee or agent of
the Corporation or as a director, officer, partner, member,
trustee, administrator, employee or agent of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust or other
enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (an "
_indemnitee_ "), shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to
the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter
be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that
such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification
rights than permitted prior thereto), against all expense, liability and loss
(including attorneys fees and related disbursements, judgments, fines, excise
taxes or penalties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
as amended from time to time (" _ERISA_ "), penalties and amounts paid or to
be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in
connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an
indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, partner, member, trustee,

indemnitees heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that,
except as provided in

 



-23 -  this Section 1 of this Article VII with respect to proceedings to enforce
rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such
indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such
indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the

to the right to indemnification conferred herein, an indemnitee shall also
have the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in
defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (an "
_advance of expenses_ "); provided, however, that if and to the extent that
the DGCL requires, an advance of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or
her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any capacity in which
service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including without limitation,
service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the
Corporation of an undertaking (an " _undertaking_ "), by or on behalf of such
indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced that such indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section 1 of this
Article VII or otherwise. The Corporation may also, by action of its Board of
Directors, provide indemnification and advancement of expenses to employees
and agents of the Corporation.

Section 2\. _Procedure for Indemnification_. Any indemnification of a director
or officer of the Corporation or advance of expenses (including attorneys
fees, costs and charges) under this Section 2 of this Article VII shall be
made promptly, and in any event within forty-five days after a written claim
has been received by the Corporation (or, in the case of an advance of
expenses, twenty days after a written request is received by the Corporation,
provided that the director or officer has delivered the undertaking
contemplated by Section 1 of this Article VII if required). If a determination
by the Corporation that the director or officer is entitled
to indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to this Article VII is
required, and the Corporation fails to respond within sixty days to a written
request for indemnity or advancement of expenses, the Corporation shall be
deemed to have approved the request. If the Corporation denies a written
request for indemnification or advance of expenses, in whole or in part, or if
payment in full pursuant to such request is not made within forty-five days
after a written claim has been received by the Corporation (or, in the case
of an advance of expenses, twenty days after a written request is received by
the Corporation, provided that the director or officer has delivered the
undertaking contemplated by Section 1 of this Article VII if required), the
right to indemnification or advances as granted by this Article VII shall be
enforceable by the director or officer in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Such persons costs and expenses incurred in connection with successfully
establishing his or her right to indemnification or advancement of expenses,
in whole or in part, in any such action shall also be indemnified by the
Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. It shall be
a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim
for the advance of expenses where the undertaking required pursuant to Section
1 of this Article VII, if any, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the
claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under
the DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed,
but the burden of such defense shall be on the Corporation to the fullest
extent permitted by law. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including
its Board of Directors, a committee thereof, independent legal counsel or its
stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such
action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances
because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the
DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of
Directors, a committee thereof,

 



-24 -  independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met
such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or
create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of
conduct. The procedure for indemnification of other employees and agents for
whom indemnification and advancement of expenses is provided pursuant to
Section 1 of this Article VII shall be the same procedure set forth in this
Section 2 of this Article VII for directors or officers, unless otherwise set
forth in the action of the Board of Directors providing indemnification and
advancement of expenses for such employee or agent.

Section 3\. _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance
on its own behalf and on behalf of any person who is or was or has agreed to
become a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner,
member, trustee, administrator, employee or agent of another corporation or of
a partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust or other
enterprise against any expense, liability or loss asserted against him or
her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or
her status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to
indemnify such person against such expenses, liability or loss under the DGCL
or otherwise. 

Section 4\. _Service for Subsidiaries_. Any person serving as a director,
officer, partner, member, trustee, administrator, employee or agent of
another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited liability
company, trust or other enterprise, at least 50% of whose equity interests are
owned by the Corporation (a " _subsidiary_ " for this Article VII), shall be
conclusively presumed to be serving in such capacity at the request of the
Corporation.

 

Section 5\. _Reliance_. Persons who after the date of the adoption of this
provision become or remain directors or officers of the Corporation or who,
while a director or officer of the Corporation, become or remain a director,
officer, employee or agent of a subsidiary, shall be conclusively presumed to
have relied on the rights to indemnity, advance of expenses and other rights
contained in this Article VII in entering into or continuing such service. The
rights to indemnification and to the advance of expenses conferred in this
Article VII shall apply to claims made against an indemnitee arising out of
acts or omissions which occurred or occur both prior and subsequent to the
adoption hereof. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this Article VII that
adversely affects any right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be
prospective only and shall not limit, eliminate, or impair any such right
with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence
of any action or omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or
repeal.

 

Section 6\. _Non-Exclusivity of Rights; Continuation of Rights to
Indemnification_. The rights to indemnification and to the advance of
expenses conferred in this Article VII shall not be exclusive of any other
right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under the Certificate of
Incorporation or under any statute, bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders
or disinterested directors or otherwise. All rights to indemnification under
this Article VII shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and
each director or officer of the Corporation who serves or served in such
capacity at any time while this Article VII is in effect. Any repeal or
modification of this Article VII or any repeal or modification of relevant
provisions of the DGCL or any other applicable laws shall not in any way
diminish any rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses of such
director or officer or the obligations of the Corporation arising hereunder
with respect to any proceeding arising out of, or relating to, any actions,
transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of such repeal or
modification.

 



-25 -  Section 7\. _Merger or Consolidation_. For purposes of this Article VII,
references to the "Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting
corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a
constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate
existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its
directors, officers and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was
a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is
or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this Article
VII with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she would
have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence
had continued.

 

Section 8\. _Savings Clause_. If this Article VII or any portion hereof shall
be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify and advance expenses to each person
entitled to indemnification under Section 1 of Article VII as to all expense,
liability and loss (including attorneys fees and related disbursements,
judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties, penalties and amounts paid
or to be paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by
such person and for which indemnification or advancement of expenses is
available to such person pursuant to this Article VII to the fullest extent
permitted by any applicable portion of this Article VII that shall not have
been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporations
stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any

indispensable parties named as defendants therein and the Court of Chancery of

_ARTICLE EIGHT_

A. _Limitation of Director s Liability_. The Corporation hereby eliminates,
to the fullest extent permitted by law (as contemplated by Section 102(b)(7)
of the DGCL), the personal liability of any person who serves as a director
of the Corporation to the Corporation and/or its stockholders for monetary
damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director; _provided_ , that this
_ARTICLE EIGHT_ shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director (i)
for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its
stockholders, (ii) for any acts or omissions not in good faith or which
involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under
Section 174 of the DGCL or (iv) for any transaction from which the director
derived an improper personal benefit. If the DGCL is hereafter amended to
authorize further elimination or limitation of the liability of directors,
then the liability of a director of the Corporation, in addition to the
elimination or limitation on personal liability provided herein, shall be
limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as so amended. Any repeal
or modification of this _ARTICLE EIGHT_ shall be prospective only, and shall
not adversely affect any elimination or limitation on the personal liability
of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or
modification. 

B. _Right to Indemnification_. The Corporation, to the fullest extent
permitted or required by the DGCL or other applicable law, as the same exists
or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, unless
applicable law otherwise requires, only to the extent that such amendment
permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than such
law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), shall
indemnify and hold harmless any person who is or was made a party, or is
threatened to be made a party, or who is or was involved in any manner
(including, without limitation, as a witness), in any threatened, pending or
completed investigation, claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative, or investigative (including, without limitation, any
action, suit or proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a
judgment in its favor) (collectively, a " _Proceeding_ "), by reason of the
fact that such person, or a person of whom he or she is or was the legal
representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or who
while a director or officer of the Corporation is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, principal, member,
manager, fiduciary, employee, trustee or agent of another corporation or of a
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise (including service with respect to employee benefit plans
maintained or sponsored by the Corporation) (collectively, an " _Indemnitee_
"), whether the basis of such Proceeding is alleged action in an official
capacity as a director, officer, partner, principal, member, manager,  fiduciary, employee, trustee or agent or in any other capacity while serving
as a director, officer, partner, principal, member, manager, fiduciary,
employee, trustee or agent, against all expenses, liabilities and losses
(including, without limitation, attorneys fees, costs, charges and related
disbursements, judgments, fines, taxes, excise taxes or penalties under the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended from time to
time, penalties, and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) (collectively,
" _Expenses_ ") actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in
connection with such Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as
provided in this _ARTICLE EIGHT_ with respect to proceedings to enforce rights
to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify an Indemnitee in
connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by or on behalf of
such Indemnitee only if the initiation of such Proceeding (or part thereof)
was authorized by the Board of Directors. Each person who is or was serving as
a director, officer, partner, principal, member, manager, fiduciary, employee,
trustee or agent of a subsidiary of the Corporation shall be deemed to be
serving, or have served, at the request of the Corporation.

C.  _Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings_. An Indemnitee seeking
indemnification shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification upon
submission of a written request, and thereafter the Corporation shall have the
burden of proof to overcome that presumption in reaching a contrary
determination. In any event, if the Corporation shall not have made a
determination within thirty (30) days after receipt of a written request
therefor, the Indemnitee seeking indemnification shall be deemed to be, and
shall be, entitled to indemnification unless (i) the Indemnitee intentionally
misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact in the written request
for indemnification or (ii) such indemnification is prohibited by the DGCL.
The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction
or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself,
create a presumption that the Indemnitee (a) did not act in good faith and in
a manner which the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or at least not
opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation or (b) with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that
such conduct was unlawful. Furthermore, the knowledge or actions or failure
to act of any other director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or
other enterprise, as applicable, shall not be imputed to the Indemnitee for
purposes of determining the Indemnitees entitlement to indemnification under
this _ARTICLE EIGHT_.

D. _Advancement of Expenses_. Expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in defending
a Proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final
disposition of such Proceeding and within 15 days of receipt by the secretary
of the Corporation of (i) a written request therefor setting forth the basis
for such indemnification and (ii) if required by law at the time such written
request is made, an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay
such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article
VII. Such advances shall be made on an unsecured basis, shall be interest-free
and shall be made without regard to the Indemnitees ability to repay such
amounts and without regard to the Indemnitees ultimate entitlement to
indemnification under this _ARTICLE EIGHT_ or otherwise. E. _Remedies of the Indemnitee_.

 

(i) If a determination is made that the Indemnitee is not entitled to
indemnification or advancement of Expenses under this _ARTICLE EIGHT_ : (a)
the Indemnitee shall be entitled to seek an adjudication of entitlement to
such indemnification or advancement of Expenses either, at the Indemnitees
sole option, (1) in an appropriate court of the State of Delaware or any
other court of competent jurisdiction or (2) in an arbitration to be conducted
by a single arbitrator pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration
Association; (b) any such judicial proceeding or arbitration shall be
_de novo_ and the Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of such
adverse determination; and (c) in any such judicial proceeding or arbitration,
the Corporation shall have the burden of proving by clear and convincing
evidence that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or
advancement of Expenses under this _ARTICLE EIGHT_.

(ii) If a determination shall have been made or deemed to have been made that
the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Corporation shall be
obligated to pay the amounts constituting such indemnification within fifteen
(15) days after such determination has been made or deemed to have been made
and shall be conclusively bound by such determination unless (a) the
Indemnitee intentionally misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact
in the written request for indemnification or (b) such indemnification is
prohibited by the DGCL. In the event that (1) advancement of Expenses is not
timely made pursuant to Section D of this _ARTICLE EIGHT_ or (2) payment of
indemnification is not made within fifteen (15) days after a determination of
entitlement to indemnification has been made or deemed to have been made
pursuant to this Article VII, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to seek
judicial enforcement of the Corporations obligation to pay the Indemnitee
such advancement of Expenses and indemnification. It shall be a defense to any
such action for judicial enforcement (other than an action brought to enforce
a claim for Expenses incurred in defending any Proceeding in advance of its
final disposition where the written request therefor and the required
undertaking, if any is required, has been received by the secretary of the
Corporation) that the Indemnitee has not met the standard of conduct set forth
in the DGCL, but the burden of proving such defense, by clear and convincing
evidence, will be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation
to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that
indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because he
or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor
an actual determination by the Corporation that the Indemnitee has not met
such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or
create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard
of conduct.

(iii) The Corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial
proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section E of _ARTICLE
EIGHT_ that the procedures and the presumptions of this _ARTICLE EIGHT_ are
not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or
before any such arbitrator that the Corporation is bound by all the provisions
of this _ARTICLE EIGHT_.

(iv) The Corporation shall indemnify the Indemnitee against, and the
Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover from the Corporation, any Expenses
actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any judicial
adjudication, judicial enforcement, or arbitration commenced pursuant to this
Section E of _ARTICLE EIGHT_ to enforce his or her rights under, or to recover
damages for breach of, this _ARTICLE EIGHT_. F. _Definitions_. For purposes of this _ARTICLE EIGHT_ :

 

(i) " _Corporation_ " shall mean, in addition to the resulting corporation,
any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent)
absorbed in a consolidation or merger that, if its separate existence had
continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors,
officers, employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director,
officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was
serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of
this _ARTICLE EIGHT_ with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as
such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its
separate existence had continued.

(ii) " _Disinterested Director_ " shall mean a director of the Corporation who
is not or was not a party to the Proceeding in respect of which
indemnification is sought by the Indemnitee.

(iii) Actions "in, or at least not opposed to, the best interests of the
Corporation" shall include, without limitation, actions taken in good faith
and in a manner the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee
benefit plan.

G. _Insurance_. The Corporation shall purchase and maintain insurance
on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the
Corporation, or who while a director or officer is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent
of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
(" _D andO Insurance_"), against any liability asserted against the person and
incurred by the person in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her
status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the
obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the
provisions of this _ARTICLE EIGHT_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Corporation shall have no obligation to obtain or maintain DandO Insurance if
the Corporation determines in good faith that such insurance is not reasonably
available, the premium costs for such insurance are materially
disproportionate to the amount of coverage provided, the coverage provided
by such insurance is limited by exclusions so as to provide a materially
insufficient benefit, or such person is covered by substantially similar
insurance maintained by a subsidiary of the Corporation or by another person
pursuant to a contractual obligation owed to the Corporation.

H. _Scope of ARTICLE EIGHT_. The rights conferred in this _ARTICLE EIGHT_
shall not be exclusive of any other right that any person may have or
hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this Certificate of
Incorporation, any certificate of designations, the Bylaws, any agreement,
vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors, or otherwise, both as to
action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while
holding such office or while employed by or acting as agent for the
Corporation. The rights provided by or granted pursuant to this  _ARTICLE
EIGHT_ shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue
as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to
the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such person.  I. _Reliance on Provisions_. Each person who shall act as a director or
officer of the Corporation, or as the legal representative of such person, or
who while a director or officer serves at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, partner, principal, member, manager, fiduciary, employee,
trustee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, limited
liability company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall be deemed
to be doing so in reliance upon rights of indemnification provided by this
_ARTICLE EIGHT_. Any repeal or modification of the provisions of this
_ARTICLE EIGHT_ shall not adversely affect any right or benefit of any
potential Indemnitee existing at the time of such repeal or modification.

J. _Indemnification of Other Employees_. The Corporation may, to the extent
authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to
indemnification, and rights to advancement by the Corporation of any Expenses
actually and reasonably incurred in defending any Proceeding, to any employee
or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this
_ARTICLE EIGHT_ with respect to the indemnification of and advancement of
Expenses to directors and officers of the Corporation.

K. _Severability_. If this _ARTICLE EIGHT_ or any portion hereof shall be
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable on any ground by any court of
competent jurisdiction, then (i) the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify
each Indemnitee as to all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred or
suffered by such person in connection with any Proceeding, including, without
limitation, a grand jury proceeding, to the fullest extent permitted by (a)
any applicable portion of this Article VII that shall not have
been invalidated, (b) the DGCL or (c) any other applicable law; and (ii) to
the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this _ARTICLE EIGHT_
(including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this _ARTICLE
EIGHT_  containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent
manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.

 

L. _Contract Rights_. The provisions of this _ARTICLE EIGHT_ shall be deemed
to be a contract right between the Corporation and each person who is
entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses pursuant to this
_ARTICLE EIGHT_ at any time while this _ARTICLE EIGHT_ and the relevant
provisions of the DGCL or other applicable law are in effect, and any
repeal or modification of this _ARTICLE EIGHT_ or any such law shall be
prospective only, and shall not in any way diminish any rights to
indemnification of such person or the obligations of the Corporation arising
hereunder with respect to any Proceeding arising out of, or relating to, any
actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of such
modification or repeal. _ARTICLE NINE_

The Corporation expressly elects not to be governed by Section 203 of the
DGCL.

_ARTICLE TEN_

The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any
provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation in the manner now or
hereafter prescribed herein and by the laws of the State of Delaware. All
rights, preferences and privileges of any nature conferred upon
stockholders, directors, or any other persons or entities by and pursuant to
this Certificate of Incorporation in its present form or as hereafter amended
are granted subject to the right reserved in this _ARTICLE TEN_ ; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any amendment, repeal or modification of _ARTICLE EIGHT_ of
this Certificate of Incorporation shall be prospective only, and shall not
adversely affect any right, benefit or protection existing at the time of such
amendment, repeal or modification. Exhibit D

proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders, except
as otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation. If a
quorum is not present, the holders of a majority of the shares present in
person or represented by proxy at the meeting, and entitled to vote at the
meeting, may adjourn the meeting to another time and/or place. When a quorum
is once present to commence a meeting of stockholders, it is not broken by
the subsequent withdrawal of any stockholders or their proxies.

_Section 7_.  _Adjourned Meetings_. When a meeting is adjourned to another
time and place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time
and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business
which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment
is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record
date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting
shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

 



2 _Section 8_. _Vote Required_. When a quorum is present, the affirmative vote
of the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the
meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the
stockholders, unless the question is one upon which by express provisions of
an applicable law or of the Certificate of Incorporation, a different vote is
required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the
decision of such question.

_Section 9_. _Voting Rights_. Except as otherwise provided by the DGCL or by
the Certificate of Incorporation or any amendments thereto and subject to
_Section 3_ of _Article VI_  hereof, every stockholder shall at every
meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one (1) vote in person or by proxy
for each share of common stock entitled to vote on the subject matter and held
(or deemed held) by such stockholder (it being understood that certain other
classes or series of capital stock may, pursuant to the Certificate of
Incorporation, be entitled to vote on an as-if converted to common stock
basis).

 

 _Section 10_. _Proxies_. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of
stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for him or
her by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3)
years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly
executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and
if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to
support an irrevocable power. A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless
of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock
itself or an interest in the Corporation generally. Any proxy is suspended
when the person executing the proxy is present at a meeting of stockholders
and elects to vote, except that when such proxy is coupled with an interest
and the fact of the interest appears on the face of the proxy, the agent named
in the proxy shall have all voting and other rights referred to in the proxy,
notwithstanding the presence of the person executing the proxy. At each
meeting of the stockholders, and before any voting commences, all proxies
filed at or before the meeting shall be submitted to and examined by the
Secretary or a person designated by the Secretary and no shares may be
represented or voted under a proxy that has been found to be invalid or
irregular.

_Section 11_. _Inspectors of Election_. In advance of any meeting of
stockholders, the Board of Directors may appoint one or more inspectors, who
need not be stockholders, to act at the meeting and to make a written report
thereof. The Board of Directors may designate one or more persons as
alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no
inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the
chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the
meeting. Each inspector, before discharging his or her duties, shall take and
sign an oath to faithfully execute the duties of inspector with strict
impartiality and according to the persons best ability. The inspectors shall
have the duties prescribed by law.

_Section 12_. _Action by Written Consent_. Unless otherwise provided in the
Certificate of Incorporation, any action required to be taken at any annual
or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, or any action which may
be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken
without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or
consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken and bearing the dates

 



3  of signature of the stockholders who signed the consent or consents, shall
be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum
number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted
and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office
in the state of Delaware, or the Corporations principal place of business,
or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book or books
in which proceedings of meetings of the stockholders are recorded. Delivery
made to the Corporations registered office shall be by hand or by certified
or registered mail, return receipt requested, or by facsimile or e-mail, with
confirmation of receipt. All consents properly delivered in accordance with
this Section shall be deemed to be recorded when so delivered. No
written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to
therein unless, within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated consent delivered
to the Corporation as required by this Section, written consents signed by the
holders of a sufficient number of shares to take such corporate action are so
recorded. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a
meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those
stockholders who have not consented in writing and who, if the action had
been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if
the record date for such meeting had been the date that written consents
signed by a sufficient number of holders to take the action were delivered to
the Corporation. Any action taken pursuant to such written consent or consents
of the stockholders shall have the same force and effect as if taken by the
stockholders at a meeting thereof.

 

 _ARTICLE III_

_DIRECTORS_

_Section 1_. _General Powers_. The business and affairs of the Corporation
shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors.

_Section 2_.  _Number, Election and Term of Office_. The Board of Directors
shall consist of that number of directors as determined from time to time by
the Board of Directors. The directors shall be elected by a plurality of the
votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting
and entitled to vote in the election of directors. The directors shall be
elected in this manner at the annual meeting of the stockholders, except as
provided in _Section 4_ of this  _Article III_. Each director elected shall
hold office until a successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or
her earlier death, resignation or removal as hereinafter provided.

 

 _Section 3_. _Removal and Resignation_. The directors shall only be removed,
with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the shares then
entitled to vote at an election of directors. Whenever the holders of any
class or series are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions
of the Certificate of Incorporation, the provisions of this Section shall
apply, in respect to the removal without cause of a director or directors so
elected, to the vote of the holders of the outstanding shares of that class or
series and not to the vote of the outstanding shares as a whole. Any director
may resign at any time upon written notice to the Corporation. Any such
resignation shall take effect at the date of the receipt of such notice or at
any later time specified therein, and unless otherwise specified therein, the
acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.

 



4 _Section 4_. _Vacancies_. Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting
from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled by a
majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by the
sole remaining director. Each director so chosen shall hold office until a
successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death,
resignation or removal as herein provided.

_Section 5_. _Annual Meetings_. The annual meeting of each newly elected
Board of Directors shall be held without other notice than this Section

at the request of any director on at least seven (7) days notice to each
director, either personally, by telephone, by mail, or by facsimile or e-mail.

_Section 7_. _Quorum_. Each director shall be entitled to one (1) vote except
as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation. Directors then in
office (and specifically excluding any vacancies) and holding a majority of
the votes of all directors (or such greater number required by applicable
law) shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The vote of
directors holding a majority of votes present at a meeting at which a quorum
is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors. If a quorum shall not
be present at any meeting of the Board of Directors, the directors present
thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than
announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present.

_Section 8_. _Committees_. The Board of Directors may, by resolution passed by
a majority of the whole Board of Directors, designate one or more committees,
each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the Corporation,
which to the extent provided in such resolution or these By-Laws shall have
and may exercise the powers of the Board of Directors in the management and
affairs of the Corporation except as otherwise limited by law. The Board of
Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any
committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting
of the committee. Such committee or committees shall have such name or names
as may be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of
Directors. Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and
report the same to the Board of Directors when required.

_Section 9_. _Committee Rules_. Each committee of the Board of Directors may
fix its own rules of procedure and shall hold its meetings as provided by such
rules, except as may otherwise be provided by a resolution of the Board of
Directors designating such committee. Unless otherwise provided in such
a resolution, the presence of at least a majority of the members of the
committee shall be necessary to constitute a quorum. In the event that a
member and that members alternate, if alternates are designated by the Board
of Directors as provided in _Section 8_ of this _Article III_ , of such
committee is or are absent or disqualified, the member or members thereof
present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such
member or members constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member
of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in place of any such absent or
disqualified member.

 



5 _Section 10_. _Communications Equipment_. Members of the Board of Directors or
any committee thereof may participate in and act at any meeting of such board
or committee through the use of a conference telephone or other communications
equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear
each other, and participation in the meeting pursuant to this Section shall
constitute presence in person at the meeting.

_Section 11_.  _Waiver of Notice and Presumption of Consent_. Any member of
the Board of Directors or any committee thereof who is present at a meeting
shall be conclusively presumed to have waived notice of such meeting except
when such member attends for the express purpose of objecting at the
beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Such member shall be conclusively
presumed to have consented to any action taken unless his or her dissent
shall be entered in the minutes of the meeting or unless his or her written
dissent to such action shall be filed with the person acting as the secretary
of the meeting before the adjournment thereof or shall be forwarded
by registered mail to the Secretary immediately after the adjournment of the
meeting. Such right to dissent shall not apply to any member who voted in
favor of such action.

_Section 12_. _Action by Written Consent_. Unless otherwise restricted by the
Certificate of Incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken at
any meeting of the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may be
taken without a meeting if all members of the Board of Directors or committee,
as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and the writing or writings
are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the board or committee.

_Section 13_. _Compensation_. The Board of Directors or a committee thereof
shall have the authority to fix the amount of compensation of directors and
any committee members.

person so removed. Any officer may resign at any time by giving written
notice to the Corporation. Any such resignation shall take effect at the date

8 _ARTICLE V_

 

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

_Section 1_. _Right to Indemnification_. The Corporation, to the fullest
extent permitted or required by the DGCL or other applicable law, as the same
exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment,
unless applicable law otherwise requires, only to the extent that such
amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights
than such law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment),
shall indemnify and hold harmless any person who is or was made a party, or is
threatened to be made a party, or who is or was involved in any manner
(including, without limitation, as a witness), in any threatened, pending or
completed investigation, claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative, or investigative (including, without limitation, any
action, suit or proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a
judgment in its favor) (collectively, a " _Proceeding_ "), by reason of the
fact that such person, or a person of whom he or she is or was the legal
representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or who
while a director or officer of the Corporation is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, principal, member,
manager, fiduciary, employee, trustee or agent of another Corporation or of a
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise (including service with respect to employee benefit plans
maintained or sponsored by the Corporation) (collectively, an " _Indemnitee_
"), whether the basis of such Proceeding is alleged action in an
official capacity as a director, officer, partner, principal, member,
manager, fiduciary, employee, trustee or agent or in any other capacity while
serving as a director, officer, partner, principal, member, manager,
fiduciary, employee, trustee or agent, against all expenses, liabilities and
losses (including, without limitation, attorneys fees, costs, charges, and
related disbursements, judgments, fines, taxes, excise taxes or penalties
under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended from
time to time, penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement)
(collectively, " _Expenses_ ") actually and reasonably incurred by the
Indemnitee in connection with such Proceeding; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that, except as provided in this _Article V_ with respect to proceedings to
enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify an
Indemnitee in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by or
on behalf of such Indemnitee only if the initiation of such Proceeding (or
part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors. Each person who is or
was serving as a director, officer, partner, principal, member, manager,
fiduciary, employee, trustee or agent of a subsidiary of the Corporation
shall be deemed to be serving, or have served, at the request of the
Corporation.

_Section 2_. _Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings_. An Indemnitee
seeking indemnification shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification
upon submission of a written request, and thereafter the Corporation shall
have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in reaching a contrary
determination. In any event, if the Corporation shall not have made a
determination within thirty (30) days after receipt of a written request
therefor, the Indemnitee seeking indemnification shall be deemed to be, and
shall be, entitled to indemnification unless (a) the Indemnitee intentionally
misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact in the written request
for indemnification or (b) such indemnification is prohibited by the DGCL.
The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction
or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself,
create a presumption that the Indemnitee (i) did not act in good faith and in
a manner which the Indemnitee reasonably

 



9  believed to be in, or at least not opposed to, the best interests of the
Corporation or (ii) with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
reasonable cause to believe that such conduct was unlawful. Furthermore, the
knowledge or actions or failure to act of any other director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation or other enterprise, as applicable, shall
not be imputed to the Indemnitee for purposes of determining the Indemnitees
entitlement to indemnification under this _Article V_.

_Section 3_. _Advancement of Expenses_. Expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in
defending a Proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the
final disposition of such Proceeding and within fifteen (15) days of receipt
by the Secretary of (a) a written request therefor setting forth the basis
for such indemnification and (b) if required by law at the time such written
request is made, an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay
such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this _Article
V_. Such advances shall be made on an unsecured basis, shall be interest-free
and shall be made without regard to the Indemnitees ability to repay such
amounts and without regard to the Indemnitees ultimate entitlement to
indemnification under this _Article V_ or otherwise.

_Section 4_. Remedies of the Indemnitee.

(a) If a determination is made that the Indemnitee is not entitled to
indemnification or advancement of Expenses under this _Article V_ , (i) the
Indemnitee shall be entitled to seek an adjudication of entitlement to such
indemnification or advancement of Expenses either, at the Indemnitees sole
option, (A) in an appropriate court of the State of Delaware or any other
court of competent jurisdiction or (B) in an arbitration to be conducted by a
single arbitrator pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration
Association, (ii) any such judicial proceeding or arbitration shall be de novo
and the Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of such adverse
determination, and (iii) in any such judicial proceeding or arbitration, the
Corporation shall have the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence
that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of
Expenses under this _Article V_.

 

(b) If a determination shall have been made or deemed to have been made that
the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Corporation shall be
obligated to pay the amounts constituting such indemnification within fifteen
(15) days after such determination has been made or deemed to have been made
and shall be conclusively bound by such determination unless (i) the
Indemnitee intentionally misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact
in the written request for indemnification or (ii) such indemnification is
prohibited by the DGCL. In the event that (A) advancement of Expenses is not
timely made pursuant to _Section 3_ of this _Article V_ or (B) payment of
indemnification is not made within fifteen (15) days after a determination of
entitlement to indemnification has been made or deemed to have been made
pursuant to this _Article V_ , the Indemnitee shall be entitled to seek
judicial enforcement of the Corporations obligation to pay the Indemnitee
such advancement of Expenses and indemnification. It shall be a defense to
any such action for judicial enforcement (other than an action brought to
enforce a claim for Expenses incurred in defending any Proceeding in advance
of its final disposition where the written request 

 



10  therefor and the required undertaking, if any is required, has been received
by the Secretary) that the Indemnitee has not met the standard of conduct set
forth in the DGCL, but the burden of proving such defense, by clear and
convincing evidence, will be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the
Corporation to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such
action that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances
because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the
DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation that the Indemnitee has
not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action
or create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable
standard of conduct.

(c) The Corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial
proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this _Section 4_ that the
procedures and the presumptions of this Article V are not valid, binding and
enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such
arbitrator that the Corporation is bound by all the provisions of this Article
V.

 

(d) The Corporation shall indemnify the Indemnitee against, and the Indemnitee
shall be entitled to recover from the Corporation, any Expenses actually and
reasonably incurred in connection with any judicial adjudication, judicial
enforcement or arbitration commenced pursuant to this _Section 4_ to enforce
his or her rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this _Article
V_.

_Section 5_. Definitions. For purposes of this _Article V_ :

 

(a) " _Corporation_ " shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation,
any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent)
absorbed in a consolidation or merger that, if its separate existence had
continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors,
officers, employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director,
officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was
serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust
or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of
this _Article V_ with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as
such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its
separate existence had continued.

(b) " _Disinterested Director_ " means a director of the Corporation who is
not or was not a party to the Proceeding in respect of which indemnification
is sought by the Indemnitee.

(c) Actions "in or at least not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation" shall include, without limitation, actions taken in good faith
and in a manner the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee
benefit plan.

_Section 6_. _Insurance_. The Corporation shall purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the
Corporation, or who while a director or officer is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, 

 



11  employee, trustee or agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise (" _D andO Insurance_"), against any
liability asserted against the person and incurred by the person in any such
capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such person
against such liability under the provisions of this  _Article V_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall have no obligation to
obtain or maintain DandO Insurance if the Corporation determines in good faith
that such insurance is not reasonably available, the premium costs for
such insurance are materially disproportionate to the amount of coverage
provided, the coverage provided by such insurance is limited by exclusions so
as to provide a materially insufficient benefit, or such person is covered by
substantially similar insurance maintained by a subsidiary of the Corporation
or by another person pursuant to a contractual obligation owed to the
Corporation.

_Section 7_. _Service for Subsidiaries_. Any person serving as a director,
officer, partner, member, trustee, administrator, employee or agent of another
corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited liability company,
trust or other enterprise, at least 50% of whose equity interests are owned by
the Corporation (a " _subsidiary_ " for this _Article V_ ), shall be
conclusively presumed to be serving in such capacity at the request of the
Corporation.

_Section 8_. _Reliance_. Persons who after the date of the adoption of this
provision become or remain directors or officers of the Corporation or who,
while a director or officer of the Corporation, become or remain a director,
officer, employee or agent of a subsidiary, shall be conclusively presumed to
have relied on the rights to indemnity, advance of expenses and other rights
contained in this _Article V_ in entering into or continuing such service. The
rights to indemnification and to the advance of expenses conferred in this
_Article V_ shall apply to claims made against an indemnitee arising out of
acts or omissions which occurred or occur both prior and subsequent to the
adoption hereof. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this _Article V_ that
adversely affects any right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be

capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office or
while employed by or acting as agent for the Corporation. The rights provided
by or granted pursuant to this _Article V_ shall, unless otherwise provided
when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors
and administrators of such person. All rights to indemnification under this

Expenses to directors and officers of the Corporation.

_ARTICLE VI_

_CERTIFICATES OF STOCK_

 

 _Section 1_. _Form_. Every holder of stock in the Corporation shall be
entitled to have a certificate, signed by, or in the name of the Corporation
by the Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer or a Vice-
President and the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation,
certifying the number of shares of a specific class or series owned by such
holder in the Corporation. If such a certificate is countersigned (1) by a
transfer agent or an assistant transfer agent other than the Corporation or
its employee or (2) by a registrar, other than the Corporation or its
employee, the signature of any such Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief
Financial Officer, Vice-President, Secretary, or Assistant Secretary may be
facsimiles. In case any officer or officers who have signed, or whose
facsimile signature or signatures have been used on, any such certificate or
certificates shall cease to be such officer or officers of the Corporation
whether because of death, resignation or otherwise before such certificate or
certificates have been delivered by the Corporation, such certificate or
certificates may nevertheless be issued and delivered as though the person or
persons who signed such certificate or certificates or whose facsimile
signature or signatures have been used thereon had not ceased to be such
officer or officers of the Corporation. All certificates for shares shall be
consecutively numbered or otherwise identified. The name of the person to whom
the shares represented thereby are issued, with the number of shares and date
of issue, shall be entered on the books of the Corporation. Shares of stock
of the Corporation shall only be transferred on the books of the Corporation
by the holder of record thereof or by such holders attorney duly authorized
in writing, upon surrender to the Corporation of the certificate or
certificates for such shares endorsed by the appropriate person or persons,
with such evidence of the authenticity of such endorsement, transfer,
authorization, and other matters as the Corporation may reasonably require,
and accompanied by all necessary stock transfer stamps. In that event, it
shall be the

 



13  duty of the Corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled
thereto, cancel the old certificate or certificates, and record the
transaction on its books. The Board of Directors may appoint a bank or trust
company organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof to
act as its transfer agent or registrar, or both in connection with the
transfer of any class or series of securities of the Corporation. 

_Section 2_. _Lost Certificates_. The Board of Directors may direct a new
certificate or certificates to be issued in place of any certificate or
certificates previously issued by the Corporation alleged to have been lost,
stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen, or destroyed.
When authorizing such issue of a new certificate or certificates, the Board of
Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance
thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen, or destroyed certificate
or certificates, or his or her legal representative, to give the Corporation
a bond sufficient to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be
made against the Corporation on account of the loss, theft or destruction of
any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate.

_Section 3_. _Fixing a Record Date for Stockholder Meetings_. In order that
the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to
vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less
than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed
by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be the
close of business on the next day preceding the day on which notice is given,
or if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding
the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of
record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall
apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided that the Board of Directors
may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

_Section 4_. _Fixing a Record Date for Action by Written Consent_. In order
that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix
a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and
which date shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. If
no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required
by statute, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting
forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation
by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal
place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody
of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded.
Delivery made to the Corporations registered office shall be by hand or by
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested or by facsimile or
e-mail, with confirmation of receipt. If no record date has been fixed by the
Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by
statute, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of
business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution
taking such prior action.

 



14 _Section 5_. _Fixing a Record Date for Other Purposes_. In order that
the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of
any dividend or other distribution or allotment or any rights or the
stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change,
conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purposes of any other lawful
action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall
not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty (60) days prior
to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining
stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day
on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. 

_Section 6_. _Registered Stockholders_. Prior to the surrender to the
Corporation of the certificate or certificates for a share or shares of stock
with a request to record the transfer of such share or shares, the Corporation
may treat the registered owner as the person entitled to receive dividends, to
vote, to receive notifications, and otherwise to exercise all the rights and
powers of an owner. The Corporation shall not be bound to recognize any
equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of
any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice
thereof.

_Section 7_. _Subscriptions for Stock_. Unless otherwise provided for in the
subscription agreement, subscriptions for shares shall be paid in full at
such time, or in such installments and at such times, as shall be determined
by the Board of Directors. Any call made by the Board of Directors for payment
on subscriptions shall be uniform as to all shares of the same class or as to
all shares of the same series. In case of default in the payment of any
installment or call when such payment is due, the Corporation may proceed to
collect the amount due in the same manner as any debt due the Corporation.

_ARTICLE VII_

_GENERAL PROVISIONS_

Corporation, subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, if

shares of the capital stock, subject to the provisions of the Certificate of
Incorporation. Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside out of
any funds of the Corporation available for dividends such sum or sums as
the directors from time to time, in their absolute discretion, think proper
as a reserve or reserves to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends,
or for repairing or maintaining any property of the Corporation, or any other

contract or to execute and deliver any instrument in the name of and on behalf
of the Corporation, and such authority may be general or confined to specific
instances. 

_Section 4_. _Loans_. The Corporation may lend money to, or guarantee any
obligation of, or otherwise assist any officer or other employee of the
Corporation or of its subsidiary, including any officer or employee who is a
director of the Corporation or its subsidiary, whenever, in the judgment of
the directors, such loan, guaranty or assistance may reasonably be expected
to benefit the Corporation. The loan, guaranty or other assistance may be with
or without interest, and may be unsecured, or secured in such manner as the
Board of Directors shall approve, including, without limitation, a pledge
of shares of stock of the Corporation. Nothing in this section contained
shall be deemed to deny, limit or restrict the powers of guaranty or warranty
of the Corporation at common law or under any statute.

reproduced or otherwise.

 

 _Section 7_. _Voting Securities Owned By Corporation_. Voting securities in
any other corporation or other entity (such as a limited liability company,
limited partnership or trust) held by the Corporation shall be voted by the
President, unless the Board of Directors specifically confers authority to
vote with respect thereto, which authority may be general or confined to
specific instances, upon some other person or officer. Any person authorized
to vote securities shall have the power to appoint proxies, with general power
of substitution.

_Section 8_. _Inspection of Books and Records_. Any stockholder of record, in
person or by attorney or other agent, shall, upon written demand under oath
stating the purpose thereof, have the right during the usual hours for
business to inspect for any proper purpose the Corporations stock ledger, a
list of its stockholders, and its other books and records, and to make copies
or extracts therefrom. A proper purpose shall mean any purpose reasonably
related to such persons interest as a stockholder. In every instance where an
attorney or other agent shall be the person who seeks the right to inspection,
the demand under oath shall be accompanied by a power of attorney or such
other writing which authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act on behalf
of the stockholder. The demand under oath shall be directed to the Corporation
at its registered office in the State of Delaware or at its principal place
of business.

_Section 9_. _Section Headings_. Section headings in these By-Laws are for
convenience of reference only and shall not be given any substantive effect
in limiting or otherwise construing any provision herein.

_Section 10_.  _Inconsistent Provisions_. In the event that any provision of
these By-Laws is or becomes inconsistent with any provision of the Certificate
of Incorporation, the DGCL or any other applicable law, the provision of these
By-Laws shall not be given any effect to the extent of such inconsistency but
shall otherwise be given full force and effect.

any meeting of the Board of Directors by a majority vote. The fact that the

One Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Dex_ "), and Spruce Acquisition
Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Merger Sub_ ") and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Dex, desire to merge Merger Sub with and into the Company, with
the Company as the surviving entity and constituting thereafter a wholly owned
subsidiary of Dex (the foregoing merger transaction being referred to herein
as the "Merger"). The Lenders would consent to, and waive the occurrence of
the Change of Control arising from, the Merger. 
   | 
  Extend Maturity Date |  | Holders of 100% of the outstanding principal
balance of the Loans agree to modify the definition of "Maturity Date" to be
December 31, 2016. 
   | 
  Change to Cash Sweep Provision |  | Revise the quarterly Loan

shared services agreement among Dex and each of its subsidiaries (including
the Company), a draft of which is attached as Exhibit A hereto, and providing
for sharing of synergy benefits by means of payments by and among Dex and all
of its Subsidiaries (including the Company), in accordance with the terms set
forth therein, (b) the tax sharing agreement, a draft of which is attached
hereto as Exhibit B, reflecting an allocation of income tax burden by and
among Dex and all of its Subsidiaries (including the Company) in accordance
with the terms set forth therein, and (c) intercompany licenses of
intellectual property rights so as to permit consolidation of print
directories in markets that overlap with Dex Media West, Inc., Dex
Media East, Inc., or R.H. Donnelley Inc. and their respective Subsidiaries in
order to take advantage of synergies in those markets;



 

(ii) Section 6.08(a)(v) (Restricted Payments) to permit distributions of $5
million per year, up to $15 million in aggregate during the term of the
Credit Agreement;



(iii) Section 6.05(l), to refresh the $50 million basket for permitted
dispositions, so that such basket is available in full following the closing

(iv) revise the appropriate covenants and provisions, including



 

(A) the relevant defined terms, including (without limiting the generality of
the foregoing) "Available Cash", "Consolidated Net Income"; "Pro Forma
Compliance", and "Total Indebtedness", and



 

(B) Section 5.01 (Financial Information), and 6.13 (Financial Covenants),

 



so that such terms and covenants are calculated for the Company and its
Subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis, as if (1) (after closing of the Merger)
the Company were not a subsidiary of Dex, (2) the preparation of financial
statements and other calculations (including without limitation the Leverage
Ratio and the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio) in accordance with GAAP
did not require or give effect to intercompany eliminations for transactions
between the Company and its Subsidiaries on the one hand and Dex and its
Subsidiaries on the other hand, and all transactions with Dex or its
Subsidiaries were transactions with a Person not affiliated with the Company
(provided that Section 6.09 would continue to apply and give effect to the
Affiliate status of Dex and its subsidiaries). Subject to the foregoing,
Section 5.01 would be further 

 



A-2  ---|---|---|---|--- 
    |  |

revised such that (A) the Company would be required to deliver the audited
annual financial reports, and the quarterly reports, as filed with the SEC,
of Dex, (B) the Company would deliver, in conjunction with such quarterly and
annual reports, stand-alone financial statements for the Company and its
Subsidiaries in form substantially similar in all material respects to the
financial statements of Dex filed with such reports, except that financial
statements of the Company and its subsidiaries would not be audited, (C) the
Companys financial statements so delivered would be accompanied by
a certificate of an officer certifying that such statements fairly present in
all material respects in accordance with GAAP the financial condition and
results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries (except for income
tax provisions, which would reflect an allocation to the Company and its
Subsidiaries of Dexs income tax provisions, in accordance with the tax
sharing agreement); and



 

(v) revise the definition of "Permitted Acquisition", so that amounts expended
prior to the date of the Merger (A) for acquisitions, or (B) for Voluntary
Prepayments permitted pursuant to the First Amendment or the Second Amendment
to the Loan Agreement, would not reduce or affect the maximum consideration
payable for a Permitted Acquisition.

documents evidencing the terms hereof are satisfied or waived, but not
later than 1, 2012.

and closing conditions would apply to such Loan Agreement modifications,

doubt, any period in which a Deconsolidation taxes place) and for which the
Parent Consolidated Group has an AMT liability and the SuperMedia Group would

any Tax Attributes other than Tax Attributes of SuperMedia Entities),
SuperMedia shall pay to DOS an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the AMT
liability of the Parent Consolidated Group, or (ii) such standalone
AMT liability of the SuperMedia Group, and SuperMedia shall be entitled to
the benefits of any corresponding AMT credits.

(b) Any AMT liabilities (and the corresponding credits) of the Parent

responsibility of the Dex Entities and shall be allocated among them in
accordance with the Dex TSA.

3.5 Any payments, net of any SuperMedia Rebate, required to be made under
this Article III by SuperMedia for a taxable year shall promptly be paid to

made, and any necessary adjustment shall be paid, on or before October 31 of
the year following such taxable year unless the extended due date of a
Consolidated State Tax return is after October 31, in which case the final
accounting will occur no later than 30 days following the filing of
such return.

Tax Return pursuant to which taxes are paid to a tax authority or a refund of
taxes is received from a tax authority, Parent shall prepare, in accordance
with the principles and procedures set forth in this Agreement, revised Tax
Returns, as appropriate, to reflect the adjustment or redetermination as a

take any action or enter into any transaction that results in any increased
tax liability or reduction of any Tax Attribute of the Parent Consolidated
Group or any member thereof in respect of any Pre-Deconsolidation Tax Period,
without first obtaining the written consent of the other Parties.

 



6 4.2 In the event of a Deconsolidation, Parent may, at its option, elect, and

includable member of the Parent Consolidated Group of notice in writing of any
Proceeding in respect of a Pre-Deconsolidation Period. SuperMedia shall be
entitled to participate in such Proceeding at its own expense; provided
that SuperMedia shall, following its receipt of notice of such Proceeding
from Parent, promptly notify Parent in writing of its intention to participate
in such Proceeding. In the event that SuperMedia elects to participate in any
such proceeding, Parent shall not settle or resolve any issue that could
materially affect SuperMedias liability for Taxes without SuperMedias
consent; such consent not to be unreasonably withheld conditioned or delayed.
Parent shall provide SuperMedia with copies of any correspondence received
from the taxing authorities related to any such Proceedings controlled by
Parent, as reasonably requested by SuperMedia.

4.4 Parent agrees to pay SuperMedia 100% of the actual tax benefit received by
the Parent Consolidated Group from the use in any Tax Period of a carryback of
any Tax Attribute of SuperMedia from a Post-Deconsolidation Tax Period,
determined and paid in accordance with the principles of Article III. If,
subsequent to the payment by Parent to SuperMedia of any such amount, there
shall be (i) a Final Determination which results in a disallowance or a
reduction of the Tax Attribute so carried back or (ii) a reduction in the
amount of the benefit realized by the Parent Consolidated Group as a result of
any other Tax Attribute that arises in a Post-Deconsolidation Tax
Period, SuperMedia shall (net of any out-of-pocket costs) repay Parent within
90 days of such event described in (i) or (ii) of this paragraph (an "Event"
or, collectively, the "Events") any amount which would not have been payable
to SuperMedia pursuant to this Section 4.4 had the amount of the benefit been
determined in light of the Events.

 

4.5 SuperMedia shall hold Parent harmless for any penalty or interest payable
by any member of the Parent Consolidated Group, solely as a result of any
Event. Any such amount shall be paid by SuperMedia to Parent within 90 days of
the payment by Parent or any member of the Parent Consolidated Group of any
such interest or penalty.

2\. _Services to be Provided_.

(a) _Services_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Servicer and (until completion of the Integration) SuperMedia agree
to provide to each Client Company the administrative and other services
identified in _Schedule A_ as to be performed for such Client Company
(collectively with any New Services, the " _Services_ "). The parties hereto
may, from time to time during the term of this Agreement, negotiate in good
faith for services not otherwise specifically identified in _Schedule A_
(each, a " _New Service_ "). Any agreement among the parties on the terms of
any such New Service shall be deemed to be an amendment to this Agreement and
thereafter such New Service shall be a " _Service_ " for all purposes of this
Agreement. At all times during the performance of the Services, employees of
the provider of the Services or other persons performing Services hereunder
(including any agents, temporary employees, independent third parties and
consultants) shall not be deemed to be employees of the persons receiving the
Services on account of such Services. Neither Servicer nor SuperMedia shall
be required to perform any Services hereunder that conflict with or violate
any Applicable Law or third-party rights.

 



6 (b) _Service Standard_. Servicer and (until completion of the Integration)
SuperMedia shall use the degree of skill, care and diligence in the
performance of the Services that an experienced, qualified, prudent and
reputable provider of similar services under a similar services agreement
would use acting in like circumstances in accordance with applicable industry
standards and all Applicable Laws, including all data protection and privacy
laws. Servicer and (until completion of the Integration) SuperMedia shall act
honestly and in good faith in providing the Services and shall provide the
Services to the Client Companies on a non-discriminatory basis and without
mark-up or profit by Servicer or SuperMedia; provided that the Charges and
Stewardship Costs may be marked up or provide a profit for Servicer if
required by any Applicable Tax Law.

(c) _Attorney-in-Fact_.

 

(i) Subject to _Section 2(c)(ii)_, each Client Company hereby appoints
Servicer as such Client Companys attorney-in-fact, with full authority in
the place and stead of such Client Company and in the name of such Client
Company or otherwise, from time to time in Servicers discretion, but subject
to the direction of such Client Company, to take such actions on behalf of
such Client Company as may be necessary or advisable for purposes of
performing the Services.

(ii) Anything in _Section 2(c)(i)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, Servicer is not authorized to execute this Agreement
on behalf of or as attorney-in-fact for any Client Company or to execute any
amendment, modification or waiver to or under this Agreement or any other
agreement to which Servicer is a party.

3\. _Charges for Services_.

(a) _Servicer Charges_. Each Client Company shall pay the following charges
to Servicer (the " _Charges_ ").

(i) _Direct Costs_. The Charges to each Client Company under this Agreement
shall include all: (i) of Servicers costs associated with performing a
Service that can be directly attributed to such Service for such Client
Company; (ii) of SuperMedias costs associated with performing a Service that
can be directly attributed to such Service for such Client Company (which,
after completion of the Integration, shall be zero) and (iii) costs otherwise
directly attributable to an individual Client Company (collectively, "
_Direct Costs_ ").

(ii) _Allocated Costs_. The Charges to each Client Company under this
Agreement shall include such Client Companys Allocated Share of all costs
incurred by Servicer that are not Direct Costs, including costs related to
Services that have joint benefit for two or more Client Companies and
Servicers overhead costs and costs paid by SuperMedia that have joint benefit
for two or more Client Companies (which, after completion of the Integration,
shall be zero) (collectively, " _Allocated Costs_ "). For the avoidance of
doubt, Charges allocated

 



7  to any Client Company as Direct Costs or Allocated Costs (including such
Client Companys share of any capital expenditures or capital lease
obligations incurred by Servicer) shall also be allocated to such Client
Company for financial statement purposes.

(b) _Charges to SM Client Companies_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless
otherwise agreed to by the parties, all Charges to an SM Client Company shall
be deemed to be Charges to SuperMedia.

(c) _Allocated Share_. Each Client Companys " _Allocated Share_ " for
purposes of this Agreement shall be determined as follows:

 

(i) For each Service that directly benefits a Client Company, such Client
Companys Allocated Share of the Allocated Costs for such Service shall be
equal to such Client Companys annual Net Revenue for the preceding calendar
year divided by the total applicable annual Net Revenue of all of the Client
Companies receiving the benefits of such Service for the same period (rounded
to the nearest one percent); provided that the sum of the Allocated Shares of
all Client Companies receiving the benefit of any Service must equal 100%. The
Client Companies initial Allocated Shares for Services shall be as set forth
on Schedule B. Effective on January 1st of each calendar year during the term
of this Agreement, and upon the addition or removal of any Client Company
pursuant to _Section 18_, Servicer shall reset the Client Companies
respective Allocated Shares for each Service in accordance with this _Section
3(c)(i)_. Upon final determination of any such reallocation by Servicer,
Servicer shall submit for review and approval by each Client Company
a written statement of such reallocation and the assumptions and calculations
underlying such reallocation set forth in reasonable detail. All changes to
determinations of Direct Costs, Allocated Shares and Allocated Costs shall
only apply on a prospective basis.

(ii) Each Client Companys Allocated Share for purposes of _Sections 4_ and 
_6_ shall be equal to each Client Companys Allocated Share set forth in
_Section 3(c)(i)_ for a Service that benefits all of the Client Companies.

 

(iii) (A) Not less than once every five years during the term of this
Agreement and (B) upon any acquisition or divestiture by Surviving Dex One
Corp or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries of assets accounting
(individually or in the aggregate with all other acquisitions or divestitures
from the Effective Date) for at least 10% of the consolidated revenues or
consolidated expenses of Surviving Dex One Corp and its subsidiaries (as
reasonably determined by the board of directors of Surviving Dex One Corp
acting in good faith), Servicer shall commission a nationally recognized
accounting firm or financial institution to review the fairness of the shared
Allocated Costs and the corresponding allocation methodology set forth in this
_Section 3(c)_.

 



8 (d) _Determination of Charges_. Servicer shall make all determinations and
allocations of all Direct Costs to each Client Company and the determination
of each Client Companys Allocated Share and the allocation of Allocated Costs
to each Client Company on a fair, reasonable and equitable basis in conformity
with the principles set forth herein and as may be required by Applicable
Law. For the avoidance of doubt, Servicers costs to be included in the Direct
Costs and Allocated Costs shall include any and all costs of Servicer in
performing the Services and otherwise in operating its business, including
costs for labor, material, third-party services, overhead, taxes, legal
services and information technology; provided, however, that in no event shall
costs included in Direct Costs, Allocated Costs or Stewardship Costs include
the allocation of indebtedness for borrowed money or interest expense in
respect thereof.

4.  _Stewardship Services and Costs_. Surviving Dex One Corp and (until
completion of the Integration) SuperMedia provide certain services to Servicer
and the other Client Companies that are not directly beneficial to Servicer or
any individual Client Company, but which indirectly benefit all of Servicer
and the other Client Companies, as further identified in _Schedule C_
(collectively with any New Stewardship Services, the " _Stewardship Services_
"). The parties hereto may, from time to time during the term of this
Agreement, negotiate in good faith for services not otherwise specifically
identified in _Schedule C_ (each, a " _New Stewardship Service_ "). Any
agreement among the parties on the terms of any such New Stewardship Service
shall be deemed to be an amendment to this Agreement and thereafter such New
Stewardship Service shall be a " _Stewardship Service_ " for all purposes of
this Agreement. Surviving Dex One Corp and (until completion of the
Integration) SuperMedia incur certain costs associated with the Stewardship
Services (collectively, " _Stewardship Costs_ "). Servicer shall, on behalf of
Surviving Dex One Corp, pay all of the Stewardship Costs incurred by
Surviving Dex One Corp. Until completion of the Integration, SuperMedia,
pursuant to _Section 5(b), _shall receive a credit for Stewardship Costs that
SuperMedia incurs. Each Client Company other than Surviving Dex One Corp
shall pay Servicer an amount equal to such Client Companys Allocated Share of
the Stewardship Costs.

5.  _Payment_.

(a) _Daily Cash Settlements_. Each Client Company shall reimburse Servicer for
such Client Companys associated Charges and Allocated Share of the
Stewardship Costs, in each case, in accordance with _Schedule D_.

(b) _SuperMedia Credit for Provided Services_. Until completion of the
Integration, Servicer shall credit SuperMedia for amounts paid for by
SuperMedia for its costs associated with performing a Service that can be
directly attributed to a Service for a Client Company, with a Service that has
a joint benefit for two or more Client Companies or for Stewardship Costs
incurred by SuperMedia. Such credit shall be used in the
monthly reconciliation described in _Section 5(c)_.

(c) _Monthly Reconciliation_. Within thirty (30) days after the end of each
calendar month, Servicer shall submit for review and approval by each Client
Company a written statement of such Client Companys Charges and Allocated
Share of the reimbursement of Stewardship Costs (and, with respect to
SuperMedia, SuperMedias credit for the amount set forth in _Section 5(b)_)
for such prior month. This monthly reconciliation statement shall include the
following information for the relevant period: 

 



9  (i) Charges for Services as described in _Section 3_; (ii) daily cash
settlement amounts as described in _Section 5(a)_; (iii) Services that have
not yet been paid in cash by Servicer; (iv) Stewardship Cost reimbursement
amounts as described in _Section 4_; (v) credit given for costs paid by such
Client Company pursuant to _Section 5(b)_ (if applicable); and (vi)
overpayment or underpayment amounts as defined in _Section 5(d)_. Charges
that have not resulted in actual cash disbursements shall reside in their
respective intercompany accounts until such time as the Charges have been paid
by Servicer. Solely with respect to SuperMedia, until completion of the
Integration, the excess of SuperMedias Charges and Allocated Share of the
reimbursement of Stewardship Costs over SuperMedias credit for the amount set
forth in _Section 5(b)_ shall be transferred from SuperMedia to Servicer (if
such difference is positive) or from Servicer to SuperMedia (if such
difference is negative) within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar
month.

 

(d) _Settlement of Monthly Reconciliation_. Each Client Company may request a
written report from Servicer setting forth, in reasonable detail, the nature
of the Services rendered and costs incurred and other relevant information to
support the Charges and Stewardship Cost reimbursements (and, if applicable,
credit given) included in the monthly reconciliation statement as described
in _Section 5(c)_. If the Charges and Stewardship Cost reimbursements for a
Client Company (as adjusted for any credit given) in such written statement
are lower than the actual Charges and Stewardship Cost reimbursements paid
(as adjusted for any credit given) by such Client Company during such prior
month, the amount of the difference shall be applied as a credit to the next
days settlements pursuant to _Section 5(a)_ until fully consumed; provided,
that to the extent such credit is not fully applied to Charges and Stewardship
Cost reimbursements within three (3) Business Days (or after the occurrence
and during the continuation of an Event of Default, one Business Day) of such
written statement, Servicer shall reimburse such Client Company for the
remaining amount of such credit in cash. If the Charges and Stewardship Cost
reimbursements for a Client Company (as adjusted for any credit given) in such
written statement are higher than the actual Charges and Stewardship Cost
reimbursements paid (as adjusted for any credit given) by such Client Company
during such prior month, the amount of the difference shall be paid no later
than the next business day by such Client Company to Servicer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the amount of the overpayment or
underpayment of any Client Company in any month is less than $100,000, no
settlement payment or credit shall be made and the amount of such overpayment
or underpayment will be rolled forward to be considered in the next months
reconciliation until such time as the cumulative amount of such overpayment or
underpayment exceeds $100,000, at which time such difference shall be paid
or credited as set forth above.

(e) _Annual Non-Cash Settlements_. For each year during the term of
this Agreement and no later than the earlier of (i) 10 days after the date
that Surviving Dex One Corp is required to file a report on Form 10-K with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in compliance with the reporting
requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (whether or not Surviving Dex One Corp is so subject to such
reporting requirements), and (ii) 90 days after the end of each fiscal year of
Surviving Dex One Corp, Servicer shall provide each Client Company with a
written statement of all non-cash Charges and Stewardship Cost reimbursements
for the

 



10  previous calendar year for each Client Company. Settlement of such non-cash
Charges and Stewardship Cost reimbursements shall be handled by the parties
with non-cash dividends or similar distributions or contributions that do not
involve the transfer of property.

6\. _Funding Accounts_. Servicer shall establish one or more funding accounts
for making payment of the Client Companies obligations on behalf of the
Client Companies pursuant to the performance of the Services and Stewardship
Services (each, a " _Funding Account_ ", and collectively, the " _Funding
Accounts_ "). The initial Funding Account established pursuant to this
_Section 6_ prior to the Effective Date (the " _Primary Funding Account_ ")
was initially pre-funded with $5 million. After the Effective Date, Servicer
may elect to fund any Funding Account with a portion of the funds then
maintained in any other Funding Account; provided, that at no time shall the
aggregate closing balance of all of the Funding Accounts, exclusive of
additional funding amounts maintained in the Funding Accounts pursuant to the
next succeeding sentence, exceed $5 million. From time to time, if Servicer
determines in its reasonable discretion that additional funding for any
Funding Account is needed to continue to make payments of the Client
Companies obligations on behalf of the Client Companies pursuant to the
performance of the Services and Stewardship Services, Servicer shall provide
the Client Companies with written notice of the same setting forth such
additional funding amount, and promptly after receipt of such notice each
Client Company shall pay its Allocated Share of such additional funding amount
to Servicer; provided, that Servicer shall not request any such additional
funding by the Client Companies in an aggregate amount exceeding the aggregate
amount of Charges and reimbursements of Stewardship Costs to be made by the
Client Companies during the period of two (2) Business Days following such
additional funding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at no time shall the daily
aggregate closing balance of all of the Funding Accounts exceed $25 million.
Servicer shall be permitted to invest the funds in the Funding Accounts in
Permitted Investments. Servicer shall have no liability to any Client Company
for any losses associated with any Permitted Investment made by Servicer. Any
proceeds from any Permitted Investment made with funds from the any Funding
Account shall be quantified on a monthly basis and applied as a credit to
each Client Company in the next days settlements pursuant to _Section 5(a)_,
each such credit to be equal to each Client Companys Allocated Share of such
proceeds at the date of determination. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Servicer will not establish (and an SM Client Company need not fund) a Funding
Account for an SM Client Company until the Integration is completed, at which
time Funding Accounts will be established and funded by such SM Client
Companies with a reasonable amount of cash.

7\. _Contributions / Distributions of Services Assets_. From time to time, a
Client Company may, through one or more transactions, contribute and/or
distribute certain Services Assets to Servicer. All such contributions and
distributions of Services Assets shall be conducted pursuant to separate
agreement(s) or transaction(s) between the parties; provided that after the
date of the contribution or distribution of all of the applicable Services
Assets set forth on _Schedule E_ for a Client Company, such Client Company
shall not make any contribution or distribution of any Services Asset that
was thereafter acquired by such Client Company in contemplation of such
contribution or distribution. The parties intend that such contributions and
distributions shall include the Services Assets listed on _Schedule E_. For
the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall constitute a warranty from any
Client Company with respect to such Services Assets or the contribution or
distribution of such Services Assets to Servicer. 

 



11 8\. _Reports_. Without limiting _Section 5(b)_, Servicer shall provide
each Client Company all reports reasonably requested by such Client Company
and which Servicer reasonably determines that it can provide. Servicer will
provide such reports with the frequencies agreed upon by the applicable
parties.

 

9\. _Accounting Records and Documents_. Servicer shall be responsible for
maintaining full and accurate books, accounts and records (" _Books_ ") of
all Services and Stewardship Servicers rendered pursuant to or associated with
this Agreement and all Direct Costs, Allocated Costs and Stewardship Costs.

 

10\. _Additional Obligations of the Client Companies_.

 

(a) _Instructions and Information_. Each Client Company acknowledges that some
of the Services to be provided hereunder require instructions and information
(including access to Client Company Materials) from such Client Company, which
such Client Company shall provide to Servicer in sufficient time for Servicer
to provide or procure such Services. Any failure by Servicer to provide any
Service due to any delay by any Client Company in providing such instructions
or information shall not be considered a breach of Servicers obligations
herein, and Servicer shall have the right to suspend the performance of any
affected Service until such instruction or information is provided. Servicer
shall treat all such instructions and information as Confidential Information
of the applicable Client Company.

 

(b) _Client Company Materials_. Each Client Company retains all right, title
and interest in and to its Client Company Material. Each Client Company
hereby grants to Servicer a worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up, non-
exclusive, nontransferable license to access, use, display and make derivative
works of its Client Company Material solely to the extent necessary to
provide the Services. This license: (i) shall be limited to the term of this
Agreement (including any period pursuant to which Servicer is providing
transition assistance to such Client Company pursuant to  _Section 13(a)_;
and (ii) with respect to any third-party owned Client Company Material, is
granted solely to the extent permissible under the applicable third-party
agreement. Servicer shall have administrative responsibility for obtaining
and maintaining all consents and licenses for Servicers access and use of any
Client Company Material that may be necessary for Servicer in providing the
Services, and each Client Company shall cooperate with Servicer in
obtaining and maintain such consents and licenses and such Client Company
shall pay all costs associated therewith with respect to its Client Company
Material.

11\. _Term_. This Agreement shall be effective as of the Effective Date, and
shall continue in full force and effect with respect to Servicer and all
Client Companies until terminated with respect to any or all Client Companies
in accordance with _Section 12_.

12\. _Termination_.

 

(a) _Termination for Convenience_. Any party hereto (the " _Terminating Party_
") may terminate this Agreement with respect to its rights and obligations
hereunder for convenience by providing at least sixty (60) days prior written
notice to, in the case of Servicer, any or all of the Client Companies, or in
the case of any Client Company, Servicer (in either case, the " _Other Party_
").

 



12 (b) _Termination upon Bankruptcy or Insolvency or Discontinuance
of Business_. This Agreement may be terminated by the Terminating Party by
providing at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Other Party
if the Other Party: (i) becomes bankrupt or insolvent, or if the business of
the Other Party is placed in the hands of a receiver or trustee, whether by
voluntary act or otherwise; or (ii) liquidates its assets, dissolves or
otherwise winds up its affairs.

 

13\. _Consequences of Termination_.

(a) _Transition Assistance_. Upon termination of this Agreement with respect
to any Client Company, Servicer shall, upon such Client Companys request,
provide such Client Company with cooperation and assistance in transitioning
the Services provided hereunder to a new service provider or to providing the
Services internally. Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement, during
the period when such transition assistance is being provided, the applicable
Client Company shall continue to pay the Charges for such transition
assistance and any other Services provided in accordance with _Section 3_.

 

(b) _Distribution of the Funding Account Accounts_. Promptly following
termination of this Agreement with respect to any Client Company, Servicer
shall pay to such Client Company such Client Companys Allocated Share of the
funds available in the Funding Account Accounts as of the effective date of
such termination that are in excess of the then-outstanding obligations that
Servicer is required to pay from such funds.

14\. _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) _General_. The receiving party (the " _Recipient_ ") shall not disclose to
any third party such Confidential Information of any other party (the "
_Disclosing Party_ ") disclosed to the Recipient by the Disclosing Party in
connection with the Disclosing Partys performance of this Agreement and shall
not use such Confidential Information other than for purposes of the
Recipients performance under or exercise of its rights pursuant to this
Agreement.

(b) _Employees and Agents_. Each Recipient shall ensure that only its
contractors, distributors, representatives, agents, officers and employees who
have a need to have access to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing
Party for purposes of such Recipients performance under or exercise of its
rights pursuant to this Agreement shall be permitted to have access to such
Confidential Information. Each Recipient shall cause its contractors,
distributors, officers, representatives, agents and employees who shall have
access to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party not to disclose
to any third party any such Confidential Information and not to use
such Confidential Information other than for the purposes of such Recipients
performance under or exercise of its rights pursuant to this Agreement.

 



13 (c) _Excluded Information_. The undertakings of non-disclosure and non-use in
this _Section 14_ shall not apply to information or material which the
Recipient demonstrates:

(i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of
any act or omission on the part of the Recipient or any contractor,
distributor, representative, agent, officer or employee of the Recipient;

(ii) was available to the Recipient on a non-confidential basis prior to its
disclosure by the Disclosing Party;

(iii) becomes available to the Recipient from a Person other than the
Disclosing Party who is not, to the Recipients knowledge, subject to any
legally binding obligation to keep such disclosed information confidential; or
was independently developed by the Recipient without reference to the
disclosed information.

 

(d) _Compelled Disclosure_. If a Recipient is compelled by court decree,
subpoena or other Applicable Law to disclose any of the Confidential
Information of the Disclosing Party, it shall promptly notify the Disclosing
Party in writing and use reasonable good faith efforts to: (i) disclose only
the specific Confidential Information legally required to be disclosed and
only to the extent required; and (i i) assist the Disclosing Party (if and to
the extent requested by the Disclosing Party), at the Disclosing Partys
expense, in obtaining a protective order or other appropriate assurances
that the confidential nature of such Confidential Information shall be
protected and preserved.

15\. _Indemnification_. Servicer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each Client Company and its directors, officers and agents (collectively, the
" _Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all third-party claims,
suits, actions, liabilities, fines, penalties, costs, losses, damages and
expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys and other
reasonable costs of investigation and defense), whether incurred by or
asserted against such Indemnified Parties arising out of or resulting from
the intentional tort, reckless conduct, gross negligence or bad faith
(including dishonest, fraudulent or criminal acts or omissions) on the part of
Servicer in performing or failing to perform its obligations hereunder.

 

16\. _Limitation on Liability_. IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY HERETO BE LIABLE
HEREUNDER FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR
PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST OR ANTICIPATED REVENUES OR PROFITS RELATING
TO THE SAME) ARISING FROM ANY CLAIM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
PROVISION OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED HEREUNDER,
WHETHER SUCH CLAIM IS BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE
OR STRICT LIABILITY) OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY IS ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OR LIKELIHOOD OF THE SAME. IN ADDITION, SERVICER SHALL HAVE NO
LIABILITY TO ANY CLIENT COMPANY WITH RESPECT TO THE PERFORMANCE OF OR FAILURE
TO PERFORM ANY STEWARDSHIP SERVICE.

 



14 17\. _Representations and Warranties; Disclaimer_.

 

(a) _Servicer Warranties_. Servicer hereby represents and warrants to each
Client Company that: (i) it is an entity validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation; and
(ii) it has all requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and perform
its obligations under this Agreement.

 

(b) _Client Companies Warranties_. Each Client Company hereby represents and
warrants to Servicer that: (i) it is an entity validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation; and
(i i) it has all requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and perform
its obligations under this Agreement.

 

(c) _Disclaimer_. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NO
WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, ARE MADE OR CREATED AMONG
THE PARTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE,
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

 

18\. _Changes in Parties_. New direct or indirect subsidiaries of Surviving
Dex One Corp, which come into existence after the Effective Date, may become
additional Client Companies upon mutual agreement of the parties, including
agreement of any initial payment to the Primary Funding Account to be made by
such additional Client Companies, and shall thereafter constitute " _Client
Companies_ " for all purposes of this Agreement. In addition, any Client
Company that no longer is a direct or indirect subsidiary of Surviving Dex One
Corp shall no longer be considered a party to this Agreement, and thereafter
Servicer shall no longer have an obligation to provide Services to or on
behalf of such former Client Company. For the avoidance of doubt, any
agreement among the parties relating to the addition of a new Client Company
shall constitute an amendment to this Agreement.

19\. _Miscellaneous Provisions_.

 

(a) _Notices_. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be
delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be

(b) _Amendment and Restatement; Entire Agreement; Amendment_. This Agreement
amends and restates the Original Agreement in its entirety. From and after
the Effective Date, this Agreement shall supersede the Original Agreement in
its entirety. Further, this Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement
among the parties with respect to the rights and responsibilities set forth
herein and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, whether written
or verbal, to the extent such agreements pertain to the rights and
responsibilities set forth herein. This Agreement may be 

 



18  amended only in a writing executed by all parties; provided that Servicer
and any Client Company may amend Schedule A with respect to the provision of a
Service solely to such Client Company without the written consent of the
other parties.

(c) _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws (as opposed to
the conflicts of law provisions) of the State of New York. Each of the parties
agrees that all disputes, controversies or claims arising out of or relating
to this Agreement, or the validity, interpretation, breach or termination of
this Agreement, including claims seeking redress or asserting rights under any
Applicable Law, shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts
residing within the State of New York, and the appellate courts having
jurisdiction with respect to appeals from such courts, and each of the parties
irrevocably and unconditionally submits to personnel jurisdiction in such
courts, and waives any objection to such venue or jurisdiction or to
inconveniency of such courts.

(d) _Subcontractors; Assignment_. 

(i) With the consent of the Client Companies, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, Servicer may hire or engage one or more subcontractors
or other third parties to perform any or all of its obligations under this
Agreement; provided, that Servicer remains ultimately responsible for all of
its obligations hereunder; provided, further, that the terms of any such
engagement or hiring of any Affiliate of the Servicer, Surviving Dex One Corp
or their respective Subsidiaries shall be on terms and conditions not less
favorable, considered as a whole, to Servicer and the Client Companies than
could be obtained on an arms-length basis from unrelated third parties.

(ii) Except as permitted by  _Section 19(d)(i)_, no party hereto may assign
or transfer, by operation of law or otherwise, this Agreement or any of its
rights hereunder, and may not delegate any of its duties or obligations
hereunder, in each case in whole or in part, without the prior written
consent of, in the case of Servicer, all of the Client Companies, or in the
case of any Client Company, Servicer. Any assignment or delegation made in
violation of this _Section 19(d)(ii)_ shall be void and of no effect.
Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding on the parties
hereto and their permitted successors and assigns.

(e) _Independent Contractor_. Except as set forth in _Section 2(c)_: (i) the
relationship among the parties, as established by this Agreement, is solely
that of independent contractors; (ii) no party may assume or create any
obligation, representation, warranty or guarantee, express or implied, on
behalf of any other party for any purpose whatsoever; and (iii) nothing in
this Agreement shall be deemed to make any party the agent of another other
party hereto. This Agreement does not create any partnership, joint venture or
similar business relationship between the parties hereto.

 

(f) _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Section 15_ with
respect to the Indemnified Parties, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of
the parties hereto and their permitted successors and assigns, and nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
other person or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



19 (g) _Severability_. Wherever possible, each provision hereof shall
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under Applicable L
aw, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall, for
any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect,
such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the extent, of
such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without invalidating the
remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions or
any other provisions hereof, unless such a construction would be
unreasonable.

(h) _Force Majeure_. Except for each Client Companys obligations to pay
Charges and Stewardship Cost reimbursements herein, each party hereto shall be
excused from any performance required hereunder if such performance is
rendered impossible or unfeasible due to any catastrophe or other major
event beyond its reasonable control, including: (i) war, riot, acts of
terrorism and insurrection; (i i) Applicable Law; (iii) strikes, lockouts and
other serious labor disputes; (iv) floods, fires, explosions and other natural
disasters; (v) any delay of sources to supply materials and equipment; (vi)
government priorities; and (vii) labor or transportation problems. When such
events have abated, the parties respective obligations hereunder shall
resume. 

(i) _Interpretation_. For purposes of this Agreement: (i) the words "
_include,_ " " _includes_ " and " _including_ " shall be deemed to be
followed by the words " _without limitation;_ " (ii) the word " _or_ " is not
exclusive; and (iii) the words " _herein,_ " " _hereof,_ " " _hereby,_ " "
_hereto_ " and " _hereunder_ " refer to this Agreement as a whole. Unless the
context otherwise requires, references herein: (1) to Sections and Schedules
mean the Sections of and the Schedules attached to this Agreement; (2) to a
contract, instrument or other document means such contract, instrument or
other document as amended, supplemented and modified from time to time to the
extent permitted by the provisions thereof and by this Agreement; and (3) to a
statute means such statute as amended from time to time and includes any
successor legislation thereto and regulations promulgated thereunder. The
Schedules referred to herein shall be construed with and as an integral part
of this Agreement to the same extent as if they were set forth verbatim
herein. Headings to Sections are inserted for convenience of reference only
and shall not be deemed a part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. This Agreement shall be construed without regard to any
presumption or rule requiring construction or interpretation against the party
drafting an instrument or causing any instrument to be drafted.

(j) _Counterparts_. This Agreement is legally binding when, but not until,
each party has received from the others a counterpart of this Agreement
signed by an authorized representative of such other parties. The parties
representatives may sign separate, identical counterparts of this Agreement;
taken together, they constitute one agreement. A signed counterpart of this
document may be delivered by any reasonable means, including facsimile or
other electronic transmission.
