                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

         AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the "Agreement"), dated as of August 11,
2004, by and between National-Oilwell, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"),
and Varco International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

         WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company
have approved the merger of the Company into Parent on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each issued share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") not
owned by Parent or the Company shall be converted into shares of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") as set forth in
this Agreement;

         WHEREAS, in order to effectuate the foregoing, the Company, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the
Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), will merge with and into Parent,
with Parent surviving the merger (the "Merger"); and

         WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, the Company and Parent intend
that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below, the
parties agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I.
                                   THE MERGER

         Section 1.01 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL,
at the Effective Time, the Company shall merge with and into Parent, the
separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease and Parent shall
continue as the surviving corporation. Parent, as the surviving corporation
after the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Surviving
Corporation."

         Section 1.02 Effective Time of the Merger. As early as practicable on
the Closing Date, the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger or
other appropriate documents (in any such case, the "Certificate of Merger")
substantially in the form as set forth in Exhibit A to be executed and, as
applicable, acknowledged in accordance with, the provisions of Section 251 of
the DGCL. At or prior to consummation of the Merger, the parties shall make all
other filings, recordings or publications required under the DGCL in connection
with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at 4:00 p.m., Houston time,
on the date of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware
Secretary of State in accordance with the DGCL, or at such other time as the
parties may agree and specify in such filings in accordance with applicable Law
(the time the Merger becomes effective being the "Effective Time").

         Section 1.03 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will
take place at 10:00 a.m., Houston time, on a date to be specified by the Company
and Parent, which shall be no later than the second Business Day after
satisfaction of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth



                                       1
<PAGE>

in Sections 7.01, 7.02(a) and 7.02(b) (other than the delivery of the officers'
certificate referred to therein) and 7.03(a) and 7.03(b) (other than the
delivery of the officers' certificate referred to therein) (provided that the
other closing conditions set forth in Article VII have been met or waived as
provided in Article VII at or prior to the Closing) (the "Closing Date"), at the
corporate offices of the Company at the address indicated in Section 9.02 unless
another date, place or time is agreed to in writing by the Company and Parent.

         Section 1.04 Effects of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect
of the Merger shall be as provided by applicable Law, including the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Parent will vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all of the
debts, Liabilities and duties of the Company and Parent will become the debts,
Liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

         Section 1.05 Certificate of Incorporation; and Bylaws. Effective at the
Effective Time, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement the
Parent Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall, without any
further action of Parent or its stockholders, be amended to (i) change the name
of Parent to "National Oilwell Varco, Inc." and (ii) increase the number of
authorized shares of Parent Common Stock to Five Hundred and Ten Million and One
(510,000,001) shares, and Parent shall file the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with applicable
provisions of the DGCL. At the Effective time, the Parent Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, as contemplated by this Section 1.05, shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. The by-laws of
Parent, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law.

                                   ARTICLE II.
                            CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

         Section 2.01 Conversion of Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
shares of capital stock of the Company or Parent:

                  (a) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. All
shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock
and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no stock of
Parent or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

                  (b) Exchange Ratio for Company Common Stock. Subject to
Section 2.02, each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other
than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(a)) shall be
converted into 0.8363 of a share (the "Exchange Ratio") of Parent Common Stock.
All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock and any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with
Section 2.02,



                                       2
<PAGE>

without interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock
or Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, or
any similar event shall have occurred, or any Company Rights are exercised, then
the Exchange Ratio contemplated shall be correspondingly adjusted to provide to
Parent and the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

         Section 2.02 Exchange of Certificates. The procedures for exchanging
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for certificates representing shares
of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger are as follows:

                  (a) Exchange Agent. At the Effective Time, Parent shall make
available to a bank or trust company designated by Parent and the Company (the
"Exchange Agent"), in trust for the benefit of the holders of certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.02, through
the Exchange Agent, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock
and an estimated amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares (such certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto, and cash in lieu of fractional shares being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") issuable pursuant to Section
2.01 upon conversion of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. The Exchange
Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be the
property of, and be paid to, Parent.

                  (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Certificates") whose shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.01 into shares
of Parent Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall
pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be
in such form and have such other provisions as the Company and Parent may
reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent Common
Stock (plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, of Parent Common Stock as
provided below). Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent or to
such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock into which the holder's shares of Company Common
Stock were converted pursuant to Section 2.01(b) and a check representing cash
in lieu of fractional shares which the holder has the right to receive pursuant
to Section 2.02(e), and the Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate
representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined in
accordance with Section 2.01(b) and a check representing cash in lieu of
fractional shares which the holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section
2.02(e) may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate



                                       3
<PAGE>

representing such Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender, a certificate representing shares of Parent Common
Stock into which the holders of shares of Company Common Stock were converted
pursuant to Section 2.01(b) and a check representing cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as contemplated by Section 2.02(e).

                  (c) Treatment of Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record
date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the certificates representing shares of Parent
Common Stock represented thereby that the holder would be entitled to upon
surrender of such Certificate and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares
shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to subsection (e) below, until the
holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with
this Section 2.02. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following surrender
of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the Certificates
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash
payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to subsection (e) below and the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time previously
paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date
subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock. For purposes of determining quorums at meetings of stockholders of
Parent and the stockholders of Parent entitled to notice of, and to vote at,
meetings of stockholders, holders of unsurrendered Certificates shall be
considered record holders of the shares of Parent Common Stock represented
thereby.

                  (d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All
shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof and any cash paid pursuant to
subsection (c) or (e) of this Section 2.02 shall be deemed to have been issued
or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company
Common Stock represented thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Surviving
Corporation is obligated to pay any dividends or make any other distributions
with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or
made by the Company on shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement (to the extent permitted under Section 5.01) prior to
the date hereof and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. From and after
the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock which
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Section 2.02.

                  (e) No Fractional Shares. No certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger or upon
the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share interests
will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger
who would otherwise



                                       4

have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
(after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such
fractional amount multiplied by the average of the last reported sales prices of
Parent Common Stock, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), on
each of the ten trading days immediately preceding the date of the Effective
Time.

                  (f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for 180 days
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or otherwise on the
instruction of the Surviving Corporation, and any holders of Certificates who
have not previously complied with this Section 2.02 shall thereafter look only
to Parent for the certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock, any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock to which such holders are
entitled pursuant to Sections 2.01 and 2.02. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for five years after
the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as the
Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat or become the property of any public
official or government) shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest
of any holders of Certificates previously entitled thereto.

                  (g) No Liability. None of Parent, the Exchange Agent or any
party hereto shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common
Stock for any portion of the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

                  (h) Withholding Rights. Each of the Exchange Agent and Parent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former holder of shares of Company
Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Parent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Parent.

                  (i) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the certificate representing the shares of Parent Common
Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares, and unpaid dividends and
distributions on the certificate deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.

         Section 2.03 Associated Rights. References in this Agreement to Company
Common Stock shall include, unless the context requires otherwise, the
associated Preferred Share Purchase Rights ("Company Rights") issued pursuant to
the Rights Agreement, dated as of November 29, 2000, as amended (the "Rights
Agreement"), between the Company and ChaseMellon Shareholders Services, L.L.C.,
a New Jersey limited liability company, as Rights Agent.

                                  ARTICLE III.
                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

         The Company represents and warrants to Parent that the statements
contained in this Article III are true and correct except as set forth herein
and in the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent on or before the
date of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter"). The Company Disclosure
Letter shall be arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and
lettered paragraphs contained in this Article III and the disclosure in any
paragraph shall qualify other paragraphs in this Article III only to the extent
that it is reasonably apparent from a reading of such disclosure that it also
qualifies or applies to such other paragraphs.

         Section 3.01 Organization of the Company. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is a corporation or unincorporated entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization, has all requisite corporate or entity power to
own, lease and operate its property and to carry on its business as now being
conducted and as proposed to be conducted, and is duly qualified to do business
and is in good standing as a foreign corporation or organization in each
jurisdiction in which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in
Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries directly or indirectly owns any equity or similar interest
in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any
corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business association or entity,
excluding securities in any publicly traded company held for investment by the
Company or its Subsidiaries and comprising less than five percent (5%) of the
outstanding stock of such company.

         Section 3.02 Company Capital Structure.

                  (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of
200,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of Preferred
Stock, par value $.01 per share ("Company Preferred Stock"), of which 2,000,000
shares have been designated as "Series A Participating Preferred Stock". As of
August 9, 2004, (i) 97,283,455 shares of Company Common Stock were issued and
outstanding, all of which are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, (ii)
no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding, and (iii)
3,071,380 shares of Company Common Stock and no shares of Company Preferred
Stock were held in the treasury of the Company or by Subsidiaries of the
Company. The Company Disclosure Letter shows the number of shares of Company
Common Stock reserved for future issuance pursuant to warrants, stock options
and other stock awards, and restricted stock awards granted and outstanding as
of August 9, 2004 under the 2003 Equity Participation Plan, the Amended and
Restated Stock Option Plan for Key Employees of Tuboscope Vetco International
Corporation, the Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors, the 1990 Stock
Option Plan and the 1994 Directors' Stock Option Plan, in each case, as amended
(collectively, the "Company Stock Plans"). Except for the issuance of shares of
Company Common Stock in connection with Company Stock Plans (including the
exercise of warrants, stock options or other stock awards thereunder), or
pursuant to the Varco International, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
"Company Stock Purchase Plan"), or except as set forth in the Company Disclosure
Letter, no change in such capitalization has occurred between August 9, 2004 and
the date of this Agreement. All shares of Company Common Stock subject to
issuance as specified above are duly authorized and, upon issuance on the terms
and conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable,
shall be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. There are no obligations,
contingent or otherwise, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem



                                       6
<PAGE>

or otherwise acquire any shares of Company Common Stock or the capital stock of
any Subsidiary or to provide funds to or make any material investment (in the
form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any such Subsidiary or any
other entity other than guarantees of obligations of Subsidiaries entered into
in the ordinary course of business. The Company has not repurchased any
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock since July 3, 2004. All of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of each of the Company's Subsidiaries are
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and all such
shares (other than directors' qualifying shares in the case of foreign
Subsidiaries) are owned by the Company or another Subsidiary of the Company free
and clear of all Liens, agreements or limitations on the Company's voting
rights.

                  (b) As of the date hereof, except as set forth in this Section
3.02 or as reserved for future grants of securities under the Company Stock
Plans and Company Stock Purchase Plan, and except for Company Rights issued and
issuable pursuant to the Rights Agreement and 2,000,000 shares of Series A
Participating Preferred Stock of the Company reserved for issuance upon the
exercise of Company Rights, there are no equity securities of any class of the
Company or any security exchangeable into or exercisable for such equity
securities, issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. As of the date hereof,
except as set forth in this Section 3.02, there are no options, warrants, equity
securities, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any character to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it is bound
obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or
cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or obligating the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to grant, extend, accelerate the vesting of or enter into any such
option, warrant, equity security, call, right, commitment or agreement. To the
best knowledge of the Company, there are no voting trusts, proxies or other
voting agreements or understandings with respect to the shares of capital stock
of the Company.

         Section 3.03 Authority; No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

                  (a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the
Company have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part
of the Company, subject only to the approval of this Agreement and the Merger by
the Company's stockholders under the DGCL. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by the Company and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of
the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of
general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general
equity principles (the "Bankruptcy and Equity Exception"). On or prior to the
date hereof, the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously adopted
resolutions that have (i) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
Merger, (ii) directed that this Agreement and the Merger be submitted to the
Company's stockholders for adoption at a meeting of such stockholders and (iii)
recommended that the stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement and the
Merger (with respect to subclause (iii), the "Company Recommendation"), and such
resolutions, as of the date of this Agreement, have not been subsequently
rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any way. The Company stockholder vote
required for the adoption of this Agreement and the Merger shall be a majority
of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding on the record date for the
Company Stockholders' Meeting (the "Company Stockholder Approval").

<PAGE>

                  (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
will not, (i) conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, any
provision of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company, (ii)
except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, result in any violation or
breach of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) a
default (or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of
any obligation, give rise to any obligation to make an offer to purchase any
debt instrument or give rise to any loss of any material benefit) under, or
require a consent or waiver under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of
any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, contract or other agreement,
instrument or obligation to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or by which any of them or any of their properties or assets may be bound,
or (iii) conflict with or violate any permit, concession, franchise, license,
judgment, order, decree, Law or ordinance applicable to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of its or their properties or assets, except in the case
of (ii) and (iii) for any such conflicts, violations, defaults, terminations,
cancellations or accelerations which are not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                  (c) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, any court, administrative agency or
commission or other governmental authority or instrumentality ("Governmental
Entity") is required by or with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except for (i) the
filing of the pre-merger notification report under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended ("HSR Act"), (ii) the filing of
the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State, (iii) the filing
of the Joint Proxy Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act"), (iv) such consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
registrations, declarations and filings as may be required under applicable
state securities Laws and the Laws of any foreign country and the European
Union, and (v) such other consents, authorizations, filings, approvals and
registrations which, if not obtained or made, would not be reasonably likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 3.04 SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

                  (a) The Company has filed and made available to Parent all
forms, reports and documents required to be filed by the Company with the SEC
since January 1, 2001 other than registration statements on Form S-8
(collectively, the "Company SEC Reports"). Company SEC Reports (i) at the time
filed, complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the Exchange Act,
as the case may be, and (ii) did not at the time they were filed (or if amended
or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date
of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact required to be stated in such Company SEC Reports or necessary
in order to make the statements in such Company SEC Reports, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of the Company's
Subsidiaries is required to file any forms, reports or other documents with the
SEC.

                  (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including,
in each case, any related notes) contained in Company SEC Reports complied as to
form in all material respects with the applicable published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, was prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes to such
financial statements or, in the



                                       8
<PAGE>

case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and fairly
presented the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the dates and the consolidated results of their operations
and cash flows for the periods indicated, except that the unaudited interim
financial statements were or are subject to normal and recurring year-end
adjustments which were not or are not expected to be material in amount. The
audited balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2003 is referred to
herein as the "Company Balance Sheet." For each period covered by the Company
SEC Reports, the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries have
been, and are being, maintained, in all material respects, in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied, and all other
legal and accounting requirements.

         Section 3.05 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as disclosed in Company
SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, and except for normal or recurring
Liabilities incurred since December 31, 2003 in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practices, the Company and its Subsidiaries do not have any
Liabilities, either accrued, contingent or otherwise (whether or not required to
be reflected in financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles), and whether due or to become due, which individually or
in the aggregate are reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

         Section 3.06 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as disclosed
in Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, since the date of the
Company Balance Sheet, the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their
businesses only in the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past
practice. Since the date of the Company Balance Sheet, there has not been (i)
any material adverse change in the financial condition, results of operations,
business or properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
any development or combination of developments of which the management of the
Company is aware that, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or is
reasonably likely to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect; (ii) any damage,
destruction or loss (whether or not covered by insurance) with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries having a Company Material Adverse Effect;
(iii) except as disclosed in Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof,
any material change by the Company in its accounting methods, principles or
practices to which Parent has not previously consented in writing; (iv) except
as disclosed in Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, any
revaluation by the Company of any of its assets having a Company Material
Adverse Effect; or (v) except as disclosed in Company SEC Reports filed prior to
the date hereof, any material elections with respect to Taxes by the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company or settlement or compromise by the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company of any material Tax Liability or refund.

         Section 3.07 Taxes.

                  (a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed
with the appropriate Tax authorities all Tax Returns required to be filed by
them (taking into account extensions), except for any such returns which are not
reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. All such Tax Returns are complete and correct in all respects,
except for any such omissions or errors which are not reasonably likely,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have paid (or the
Company has paid on its Subsidiaries' behalf) all Taxes shown as due on all Tax
Returns described in Section 3.07(a) herein or otherwise due by the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries, except to the extent that



                                       9
<PAGE>

such taxes otherwise due are not reasonable likely, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company's most recent
consolidated financial statements reflect an adequate reserve for all Taxes
(excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect differences
between book and Tax income) payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries for all
taxable periods and portions thereof through the date of such financial
statements, except to the extent that any such Taxes are not reasonably likely,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                  (c) Neither the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") nor any
other Tax authority has asserted any claim for Taxes, or to the knowledge of the
executive officers of the Company, is threatening to assert any claims for
Taxes, which claims, individually or in the aggregate, are reasonably likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No deficiencies for any Taxes (other
than those which are not reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect) have been proposed, asserted or assessed
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that have not been fully paid or
adequately provided for in the appropriate financial statements of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, no requests for waivers of the time to assess any Taxes
are pending, and, except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter, none of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has waived any statute of limitations in
respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax
assessment or deficiency.

                  (d) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have withheld or
collected and paid over to the appropriate governmental authorities (or are
properly holding for such payment) all Taxes required by Law to be withheld or
collected.

                  (e) There are no Liens for Taxes upon the assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Liens for current Taxes that are
not yet due and payable or Liens for Taxes that are being contested in good
faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves have been
provided in the Company's most recent consolidated financial statements), except
for Liens which are not reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                  (f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
liability for the Taxes of any person other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries (i) under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law), (ii) as a transferee or successor,
(iii) by contract, or (iv) otherwise, except, in each case, where such
liabilities are not reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                  (g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to, is bound by or has any obligation under any Tax sharing, Tax allocation or
Tax indemnity agreement or similar arrangements, other than with respect to any
such agreement or arrangement among the Company and any of its Subsidiaries.

                  (h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
distributed the stock of any corporation in a transaction satisfying the
requirements of Section 355 of the Code since April 16, 1997, and neither the
stock of the Company nor the stock of any of its Subsidiaries has been
distributed in a transaction satisfying the requirements of Section 355 of the
Code since April 16, 1997.

         Section 3.08 Properties.

                  (a) The Company has provided to Parent a true and complete
list of all real property leased by the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to
material leases (collectively "Company Material Leases"). The Company is not in
default under any such Company Material Leases, except where the existence of
such defaults, individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b) The Company has provided to Parent a true and complete
list of all real property that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries owns. With
respect to each such item of real property, except for such matters that,
individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect: (a) the Company or the identified Subsidiary has good
and clear record and marketable title to such property, free and clear of any
security interest, easement, covenant or other restriction, except for security
interests, easements, covenants and other restrictions which do not materially
impair the current uses or occupancy of such property; and (b) the improvements
constructed on such property are in good condition, and all mechanical and
utility systems servicing such improvements are in good condition, free in each
case of material defects.

         Section 3.09 Intellectual Property. The Company owns, or is licensed or
otherwise possesses legally enforceable rights to use, all patents, trademarks,
trade names, service marks, copyrights, and any applications for such
trademarks, trade names, service marks and copyrights, know-how, computer
software programs or applications, databases and tangible or intangible
proprietary information or material (collectively, the "Company Intellectual
Property") that are necessary to conduct the business of the Company as
currently conducted, subject to such exceptions that would not be reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Subject to such exceptions
that would not be reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) none of the Company Intellectual Property
is the subject of any pending or threatened action, suit, claim, investigation,
arbitration or other proceeding, (ii) no person, entity or Governmental Entity
has given written notice to the Company or its Subsidiaries claiming (A) that
any of the Company Intellectual Property is invalid, (B) that the use of any the
Company Intellectual Property is infringing or has infringed any domestic or
foreign patent, trademark, service mark, trade name, or copyright, or (C) that
the Company or its Subsidiaries has misappropriated or improperly used or
disclosed any trade secret, confidential information or know-how, and (iii) the
Company has no knowledge of any third party rights or conduct that infringes or
conflicts with the Company Intellectual Property.

         Section 3.10 Agreements, Contracts and Commitments.

                  (a) Except as set forth in Section 3.10(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, as of the date hereof, there is no contract, agreement or
understanding that is material to the business, properties, assets, financial
condition or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, that is required to be filed as an exhibit to any Company SEC Report
filed with the SEC subsequent to December 31, 2003 that is not filed as required
by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be (any such
contract, agreement or understanding whether or not entered into as of the date
hereof, a "Company Material Contract"). Except as would not individually or in
the aggregate have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each Company Material
Contract is a valid and binding obligation of the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries and is in full force and effect and enforceable against the Company
or one of its Subsidiaries and, to the



                                       11
<PAGE>

knowledge of the Company, the other party or parties thereto, in each case in
accordance with its terms, other than any Company Material Contract which is by
its terms no longer in force or effect and except as enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or
relating to the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and is subject to
general principles of equity. The Company is not in violation or breach of or in
default under any Company Material Contract, nor to the Company's knowledge is
any other party to any such Company Material Contract, except to the extent any
such violation, breach or default would not individually or in the aggregate
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b) Except as set forth in Section 3.10(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter and for documents filed or listed as exhibits to the Company
SEC Reports filed with the SEC subsequent to December 31, 2003 and prior to the
date hereof, as of the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any (a) contract, agreement or
arrangement (including any lease of real property) (i) materially restricting
the ability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or after the Merger,
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) to compete in or conduct any line of business
or to engage in business in any significant geographic area, (ii) relating to
indebtedness for borrowed money providing for payment or repayment in excess of
$20.0 million, (iii) relating to any material joint venture, partnership,
strategic alliance or similar arrangement, (iv) requiring the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to register for resale under the Securities Act any securities
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (v) relating to the disposition or
acquisition of material assets not in the ordinary course of business, or (vi)
providing for performance guarantees or contingent payments by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, in each case involving more than $15.0 million over the
term of the relevant contract, or (b) financial derivatives master agreements,
confirmation, or futures account opening agreements and/or brokerage statements
evidencing financial hedging or other trading activities.

         Section 3.11 Litigation. There is no action, suit or proceeding, claim,
arbitration or investigation against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pending or as to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written notice of assertion, which, individually or in the aggregate, is
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a material
adverse effect on the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

         Section 3.12 Environmental Matters. Except for such matters that,
individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect: (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries comply, and within
all applicable statute of limitation periods have complied, with all applicable
Environmental Laws; (ii) neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries are subject to
liability for any Hazardous Substance disposal or contamination on any third
party property; (iii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries are
subject to liability for any release of, or any exposure of any person or
property to, any Hazardous Substance; (iv) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any notice, demand, letter, claim or request for
information alleging that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may be in
violation of or liable under any Environmental Law; (v) neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any orders, decrees or injunctions issued
by, or other arrangements with, any Governmental Entity or is subject to any
indemnity or other agreement with any third party relating to liability under
any Environmental Law or relating to Hazardous Substances; (vi) there are no
circumstances or conditions involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that could reasonably be expected to cause the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to become subject to any claims, liability, investigations or
costs, or to restrictions on the ownership, use or transfer of any property of

         Section 3.13 Employee Benefit Plans.

                  (a) The Company has listed in Section 3.13 of the Company
Disclosure Letter all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")) and all
bonus, stock option, stock purchase, incentive, deferred compensation,
supplemental retirement, severance and other similar employee benefit plans,
programs and agreements, and all unexpired employment and severance agreements,
written or otherwise, for the benefit of, or relating to, any current or former
employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or any trade or
business (whether or not incorporated) which is a member of a group that
includes, or which is under common control with, the Company or any Subsidiary
of the Company, within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the
Code, and all other employee benefit plans under which the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company has or may have any liability or obligation,
including, without limitation, any foreign plans (together, the "Company
Employee Plans").

                  (b) With respect to each Company Employee Plan, the Company
has made available to Parent (if applicable), a true and correct copy of (i) the
most recent annual report (Form 5500) filed with the IRS, (ii) such Company
Employee Plan (or, if unwritten, a written description of the material terms
thereof), (iii) each trust agreement and group annuity contract, if any,
relating to such Company Employee Plan, (iv) the most recent actuarial report or
valuation relating to such Company Employee Plan, and (v) the most recent
summary plan description (and any summaries of material modifications) relating

                  (c) With respect to the Company Employee Plans, individually
and in the aggregate, no event has occurred, and, to the knowledge of the
Company, there exists no condition or set of circumstances, in connection with
which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company could be subject to any
liability that is reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect
under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Law.

                  (d) With respect to the Company Employee Plans, individually
and in the aggregate, there are no funded benefit obligations for which
contributions have not been made or properly accrued and there are no unfunded
benefit obligations which have not been accounted for by reserves, or otherwise
properly reflected in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
on the financial statements of the Company, which obligations are reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                  (e) Except as disclosed in Company SEC Reports filed prior to
the date of this Agreement, or except as set forth in the Company Disclosure
Letter or as provided for in this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any oral or written (i) agreement with any officer or

are contingent, or the terms of which are materially altered, upon the
occurrence of a transaction involving the Company of the nature contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) agreement with any officer or employee of the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company providing any term of employment or compensation
guarantee extending for a period longer than one year from the date hereof and
for the payment of compensation in excess of $100,000 per annum, or (iii)
agreement or



                                       13

plan, including any stock option plan, stock appreciation right plan, restricted
stock plan or stock purchase plan or incentive plan, any of the benefits of
which will be increased, or the vesting of the benefits of which will be
accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the value of any of the benefits of which will be calculated on the
basis of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (f) Section 3.13(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains
a true and complete schedule of all benefits and awards provided to officers,
directors or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including
stock options and restricted stock awards, that are not disclosed in the Company
SEC Reports and that will increase in value (other than as a result of changes
in the trading value of the Parent Common Stock or the Company Common Stock), or
accelerate in vesting or time of payment, as a result of the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

                  (g) Except as set forth in Section 3.13(g) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, or otherwise in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice (and not in connection with, or in anticipation of or
otherwise related to, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby),
since January 1, 2004, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has entered into
any new, or modified or amended any existing employment agreement or Company
Employee Plan.

                  (h) The assumption and conversion of Company Stock Options
pursuant to Section 6.10(a) will not require the consent of any holder of any
option or award granted under any Company Stock Plan.

         Section 3.14 Compliance With Laws. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has complied with, is not in violation of, and has not received any
notices of violation with respect to, any federal, state or local Law with
respect to the conduct of its business, or the ownership or operation of its
business, except for failures to comply or violations which, individually or in
the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 3.15 Tax Matters. Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates
has taken or agreed to take any action which would prevent the Merger from
qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.

         Section 3.16 Registration Statement; Proxy Statement/Prospectus. The
information to be supplied in writing by the Company for inclusion in the
registration statement on Form S-4 pursuant to which shares of Parent Common
Stock issued in the Merger will be registered under the Securities Act (the
"Registration Statement"), shall not at the time the Registration Statement is
declared effective by the SEC contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated in the Registration
Statement or necessary in order to make the statements in the Registration

<PAGE>

Meeting and the Parent Stockholders' Meeting and at the Effective Time, contain
any statement which, at such time and in light of the circumstances under which
it shall be made, is false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
in the Joint Proxy Statement not false or misleading; or omit to state any
material fact necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication
with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the Company Stockholders'
Meeting or the Parent Stockholders' Meeting which has become false or
misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event relating to the
Company or any of its Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by
the Company which should be set forth in an amendment to the Registration
Statement or a supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement, the Company shall
promptly inform Parent.

         Section 3.17 Labor Matters. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or otherwise bound by any collective bargaining
agreement, contract or other agreement or understanding with a labor union or
labor organization, nor is any such contract or agreement presently being
negotiated, nor is there, nor has there been in the last five years, a
representation question respecting any of the employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, and, to the best knowledge of the executive officers of the
Company, there are no campaigns being conducted to solicit cards from employees
of the Company or its Subsidiaries to authorize representation by any labor
organization, nor is the Company or its Subsidiaries a party to, or bound by,
any consent decree with, or citation by, any governmental agency relating to
employees or employment practices. Nor, as of the date hereof, is the Company or

is seeking to compel it to bargain with any labor union or labor organization
nor, as of the date of this Agreement, is there pending or, to the knowledge of
the executive officers of the Company, threatened, any material labor strike,

         Section 3.18 Insurance. All material fire and casualty, general
liability, business interruption, product liability, and sprinkler and water
damage insurance policies maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
are with reputable insurance carriers and are in character and amount at least
equivalent to that carried by persons engaged in similar businesses and subject
to the same or similar perils or hazards, except for any such failures to
maintain insurance policies that, individually or in the aggregate, are not
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 3.19 No Existing Discussions. As of the date hereof, the
Company is not engaged, directly or indirectly, in any discussions or
negotiations with any other party with respect to an Acquisition Proposal.

         Section 3.20 Opinion of Financial Advisor. The financial advisor of the

dated the date of this Agreement, to the effect that the Exchange Ratio is fair
to the holders of Company Common Stock from a financial point of view.

         Section 3.21 Anti-Takeover Laws. The restrictions contained in Section
203 of the DGCL with respect to a "business combination" (as defined in DGCL
Section 203) have been rendered inapplicable to the authorization, execution,
delivery and performance of the Agreement by the Company or the consummation of
the Merger by the Company. No other "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation is



                                       15

applicable to the Company or (solely by reason of the Company's participation
therein) the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         Section 3.22 Company Rights Plan. The Company has taken all action
necessary to (i) render the Company Rights issued pursuant to the terms of the
Rights Agreement inapplicable to, or not exercisable as a result of, the Merger,
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (ii) amend the definition of "Acquiring Person" in Section
1.1 of the Rights Agreement to delete "(i)" in the first sentence thereof, to
delete the entirety of clause (ii) of the first sentence thereof and to delete
the second sentence thereof.

         Section 3.23 Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Company and each of its officers
and directors are in compliance with, and have complied, in all material
respects with (A) the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
and the related rules and regulations promulgated under such Act (the
"Sarbanes-Oxley Act") and the Exchange Act and (B) the applicable listing and
corporate governance rules and regulations of The New York Stock Exchange. The
Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act); such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to provide that information relating to the
Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by
the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to the Company's principal executive officer and
its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure, and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. The Company's
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed,
based on their most recent evaluation, to the Company's auditors and the audit
committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (x) all significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
data and have identified for the Company's auditors any material weaknesses in
internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company's
internal controls.

         Section 3.24 Brokers or Finders. The Company represents, as to itself,
its Subsidiaries and its Affiliates, that no agent, broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other firm or person is or will be entitled to any broker's
or finder's fee or any other commission or similar fee in connection with any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except Citigroup Global Markets
Inc. whose fees and expenses will be paid by the Company in accordance with the
Company's agreements with such firm.

                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT

         Parent represents and warrants to the Company that the statements
contained in this Article IV are true and correct except as set forth herein and
in the disclosure letter delivered by Parent to the Company on or before the
date of this Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure Letter"). The Parent Disclosure
Letter shall be arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and
lettered paragraphs contained in this Article IV and the disclosure in any
paragraph shall qualify other paragraphs in this Article IV only to the extent
that it is reasonably apparent from a reading of such disclosure that it also
qualifies or applies to such other paragraphs.

         Section 4.01 Organization of Parent. Each of Parent and its
Subsidiaries is a corporation or unincorporated entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization, has all requisite corporate or entity power to
own, lease and operate its property and to carry on its business as now being
conducted and as proposed to be conducted, and is duly qualified to do business
and is in good standing as a foreign corporation or organization in each
jurisdiction in which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in the
Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries directly or indirectly owns any equity or similar interest in, or
any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any
corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business association or entity,
excluding securities in any publicly traded company held for investment by
Parent or its Subsidiaries and comprising less than five percent (5%) of the
outstanding stock of such company.

         Section 4.02 Parent Capital Structure.

                  (a) The authorized capital stock of Parent consists of
150,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock, 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock,
$.01 par value ("Parent Preferred Stock") and one share of Special Voting Stock.
As of August 9, 2004, (i) 85,891,223 shares of Parent Common Stock were issued
and outstanding, all of which are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable,
(ii) no shares of Parent Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding, (iii) no
shares of Special Voting Stock were issued and outstanding and (iv) no shares of
Parent Common Stock and no shares of Parent Preferred Stock were held in the
treasury of Parent or by Subsidiaries of Parent. The Parent Disclosure Letter
shows the number of shares of Parent Common Stock reserved for future issuance
pursuant to warrants, stock options and other stock awards, and restricted stock
awards granted and outstanding as of August 9, 2004 under Parent's Stock Award
and Long Term Incentive Plan, the Dreco Stock Option Plan and the IRI Stock
Option Plan (collectively, the "Parent Stock Plans"). Except for the issuance of
shares of Parent Common Stock in connection with the Parent Stock Plans
(including the exercise of warrants, stock options or other stock awards
thereunder), or except as set forth in the Parent Disclosure Letter, no change
in such capitalization has occurred between August 9, 2004 and the date of this
Agreement. All shares of Parent Common Stock subject to issuance as specified
above are duly authorized and, upon issuance on the terms and conditions
specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, shall be
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. There are no obligations,
contingent or otherwise, of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of Parent Common Stock or the capital
stock of any Subsidiary or to provide funds to or make any material investment
(in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any such
Subsidiary or any other entity other than guarantees of obligations of
Subsidiaries entered into in the ordinary course of business. Parent has not
repurchased any outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock since July 3, 2004.
All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each of Parent's Subsidiaries
are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and all such
shares (other than directors' qualifying shares in the case of foreign
Subsidiaries) are owned by Parent or another Subsidiary of Parent free and clear
of all Liens, agreements or limitations on Parent's voting rights.

                  (b) As of the date hereof, except as set forth in this Section
4.02 or as reserved for future grants of securities under the Parent Stock
Plans, there are no equity securities of any class of Parent or any security
exchangeable into or exercisable for such equity securities, issued, reserved
for issuance or outstanding. As of the date hereof, except as set forth in this
Section 4.02, there are no options, warrants, equity securities, calls, rights,
commitments or agreements of any character to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which it is bound obligating



                                       17
<PAGE>

Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be
issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries or obligating Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to grant,
extend, accelerate the vesting of or enter into any such option, warrant, equity
security, call, right, commitment or agreement. To the best knowledge of Parent,
there are no voting trusts, proxies or other voting agreements or understandings
with respect to the shares of capital stock of Parent.

         Section 4.03 Authority; No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

                  (a) Parent has all requisite corporate power and authority to
enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by Parent have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent,
subject only to the approval of this Agreement and the Merger by Parent's
stockholders under the DGCL. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
by Parent and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Parent,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception. On or prior to the date hereof, the Board of Directors of Parent has
unanimously adopted resolutions that have (i) approved and declared advisable
this Agreement and the Merger, (ii) directed that this Agreement and the Merger
be submitted to Parent's stockholders for adoption at a meeting of such
stockholders and (iii) recommended that the stockholders of Parent adopt this
Agreement and the Merger (with respect to subclause (iii), the "Parent
Recommendation"), and such resolutions, as of the date of this Agreement, have
not been subsequently rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any way. The Parent
stockholder vote required for the adoption of this Agreement and the Merger
shall be a majority of the shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding on the
record date for the Parent Stockholders' Meeting (the "Parent Stockholder
Approval").

                  (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent
does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not,
(i) conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, any provision of the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws of Parent, (ii) except as set forth in
the Parent Disclosure Letter, result in any violation or breach of, or
constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) a default (or give
rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation,
give rise to any obligation to make an offer to purchase any debt instrument or
give rise to any loss of any material benefit) under, or require a consent or
waiver under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, lease, contract or other agreement, instrument or
obligation to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any
of them or any of their properties or assets may be bound, or (iii) conflict
with or violate any permit, concession, franchise, license, judgment, order,
decree, Law or ordinance applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of its or their properties or assets, except in the case of (ii) and (iii) for
any such conflicts, violations, defaults, terminations, cancellations or
accelerations which are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely
to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

                  (c) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required by
or with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, except for (i) the filing of the pre-merger notification
report under the HSR Act, (ii) the filing of the Registration Statement with the
SEC in accordance with the Securities Act, (iii) the filing of the Certificate
of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State, (iv) the filing of the Joint
Proxy Statement with the SEC in accordance with the



                                       18
<PAGE>

Exchange Act, (v) such consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
registrations, declarations and filings as may be required under applicable
state securities Laws and the Laws of any foreign country and the European
Union, and (vi) such other consents, authorizations, filings, approvals and
registrations which, if not obtained or made, would not be reasonably likely to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.04 SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

                  (a) Parent has filed and made available to the Company all
forms, reports and documents required to be filed by Parent with the SEC since
January 1, 2001 other than registration statements on Form S-8 (collectively,
the "Parent SEC Reports"). The Parent SEC Reports (i) at the time filed,
complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (ii) did not at the
time they were filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date
of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated in
such Parent SEC Reports or necessary in order to make the statements in such
Parent SEC Reports, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. None of Parent's Subsidiaries is required to file any
forms, reports or other documents with the SEC.

                  (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including,
in each case, any related notes) contained in the Parent SEC Reports complied as
to form in all material respects with the applicable published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, was prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes to such
financial statements or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by
Form 10-Q of the SEC) and fairly presented the consolidated financial position
of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of the dates and the consolidated results of
their operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, except that the
unaudited interim financial statements were or are subject to normal and
recurring year-end adjustments which were not or are not expected to be material
in amount. The audited balance sheet of Parent as of December 31, 2003 is
referred to herein as the "Parent Balance Sheet." For each period covered by the
Parent SEC Reports, the books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries have
been, and are being, maintained, in all material respects, in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied, and all other
legal and accounting requirements.

         Section 4.05 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as disclosed in the
Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, and except for normal or
recurring Liabilities incurred since December 31, 2003 in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practices, Parent and its Subsidiaries do not have
any Liabilities, either accrued, contingent or otherwise (whether or not
required to be reflected in financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles), and whether due or to become due, which
individually or in the aggregate are reasonably likely to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.06 Absence of Certain Changes or Events(i) . Except as
disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, since the
date of the Parent Balance Sheet, Parent and its Subsidiaries have conducted
their businesses only in the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with
past practice. Since the date of the Parent Balance Sheet, there has not been
(i) any material adverse change in the financial condition, results of
operations, business or properties of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or any development or combination of developments of which the management
of Parent is aware that, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or is


                                       19
<PAGE>

reasonably likely to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect; (ii) any damage,
destruction or loss (whether or not covered by insurance) with respect to Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries having a Parent Material Adverse Effect; (iii) except
as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, any
material change by Parent in its accounting methods, principles or practices to
which the Company has not previously consented in writing; (iv) except as
disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, any
revaluation by Parent of any of its assets having a Parent Material Adverse
Effect; or (v) except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the
date hereof, any material elections with respect to Taxes by Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent or settlement or compromise by Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent of any material Tax Liability or refund.

         Section 4.07 Taxes.

                  (a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed with
the appropriate Tax authorities all Tax Returns required to be filed by them
(taking into account extensions), except for any such returns which are not
reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. All such Tax Returns are complete and correct in all respects,
except for any such omissions or errors which are not reasonably likely,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have paid (or Parent
has paid on its Subsidiaries' behalf) all Taxes shown as due on all Tax Returns
described in Section 4.07(a) herein or otherwise due by Parent and each of its
Subsidiaries, except to the extent that such taxes otherwise due are not
reasonable likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. Parent's most recent consolidated financial statements reflect
an adequate reserve for all Taxes (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes
established to reflect differences between book and Tax income) payable by
Parent and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof through
the date of such financial statements, except to the extent that any such Taxes
are not reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

                  (c) Neither the IRS nor any other Tax authority has asserted
any claim for Taxes, or to the knowledge of the executive officers of Parent, is
threatening to assert any claims for Taxes, which claims, individually or in the
aggregate, are reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No
deficiencies for any Taxes (other than those which are not reasonably likely,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect) have
been proposed, asserted or assessed against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
that have not been fully paid or adequately provided for in the appropriate
financial statements of Parent and its Subsidiaries, no requests for waivers of
the time to assess any Taxes are pending, and, except as disclosed in the Parent
Disclosure Letter, none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has waived any
statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time
with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency.

                  (d) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have withheld or
collected and paid over to the appropriate governmental authorities (or are
properly holding for such payment) all Taxes required by Law to be withheld or
collected.

                  (e) There are no Liens for Taxes upon the assets of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries (other than Liens for current Taxes that are not yet due
and payable or Liens for Taxes that are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves

list of all real property leased by Parent or its Subsidiaries pursuant to
material leases (collectively "Parent Material Leases"). Parent is not in
default under any such Parent Material Leases, except where the existence of

have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

list of all real property that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries owns. With
respect to each such item of real property, except for such matters that,

<PAGE>

the Parent Intellectual Property is invalid, (B) that the use of any Parent

whole, that is required to be filed as an exhibit to any Parent SEC Report filed

full force and effect and enforceable against Parent or one of its Subsidiaries
and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other party or parties thereto, in each
case in accordance with its terms, other than any Parent Material Contract which
is by its terms no longer in force or effect and except as enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or

general principles of equity. Parent is not in violation or breach of or in
default under any Parent Material Contract, nor to Parent's knowledge is any

violation, breach or default would not individually or in the aggregate have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Subsidiaries) to compete in or conduct any line of business or to engage in
business in any significant geographic area, (ii) relating to indebtedness for
borrowed money providing for payment or repayment in excess of $20.0 million,

case involving more than $15.0 million over the term of the relevant contract,
or (b) financial derivatives master agreements, confirmation, or futures account
opening agreements and/or brokerage statements evidencing financial hedging or
other trading activities.

         Section 4.11 Litigation. There is no action, suit or proceeding, claim,
arbitration or investigation against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pending
or as to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice
of assertion, which, individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the
ability of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

to any orders, decrees or injunctions issued by, or other arrangements with, any
Governmental Entity or is subject to any indemnity or other agreement with any
third party relating to liability under any Environmental Law or relating to
Hazardous Substances; (vi) there are no circumstances or conditions involving
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that could reasonably be expected to cause
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to become subject to any claims, liability,
investigations or costs, or to restrictions on the ownership, use or transfer of
any property of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, pursuant to any Environmental
Law; and (vii) Parent and its Subsidiaries have all of the Environmental Permits
necessary for the conduct and operation of the business as now being conducted,

bonus, stock option, stock purchase, incentive, deferred compensation,
supplemental retirement, severance and other similar employee benefit plans,
programs and agreements, and all unexpired employment and severance agreements,
written or otherwise, for the benefit of, or relating to, any current or former

liability or obligation, including, without limitation, any foreign plans
(together, the "Parent Employee Plans").

                  (b) With respect to each Parent Employee Plan, Parent has made
available to the Company (if applicable), a true and correct copy of (i) the
most recent annual report (Form 5500) filed with the IRS, (ii) such Parent
Employee Plan (or, if unwritten, a written description of the material terms
thereof), (iii) each trust agreement and group annuity contract, if any,
relating to such Parent Employee Plan, (iv) the most recent actuarial report or
valuation relating to such Parent Employee Plan, and (v) the most recent summary
plan description (and any summaries of material modifications) relating to such
Parent Employee Plan.

                  (c) With respect to the Parent Employee Plans, individually
and in the aggregate, no event has occurred, and, to the knowledge of Parent,
there exists no condition or set of circumstances, in connection with which
Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent could be subject to any liability that is
reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect under ERISA, the Code
or any other applicable Law.

and in the aggregate, there are no funded benefit obligations for which

reserves, or otherwise properly reflected in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, on the financial statements of Parent, which obligations
are reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

                  (e) Except as disclosed in Parent SEC Reports filed prior to
the date of this Agreement, or except as set forth in the Parent Disclosure
Letter or as provided for in this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any oral or written (i) agreement with any officer or
other employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, the benefits of which are
contingent, or the terms of which are materially altered, upon the occurrence of
a transaction involving Parent of the nature contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) agreement with any officer or employee of Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent providing any term of employment or compensation guarantee extending for
a period longer than one year from the date hereof and for the payment of
compensation in excess of $100,000 per annum, or (iii) agreement or plan,
including any stock option plan, stock appreciation right plan, restricted stock
plan or stock purchase plan or incentive plan, any of the benefits of which will
be increased, or the vesting of the benefits of which will be accelerated, by
the occurrence of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
value of any of the benefits of which will be calculated on the basis of any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (f) Section 4.13(f) of the Parent Disclosure Letter contains a
true and complete schedule of all benefits and awards provided to officers,
directors or employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including stock

the other transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

                  (g) Except as set forth in Section 4.13(g) of the Parent

have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

         Section 4.15 Tax Matters. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates has
taken or agreed to take any action which would prevent the Merger from

Parent makes no representation) shall not at the time the Registration Statement
is declared effective by the SEC contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated in the Registration
Statement or necessary in order to make the statements in the Registration
Statement, in light of the



                                       24
<PAGE>

circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The information
supplied in writing by Parent for inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement shall
not, on the date the Joint Proxy Statement is first mailed to Parent's
stockholders or the Company's stockholders, at the time of the Parent
Stockholders' Meeting and the Company Stockholders' Meeting and at the Effective
Time, contain any statement which, at such time and in light of the
circumstances under which it shall be made, is false or misleading with respect
to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to

shall promptly inform the Company.

question respecting any of the employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries, and, to
the best knowledge of the executive officers of Parent, there are no campaigns
being conducted to solicit cards from employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries to
authorize representation by any labor organization, nor is Parent or its
Subsidiaries a party to, or bound by, any consent decree with, or citation by,

Section 203) have been rendered inapplicable to the authorization, execution,
delivery and performance of the Agreement by Parent or the consummation of the
Merger by Parent. No other "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation is applicable
to Parent or (solely

Act and (B) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and
regulations of The New York Stock Exchange. Parent has established and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
provide that information relating to Parent, including its consolidated
Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Parent's
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure, and such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in SEC rules and forms. Parent's principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to
Parent's auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors of Parent
(x) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect Parent's ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data and have identified for Parent's auditors any material
weaknesses in internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parent's
internal controls.

         Section 4.24 Brokers or Finders. Parent represents, as to itself, its
Subsidiaries and its Affiliates, that no agent, broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other firm or person is or will be entitled to any broker's

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except Goldman, Sachs & Co.
whose fees and expenses will be paid by Parent in accordance with Parent's
agreements with such firm.

substantially the same manner as previously conducted, to pay its debts and
Taxes when due subject to good faith disputes over such debts or Taxes, to pay

involving such party or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) engage in any negotiations
or discussions concerning, or provide any non-public information of such party
to any person relating to, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries

any agreement, arrangement or understanding (other than a confidentiality
agreement entered into in accordance with this Section 6.01(a)) contemplating or

by this Agreement; provided, however, that, prior to receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval (in the case of the Company) or Parent Stockholder Approval
(in the case of Parent), nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the
Company or Parent, or their respective Boards of Directors, from (A) furnishing
non-public information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with,
any person in connection with an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal by such person, if and only to the extent that (1) such Acquisition
Proposal was made after the date of this Agreement and shall not have been
withdrawn, (2) such Acquisition Proposal was not solicited, initiated,
encouraged or facilitated after the date of this Agreement in breach of, and did
not otherwise result from a breach of, this Section 6.01(a), (3) the Board of
Directors of such party determines in good faith by affirmative vote of a
majority of all of its members, after consultation with its outside counsel and
financial advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal is, or is reasonably likely
to lead to, a Superior Proposal, (4) prior to furnishing such non-public
information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such person,
such Board of Directors receives from such person an executed confidentiality
agreement with terms no less favorable to such party than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement dated July 13, 2004 between the Company and Parent
(the "Confidentiality Agreement"), and (5) prior to furnishing such non-public
information or providing access to the properties, books or records of such
party, such party has complied with the provisions of Section 6.01(b); or (B)
complying with Rule 14e-2 or Rule 14a-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act with
regard to an Acquisition Proposal; provided that, with respect to this clause
(B), any Change of Recommendation is made in compliance with Section 6.01(e).
Each party agrees that, in the event that it receives a Superior Proposal, for
the three Business Day period commencing on the date on which it delivers notice
of such Superior Proposal to the other party in accordance with Section 6.01(b),
it shall offer to negotiate with, and cause its respective financial and legal

in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable such party to
proceed with the transactions contemplated herein.

                  (b) The Company and Parent shall each notify the other party
promptly after receipt (and in any event within one Business Day) by the Company
or Parent (or their Representatives), as applicable, of any Acquisition
Proposal, any discussions or negotiations that are reasonably likely to lead to

the properties, books or records of such party relating to or which could

made orally and in writing and shall indicate in reasonable detail the identity
of the offeror and the terms and conditions of such proposal, inquiry or
contact. Such party shall (i) continue to keep the other party hereto informed,
on a prompt basis (and in any event within one Business Day) of the status of
any material developments (including any changes or adjustments made to or
proposed to be made to the terms of



                                       32
<PAGE>

any such Acquisition Proposal), (ii) provide to the other party promptly (and in
any event within one Business Day) after receipt or delivery thereof with copies

and all such other material and information provided in writing by the person
making such Acquisition Proposal; provided that neither party shall be required
to disclose its internal analyses relating to any such Acquisition Proposal, and
(iii) provide to the other party a list of, and copies of, the information
provided to the person making such inquiry, proposal, offer or request
concurrently with delivery to such person and immediately provide the other
party hereto with access to all information to which the person making such
inquiry, proposal, offer or request was provided access (except for any such
information previously provided to the other party).

                  (c) Each party will immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing activities, discussions or negotiations by it, its
Subsidiaries and their Representatives with any person other than the other
party hereto conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Each

person, if any, that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement within
12 months prior to the date hereof in connection with any Acquisition Proposal
to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such
person by or on behalf of it or its Subsidiaries. Neither party shall agree to
modify, amend or terminate, or waive, assign or release any material rights or
claims, or grant any consent under, any confidentiality agreement relating to
any Acquisition Proposal or otherwise under any standstill or similar agreement
or fail to fully enforce any such agreement upon the request of the other party
hereto, provided, however, that either party may grant a consent or waiver
under, or otherwise fail to enforce, such agreement in order to permit a person
to make a private unsolicited Acquisition Proposal provided that such party has
otherwise complied with this Section 6.01; and provided, further, that upon any
grant of waiver or consent, the other party is promptly notified of such waiver
or consent.

                  (d) Each party will take such action as is necessary to inform
promptly its Representatives of the provisions of this Section 6.01.

                  (e) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company or Parent
nor any committee thereof shall (i) in the case of the Company, withdraw or

Approval (in the case of Parent), (w) such party's Board of Directors shall have
determined in good faith by affirmative vote of a majority of its members, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the actions described in clauses (A)
and/or (B) below are required for the purpose of fulfilling its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, (x) such party's Board of Directors has notified the other
party in writing of the determination described in clause (w) above, (y) at
least three Business Days following receipt by the other party of the notice

or Section 8.01(j), as applicable, and concurrent payment of the termination fee
in accordance with Section 8.03, approve and enter into an agreement relating to

specifically provided in Article VIII or effect any other obligation of the
parties under this Agreement.

         Section 6.02 Proxy Statement/Prospectus; Registration Statement.

                  (a) As promptly as practical after the date of this Agreement,

Subsidiaries, or any change occurs with respect to other information supplied by
a party for inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration
Statement, which is required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement
to, the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement, such party shall
promptly notify the other party of such event, and the Company and Parent shall
cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or
supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement and, as

Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the
Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing or Section 6.05, neither the Company nor
Parent shall be required to provide any information which it reasonably believes
it may not provide to the other party by reason of contractual or legal
restrictions, including applicable Laws, or which it believes is competitively
sensitive information. In addition, the Company and Parent may designate any
competitively sensitive information provided to the other under this Agreement
as "outside counsel only" and such information shall be given only to outside
counsel of the recipient. Each party will use reasonable efforts to minimize any
disruption to the businesses of the other party and its Subsidiaries which may
result from the requests for access, data and information hereunder.

Parent Stockholders' Meeting, as applicable, separate from the proposals
referred to in Section 6.04(a) and (b), provided that each party shall consult

submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger required under (A)
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and any other applicable federal or

Agreement.

                  (b) The Company and Parent agree, and shall cause each of
their respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use their reasonable best
efforts to obtain any government clearances or approvals required for Closing

"Antitrust Laws"), to obtain the expiration of any applicable waiting period
under any Antitrust Laws, to respond to any government requests for information
under any Antitrust Law, and to contest and resist any action, including any
legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) (an "Order") that restricts, prevents or
prohibits the consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law. The parties hereto will consult and
cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another,
in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party
hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.05, neither the
Company nor Parent nor any of their Subsidiaries shall be required (i) to divest
or hold separate any of their respective businesses, product lines or assets, or
to take or agree to take any other action or agree to any limitation, that would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition, results of operations or prospects of either Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (ii) to agree to or effect any divestiture, hold separate any business
or take any other action that is not conditioned on the consummation of the
Merger.

                  (c) Each of Parent and the Company shall give (or shall cause

hereby, (ii) disclosed or required to be disclosed in the Parent Disclosure
Letter or the Company Disclosure Letter, as the case may be, or (iii) required
to prevent a Parent Material Adverse Effect or a Company Material Adverse Effect

party will use its reasonable efforts, and will take any such actions reasonably
requested by the other party hereto, to limit the adverse affect upon the
Company and Parent, their respective Subsidiaries, and



                                       36
<PAGE>

their respective businesses resulting, or that could reasonably be expected to
result after the Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such consent.

                  (d) Each of the Company and Parent will give prompt notice to
the other of (i) any notice or other communication from any person alleging that
the consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the Merger,

proceedings commenced or threatened in writing against, relating to or involving
or otherwise affecting the Company, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries that
relate to the consummation of the Merger and (iv) if there has been a material
change in its current or future business, financial condition or results of
operations or any event or condition that might reasonably be expected to cause
or result in any of its representations or warranties contained herein to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or to materially delay or impede
the ability of either the Company or Parent, respectively, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to fulfill their respective
obligations set forth herein.

         Section 6.06 Public Disclosure. The Company and Parent shall agree on
the form and content of the initial joint press release regarding the
transactions contemplated hereby, and thereafter shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement with
respect to the Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as
may be required by Law or the rules and regulations of the NYSE.

         Section 6.07 Rule 145. Prior to the filing of the Joint Proxy Statement
with the SEC, the Company will provide to Parent a list of those persons who
are, in the Company's reasonable judgment, "affiliates" of the Company within
the meaning of Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act ("Rule 145"). The
Company shall provide such information and documents as Parent shall reasonably
request for purposes of reviewing such list and shall notify Parent in writing
regarding any change in the identity of its "affiliates" for purposes of Rule
145 prior to the Closing Date. The Company shall use its reasonable efforts to
deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent by the Effective Time from each
person identified as an "affiliate" for purposes of Rule 145, an executed
affiliate agreement, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, by
which each such person agrees to comply with the applicable requirements of Rule
145 (an "Affiliate Agreement"). Parent will not be required to maintain the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement for the purpose of resales by
stockholders of the Company who may be affiliates of the Company pursuant to
Rule 145 and shall be entitled to place appropriate legends on the certificates
evidencing any Parent Common Stock to be received by such affiliates of the
Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and to issue appropriate stop
transfer instructions to the transfer agent for the Parent Common Stock,
consistent with the terms of the Affiliate Agreements (provided that such
legends or stop transfer instructions shall be removed, two years after the
Closing Date, upon the request of any stockholder that is not then an Affiliate
of Parent).

         Section 6.08 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time: (i) the
Board of Directors of Parent, or an appropriate committee of non-employee
directors thereof, shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive
guidance of the SEC so that the acquisition by any officer or director of the
Company who may become a covered person of Parent for purposes of Section 16
(together with the rules and regulations thereunder, "Section 16") of the
Exchange Act, of shares of Parent Common Stock or options to purchase shares of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger shall be an exempt
transaction for purposes of Section 16; and (ii) the



                                       37
<PAGE>

Board of Directors of the Company, or an appropriate committee of non-employee
directors thereof, shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive
guidance of the SEC so that the disposition by any officer or director of the
Company, who is a covered person of the Company, for purposes of Section 16 of
shares of Company Common Stock or options to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger shall be an exempt transaction
for purposes of Section 16.

         Section 6.09 NYSE Listing. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued (i) in the Merger, (ii)
upon the exercise of the outstanding Company Stock Options, as assumed and
converted, pursuant to Section 6.10(a) and (iii) pursuant to the New Stock
Purchase Rights as set forth in Section 6.10(b), to be approved for listing on
the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date.

         Section 6.10 Stock Plans.

                  (a) (i) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option,
whether vested or unvested, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be assumed by Parent and converted into an option to purchase shares of
Parent Common Stock in accordance with this Section 6.10(a). Each Company Stock
Option as so assumed and converted shall continue to have, and be subject to,
the same terms and conditions as set forth in the applicable Company Stock Plan
and any agreements thereunder immediately prior to the Effective Time, except
that, as of the Effective Time, (i) each Company Stock Option as so assumed and
converted shall be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that
were subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number
of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) the per share exercise price for the
shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option as so assumed
and converted shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock of such Company Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest
whole cent. It is intended that Company Stock Options assumed and converted into
options to acquire Parent Common Stock in accordance with the foregoing shall
qualify following the Effective Time as incentive stock options as defined in
Section 422 of the Code to the extent such Company Stock Options qualified as
incentive stock options immediately prior to the Effective Time and that the
assumption and conversion be consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code and the
treasury regulations thereunder, and, if reasonably practicable, the provisions
of this Section 6.10 shall be applied consistent with such intent.

                           (ii) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall deliver to the participants in Company Stock Plans appropriate
notice setting forth such participants' rights pursuant thereto and the grants
pursuant to Company Stock Plans shall continue in effect on the same terms and
conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 6.10 after
giving effect to the Merger).

                           (iii) The Board of Directors of the Company (or
appropriate committee thereof) shall, prior to or as of the Effective Time, take
all necessary actions, if any, pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of
the Company Stock Plans and the instruments evidencing Company Stock Options, to
provide for the assumption and conversion of Company Stock Options into options
to acquire Parent Common Stock in accordance with this Section 6.10 without the
consent of the holders of the Company Stock Options.



                                       38
<PAGE>

                  (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company's Board of
Directors (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) and Parent's Board of
Directors (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate
resolutions and take all other actions necessary to provide that, effective at
the Effective Time, each right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "Company Stock Purchase
Right") under the Company Stock Purchase Plan shall be assumed by Parent and
shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (subject to the adjustments in this
Section 6.10(b)), and each such Company Stock Purchase Right shall be converted
automatically into a right to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock (a "New
Stock Purchase Right"). Each New Stock Purchase Right shall entitle the holder
thereof to purchase the number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined under
the terms and conditions of the Company Stock Purchase Plan, as provided for
herein, at the per share exercise price determined as provided below. Effective
at the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the Company Stock Purchase Plan,
shall amend the Company Stock Purchase Plan to substitute references to Parent
Common Stock for references to Company Common Stock therein and shall continue
the Company Stock Purchase Plan with respect to the New Stock Purchase Rights;
provided, however, that Parent shall reserve the right to terminate the Company
Stock Purchase Plan upon the exercise or other termination of all New Stock
Purchase Rights in accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Purchase Plan.
The per share exercise price for a New Stock Purchase Right shall be determined
under the terms of the Company Stock Purchase Plan, provided that the fair
market value of the "Stock" (as defined in the Company Stock Purchase Plan) on
any day prior to the Closing Date shall equal the per share fair market value of
Company Common Stock on such date, divided by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to
the nearest whole cent; provided, further, that the fair market value of the
"Stock" (as defined in the Company Stock Purchase Plan) on any date on or after
the Closing Date shall mean the fair market value of Parent Common Stock on such
date. The adjustment provided herein with respect to any Company Stock Purchase
Right shall be, and is intended to be, effective in a manner which is consistent
with Sections 423 and 424(a) of the Code and the treasury regulations
thereunder, and shall provide that the excess (if any) of the aggregate fair
market value of the shares of Parent Common Stock over the aggregate exercise
price for the New Stock Purchase Right (resulting from the assumption and
conversion of such Company Stock Purchase Right immediately after the Effective
Time) shall be no greater than the excess (if any) of the aggregate fair market
value of the shares of Company Common Stock over the aggregate exercise price
for such Company Stock Purchase Right (immediately prior to the Effective Time),
and shall provide that such New Stock Purchase Right shall not give the holder
more favorable benefits than such holder had with respect to the Company Stock
Purchase Right. At the Effective Time, the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to a New Stock Purchase Right resulting from the assumption and
conversion of a Company Stock Purchase Right shall be determined under the terms
of the Company Stock Purchase Plan (as so amended); provided, however, that the
maximum number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such New Stock
Purchase Right shall equal the maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to the Company Stock Purchase Right, multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole share. Except as provided in this Section
6.10(b), after the Effective Time, each New Stock Purchase Right shall be
exercisable upon the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the related
Company Stock Purchase Right immediately prior to the Effective Time (except
that with regard to such New Stock Purchase Right, any references to the Company
shall be deemed, as appropriate, to mean Parent). Parent shall take all action
necessary, on or prior to the Effective Time, to authorize and reserve a number
of shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient for issuance upon the exercise of
New Stock Purchase Rights as contemplated by this Section.



                                       39
<PAGE>

                  (c) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to
reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for
delivery under Company Stock Plans and the Company Stock Purchase Plan in
accordance with this Section 6.10. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor
or other appropriate forms), or another appropriate form with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Options and New Stock
Purchase Rights, and shall use all reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein)
for so long as such options remain outstanding.

         Section 6.11 Indemnification.

                  (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent agrees that it
will indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties"), against any costs
or expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, Liabilities or amounts paid in settlement (collectively, "Costs")
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising
out of or pertaining to any act or omission in their capacity as a director or
officer occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts and
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement ant the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
permitted under Delaware Law (and Parent shall also advance expenses as incurred
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, provided that, if required
by Law, the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification).

                  (b) For six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
to be maintained in effect for the benefit of the Company's current directors
and officers an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for
acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time (the "D&O Insurance")
covering each such person currently covered by the officers' and directors'
liability insurance policies of the Company on terms with respect to coverage
and in amounts no less favorable than those of the Company's policies in effect
on the date hereof with the same or comparable quality insurance carriers;
provided, however, that Parent shall not be required to pay an annual premium
for the D&O Insurance in excess of 300% of the premium for the 2004 fiscal year
(the "Maximum Premium"); provided, further, if such D&O Insurance coverage
cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual premium in
excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent shall obtain the most advantageous
policies of directors' and officers' insurance obtainable for an annual premium
equal to the Maximum Premium.

                  (c) The provisions of this Section 6.11 are intended to be in
addition to the rights otherwise available to the current and former officers
and directors of the Company by Law, charter, by-law or agreement. Parent agrees
to honor all indemnification agreements entered into by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. In the event that Parent or its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets to any
person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provisions to be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.11. The obligations of Parent under this Section 6.11
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
indemnitee to whom this Section 6.11 applies


                                       40
<PAGE>

without the express written consent of such affected indemnitee (it being
expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this Section 6.11 applies shall be
third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.11).

         Section 6.12 Letter of the Company's Accountants. The Company shall use
its reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent a letter of Ernst &
Young LLP, the Company's independent auditors, dated a date within two Business
Days before the date on which the Registration Statement shall become effective
and addressed to Parent, in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent and customary
in scope and substance for letters delivered by independent public accountants
in connection with registration statements similar to the Registration
Statement. In connection with Parent's efforts to obtain such letter, if
requested by Ernst & Young LLP, the Company shall provide a representation
letter to Ernst & Young LLP complying with SAS 72, if then required.

         Section 6.13 Letter of Parent's Accountants. Parent shall use its
reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to the Company a letter of Ernst &
Young LLP, Parent's independent auditors, dated a date within two Business Days
before the date on which the Registration Statement shall become effective and
addressed to the Company, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Company and
customary in scope and substance for letters delivered by independent public
accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the
Registration Statement. In connection with the Company's efforts to obtain such
letter, if requested by Ernst & Young LLP, Parent shall provide a representation
letter to Ernst & Young LLP complying with the SAS 72, if then required.

         Section 6.14 Governance Matters.

                  (a) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall take all requisite
action such that (i) the Board of Directors of Parent shall consist of 10
members, including John F. Lauletta (who shall be Chairman), Merrill A. Miller,
Jr., four members named by the Company prior to the mailing of the Joint Proxy
Statement (together with John F. Lauletta, the "Company Designated Directors")
and four members named by Parent prior to the mailing of the Joint Proxy
Statement (together with Merrill A. Miller, Jr., the "Parent Designated
Directors") until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be, and
(ii) John F. Lauletta, one Company Designated Director and one Parent Designated
Director shall be placed in the class with a term expiring in 2005, Merrill A.
Miller, Jr., one Company Designated Director and one Parent Designated Director
shall be placed in the class with a term expiring in 2006 and two Company
Designated Directors and two Parent Designated Directors shall be placed in the
class with a term expiring in 2007. If any Company Designated Director or Parent
Designated Director shall be unable to serve as a director at the Effective
Time, the party which designated such individual shall designate another
individual, reasonably acceptable to the other party, to serve in such
individual's place. All designated directors other than Messrs. Lauletta and
Miller shall qualify as independent members of the Parent's Board of Directors
as determined in accordance with the rules of the NYSE.

                  (b) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall take all requisite
action such that the executive positions of Chairman of the Board, Chief
Executive Officer, and Chief Operating Officer of Parent shall be as set forth
on Schedule 1 hereto until the earlier of the resignation or removal. If any
officer set forth on or designated in accordance with Schedule 1 ceases to be a
full-time employee of either Parent or the Company, as applicable, at or before
the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will agree in writing upon another
person to serve in such person's stead.

                  (c) The Company and Parent agree that the Company Designated
Directors, the Parent Designated Directors and the individuals set forth on
Schedule 1 hereto shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.14.

         Section 6.15 State Takeover Statutes. If any state takeover statute or
state Law that purports to limit or restrict business combinations or the
ability to acquire or vote shares is or may become applicable to the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company and
its Board of Directors and the Parent and its Board of Directors will grant such
approvals and take such other actions as are necessary so that such transactions
may be consummated as promptly and practicable on the terms contemplated hereby
and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or Law on
this Agreement and such transactions.

         Section 6.16 Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment.

                  (a) The Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best
efforts, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use their reasonable
best efforts, to take or cause to be taken any action necessary for the Merger
to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
Neither the Company nor Parent shall, nor shall they permit any of their
respective Subsidiaries to, take or cause to be taken any action that would
prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

                  (b) This Agreement is intended to constitute, and the parties
hereto hereby adopt this Agreement as, a "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning Treasury Regulation Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a). Each of the
Company and Parent shall report the Merger as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, unless otherwise required pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.
