1.3. _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the
Company and Parent will cause a Certificate of Merger (the " _ _Delaware
Certificate of Merger__ "), together with any required certificates, to
be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective at the time when the Delaware Certificate of Merger has been duly
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later
time as may be agreed by the parties and specified in the Delaware

incorporation of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
(the " _ _Charter__ "), until duly amended as provided therein or
by applicable Law.

  



  

2.2. _The Bylaws_. The bylaws of the Company as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be amended and restated in their entirety to be
identical to the bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the

therein or by applicable Law.

  



  

ARTICLE III 
  
 Officers and Directors 
 of the Surviving Corporation

  



  

3.1. _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall,

qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the Charter and the Bylaws.

  



  

3.2. _Officers_. The officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from
and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation

earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and the
Bylaws.

  



  

ARTICLE IV 
  
 Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; 
 Exchange of Certificates

  



  

4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company:

  



  

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of the common stock, par value $0.0001
per share, of the Company (the " _ _Common Stock__ ") issued and outstanding
at the Effective Time (a " _ _Share__ " or, collectively, the " _ _Shares__
") (other than (i) Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct
or indirect Subsidiary of Parent, (ii) Shares owned by the Company or
any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company except, in the case
of clauses (i) and (ii), for any such Shares held on behalf of third
parties and (iii) Shares (" _ _Dissenting Shares__ ") that are held by
stockholders (" _ _Dissenting Stockholders__ ") who have properly exercised
and not withdrawn appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (each,
an " _ _Excluded Share__ " and collectively, " _ _Excluded Shares__ ", and
each Share that is not an Excluded Share, an " _ _Outstanding Share__ " and
collectively, the " _ _Outstanding Shares__ ")), together with the associated
share purchase rights (" _ _Company Rights__ ") issued pursuant to the Rights
Agreement, shall be converted into the right to receive, and become
exchangeable in accordance with this Article IV for, an amount of cash equal
to $22.50 (the " _ _Per Share Merger Consideration__ ", the aggregate amount
in cash into which all Shares shall be converted pursuant to this Section
4.1(a) being referred to herein as the " _ _Merger Consideration__ ").

  



  

(b) _Cancellation of Shares/Certificates_. At the Effective Time, all Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall be cancelled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _ _Certificate__ ") (i)
representing any Outstanding Shares shall thereafter represent only the right
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, as applicable, payable in
respect of such Outstanding Shares in accordance with this Article IV, (ii)
representing any Dissenting Shares shall thereafter represent only the right
to receive the payments set forth in Section 4.3 and (iii) representing any
Excluded Shares other than Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and such
Excluded Shares, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and
retired without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to
exist.

  



  

3   

     
   

  



  

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, converted into one share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(d) _Further Rights in Shares_. The Per Share Merger Consideration
issued upon conversion of an Outstanding Share in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Outstanding Share.

  



  

4.2. _Exchange of Certificates for Merger Consideration_.

  



  

(a) _Paying Agent_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to
be deposited with a paying agent selected by Parent with the Companys prior
approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (the "
_ _Paying Agent__ "), for the benefit of holders of Outstanding Shares, a
cash amount sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration to be paid in the
Merger in exchange for Outstanding Shares (such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the " _ _Exchange Fund_ "_). The Paying Agent, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions provided by Parent, shall deliver the Per Share
Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid per Outstanding Share pursuant
to Section 4.1 out of the Exchange Fund upon due surrender of
the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) pursuant
to the provisions of this Article IV.

  



  

(b) _Payment Procedures_. Appropriate transmittal materials shall be provided
to the holders of record of Shares promptly following the Effective Time by
the Paying Agent advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger and
the procedure for surrendering Certificates to the Paying Agent. The
transmittal materials shall (i) specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates (or an effective affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) to the Paying Agent and (ii) include instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) in exchange for the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificates.
Upon surrender of a Certificate (or an effective affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof), together with properly completed and executed transmittal
materials, to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of the
transmittal materials, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor a cash amount (after giving effect to any
required tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.7) equal to (A) the number
of Shares represented by such Certificate (or effective affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) multiplied by (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, in the
form of a check (or made available for collection by hand if so elected by
the surrendering holder of a Certificate (or effective affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof), provided payment by hand is permissible by the Paying Agent)
and the Certificate

  



  

4   

     
   

  



  

so surrendered shall be cancelled forthwith. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company under the name of the Person surrendering
such Certificate, a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the
Certificate may be issued to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly
representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable. If
any Merger Consideration is to be delivered to a Person whose name is other
than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefore is
registered, it shall be a condition of such delivery that the Person
requesting such delivery shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required to be
paid by reason of such delivery to a Person whose name is other than that of
the holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable.

  



  

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Per
Share Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant
to this Article IV.

  



  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the stockholders of the Company for 180 days after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to Parent. Any holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares)
who have not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look
only to Parent for delivery of (after giving effect to any required tax
withholdings as provided in Section 4.7) the Per Share Merger Consideration
payable in respect of any such holders Shares (without interest thereon)
upon due surrender of their Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable
to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

  



  

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an effective
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of
a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the amount
(after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in Section
4.7) equal to the number of Shares represented

  



  

5   

     
   

  



  

by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate that have been surrendered
multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration.

  



  

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis.
Parent shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the Exchange Fund
includes at all times cash sufficient to satisfy Parents obligations under
Section 4.1(a).  Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent upon termination of the Exchange Fund
pursuant to Section 4.2(d).

  



  

4.3. _Dissenters  Rights_. At the Effective Time, the Shares held by each
Dissenting Stockholder shall be converted into and become exchangeable for
and be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the
DGCL with respect to the Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder unless
and until such Person shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such Persons right to dissent from the Merger under the
DGCL, at which time such Persons Shares shall represent only the right to
receive (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in
Section 4.7) the Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect of any
such Persons Shares (without interest thereon, upon due surrender of their
Certificate (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)). If any
Person who otherwise would be deemed a Dissenting Stockholder shall have
failed to properly perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the
right to dissent with respect to any Shares, such Person shall forfeit the
right to appraisal of such Shares and such Shares shall thereupon be deemed
to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and represent the
right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect of
such Shares. The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of any written
demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to applicable law received by the Company
relating to stockholders rights of appraisal and (b) the opportunity to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demand for appraisal
under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisals of Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle any such demands
or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

  



  

4.4. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company
changes the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into
or exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time
as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without
duplication with respect to any such event, so as to preserve the economic
benefits that the parties reasonably expected on the date of this Agreement
as a result of the consummation of the Merger and any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

6   

     
   

  



  

4.5. _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

  



  

(a) _Treatment of Underwater Options and Stock Purchase Rights_. At least 31
days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
actions necessary to fully vest each outstanding option to purchase Shares
with an exercise price greater than $30.00 (an " _ _Underwater Company
Option__") and each outstanding stock purchase right (a " _ _Stock Purchase
Right__ ") issued under the Stock Plans (as defined in Section 5.2), and
provide appropriate notice to each holder of an Underwater Company Option or
Stock Purchase Right informing them that (i) all their Underwater
Company Options and Stock Purchase Rights are fully vested and (ii)
their Underwater Company Options and Stock Purchase Rights will all terminate
if not exercised within 30 days after the date of the notice. The Company
will take all actions necessary to ensure that there are no outstanding
Underwater Company Options or Stock Purchase Rights immediately prior to the
Effective Time, including without limitation seeking consents from the
holders of Underwater Company Options and Stock Purchase Rights, if requested
by Parent.  The provisions of this Section 4.5(a) shall be contingent upon
the consummation of the Merger and shall be null and void in the event the
Merger is not consummated.

  



  

(b) _Treatment of In-the-Money Options_. At the Effective Time, each
outstanding option to purchase Shares with an exercise price less than
or equal to $30.00 (an " _ _In-the-Money Company Option__" and together with
the Stock Purchase Rights and the Underwater Company Options, the " _ _Company
Options__ ") issued under the Stock Plans (as defined in Section 5.2),
whether vested or unvested, shall be converted into an option to acquire a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to
the nearest number of whole shares) of (x) the number of Shares subject to
the In-the-Money Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(y) the Conversion Number, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per Share of such In-the-
Money Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (B)
the Conversion Number; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the exercise price and
the number of shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Parent
(" _ _Parent Common Stock__ ") purchasable pursuant to the In-the-Money
Company Options shall be determined in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code; _provided_ , _further_ , that in
the case of any In-the-Money Company Option to which Section 422 of the Code
applies, the exercise price and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
purchasable pursuant to such option shall be determined in accordance with
the foregoing, subject to such adjustments as are necessary in order to
satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. Except as
specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each In-the-Money
Company Option shall continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions
as set forth in the applicable Stock Plan and any agreements thereunder as
were applicable immediately prior to the Effective Time. For purposes of this
Agreement, the " _ _Conversion Number__ " shall be equal to the fraction
having a numerator equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration and

  



  

7   

     
   

  



  

having a denominator equal to the average of the closing sale prices of a
share of Parent Common Stock as quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market (" _
_NASDAQ__ ") (as reported in the New York City edition of _The Wall Street
Journal_ or, if not reported thereby, another authoritative source) for each
of the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date.
 In addition to the foregoing, Parent shall assume the Stock Plans, and the
number and kind of shares available for issuance under the Stock Plans shall
be converted into shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with
the provisions of each applicable Stock Plan.

  



  

(c) _Company Awards_. At the Effective Time, each then outstanding right of
any kind, contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive Shares or benefits
measured by the value of Shares, and each award of any kind consisting of
Shares that may be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved
for issuance under the Stock Plans and any other Company Benefits Plans,
other than Company Options (the " _ _Company Awards__ "), shall be deemed to
be converted into the right to acquire or receive benefits measured by the
value of (as the case may be) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest number of whole shares) of
(x) the number of Shares subject to such Company Award immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (y) the Conversion Number, and to the extent such
Company Award provides for payments to the extent the value of the
Shares exceed a specified reference price, at a reference price per share
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the reference price per
Share immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (B) the
Conversion Number. Except as specifically provided above, following the
Effective Time, each such right shall otherwise be subject to the same terms
and conditions as were applicable to the rights under the relevant Stock Plan
or other Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Section 4.5(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and compete
list of all Company Awards.

  



  

(d) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The Company shall take all actions
necessary to cause any purchase periods under the Companys 1998 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ _ESPP__ ") and Canadian Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the " _ _Canadian ESPP__ ") to be shortened by setting a new exercise
date for all such periods within 30 days of the date of this Agreement (the "
_ _Exercise Date__ ") where each participants accumulated
payroll deductions shall be used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
in accordance with the terms of the ESPP and the Canadian ESPP. The Company
agrees that no new purchase periods will begin under the ESPP or the Canadian
ESPP after the Exercise Date and that no further purchases of shares
of Company Common Stock will be made after the Exercise Date. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate the
ESPP and the Canadian ESPP and ensure that no further purchases of shares of
Company Common Stock are made thereunder.

  



  

(e) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Board of Directors and the compensation committee, as applicable,

  



  

8   

     
   

  



  

shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are necessary to
effectuate the provisions of Sections 4.5(a), 4.5(b), 4.5(c) and 4.5(d).

  



  

(f) _No Right to Acquire Shares_. The Company shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor
the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver Shares or other capital
stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company
Options and Company Awards after the Effective Time.

  



  

4.6. _Treatment of the Preferred Stock, the AZ Note and the Warrants_. The
Preferred Stock, the AZ Note and the Warrants shall be treated as set forth
in Section 7.11.

  



  

4.7. _Withholding_. Parent or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Outstanding Shares such amounts as Parent or the
Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _ _Code__ ") , or any applicable Tax
Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by Parent or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of Outstanding Shares in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent or the Paying Agent.

  



  

4.8. _Associated Rights_. All references in this Agreement to the shares of
Common Stock shall be deemed to include the associated Company Rights issued
pursuant to the Rights Agreement, except, in each case, where the context
otherwise requires.

  



  

ARTICLE V 
  
 Representations and Warranties of the Company

  



  

Except as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the
disclosure letter delivered to Parent by the Company on or prior to entering
into this Agreement (the " _ _Company Disclosure Letter__ ") (with disclosure
of any item, information or other matter on any section of the Company

Subsidiaries as a single employer within the

  



  

19   

     
   

  



  

meaning of Section 414 of the Code. Neither the Company nor, to the knowledge
of the Company, any other Person or entity, has made any commitment to
modify, change or terminate any Company Benefit Plan, other than with respect
to a modification, change or termination required by ERISA or the Code.

consolidated balance sheet dated as of December 31, 2004 included in the
Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004
(the " _ _Balance Sheet__ "). With respect to the Company Benefit Plans,
no event has occurred and, to the knowledge of the Company, there exists

taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code is so exempt, each VEBA has been

of such qualification or exemption, (iv) to the Companys knowledge, there
has been no prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of

under a statutory or administrative exemption) with respect to any Company
Benefit Plan that could result in liability to the Company or an ERISA

or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who is a "disqualified
individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1)

"excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code).
The Company has provided the following to Parent: (i) the preliminary
estimated maximum amount that could be paid to each disqualified individual
in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this

U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as from time to
time in effect and any successor to all or a portion thereof establishing
margin requirements.  All employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries are

upon termination or upon a change in control of the Company.

  



  

22   

     
   

  



  

(i) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is an "employee welfare
benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA, all claims

_HMO__ ") pursuant to which the HMO bears the liability for such claims, or

agreements, nor the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or such related agreements will (either alone
or in conjunction with any other event, such as termination of employment),
except as provided by Parent (i) result in any payment (including, without
limitation, severance or unemployment compensation) becoming due to any

Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates under any Company Benefit
Plan or otherwise, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any

in control provisions with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
terminated employment or been terminated, nor has any event occurred that

not being, conducted in violation of any federal, state, local or foreign
law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order,
injunction, decree, arbitration award, agency requirement, license or permit
of any Governmental Entity (collectively, " _ _Laws__ ") in any material
respect in the aggregate; and, prior to December 31, 2004, the businesses of
each of the Company and its Subsidiaries had not been conducted in violation
of any Laws, except for such violations that are not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No
investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to the knowledge of the Company, is
pending or threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention
to conduct the same. To the knowledge of the Company, no change is required

  



  

23   

     
   

  



  

in the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries processes, properties
or procedures in order to bring them into material compliance with any Laws,
and the Company has not received any written notice or communication of
any material noncompliance with any Laws that has not been cured as of the

licenses, permits, franchises, variances, exemptions, orders and other

submitted notices to, all Governmental Entities, including all authorizations
under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended (the " _
_FDCA__ "), the Public Health Service Act of 1944, as amended (the " _
_PHSA__ "), and the regulations of the United States Food and Drug
Administration (the " _ _FDA__ ") promulgated thereunder, and any other
Governmental Entity that is concerned with the quality, identity, strength,
purity, safety, efficacy or manufacturing of the pharmaceutical compounds or
products tested or sold by the Company or its Subsidiaries (any such
Governmental Entity, a " _ _Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency__ ") necessary
for the Company or any such Subsidiary to own, lease and operate its
properties or other assets and to carry on its respective business (the " _
_Company Permits__ "), and all such Company Permits are valid, and in full
force and effect. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance
in all material respects with all statutes, rules and regulations (including,
but not limited, to those pertaining to Good Manufacturing Practice, Good
Laboratory Practice and Good Clinical Practice) of the FDA and any applicable
foreign equivalent with respect to manufacturing, clinical research and
development, marketing and sale of all of their products. There are no pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened actions or proceedings by the
FDA or any applicable foreign equivalent which would prohibit or materially
impede the sale of any product currently manufactured and/or sold by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries into any market. The Company has received
no notice with respect to revocation or challenge of any of the Company
Permits. This Section 5.9 does not apply to Tax matters, which are addressed
in Section 5.14.

  



  

5.10. _Properties_.

  



  

(a) Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries owns any real property.  Each
of the Company and its Subsidiaries has (i) good and valid title to all of

clear of any Liens, except for Permitted Liens, and (ii) a valid leasehold
interest or other comparable Contract of use in all properties and assets
reflected as leased on such balance sheet, except for such leases terminated

Liens. The assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries and any assets leased
or licensed by the Company and its Subsidiaries constitute as of the date of
this Agreement, and will constitute as of the Closing (except sales and
dispositions of assets in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice), all of the material assets, rights and properties, tangible
and

  



  

24   

     
   

  



  

intangible, real or personal, which are necessary for the operation of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as presently operated. The
Company or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, enjoys peaceful and
undisturbed possession under all Personal Property Leases and Real Property
Leases. For purposes of this Agreement, (A) " _ _Real Property Leases__ "

Liens securing obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice that are not yet due and delinquent; and (4)
similar Liens and encumbrances which are incurred in the ordinary course of

materially detract from the value of the related assets or properties or
materially impair the use thereof in the operation of such business.

binding on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries party thereto and, to the
knowledge of the Company, each other party thereto, (ii) all Personal

is not in default with respect to any of its material obligations required to
be performed by it under such Real Property Lease or Personal Property Lease.
 Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has knowledge of
any default or any event which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or
both, would be an event of default by the lessee or licensee thereunder.

  



  

(c) Neither the Company nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any other party
to any Real Property Lease has commenced any action in respect of, or arising
out of such Real Property Lease or given any written notice to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries for the purpose of terminating or threatening to
terminate such Real Property Lease, and no lessor or sublessor under any Real
Property Lease has given any written notice to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for the purpose of terminating or threatening to terminate any
right of first refusal (or right of first offer) to lease or purchase, any
lease expansion right, or any similar right now existing under the Real
Property Leases.

  



  

(d) To the knowledge of the Company, there are no conditions or defects to
the buildings contained on the real property subject to the Real Property

  



  

25

performance by Parent or Merger Sub of any of its material obligations under
this Agreement.

  



  

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not,
constitute or result in (i) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the

termination (or right of termination), acceleration or default under, any

in the rights or obligations of any party under any Contract, except, in the

Company) all confidential information heretofore furnished by the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their Affiliates or Representatives

Representatives.  Section 7.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth
a complete list of any confidentiality agreement with the Company or any of
its Affiliates or Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives with
respect to such Persons consideration of a possible Acquisition Proposal
(other than agreements that have expired by their terms).

previously provided such materials to Parent).

  



  

(ii) The Company shall provide Parent with three business days prior notice
of any meeting of the Board of Directors of the Company at which such Board
of Directors is reasonably expected to consider a Change of Recommendation.

  



  

(c) If, prior to the time at which the Company has obtained the Company
Requisite Vote, the Company receives from a Person a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal that is or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal (and continues to constitute (or reasonably be expected to
lead to) a Superior Proposal after taking into account any modifications to
this Agreement proposed by Parent and Merger Sub), the Company shall promptly
provide to Parent written notice (the " _ _Superior Proposal Notice__ ")
that shall state expressly (i) that it has received a Superior Proposal (or
an Acquisition Proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal), (ii) the identity of the Person making such proposal and
(iii) the material terms and conditions of such proposal and may (A) provide
information in response to a request therefor by such Person if the Board of
Directors receives from the Person so requesting such information an

such Person, the Company furnishes to Parent all such non-public information

public information previously provided to Parent, (B) engage in discussions
or negotiations with such Person or (C) in the case of an Acquisition
Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor and legal counsel) is a

Section 7.2(b)(ii), withhold, withdraw, modify, qualify or amend the
Directors Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent and may approve,
recommend, or otherwise declare advisable or propose to approve, recommend or
declare advisable (publicly or otherwise) such a Superior Proposal (any of
the foregoing actions, whether by the Board of Directors of the Company or a
committee thereof, a " _ _Change of Recommendation__ "), if and only to the
extent that, in each such case referred to in clauses (A), (B) and (C) above,
the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith, following the
receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action, in light of the Acquisition Proposal and the terms of this Agreement,
would be inconsistent with the Board of Directors fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law.

  



  

47   

     
   

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
obligation of the Company to call, give notice of, convene and hold the

Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) or propose to do so.

of the Company from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the

withdrawing, modifying or qualifying the Directors Recommendation in any

Directors of the Company, Parent shall have the right to terminate this

such Persons stockholders would own at least a majority of the voting power
of the entity surviving or resulting from such transaction (or the ultimate
parent entity thereof), (B) be on terms that the Board of Directors of the
Company in good faith concludes (following consultation with a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal
counsel), taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the identity of and the
ability of such Person making such proposal to consummate the transactions
contemplated by such proposal, (1) would result in a transaction that is more
favorable to the Companys stockholders (in their capacities as
stockholders), from a financial point of view, than the terms of this
Agreement and transactions contemplated by this Agreement (taking into
account any revisions hereto agreed upon by Parent and Merger Sub in response

_however_ , that nothing in this Section 7.4 shall require, or be construed
to require, Parent to agree to commit to any divestitures or licenses or to
proffer to, or agree to, sell or hold separate and agree to sell, before or
after the Effective Time, any assets, businesses, or interest in any assets
or businesses of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates

Company, of any of its assets or businesses) or to agree to any material
changes or restriction in the operations of any such assets or businesses.
 The Company shall not, without Parents prior written consent, commit
or agree to commit or proffer to agree to any divestitures or licenses or
agree to hold separate any assets or agree to any similar arrangements or
commit to conduct its business in a specified manner (or allow any of its
Subsidiaries to commit to any divestitures or licenses or agree to hold
separate any assets or agree to any similar arrangements).  Subject to
applicable Laws relating to the sharing of information, Parent and the
Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent

Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions.
The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any change, fact or
condition that the Company reasonably believes is reasonably likely to result
in a Company Material Adverse Effect (for the avoidance of doubt, only a
willful and knowing breach of this sentence shall be deemed a material

set forth in Section 8.2(b)). The Company shall not permit any of its
officers or any other Representatives to

  



  

51   

     
   

  



  

participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any

throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its properties, books,
contracts, personnel and records and, during such period, shall (and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Parent and Parents and its
Subsidiaries Representatives all information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as may reasonably be requested, _provided_ that no
investigation pursuant to this Section 7.5 shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty made by the Company.  Section 7.5 of
the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of all confidentiality
obligations that would prevent the Company from disclosing employment related
information to Parent following the execution of this Agreement and prior to
the Effective Time.

  



  

7.6. _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a
joint press release and thereafter the Company shall consult with Parent
prior to issuing, and provide Parent the opportunity to review and make
reasonable comment upon, any press releases or otherwise making
public announcements with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making any filings
with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity (including any national
securities interdealer quotation service) with respect thereto, except as may
be required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with
or rules of NASDAQ or by the request of any Government Entity with
jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable antitrust or competition Law;
_provided_ , that such statements are not inconsistent with the Directors
Recommendation (unless the Board of Directors shall have made a Change of
Recommendation) and previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made jointly by Parent and the Company or previously approved by
Parent in accordance with this Section 7.6. Parent shall provide the Company
with copies of any filings prepared in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby prior to the submission of such filings to
the SEC.

  



  

7.7. _Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(a) If requested by Parent at least five days prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall terminate any and all Company Benefit Plans intended to

  



  

52   

     
   

  



  

qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code, effective not later than the day
immediately preceding the Effective Time. In the event that Parent requests
that such 401(k) plan(s) be terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with
evidence that such 401(k) plan(s) have been terminated pursuant to resolution
of the Companys Board of Directors (the form and substance of which shall be
subject to review and approval by Parent) not later than the day immediately
preceding the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) No provision of this Agreement shall create any third-party beneficiary
rights in any employee of the Company, any beneficiary or dependent thereof,
or any collective bargaining representative thereof, with respect to the
compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be
provided to any employee of the Company by Parent or the Surviving Entity or
under any benefit plan which Parent or the Surviving Entity may maintain.

  



  

(c) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending on the last day of the year during which Closing occurs, the
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time (the " _
_Company Employees__ ") will continue to be provided benefits that are not
materially less favorable in the aggregate than those currently provided by
the Company and its Subsidiaries to such employees under the Company Welfare
Plans and the Company Pension Plans listed in Section 5.8(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, so long as the Company Employee remains employed by the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates.

  



  

(d) With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy or
arrangement maintained by Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent in which the
Company Employees subsequently participate (the " _ _Parent Plans__ "), for
purposes of determining eligibility, vesting and entitlement to benefits,
including for severance benefits and vacation entitlement (but not for
accrual of pension benefits), service with the Company or a Subsidiary of the
Company (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company or a Subsidiary
of the Company provides past service credit) shall be treated as service with
Parent; provided, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent
that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or to the
extent that such service was not recognized under the applicable Company
Benefit Plan. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its other Subsidiaries to, credit to Company
Employees the amount of vacation time that such employees had accrued under
any applicable Company Benefit Plan as of the Effective Time, subject to the
cap on vacation accrual set forth in Parents vacation policy, provided that
the accrued vacation time of each such employee in excess of such cap shall
be paid as soon as practicable to such employee at the
employees compensation rate in effect as of the Effective Time. Parent shall
use reasonable efforts to cause to be waived any waiting periods, evidence of
insurability requirements, or the application of any pre-existing condition
limitations under any Parent Plans.

  



  

53   

      
  

  



  

(e) In the event of any change in the medical and dental benefits provided to
Company Employees following the Effective Time, in respect of at least one of
the options available under one of its medical and dental plans, Parent shall
cause (i) the waiver of all limitations as to pre-existing conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to the Company Employees under any such medical and
dental benefits to the extent that such conditions, exclusions or waiting
periods would not apply in the absence of such change and (ii) for the plan
year in which the Closing Date occurs, the crediting of each Company Employee
with any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to any such change in
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements after such
change.

  



  

(f) Not later than five business days prior to the Stockholders Meeting,
Parent shall adopt a severance plan consistent with the terms set forth in
Section 7.7(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  



  

7.8. _WARN Act_. With respect to all employees, the Company and/or any of
its Subsidiaries shall be responsible for providing any notices required to
be given and otherwise complying with WARN or similar statutes or regulations
of any jurisdiction relating to any plant closing or mass layoff (or similar
triggering event) caused by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and
Parent shall have no responsibility or liability under WARN (or any other
similar statute or regulation) with respect to such employees. If Parent
determines that an event would trigger WARN obligations (or obligations
arising under similar statutes or regulations) within 60 days following the
Effective Time, the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries shall, at Parents
request, provide notices to all employees as are required to be provided
under WARN (or any similar statute or regulation), in a form approved by and
as directed by Parent.

  



  

7.9. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.11, whether or not
the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expense, except that
expenses incurred in connection with the filing fee for the Proxy Statement
and printing and mailing the Proxy Statement shall be shared equally by
Parent and the Company.

  



  

7.10. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

  



  

(a) Parent agrees that, from and after the Effective Time, it will indemnify
and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company
(when acting in such capacity), determined as of the Effective Time (the " _
_Indemnified Parties__ "), in respect of acts or omissions in their capacity
as such, against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(collectively, " _ _Costs__ ") incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of matters existing or

  



  

54   

     
   

  



  

occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the
Company would have been permitted under the DGCL and its and its certificate
of incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date hereof to indemnify such
Person and such obligation shall continue in full force and effect for a
period of six years from and after the Effective Time (and Parent shall also
advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law and the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws in effect on
the date hereof; _provided_ , that the Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such Person is not entitled to indemnification); and _provided_ , 
_further_ , that any determination required to be made with respect
to whether an officers or directors conduct complies with the standards
set forth under the DGCL and the Companys certificate of incorporation and
bylaws shall be made by independent counsel selected by the Surviving
Corporation.

  



  

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph
(a) of this Section 7.10, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the
failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent of any obligation hereunder
except to the extent that Parent is actually prejudiced by such failure to
give notice.  In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i)
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume
the defense thereof and Parent shall not be liable to such Indemnified
Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the
defense thereof, except that if Parent or the Surviving Corporation elects
not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises
that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Parent or the
Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties
may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for
the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall be obligated pursuant to this
paragraph (b) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties
in any jurisdiction, (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the
defense of any such matter and (iii) Parent shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without its prior written consent; and _provided_ , 
_however_ , that Parent shall not have any obligation hereunder to
any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction
shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final,
that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated
hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

  



  

(c) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain (directly or indirectly through the Companys
existing insurance programs) in effect the Companys current directors and
officers liability insurance (" _ _D andO Insurance__") in respect of acts or
omissions

  



  

55   

     
   

  



  

occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each Person currently
covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy
(a complete and accurate copy of which has been heretofore delivered to
Parent), on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable
than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof (provided that, such
terms are commercially available in the market); _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that Parent may (i) substitute therefor policies of Parent containing terms
with respect to coverage (including as coverage relates to deductibles and
exclusions) and amount no less favorable to such directors and officers or
(ii) obtain such extended reporting period coverage under the Companys
existing DandO Insurance (to be effective as of the Effective Time) and the
Company shall cooperate with Parent in doing so (including,
without limitation, executing all documents and providing all information and
materials reasonably necessary therefor); _provided,_ _further,_ that,
in satisfying its obligation under this Section 7.10, neither the Company
nor Parent shall be obligated to pay more than 200% of the last annual
aggregate premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement by the Company in
the aggregate to obtain such coverage. It is understood and agreed that in
the event such coverage cannot be obtained for 200% of the last annual
aggregate premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement by the Company, or
less, in the aggregate, Parent shall be obligated to provide the greatest
coverage as may be obtained for such aggregate amount.

  



  

(d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity,
then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.10.

  



  

(e) The provisions of this Section 7.10 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs
and their representatives.

  



  

7.11. _Preferred Stock, AZ Notes and Warrants_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall take all necessary action to redeem the Preferred Stock
in accordance with the terms of the certificate of incorporation of the
Company and, if requested and as directed by Parent, prepay the AZ Note in
accordance with the terms of the AZ Note, in each case, including, but not
limited to, making a cash payment to the holder thereof of the Redemption
Price (as defined in the certificate of incorporation of the Company) (in the
case of the Preferred Stock) and the principal amount (in the case of the AZ
Note), or, to the extent the holder thereof exercises conversion rights with
respect to any or all of the Preferred Stock and/or AZ Note, issuing shares
of Common Stock in exchange therefor, in each case so as to cause all of the
Preferred Stock and AZ Note to be

  



  

56   

     
   

  



  

deemed not to be outstanding and of no further force and effect after taking
such actions; _provided_ , that in the event that the Company prepays the AZ
Note at the request of Parent and pursuant thereto is requested to make a
cash payment in respect thereof, Parent shall provide to the Company, as a
condition to the Companys obligations to prepay the AZ Note, the amount
required under the terms of the AZ Note to prepay the AZ Note.

  



  

(b) _Warrants_. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
all of the Warrants that are outstanding and exercisable prior to the
Effective Time to be terminated and cancelled prior to the Effective Time,
including offering to purchase such Warrants from the holders thereof at a
price equal to the product of the Per Share Merger Consideration and
such number of shares of Common Stock for which such Warrant is exercisable,
less the Warrant Price (as defined in the Warrant).

  



  

7.12. _Stockholder Litigation_. In the event that any stockholder litigation
related to this Agreement or the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is brought, or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened, against the Company and/or the members of the Board
of Directors of the Company prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
have the right to control the defense of such litigation; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall give the Parent the opportunity to
participate in the defense or settlement of any such stockholder litigation.
The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any such stockholder litigation
brought, or threatened, against the Company and/or members of the Board of
Directors of the Company and keep Parent promptly informed with respect to
the status thereof. The Company shall not make any payment or settlement
offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such litigation unless
Parent shall have consented in writing to such payment or settlement, in its
sole discretion.

  



  

7.13. _Other Actions by the Company and Parent_.

  



  

(a) _Takeover Statute_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each
of Parent and the Company and its Board of Directors shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement or by the Merger and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions.

  



  

(b) _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors
of the Company or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof,
shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC
so that the disposition of Shares, Company Options or Company Awards pursuant
to this Agreement in the Merger by any officer or director of the Company
who, at the Effective Time, is a covered person of the Company for

  



  

57   

     
   

  



  

purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act (together with the rules and
regulations thereunder, " _ _Section 16__ "), shall be an exempt transaction
for purposes of Section 16.

has not been withdrawn and (B) on or prior to the twelve-month anniversary of
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(b) or 9.1(d), an
Acquisition Proposal is consummated or the Company enters into an agreement
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal which is ultimately consummated
(whether prior to or after such twelve-month period), the Company shall pay
to Parent the Termination Fee;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the event
that (1) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.1(b) or 9.1(d)
and an Acquisition Proposal is subsequently consummated with or an agreement
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal is subsequently entered into during
the twelve-month period following termination with a Person other than the
Person making the Acquisition Proposal at the time of such termination and
(2) the consideration per share of Common Stock to be paid in such
Acquisition Proposal is less than the closing sale price of the Common Stock
as quoted on NASDAQ (as reported in the New York City edition of The Wall
Street Journal or, if not reported thereby, another authoritative source) on
December 13, 2005, then no Termination Fee shall be payable. For purposes of
this Section 9.2(b)(iii), the "consideration per share of Common Stock"
shall be determined as follows: (x) if the consideration consists of cash,
such amount of cash, (y) if the consideration consists of marketable
consideration, the value of such marketable securities at the close of
business on the day before the date such Acquisition Proposal is announced
and (z) if the consideration is in a form other than cash or marketable
securities, such value as the parties shall reasonably agree, in the case of
each of (x), (y) and (z), adjusted to reflect any required adjustments to
prevent dilution of the Common Stock.

  



  

(iv) The Termination Fee shall be payable (A) in the case of Section
9.2(b)(i), within two business days after the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.1(e), 9.1(f)(iv) or 9.1(f)(v) and (B) in the case of
Sections 9.2(b)(ii) or 9.2(b)(iii), concurrent with consummation of an
Acquisition Proposal.

The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in
this Section 9.2(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any
amount due pursuant to this Section 9.2(b), and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
Company for the Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount of the Termination Fee from the
date such payment was required until the date of payment at the prime rate of
Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

  



  

(c) _All Payments_. All payments under Section 9.2 shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the party
entitled to receive payment.

10.2. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by
action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at any
time prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after
receipt of the Company stockholder approval as set forth in Section 8.1(a),
no amendment may be made without further stockholder approval which, by Law
or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires
further approval by such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.

  



  

10.3. _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto may
(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in any

rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires further approval by
such stockholders. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound

compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure. No failure or delay by any party hereto in exercising any right,
power or privilege hereunder shall act as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

  



  

10.4. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate

between the parties under or related to the Agreement or the facts and
circumstances leading to its execution, whether in contract, tort or
otherwise, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of
the State of Delaware, without regard to the application of Delaware
principles of conflicts of laws.

  



  

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
Delaware State court, or Federal court of the United States of America,
sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements
delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto,
and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not

determined in such Delaware State court or, to the extent permitted by Law,
in such Federal court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in any such Delaware State
or Federal court, and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such Delaware State or Federal court. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in Section 10.6. Nothing in this

Agreement shall affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve
process in any other manner permitted by Law.

UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (iii) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
10.5.

10.7. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter, the
Confidentiality Agreement dated October 11, 2004, as amended, between Parent
and the Company (the " _ _Confidentiality Agreement__ ") and any written
agreement executed by the Company and Parent specifically referring to this
Section 10.7 constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior
agreements, understandings, representations and warranties, both written and
oral, between the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

  



  

10.8. _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors
and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, other than
pursuant to Section 10.13, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.

  



  

10.9. _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_.  Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a
Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of
the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

  



  

10.10. _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in the list of defined
terms included in this Agreement is defined in the Section of this Agreement
set forth opposite such term.

  



  

10.11. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force

  



  

67   

     
   

  



  

and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

  



  

10.12. _Interpretation; Construction_.

  



  

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Exhibits, or
Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include",
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation".

  



  

(b) Each party hereto has participated in the drafting of this Agreement,
which each party acknowledges is the result of extensive negotiations between
the parties. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden or proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state, local or
foreign statue or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the content requires
otherwise. It is understood and agreed that neither the specifications of any
dollar amount in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in the
Schedules or Exhibits is intended to imply that such amounts or higher or
lower amounts, or the items so included or other items, are or are not
material, and neither party shall use the fact of setting of such amounts or
the fact of the inclusion of such item in the Schedules or Exhibits in any
dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item
or matter is or is not material for purposes hereof.

  



  

10.13. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in
whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise), without the
prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void, except that
Merger Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement to any entity that is wholly-
owned directly by Parent without the consent of the Company.

  



  

10.14. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not to be performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties
shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof in addition to
any other remedies at Law or in equity.

  



  

68   

     
   

  



  

10.15. _Disclosure_. The provision of monetary or other quantitative
thresholds for disclosure does not and shall not be deemed to create or imply
a standard of materiality hereunder.

  



  

69   

     
   

  



  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
the duly authorized officers of the parties hereto as of the date first
