RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have
each determined that an acquisition of the Company by Parent is advisable,
fair to and in the best interests of their respective companies and
stockholders and, accordingly, have each approved the merger of Merger Sub

the conditions set forth in this Agreement and have each approved and
declared advisable this Agreement;

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Company has

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,

legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as
follows:

 

AGREEMENT

 

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company. Following the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ")
and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent and the separate corporate existence
of the Company, with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger except as set forth in
Article I.

Section 1.2  _Closing_.

(a) The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place (i) at
10:00 a.m., New York City time, at the offices of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and
Feld LLP, One Bryant Park, New York, New York, as soon as practicable but in
no event later than the latter of (A) the third Business Day following the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) and (B) the
earliest of (1) a date during the Marketing Period to be specified by Parent
on no fewer than three Business Days notice to the Company, (2) the final day
of the Marketing Period or (3) the date immediately preceding the Outside Date
if all the conditions set forth in Article VI have been satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be

 satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions); or (ii) on such other date, time or place as agreed to in writing
by Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred
to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ".

(b) The term " _Marketing Period_ " means the first period of 20 consecutive
days after the date hereof throughout which: (i) Parent shall have the
Required Financial Information that the Company is required to provide to
Parent pursuant to Section 5.14(b) in connection with any portion of the
Financing to be consummated on the Closing Date; _provided_ , that if the
Company shall in good faith reasonably believe it has delivered the Required
Financial Information, it may deliver to Parent a written notice to that
effect (stating when it believes it completed such delivery), in which case
the Marketing Period shall be deemed to have commenced on the date of such
notice unless the Company has not completed delivery of the Required
Financial Information and, within two Business Days after the delivery of such
notice by the Company, Parent delivers a written notice to the Company to that
effect (stating with specificity which Required Financial Information
the Company has not delivered) and (ii) the conditions set forth in Section
6.1 and Section 6.3 shall be satisfied or waived (other than those conditions
that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing); _provided_ ,
that the Marketing Period shall not be deemed to have commenced if, prior to
the completion of such 20-consecutive-day period, (A) the Companys auditor
shall have withdrawn its audit opinion with respect to any year end audited
financial statements set forth in the Company SEC Documents, (B) the
financial statements included in the Required Financial Information that is
available to Parent on the first day of any such 20-consecutive-day period
would be required to be updated under Rule 3-12 of Regulation S-X in order to
be sufficiently current on any day during such 20-consecutive-day period to
permit a registration statement using such financial statements to be declared
effective by the SEC on the last day of such 20-consecutive-day period, in
which case the Marketing Period shall not be deemed to commence until the
receipt by Parent of updated Required Financial Information that would be
required under Rule 3-12 of Regulation S-X to permit a registration statement
using such financial statements to be declared effective by the SEC on the
last day of such new 20-consecutive-day period, (C) the Company shall have
publicly announced any intention to restate any material financial

restatement is under consideration, in which case the Marketing Period shall
be deemed not to commence unless and until such restatement has been completed
and the Company SEC Documents have been amended or the Company has determined
that no restatement shall be required, or (D) the Company shall have been
delinquent in filing any annual or quarterly reports, or Current Reports on
Form 8-K under Items 1.03, 2.01, 2.03, 2.04, 3.01, 3.02, 3.03 and 5.02 that

Marketing Period will not be deemed to commence until all such delinquent
filings have been made; and _provided_ _further_ , that the Marketing Period
shall end on any earlier date on which the entire Financing is consummated,
regardless of whether the Marketing Period shall have been deemed to commence.

be considered a delinquent filing.

immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares to be canceled
in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and (ii) any Dissenting Shares) shall

(in each case, other than any such Shares held on behalf of

 



3 ##### Table of Contents

  

 third parties) shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease

Dissenting Share shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the

issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

(d) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Shares, or securities
convertible into or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares shall occur as
a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a
reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment
of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date
during such period, merger or other similar transaction, the Merger
Consideration and the Incentive Security Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted, without duplication, to reflect such change.

Section 2.2 _Exchange and Payment_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with a
paying agent selected by Parent with the Companys prior approval (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) for the stockholders of
the Company in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to
distribute the Merger Consideration to which stockholders of the Company
shall become entitled pursuant to this Article II. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the
Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient to make all payments pursuant to
this Article II (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment
Fund_ "), less any Merger Consideration paid directly to any record holder of
Shares pursuant to any agreement between such holder, Parent and the
Company providing for such payment and the surrender of such holders Shares.
The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments
of the Merger Consideration due pursuant to this Article II, except as
expressly provided in this Agreement. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all
charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, incurred by it in
connection with this Agreement.

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in any event
not later than the second Business Day thereafter, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of (i) an
outstanding certificate or certificates (" _Certificates_ ") that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares or (ii)
uncertificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ")
which, in each case, were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.1, (A) a form of
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by
such Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the
procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal) which letter shall be
prepared by Parent prior to the Effective Time with the consent and approval
(not to be unreasonably withheld) of the Company and (B) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares in exchange
for the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto pursuant to this
Article II. Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book Entry Share to the Paying
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed, and such other documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably require,
the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share. No interest shall be paid
or shall accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-
Entry Share. In the event that the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name any Certificate is registered, it
shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer, that the
signatures on such Certificate or any related stock power shall be properly
guaranteed and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer
or other Taxes required by reason of such payment to a Person other than
the registered

 



4 ##### Table of Contents

  

 holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender or transfer the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of Shares theretofore represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares without any interest thereon.

(c) All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
for transfer or transfer is sought for Book-Entry Shares, such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in
immediately available funds to which the holder of the Certificate is entitled
pursuant to this Article II, subject to applicable Law in the case of
Dissenting Shares.

 

(d) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as
directed by Parent, on a daily basis; _provided_ , that any investment of
such cash shall in all events be in short-term obligations of the United
States of America with maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the
United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States of America. If for any reason (including investment losses) the
cash in the Payment Fund is insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment
obligations to be made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder (but subject to
Section 2.3), Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Payment Fund in an
amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to
fully satisfy such cash payment obligations. Unless the parties hereto agree
otherwise with the Paying Agent, any interest and other income resulting from
such investments shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation.

(e) At any time following the date that is six months after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent
to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect
thereto, subject to the last sentence of Section 2.2(d)) which have been made
available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be
entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect
to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares.

 

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Paying Agent
may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 2.3  _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any holder of Shares or otherwise pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "),
or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

Section 2.4 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, any Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are held by any holder who has not voted in

 favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time in accordance with
Section 2.1(a), unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect, or
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such holders right to appraisal
under the DGCL. Dissenting Shares shall be treated in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect such appraisal right in
accordance with the DGCL or withdraws or otherwise loses any such right to
appraisal, each such Share of such holder shall thereupon be converted into
and become exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of the later of the
Effective Time and the time that such right to appraisal has been irrevocably
lost, withdrawn or expired, the Merger Consideration in accordance with
Section 2.1(a). The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands
for appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such notices or demands
and any other instruments received by the Company relating to rights to
appraisal, and, prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall have the reasonable
right to participate in, and after the Effective Time, Parent shall have the
right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent or as required under the DGCL, make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

by written consent of stockholders in lieu of meeting (the " _Company
Stockholder Approval_ "), to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are
necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, subject, in the case of the consummation of the Merger,
to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and to the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State as required by the

the Company (in each case as such term is used in Section 203 of the DGCL) as
a result of the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions in the manner contemplated hereby. The Company Stockholder
Approval is the only vote or consent of the holders of any class or series of
capital stock of the Company necessary to approve this Agreement, the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons
conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.
The Company agrees that it will take the necessary steps to promptly inform

Agreement. The Company also agrees that it will promptly request each Person
that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with
its consideration of acquiring the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such
Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in
accordance therewith.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to, but not after, the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, if the
Company or any of its Representatives receives an Acquisition Proposal for
more than 50% of the assets (on a consolidated basis) or total voting power of
the equity securities of the Company from any Person that did not result
from a material breach of Section 5.2(a), the Company and its Representatives
may contact such Person solely to clarify the terms and conditions thereof and
(i) the Company and its Representatives may provide non-public information and
data concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries in response to a request
therefor by such Person if the Company receives from such Person an executed
confidentiality agreement on customary terms not more favorable to such Person
in any material respect than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
(it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the
making or amendment of an Acquisition Proposal to the extent such Acquisition
Proposal is made directly to the Company), (ii) the Company and its
Representatives may engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations
with such Person and (iii) after having complied with Section 5.2(d), the
Company Board or any committee thereof may authorize, adopt, approve,
recommend, or otherwise declare advisable or propose to authorize, adopt,
approve, recommend or declare advisable (publicly or otherwise) such an
Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that, (x) prior to taking any
action described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the Company Board or any
committee thereof determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (y) in each
such case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, the Company Board or

 



29 ##### Table of Contents

  

 any committee thereof has determined in good faith based on the information
then available and after consultation with its financial advisor that such
Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal; and (z) in the case
referred to in clause (iii) above, the Company Board or any committee thereof
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
meanings assigned below:

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal or offer with respect
to a merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution,
liquidation, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange,
business combination or similar transaction involving the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or (ii) any acquisition by any Person or group of Persons
resulting in, or proposal or offer to acquire by tender offer, share exchange
or in any other manner which if consummated would result in, any Person or
group of Persons becoming the beneficial owner of, directly or indirectly, in
one or a series of related transactions, (A) more than 15% of the Shares then
outstanding or the total voting power of the equity securities of the Company
or (B) assets constituting more than 15% of consolidated total assets,
measured either by book value or fair market value (including, without
limitation, equity securities of its Subsidiaries), of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in each case other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal (with
the percentages set forth in the definition of such term changed from 15% to
50%), other than an Acquisition Proposal solicited in violation of this
Section 5.2, that the Company Board or any committee thereof has determined
in its good faith judgment (i) is reasonably likely to be consummated in
accordance with its terms, taking into account all legal, financial and
regulatory aspects of the proposal (including the financing thereof) and the
Person making the proposal, and (ii) if consummated, would result in a
transaction more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial
point of view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. 

(d) Except as set forth in this Section 5.2(d), Section 5.2(e) or Section
7.1(c)(ii), the Company Board and each committee thereof shall not:

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, its
recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger or approve or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve or recommend, or resolve to approve or recommend,
any Acquisition Proposal (it being understood that the Company Board may take
no position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until the close of
business as of the tenth Business Day after the commencement of such
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act without
such action being considered an adverse modification); or

(ii) except as permitted by Section 7.1(c)(ii) hereof, cause or permit the
Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other
agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section
5.2(b)) (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") relating to any
Acquisition Proposal.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement
(including clauses (i) and (ii), above), prior to the time, but not after, the
Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board and any committee
thereof may withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify its recommendation of this
Agreement and the Merger or approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable
any Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board or any committee thereof
determines in good faith is a Superior Proposal made after the date hereof
that was not solicited, initiated, encouraged or facilitated in breach of this
Agreement, if the Company Board or any committee thereof determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to
take such action is likely to be inconsistent with the Company Boards
fiduciary duties under applicable Law (an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ")
and may also take action pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the

 



30 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Company shall not effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with
a Superior Proposal or take any action pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) with
respect to a Superior Proposal unless the Company notifies Parent in writing
at least three Business Days in advance, that it intends to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change in connection with a Superior Proposal or to take action
pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) with respect to a Superior Proposal;
_provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that in the event that the Acquisition
Proposal is thereafter modified by the party making such Acquisition Proposal,
the Company shall provide written notice to Parent of such modified
Acquisition Proposal and shall again comply with this Section 5.2(d), except
that the Companys advance written notice obligation shall be reduced to two
Business Days (rather than the three Business Days otherwise contemplated
by this Section 5.2(d)), and the time the Company shall be permitted to
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with a Superior Proposal
or to take action pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) with respect to a Superior
Proposal shall be reduced to two Business Days after it has provided such
written notice (rather than the three Business Days otherwise contemplated by
this Section 5.2(d)) (but in no event prior to the original three Business
Days advance notice period). In determining whether to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal or otherwise, the
Company Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent and any other information provided by Parent in
response to such notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement, Parent may propose changes to the terms of this
Agreement in connection with this Section 5.2 without the written consent of
the Company or the Company Board.

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof from complying with its
disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders), or (ii) making
any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communications to the stockholders of the Company); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither the Company nor the Company Board (or any committee thereof)
shall be permitted to recommend that the Company stockholders tender any
securities in connection with any tender or exchange offer (or otherwise
approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal), unless in each case,
in connection therewith, the Company Board (or any committee thereof) effects
an Adverse Recommendation Change consistent with and subject to its
obligations set forth in Section 5.2(d); _provided_ _further_ , _however_ that
if any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act) does not reaffirm the Company Recommendation, such disclosure
shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change and Parent shall have
the right to terminate this Agreement as set forth in Section 7.1(d)(ii).

(f) The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event, within 24
hours) notify Parent if any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal are received by, any such information is requested from,
or any such discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or
continued with, it or any of its Representatives indicating, in connection
with such notice, the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers
and thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, of the status
of any such proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto) and the
status of any such discussions or negotiations.

a Material Adverse Effect or (y) a material adverse effect on the business,
financial condition or results of operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries
(excluding the Company and its Subsidiaries), taken as a whole, or (any action

agree to any changes (including, without limitation, through a licensing
arrangement) or restriction on, or other impairment of Parents ability to own

its respective commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such
Action and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and
Merger Sub agree that they shall defend, at their cost and expense, any Action

present (as of the Effective Time) and former officer, director or employee
of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against
all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and
reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements, incurred in connection with any Action, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to (i)

(b) Except as may be required by applicable Law, Parent and the Company agree
that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any
Indemnified Party as provided in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
(or comparable organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries
or in any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and continue in
full force and effect, and shall not be amended, repealed, modified or
otherwise supplemented in any manner that would adversely affect any right
thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

 

(c) For a six-year period from the Effective Time, Parent shall either cause
to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the
Company and its Subsidiaries or cause to be provided substitute policies or
purchase or cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase, a "tail policy," in
either case of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions that are not less advantageous in the aggregate than such policy
with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time;  _provided_
, _however_ , that after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to
pay in the aggregate with respect to such insurance policies premiums in
excess of $1,000,000, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage
as reasonably practicable for such amount; _provided_ _further_ , that if the
Surviving Corporation purchases a "tail policy" and the coverage thereunder
costs more than $1,000,000, the Surviving Corporation shall purchase
the maximum amount of coverage that can be obtained for $1,000,000. At the
Companys option, the Company may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a
six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions (in both amount and
scope) providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising
on or before the Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions
contemplated hereby. If such tail prepaid policy has been obtained by the
Company prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be
maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is instituted against any
Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, the provisions of this Section 5.11 shall continue
in effect until the final disposition of such Action.

(e) The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant
to Law, Contract or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.11 shall
survive the consummation of the Merger and, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, expressly are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives.

(f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.11.

 

Section 5.12 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be
permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
hereto to cause dispositions of Shares and Incentive Equity Securities
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual
who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

other hand, shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with each
other before issuing, and give each other a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
shall not issue any such press release or make any public announcement prior
to such consultation and review, except as may be required by applicable Law,
court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any
national securities exchange or national securities quotation system. Parent
and the Company agree that the press release announcing the execution and
delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint release of Parent and the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is an inconsistency between the terms
of this Section 5.13 and the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of this
Section 5.13 shall prevail.

(b) The Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all
things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under

by the Surviving Corporation of the Shares from the NASDAQ and the
deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time, and in any event no more than 10 days after the

Section 5.14 _Financing_.

 

(a) Each of Parent, Satellite Services and Merger Sub shall use, and shall
cause its Affiliates to use, commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Financing Letters pursuant to which the parties
thereto have committed to provide the financing (such financing, or any
financing in lieu thereof as contemplated by the Financing Letters, the "
_Financing Commitment_ "), including using commercially reasonable efforts (i)
to maintain in effect the Financing Commitment in accordance with the terms
and subject to the conditions thereof, (ii) to negotiate and enter into the
definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
contained in the Financing Commitment (or on other terms acceptable to
Parent, provided such terms do not contain any conditions to funding on the
Closing Date that are not set forth in the Financing Commitment and would not
otherwise reasonably be expected to impair or delay the consummation of the
Financing), (iii) to satisfy (or cause its Affiliates to satisfy) on a timely
basis all conditions to obtaining the Financing set forth in the Financing
Commitment, (iv) to exercise its option to extend the Initial Date (as
defined in the Financing Commitment) and to satisfy the conditions required to
extend the Initial Date only to the extent that the Financing has not been
obtained and (v) to consummate the Financing contemplated by the
Financing Commitment at or prior to the Closing. In the event that any
portion of the Financing becomes unavailable (including by expiration in
accordance with its terms) on the terms and conditions set forth in the
Financing Commitment, Parent shall promptly notify the Company, and Parent
and Satellite Services shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, any such
portion from alternative sources (" _Alternative Financing_ ") on terms that
will still enable Parent, Satellite Services and Merger Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that are approved by the
Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Parent and Satellite Services shall deliver to the Company true and
complete copies of all agreements (including any fee letters and engagement
letters, provided that amounts in such letters may be redacted unless
such redactions would adversely affect the amount, conditionality,
enforceability or availability of the Financing) pursuant to which any such
alternative source shall have committed to provide Parent, Satellite Services
or the Surviving Corporation with any portion of the Financing. None of
Parent, Satellite Services or Merger Sub shall agree, without the Companys
prior written consent, to or permit any amendment, supplement or other
modification of, or waive any of its rights under, the Financing Commitment
if such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver (x) reduces the
aggregate amount of the Financing or (y) imposes new or additional conditions
or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the receipt
of the Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (I) delay or
prevent the Closing Date, (II) make the funding of the Financing (or

 



40 ##### Table of Contents

  

 satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing) less likely to
occur or (III) adversely impact the ability of each of Parent, Satellite
Services and Merger Sub to enforce its rights against other parties to the
Financing Commitment or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing.
Any Alternative Financing shall (X) be in an amount sufficient to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including paying the Merger
Consideration, and all fees and expenses) and (Y) not impose new or additional
conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the
receipt of the Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (1)
delay or prevent the Closing Date or (2) make the funding of the Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing) less likely to
occur; _provided_ that neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required
to arrange Alternate Financing on economic terms which are less favorable and
other terms and conditions (other than conditions to funding) which are
materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent and Merger Sub than
those included in the Financing Commitment. Upon obtaining any commitment for
any Alternative Financing, such Alternative Financing shall be deemed to be
the Financing Commitment for purposes of this Agreement. Parent shall keep the
Company informed on a current basis of the status of its efforts to obtain
the Financing, provide the Company copies of all documents related to the
Financing and give the Company prompt notice of any material breach by any
party to the Financing Commitment of which Parent becomes aware or any
termination of the Financing Commitment. Without limiting the foregoing,
Parent agrees to notify the Company promptly, and in any event within two
Business Days, if at any time (A) any of the Financing Letters shall expire or
be terminated for any reason, (B) any financing source that is a party to any
of the Financing Letters notifies Parent, Satellite Services or Merger Sub
that such source no longer intends to provide financing on the terms set forth
therein or (C) to the knowledge of Parent (without a requirement of due
inquiry), any party to any of the Financing Letters is or is alleged to be in
breach or default thereafter. In the event that the Stockholders Written
Consents are not delivered to the Company in accordance with Section 5.3(b),
the parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to market the
Financing concurrently with the solicitation of proxies in connection with the
Company Stockholders Meeting, subject to the concurrence of the underwriters
and lead arrangers that doing so will not adversely affect the marketing of
the Financing, with the objective of completing the Merger as promptly as
practicable after the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting.

(b) The Company shall provide, shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and their
representatives to provide such reasonable cooperation in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent,
including (i) participation in a customary and reasonable number of meetings,
drafting sessions, presentations, road shows and due diligence and sessions
with the financing sources, investors and rating agencies, (ii) furnishing
Parent and the financing sources as promptly as practicable with financial
and other pertinent information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as
may be reasonably requested by Parent to consummate the Financing, including
all financial statements and financial and other data of the type required by
Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act for registered
offerings of debt securities (including any financial statements required by
Regulation S-X Rule 3-10 but not any financial statements required by Rule
3-16), and of the type and form customarily included in offering documents
used in private placements under Rule 144A of the Securities Act and other
documents required to satisfy any customary negative assurance comfort from
independent accountants, to consummate the Financing at the time or times the
Financing is to be consummated, including all of the financial information
related to the Company and its Subsidiaries necessary to satisfy the
conditions set forth in the Financing Commitment, _provided_ that
throughout the Marketing Period, none of the information provided by the
Company in connection herewith to be included in the offering documents shall
contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (information and data
required to be delivered pursuant to this clause (ii) being referred to as the
" _Required Financial Information_ "), (iii) assisting Parent and its
financing sources in the preparation of (A) any offering documents, private
placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and other
informational and marketing materials and documents for any portion of the
Financing, (B) any legal documents to be executed by the Company and any of
its Subsidiaries (subject to receipt of all requisite funds from the Parent
and its financing sources) relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the
HNS Senior Notes to be delivered at the Effective Time and (C) materials for
rating agency presentations, (iv) reasonably cooperating with the marketing
efforts of Parent and the financing sources for any

 portion of the Financing, (v) executing and delivering any necessary pledge
and security documents and otherwise reasonably facilitating the granting of a
security interest (and perfection thereof) in collateral, guarantees,
mortgages, other definitive financing documents or other certificates or
documents as may reasonably be requested by Parent; _provided_ , that no such
document or obligation of the Company shall be effective prior to the
Effective Time, (vi) obtaining customary authorization letters with respect to
the bank information memoranda and consents of accountants for use of their
reports in any materials relating to the Financing, (vii) using commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain accountants comfort letters, surveys and title
insurance as reasonably requested by Parent, (viii) subject to the occurrence
of the Closing, taking all corporate actions, necessary to permit
the consummation of the Financing and (ix) using commercially reasonable
efforts to prepare financial statements of any FCC License Subsidiary (as
defined in the Financing Letters as in effect as of the date hereof) of the
Company that would be required by Parent to be included under Rule 3-16 under
Regulation S-X in a registered offering of secured debt securities
contemplated by the Financing (it being understood that the financial
statements contemplated by this clause (ix) shall not be part of the Required
Financial Information); _provided_ , that (I) neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other fee, provide
any security, reimburse any expense, give any indemnity, prepay any Company
indebtedness or incur any other liability in connection with the Financing or
any Alternative Financing prior to the Effective Time, (II) such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (III) all non-public or otherwise
confidential information regarding the Company obtained by Parent, Satellite
Services and Merger Sub or their representatives pursuant to this Section
5.14(b) be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement, except that such information may be disclosed to potential
syndicate members during syndication, other potential Lenders or potential
participants, subject to customary confidentiality undertakings by such
potential syndicate members, other potential Lenders or potential participants
and (IV) the Company shall be permitted a reasonable period to comment on any
documents or other information circulated to potential financing sources.
Parent (x) shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable attorneys fees)
incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
such cooperation, (y) acknowledges and agrees that the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective representatives shall not have any
responsibility for, or incur any liability to any person prior to the
Effective Time under, the Financing or any Alternative Financing and (z)
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective representatives from and against any and all losses, damages,
claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing and any information utilized in connection
therewith.

(c) Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge and agree that receipt of the
Financing or any Alternative Financing does not constitute a condition to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
