AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter referred to as this "Agreement"),
dated August 12, 2008, by and among The Middleby Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), Chef Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and TurboChef
Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

 

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
has unanimously approved and declared advisable the acquisition of the
Company by Parent by means of the merger of the Company with and into Merger
Sub upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and have
approved and declared advisable this Agreement;

 

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board
of Directors") has unanimously determined that the Merger Consideration
(as defined in Section 2.1(c)) to be received by holders of shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Shares") is fair
to the holders of such Shares from a financial point of view and has resolved
to recommend that the holders of Shares adopt this Agreement, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and

 

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to Parent\'s willingness to enter into this
Agreement, each director, executive officer and stockholder of the Company
set forth on Schedule 1 hereto has executed a Voting and Support Agreement in
respect of Shares beneficially owned by such director, officer or
stockholder, the forms of which are attached hereto as an exhibit to
Schedule 1.

 

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

 

 

ARTICLE I

 

 

THE MERGER

 

 

Section 1.1 The Merger. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Company and Merger
Sub shall consummate a merger (the "Merger") pursuant to which (i)
the Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub and the separate
corporate existence of the Company shall thereupon cease, (ii) Merger Sub
shall be the successor or surviving corporation in the Merger and shall
continue to be governed by the Laws of the State of Delaware, and (iii) the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub with all its rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger.
The corporation surviving the Merger is sometimes hereinafter referred to as
the "Surviving Corporation." The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
the DGCL.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) The Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended as provided by Law and such
Certificate of Incorporation.

 

 

(c) The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter
amended as provided by Law, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation and such Bylaws.

 

 

Section 1.2 Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, on
the Closing Date (as defined in Section 1.3), the parties shall (i) file the
appropriate Certificate of Merger in such form as is required by and executed
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and (ii) make all
other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger will become
effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the

Merger (such time hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time").

 

 

Section 1.3 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will
take place at 10:00 a.m., Chicago time, as soon as practicable, but in any
event no later than the second Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of
all of the conditions set forth in Article VII (the "Closing Date"), at the
offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, 333 West Wacker Drive,

The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation, and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of
the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors
shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier

Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.

 

 

Section 1.5 Subsequent Actions. If at any time after the Effective Time the
Surviving Corporation shall determine, in its reasonable discretion, that any
actions are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or
under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or
Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a
result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this
Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall
be authorized take all such actions as may be necessary or desirable to vest

ARTICLE II

 

 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

 

 



 

 

Section 2.1 Conversion of Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any
Shares or the holders of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock"):

 

 

(a) Each outstanding share of Merger Sub Common Stock shall remain
outstanding and shall constitute the only issued and outstanding shares of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

(b) All Shares that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any Shares
owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent
shall be cancelled and retired, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

 

 

(c) Subject to Section 2.1(e) below, each outstanding Share, (other than
Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and other than
Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive: (i) 0.0486
(the "Exchange Ratio") of a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent ("Parent
Common Stock") (the "Stock Consideration"), and (ii) $3.67 in cash, without
interest (the "Cash Consideration", and together with the Stock
Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all Shares
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this
Section 2.1(c) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (or, in
the case of uncertificated Shares, evidence of such Shares in book-entry
form) which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such
Shares (each, a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration and cash in
lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d), in each
case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of
such Certificate (or, in the case of uncertificated Shares, evidence of such
Shares in book-entry form) in accordance with this Section 2.2(b),
without interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, the shares of outstanding Parent
Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class, by reason of the occurrence or record date of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction, then the Exchange
Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such action. The right of
any holder of a Certificate to receive the Merger Consideration and cash in
lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d) shall, to
the extent provided in Section 2.2(i), be subject to and reduced by the
amount of any withholding that is required under applicable Tax Law.

 

 

(d) Dissenting Shares.

 

 

(i) Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and which are held by holders who have not voted in favor of or
consented to the Merger and who are entitled to demand and have properly
demanded their rights to be paid the fair value of such Shares in

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not
be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, and the holders thereof shall be entitled to only such
rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that
if any such stockholder of the Company shall fail to perfect or shall
effectively waive, withdraw or lose such stockholder\'s rights under Section
262 of the DGCL, such stockholder\'s Dissenting Shares in respect of which
the stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive fair value under
Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been cancelled, at
the Effective Time, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration (payable without any interest thereon) as compensation
for such cancellation.

 

 

(ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any notice received
by the Company of intent to demand the fair value of any Shares, withdrawals
of such notices and any other instruments or notices served pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL and (B) the opportunity to direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent or as otherwise required by an Order, (x) make any payment
or other commitment with respect to any such exercise of appraisal rights,
(y) offer to settle or settle any such rights or (z) waive any failure to
timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or timely take any other action
to perfect appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL.

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Article II to the contrary, the Stock
Consideration and the Cash Consideration paid for each Share converted
pursuant to Section 2.1(c) shall be adjusted in the manner set forth herein
to account for the excess cash paid to holders of Dissenting Shares pursuant
to Section 2.1(d) over the amount of cash such holders would have received
had the Dissenting Shares been converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c) (the
"Dissenters\' Excess Cash", which shall be equal to 40% of the total cash
paid in exchange for the Dissenting Shares). First, the Cash Consideration
payable for each Share shall be reduced pro rata by an aggregate amount equal
to the Dissenters' Excess Cash. Second, the Stock Consideration (and
the Exchange Ratio) payable for each Share shall be increased pro rata by
an aggregate amount equal to the Dissenters' Excess Cash (based on the per
share value of the Parent Common Stock as of the day immediately preceding
the date of this Agreement). Nothing in this Section 2.1(e) is intended
to result in a change to the aggregate amount of cash and the aggregate
number of shares of Parent Common Stock payable in exchange for the Shares
(including Dissenting Shares) as of the date of this Agreement pursuant to
this Article II.

 

 

Section 2.2 Exchange of Certificates.

 

 

(a) Exchange Agent. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit with a bank or trust company
designated by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the
"Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates (or, in the
case of uncertificated Shares, evidence of such Shares in book-entry form),
certificates representing Parent Common Shares in an amount sufficient to pay
the Stock Consideration and cash in an amount sufficient to pay the Cash
Consideration required to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be paid pursuant to Section 2.1(c) in the aggregate amount equal to the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock and amount of cash into which such
Shares have been converted (in each case, other than Dissenting Shares). In
addition, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from
time to time after the Effective Time, cash in lieu of any fractional shares
payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d). All cash and shares of Parent Common
Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 2.2(a)
shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund".

 

 

(b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, but in any event
no later than the fifth Business Day after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate (or, in the case of uncertificated Shares, evidence of such
Shares in book-entry form) whose Shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of any fractional shares
payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d) (i) a form of letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in customary form and
contain customary provisions including customary provisions with respect to
delivery of an "agent\'s message" with respect to Shares held in book-entry
form) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d). Each holder of record
of one or more Certificates shall, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of
such Certificate or Certificates (or, if applicable, delivery of an "agent\'s
message"), together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) the amount of cash to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c), (ii) a certificate or
certificates representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
(after taking into account all Certificates surrendered by such holder) to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and (iii) cash in
lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d), and the
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares which is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay
any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the transfer or establish
to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes have been paid or
are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b),
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to
Section 2.2(d). No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any payment to
holders of Certificates or holders of Shares in book-entry form pursuant to
the provisions of this Article II.

 

 

(c) No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. The Merger Consideration and cash
in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d)
paid upon the surrender of Certificates (or, if applicable, delivery of an
"agent\'s message") in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Shares formerly represented by such Certificates. At the close of business on
the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the share transfer books of the
Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the share transfer books of the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is
presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, it shall be cancelled
against delivery of and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

 

 

(d) No Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates or holders of Shares in book-entry form (or, if
applicable, delivery of an "agent\'s message"), and such fractional
share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights
of a stockholder of Parent. Each holder of Shares who otherwise would
have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall
receive in lieu thereof cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A)
the fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account
all Shares formerly represented by all Certificates surrendered by such
holder) would otherwise be entitled by (B) the per share closing price of the
Parent Common Stock on the last trading day immediately prior to the Closing
Date, as such price is reported on the NASDAQ Stock Market (as reported by
Bloomberg Financial Markets or such other source as the parties shall agree
in writing).

 

 

(e) Termination of the Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or holders of Shares
in book-entry form for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered
to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates or holders of
Shares in book-entry form who have not theretofore complied with this Article
II shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable
for, payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of
any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d) in accordance with
this Article II.

 

 

(f) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any shares of Parent Common Stock or other distributions from the Exchange
Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

 

(g) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent (i) direct obligations of
or guaranteed by the United States of America, (ii) commercial paper rated
the highest quality by either Moody\'s Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and
Poor\'s Rating Group, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. or (iii)
money market, bank repurchase agreements or bankers\' acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $3 billion, or any of the foregoing
and, in any such case, no such investment shall be subject to an extended
maturity that would prohibit immediate liquidation and access to such funds.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid
to and be income of Parent. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in
the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment
obligations to be made in cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall
promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to
the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash
payment obligations.

 

 

(h) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such
person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of
any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d), in each
case pursuant to this Article II.

 

 

(i) Withholding Rights. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent determine are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under Code,
or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of Certificates or holder of shares in book-entry form in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent.

 

 

(j) Exchange Agent Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, Parent
shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in
connection with the exchange of the Merger Consideration for Certificates.

 

 

Section 2.3 Company Equity Plans; Exchange Rights.

 

 

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate the
Company\'s 2003 Stock Incentive Plan and any predecessor plans thereto, each
as amended through the date of this Agreement (collectively, the
"Option Plans"). Each holder of an option to purchase shares of common stock
of the Company granted under the Option Plans or otherwise (each,
an "Option") that is outstanding and unexercised at the Effective Time
whether or not vested pursuant to the terms of the applicable Option Plan,
other than holders of an Option to purchase shares of common stock of the
Company granted under the Company's former 1994 Stock Option Plan (the
"Outstanding 1994 Plan Options") shall be entitled to receive from the
Surviving Corporation as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, in exchange for the cancellation of such Option, a payment in cash,
payable in U.S. dollars and without interest, equal to the product of (i) (A)
the excess, if any, of (1) the Cash Consideration plus (2) (x) the Exchange
Ratio multiplied by (y) the Parent Reference Price over (B) the per share
exercise price of such Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of Shares
subject to such Option as of the Effective Time. Any such payments shall be
subject to Section 2.3(d). The Surviving Corporation shall assume the
Outstanding 1994 Plan Options as options to purchase shares of Parent Common
Stock, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth on Schedule
2 hereto. The Surviving Corporation shall assume the MSLO Warrant upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in that certain Waiver,
Amendment and Assumption, dated August 12, 2008, among the Company, Parent
and Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc., a copy of which is attached hereto
in Schedule 3.

 

 

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award
evidencing the right to receive shares of common stock of the Company granted
under the Option Plans or otherwise (each, a "Restricted Stock Unit") that
is outstanding immediately prior

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thereto shall become fully vested as to the number of shares of common stock
of the Company that are the subject thereof as of the Effective Time and
shall by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any
holder of any Restricted Stock Unit be cancelled and converted into the right
to receive from the Surviving Corporation as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time the Merger Consideration in respect of such number
of shares of common stock of the Company that are the subject thereof. Any
such payments shall be subject to Section 2.3(d).

 

 

(c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
actions necessary to cause each Enersyst Development Center, L.L.C. preferred
unit exchange right (each, an "Exchange Right") granted pursuant to that
certain Preferred Unit Exchange Agreement dated May 21, 2004 that is
outstanding and unexercised at the Effective Time to be cancelled, and each
such holder of Exchange Rights shall be entitled to receive from the
Surviving Corporation as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, in exchange for the cancellation of such Exchange Rights, the Merger
Consideration in respect of such number of shares of common stock of the
Company that are the subject thereof. Any such payments shall be subject to
Section 2.3(d).

 

 

(d) The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to Sections 2.3(a)-(c) to any holder
of Options, Restricted Stock Units and Exchange Rights such amounts as the
Company is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law,
and shall deposit such amounts with the appropriate taxing authority on
behalf of the applicable holder. To the extent that amounts are so deducted
and withheld by the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the Options, Restricted Stock Units or Exchange Rights in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary action
(i) (in accordance with that certain SEC no-action letter, dated January 12,
1999, to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP) to provide that the
treatment of Options pursuant to Section 2.3(a) will qualify for exemption
under Rule 16b-3(d) or (e), as applicable, under the Exchange Act, and (ii)
to effect the treatment of the Option Plans and Options, Restricted
Stock Units and Exchange Rights set forth in this Section 2.3, including
obtaining any and all necessary consents.

 

 

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent, the Company and Exchange Agent shall
mutually agree on the mechanics for the payment (as promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time) of the consideration to be received under this
Section 2.3 to holders of Options, Restricted Stock Units and Exchange
Rights.

Except as set forth on the disclosure schedule, dated the date hereof,
delivered by the Company to Parent (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), with
specific reference to the particular Section or subsection of this Agreement
to which the limitation set forth in such Company Disclosure Schedule relates
(it being understood that any information set forth in a particular Section
or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to apply to
and qualify each other Section or subsection thereof or hereof to the extent
that it is readily apparent on its face that such information is relevant to
such other Section or subsection thereof or hereof), the Company represents
and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as set forth below.

 

 

Section 3.1 Organization. i) The Company is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware
and has full corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted.

 

 

(b) The Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign
corporation and in good standing in each jurisdiction where such
qualification or licensing is necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed or in good standing could not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
As used in this Agreement, "Company Material Adverse Effect" means any
change, circumstance, development, occurrence, event, fact or effect that,
when considered either individually or in the aggregate, is or is reasonably
likely to be materially adverse to (A) the business, properties, assets,
liabilities, consolidated results of operations or condition (financial or
otherwise) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
(B) the ability of the Company to perform any of its obligations under or
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that in the case of clause (A) only, none of the following shall be
deemed to be, and shall not be taken into account when determining whether
there has been, a Company Material Adverse Effect: changes, circumstances,
developments, occurrences, events, facts or effects resulting from (i)
changes affecting the industries in which the Company and its Company
Subsidiaries operate; (ii) any conditions affecting the economy or the
financial, debt, credit, or securities markets in the United States,
including as a result of changes in geopolitical conditions; (iii) acts of
war (whether or not declared), armed hostilities and acts of terrorism,
or developments or changes therein; (iv) any conditions resulting from
natural disasters; (v) compliance by the Company and its Company Subsidiaries
with the covenants contained in this Agreement; (vi) any failure by the
Company to meet any published analyst estimates or expectations of the
Company\'s revenue, earnings or other financial performance or results of
operations for any period ending on or after the date of this Agreement (it
being understood that the exception in this clause (vi) is strictly limited
to any such failure in and of itself and shall not prevent or otherwise
affect a determination that any change, circumstance, development,
occurrence, event, fact or effect underlying such failure has resulted in or
contributed to a Company Material Adverse Effect); (vii) any action taken or
omitted to be taken by or at the written request or with the written consent
of Parent; (viii) changes in GAAP or authoritative interpretations thereof;
unless, in the case of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), such change, circumstance,
development, occurrence, event, fact or effect has a materially
disproportionate effect on the Company compared with other companies
operating in the industries in which the Company operates; or (ix) any
announcement of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in
each case, solely to the extent due to such announcement. The Company has
heretofore delivered to Parent complete and correct copies of the Certificate
of

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Incorporation and Bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of the Company
and each Company Subsidiary as presently in effect.

 

 

Section 3.2 Subsidiaries and Affiliates. ii) Section 3.2(a)(i) of the

the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, statements, exhibits, and other
documents required by it to be filed under the Exchange Act or the Securities
Act (collectively, the "Company SEC Documents"). As of its filing date or,
if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the last
such amendment, each Company SEC Document complied

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act
and the Securities Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder. As of its filing date or, if amended
prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the last such
amendment, each Company SEC Document filed pursuant to the Exchange Act did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. Each Company SEC Document that is a
registration statement, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed
pursuant to the Securities Act, as of the date such registration statement or
amendment became effective prior to the date of this Agreement, did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. None of the Company Subsidiaries is required to file any forms,
reports or other documents with the SEC. As of its filing date or, if amended
prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the last such
amendment, all of the audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited
consolidated interim financial statements of the Company included in the
Company SEC Documents (collectively, the "Financial Statements") (i)
complied in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements
and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto,
(ii) have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and except,
in the case of the unaudited interim statements, as may be permitted under
Form 10-Q of the Exchange Act) and (iii) fairly present in all material
respects the consolidated financial position and the consolidated results of
operations and cash flows (subject, in the case of unaudited interim
financial statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments) of the
Company and its consolidated Company Subsidiaries as of the times and for the
periods referred to therein.

 

 

(b) The Company has heretofore furnished to Parent complete and correct
copies of all comment letters from the SEC since January 1, 2005 through the

Stock Market.

 

 

(d) The Company maintains a system of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance (i) that the Company maintains
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect its
transactions and dispositions of assets, (ii) that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP, (iii) that receipts and expenditures are executed only in accordance
with authorizations of management and the Board of Directors and (iv)
regarding prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use
or disposition of the Company\'s assets that could have a material effect on
the Company\'s consolidated financial statements. The Company has evaluated
the effectiveness of the Company\'s internal control over financial reporting
and, to the extent required by applicable

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Law, presented in any applicable Company SEC Document that is a report on
Form 10-K or Form 10-Q or any amendment thereto its conclusions about the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting as of the end
of the period covered by such report or amendment based on such evaluation.
The Company has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of internal
control over financial reporting, to the Company\'s auditors and the audit
committee of the Board of Directors (and made available to Parent a summary
of the significant aspects of such disclosure) (A) all significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect the Company\'s ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the

13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed
to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to
be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all
such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company\'s management

officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to
such reports.

 

 

(f) To the knowledge of the Company, there are no SEC inquiries or
investigations, other governmental inquiries or investigations or internal
investigations pending or threatened in each case regarding any accounting
practices of the Company or any malfeasance by any director or executive
officer of the Company. Since January 1, 2005 there have been no
internal investigations regarding accounting or revenue recognition discussed
with, reviewed by or initiated at the direction of the chief executive
officer, chief financial officer, general counsel or similar legal officer,
the Board or any committee thereof.

financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer
of the Company and each former principal financial officer of the Company,
as applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14
under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
with respect to the Company SEC Documents, and the statements contained in
such certifications are true and accurate. For purposes of this
Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer"
shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The
Company does not have, and has not arranged any, outstanding "extensions of
credit" to directors or executive officers within the meaning of Section 402
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet

relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose
or limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand) or any "off-balance
sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC),

Company or any Company Subsidiary in the Company\'s published financial
statements or other Company SEC Documents.

Adverse Effect or (ii) materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. No judgment, decree, injunction, rule or

Code, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no condition exists that would be
expected to materially adversely affect such qualification.

 

 

(e) None of the Benefit Plans is, and none of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, nor any trade or business, whether or not incorporated,
that, together with

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Company would be deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of

Affiliate"), has within the last six (6) years, maintained or had an
obligation to contribute to (i) a "single employer plan" (as such term is
defined in Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA) subject to Section 412 of the Code

Affiliate has engaged in a "prohibited transaction" (as such term is
defined in Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code) or any other
breach of fiduciary responsibility with respect to any Benefit Plan that
reasonably could be expected to subject the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to any material tax or penalty.

investigation or claim pending, or to the Company\'s knowledge, threatened or
anticipated, other than routine claims for benefits.

except as specifically required by Part 6 of Title I of ERISA ("COBRA"),
except to the extent the sole cost of which is borne solely by such former
employees, directors or consultants.

of the transactions contemplated hereby, or (except as required by Law) any
termination of employment or service (or other event or occurrence) in
connection therewith will (i) entitle any current or former employee,
director or consultant of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to
any payment or benefit (or result in the funding of any such payment or
benefit) or result in any forgiveness of indebtedness with respect to any
such persons, (ii) increase the amount of any compensation, severance, equity

reports, schedules, statements, exhibits, and other documents required by it
to be filed under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act (collectively, the
"Parent SEC Documents"). As of its filing date or, if amended prior to

Parent SEC Document complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the case may be,
and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder. As of
its filing date or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the
date of the last such amendment, each Parent SEC Document filed pursuant to
the Exchange Act did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. Each Parent SEC Document that is
a registration statement, as amended or supplemented, if applicable,
filed pursuant to the Securities Act, as of the date such registration
statement or amendment became effective prior to the date of this Agreement,
did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. None of Parent\'s Subsidiaries is required to file
any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC. As of its filing
date or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of
the last such amendment, all of the audited consolidated financial statements

(i) comply in all material respects with the applicable accounting
requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, (ii) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in

33  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and except, in the case of the unaudited interim statements, as may be
permitted under Form 10-Q of the Exchange Act) and (iii) fairly present in
all material respects the consolidated financial position and the
consolidated results of operations and cash flows (subject, in the case of
unaudited interim financial statements, to normal and recurring year-end
adjustments) of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the times and
for the periods referred to therein.

 

 

(b) Parent has heretofore furnished to the Company complete and correct
copies of all comment letters from the SEC since January 1, 2007 through the

in comment letters received from the SEC staff with respect to any of the
Parent SEC Documents.

 

 

(c) Parent is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable listing and
governance rules and regulations of the NASDAQ Stock Market.

 

 

(d) Parent maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient
to provide reasonable assurance (i) that Parent maintains records that in
reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect its transactions and
dispositions of assets, (ii) that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP, (iii)
that receipts and expenditures are executed only in accordance with
authorizations of management and its board of directors and (iv) regarding
prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of Parent\'s assets that could have a material effect on
Parent\'s consolidated financial statements. Parent has evaluated
the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting and, to
the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable Parent
SEC Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q or any amendment
thereto its conclusions about the effectiveness of the internal control over
financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by such report or
amendment based on such evaluation. Parent has disclosed, based on the most
recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the
Parent\'s auditors and the audit committee of its board of directors (and
made available to the Company a summary of the significant aspects of such
disclosure) (A) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect Parent\'s ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Parent\'s internal control over financial reporting. Except as
disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents, Parent has not identified any material
weaknesses in the design or operation of Parent\'s internal control over
financial reporting.

 

 

(e) Parent\'s "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed to
ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
information is accumulated and communicated to Parent\'s management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the chief executive

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer and chief financial officer of Parent required under the Exchange Act
with respect to such reports.

 

 

(f) To the knowledge of Parent, there are no SEC inquiries or investigations,
other governmental inquiries or investigations or internal investigations
pending or threatened in each case regarding any accounting practices of
Parent or any malfeasance by any director or executive officer of Parent.
Since January 1, 2005 there have been no internal investigations regarding
accounting or revenue recognition discussed with, reviewed by or initiated at
the direction of Parent\'s chief executive officer, chief financial officer,
general counsel or similar legal officer, Parent\'s board of directors or any
committee thereof.

 

 

(g) Each of the principal executive officer of Parent and the principal
financial officer of Parent (or each former principal executive officer of
Parent and each former principal financial officer of Parent, as applicable)
has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect
to the Parent SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such
certifications are true and accurate. For purposes of this Agreement,
"principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have
the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Parent does
not have, and has not arranged any, outstanding "extensions of credit" to
directors or executive officers within the meaning of Section 402 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 

 

(h) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract (including any contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity
or person, on the other hand) or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result,
purpose or effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in Parent\'s published financial statements or other Parent SEC
Documents.

 

 

Section 4.6 Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be

made, not misleading or (ii) the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is
first mailed to the stockholders of the Company and at the time of the
Company Stockholders\' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except that, in each
case, no representation or warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub with
respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by or on behalf of the Company specifically for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 or the

other Person is entitled to any broker\'s, finder\'s, financial advisor\'s or

Section 5.2 No Solicitation.

 

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the time the Company
Stockholder Approval is obtained or the termination of this Agreement, the
Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions, negotiations and communications, if any, with any Persons with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal and shall request that any such Person
(and its agents and advisors) in possession of confidential information about
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf
of the Company to return or destroy all such information. The Company agrees
that neither it nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall
direct the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' respective officers,
directors, employees, agents and representatives, including any investment
banker, consultant, attorney or accountant retained by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (collectively, "Representatives") not to, directly or
indirectly (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing information or assistance), or knowingly induce, or take any
action that is designed to or could reasonably be expected to facilitate the
making of, any inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with,
furnish any non-public information relating to the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with any Person
(other than Parent or any of its affiliates or representatives) that
is seeking to make, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to make,
or withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Board Recommendation, or recommend, adopt or approve, or publicly propose
to recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal (any of the
foregoing in this clause (iii), an "Adverse Recommendation Change"), (iv)
except as required by applicable Law, grant (other than to Parent or any of
its affiliates or representatives) any waiver or release under any standstill
or similar agreement, or (v) enter into any letter of intent or similar
document or any understanding or agreement contemplating or
otherwise relating to, or that is intended to or could reasonably be expected
to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(and in any event within twenty-four hours) notify Parent if (1) any
proposals are received by the Company or (2) any information is requested
from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated or
continued with, the Company or any Representative which could reasonably be
expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall identify
the name of the Person making such proposal or request or seeking such
negotiations or discussions and include copies of all correspondence and
written materials provided to the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any
Representative that describe the terms and conditions of any proposal or
request (and any subsequent changes to such terms and conditions) and
summaries of any material oral communications addressing such matters. The
Company shall promptly inform Parent of any material changes to any
Acquisition Proposal.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 5.2(a) or any other provision of this
Agreement, following the execution of this Agreement but prior to the time
the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained (and in no event after the
Company Stockholder Approval is obtained), the Company may, subject to
compliance with this Section 5.2, furnish information concerning its and the
Company Subsidiaries' respective businesses, properties or assets to any
Person pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable
to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, dated
April 15, 2008, entered into between Parent and the Company (the
"Confidentiality Agreement") (a copy of which shall be provided to Parent
promptly after its execution) and may negotiate and participate in
discussions and negotiations (including making counterproposals) with such
Person concerning an Acquisition Proposal if, but only if, (x) such
Acquisition Proposal provides for consideration to be received by holders of
all, but not less than all, of the issued and outstanding Shares and is
reasonably likely to be consummated promptly; (y) such Person has on an
unsolicited basis, and in the absence of any violation of this Section 5.2 by
the Company or any of its Representatives, submitted a bona fide, written
proposal to the Company relating to any such transaction which the Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after receiving advice from a nationally
recognized investment banking firm, is, or would reasonably be likely to be,
more favorable to the holders of Shares from a financial point of view than
the Merger or, if applicable, any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of
this Agreement, taking into account all the terms and conditions of such
proposal and this Agreement (including the expected timing and likelihood of
consummation, and taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory
aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal) and which is not
conditioned upon obtaining financing or any regulatory approvals beyond or in
addition to the types of regulatory approvals required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (z) in the good faith belief
of the Company Board of Directors, after consultation with outside legal
counsel to the Company, the failure to provide such information or access or
to engage in such discussions or negotiations would be reasonably likely to
cause the Company Board of Directors' to violate its fiduciary duties to the
Company\'s stockholders under applicable Law (an Acquisition Proposal which
satisfies clauses (x), (y) and (z) being referred to herein as a
"Superior Proposal"). The Company shall promptly, and in any event within
twenty-four hours, notify Parent of a Company Board of
Directors determination that an Acquisition Proposal is or would reasonably
be likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, which notice shall include the name
of the Person making such Superior Proposal and copies of all correspondence
and written materials provided to the Company or any Representative that
describes any terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal (and any
subsequent changes to such terms and conditions) and summaries of any
material oral communications addressing such matters. The Company shall
promptly provide to Parent any

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

material non-public information regarding the Company or any Company
Subsidiary provided to any other Person which was not previously provided to
Parent, such additional information to be provided no later than the date of
provision of such information to such other Person.

 

 

(c) Any violation of this Section 5.2 by any of its Representatives, whether
or not such Representative is so authorized and whether or not such
Representative is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or otherwise,
shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed for purposes of
this Agreement that, so long as no actions inconsistent with the Company's
obligations under this Section 5.2 are taken by the Company, its Company
Subsidiaries, or their Representatives after the date this Agreement is
executed, an Acquisition Proposal shall not be considered to have been
solicited as a result of any actions taken prior to the date of
this Agreement. In addition, nothing in this Section 5.2 shall prohibit the
Company's outside legal counsel from contacting or otherwise engaging in
discussions with any Person after the date hereof who has submitted an
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that did not otherwise result from a
breach of this Section 5.2 solely for the purpose of clarifying such
Acquisition Proposal and any material terms and the conditions thereof so as
to assist the Company Board of Directors in determining whether such
Acquisition Proposal is or would reasonably be likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal.

 

 

(d) Prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained (and in no
event after the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained), neither the
Company Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) make an
Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii) authorize the Company to enter into any
agreement with respect to any Superior Proposal (an
"Acquisition Agreement"), unless and until the Company shall have delivered
to Parent the written notice required by Section 5.2(e) below and all rights
of the Parent to propose adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement as set forth in said Section 5.2(e) shall have expired. Any such
Adverse Recommendation Change or the entry by the Company into any
Acquisition Agreement shall not change the approval of the Company Board of
Directors for purposes of causing any state takeover statute or other state
Law to be applicable to the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

 

(e) The Company Board of Directors may make an Adverse Recommendation Change
and authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement if (i) the Company
first provides Parent with written notice that it intends to do so pursuant
to this Section 5.2(e), identifying the Superior Proposal then determined
to be more favorable and the parties thereto and delivering to Parent a copy
of the Acquisition Agreement for such Superior Proposal in the form to be
entered into and (ii) within a period of five full Business Days following
the delivery of the notice referred to in clause (i) above, Parent shall not
have proposed adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement
which, after having caused its financial and legal advisors to negotiate with
Parent in good faith such proposed adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the Company Board of Directors determines in its good faith
judgment (after considering the advice of its financial advisor) to be as
favorable to the Company\'s stockholders as such Superior Proposal. If the
conditions of the immediately preceding sentence are satisfied in all
respects, the Company shall be free to deliver to the Parent, pursuant to
this Section 5.2(e) and Section 8.1(d)(i), at least five full Business Days
after the Company has provided the notice referred to in clause (i) above,
(A) a written notice of

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.2(e) and Section
8.1(d)(i) and (B) within the time specified in Section 8.2(b), a wire
transfer of immediately available funds in the amount of the Termination Fee
(it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or
any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new written
notice to Parent pursuant to clause (i) above and a new five Business
Day period).

 

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position with respect to a tender offer by a third party pursuant to Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making such
disclosure to the Company's stockholders which, in the good faith judgment of
the Company Board of Directors, after consultation with outside counsel to
the Company, is required by applicable Law or the failure to take such action
would cause the Company Board of Directors to violate its fiduciary duties to
the Company\'s stockholders under applicable Law.

 

 

Section 5.3 Right to Make Adverse Recommendation Change Due to Intervening
Event.

 

 

In addition, and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this
Agreement, at any time prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is
obtained the Company Board of Directors may, in response to a fact, event,
change, development or set of circumstances with respect to or otherwise
affecting Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their business,
properties, assets, liabilities, results of operation or condition (financial
or otherwise) occurring or arising after the date hereof that is materially
adverse to Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole and that was not
known to the Company Board of Directors prior to the execution of this
Agreement (such fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances, an
"Intervening Event"), make an Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Intervening Event, the failure
to take such action would or would be reasonably likely to cause the Company
Board of Directors to violate its fiduciary duties to the Company
stockholders under applicable Law; provided that (1) no fact, event, change,
development or set of circumstances shall constitute an Intervening Event if
such fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances resulted from
or arose out of any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries at the written request or with the written consent of the
Company given after the date hereof and (2) any decrease in the market price
of the Parent Common Stock shall not constitute an Intervening Event (it
being understood that the exception in this clause (2) is strictly limited to
any such decrease in and of itself and shall not prevent or otherwise affect
a determination that an Intervening Event has occurred); and provided,
further, that the Company Board of Directors shall not be entitled to
exercise its right to make an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this
Section 5.3 unless the Company has (A) given Parent and Merger Sub at least
five Business Days' prior written notice advising Parent and Merger Sub that
the Company Board of Directors intends to take such action and specifying the
facts underlying the Company Board of Directors' determination that an
Intervening Event has occurred, and the reasons for the Adverse
Recommendation Change, in reasonable detail, and (B) during such five
Business Day period, if requested by Parent, engaged in good faith
negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such manner that obviates
the need for such an Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of the
Intervening Event. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) in no event shall the
receipt, existence or terms of an Acquisition Proposal or any matter relating
thereto or the consequences thereof constitute an Intervening Event and (ii)
the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Company Board of Directors has considered and understands that the
announcement of both this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(and limited to the announcement of both this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby) could affect the value of the Stock Consideration.

 

 

ARTICLE VI 

 

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 

 

 

Section 6.1 Company Stockholder Meeting; Form S-4 and Proxy Statement 

 

 

(a) Subject to the Company\'s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Sections 8.1(d)(i) and 8.1(d)(ii), the Company shall, as promptly as
practicable after the execution of this Agreement and in accordance with
applicable Law, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a special meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of
considering and taking action upon this Agreement (the "Company Stockholder
Meeting") and shall, through the Company Board of Directors, recommend to its
stockholders the adoption of this Agreement and shall include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, subject to its right to terminate this Agreement, the
Company\'s obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 6.1(a)
shall not be affected by (i) the commencement, public proposal, public
disclosure or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal or
(ii) any Adverse Recommendation Change. If an Adverse Recommendation Change
shall have occurred and thereafter the Company Board of Directors shall
recommend this Agreement and the Merger (the "Reinstated Recommendation"),
the Company shall not hold or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting until
not less than ten (10) calendar days after the date of such Reinstated
Recommendation.

 

 

(b) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the
Company and Parent shall prepare and Parent shall file with the SEC a
Registration Statement on Form S-4 in connection with the issuance of shares
of Parent Common Stock in the Merger (as may be amended or supplemented from
time to time, the "Form S-4"), in which the proxy statement relating to the
adoption by the stockholders of the Company of this Agreement (as may be
amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Proxy Statement") will be
included. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act
as promptly as practicable after such filing. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to
the stockholders of the Company as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4
is declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall also take any
action required to be taken under any applicable state securities laws
in connection with the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in
the Merger, and each of Parent and the Company shall furnish all information
as may be reasonably requested by the other in connection with any such
action and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 will be
made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy
Statement will made by the Company, in each case without providing Parent a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. If at any time prior to
the Effective Time any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any
of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered
by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to either the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, so that

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either such document would not include any misstatement of material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
by applicable Law or the SEC, disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company. The parties shall notify each other promptly of the time when the
Form S-4 has become effective, of the issuance of any stop order or
suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of
the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or
for additional information and shall supply each other with copies of (i)
all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC or staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the
Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or the Merger and (ii) all orders of the SEC
relating to the Form S-4.

 

 

(c) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from holders
of Shares proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and take all
actions reasonably necessary or, in the reasonable opinion of Parent,
advisable to secure the approval of stockholders required by the DGCL, the
Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation and any other applicable Law to
effect the Merger, unless, pursuant to Section 5.2(d) or Section 5.3,
the Company Board of Directors determines in its good faith opinion,
after consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company, that taking
such actions would or would be reasonably likely to cause the Company Board
of Directors to violate its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders
under applicable Law.

 

 

Section 6.2 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt
written notice to Parent of (i) any claims, actions, proceedings or
governmental investigations commenced or, to its knowledge, threatened,
involving or affecting the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their
property or assets and (ii) any notice of, or other communication relating
to, a default or event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
become a default, received by the Company or any of Company
Subsidiary subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time, under any Material Contract or any Contract entered into
after the date of this Agreement that if in effect on the date hereof would
be a Material Contract, to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party or is subject. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other
hand, shall give prompt written notice to the other party of (a) any notice
or other communication from any third party alleging that the consent of such
third party is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby or (b) any Material Adverse Effect to the Company. The
Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt written notice to the Company, of (i) the occurrence, or failure to
occur, of any event that would be likely to cause any representation or
warranty made by such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect and (ii) any material failure of the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, or of any officer,
director, employee or agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no
such notification shall affect the representations, warranties or covenants
of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties hereunder. The Company and Parent shall, to the extent permitted
by Law, promptly

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide the other with copies of all filings made by such party with any
Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, other than the portions of such filings that include
confidential or proprietary information not directly related to the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

Section 6.3 Access; Confidentiality. From the date hereof until the
Effective Time, subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, the
Company shall (and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to) afford to
the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financing sources and other
Representatives of Parent and Merger Sub, regular access, during normal
business hours and with prior notice to all of its officers, employees,
agents, properties, books, contracts and records and, during such period, the
Company shall (and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to) furnish
promptly to Parent and Merger Sub (a) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed by it pursuant to the
requirements of federal securities laws and (b) all other
reasonably available information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request. Parent and Merger
Sub will hold any information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.3
in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or
any of their Representative shall be required to provide access to or
disclose information where such access or disclosure (a) the Company
reasonably determines would cause the loss of any the attorney-client
privilege of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or (b) would contravene
any Law or order of any Governmental Entity. No investigation pursuant to
this Section 6.3 shall affect any representation or warranty made by the
parties hereunder.

 

 

Section 6.4 Publicity. Each of Parent and the Company shall consult with the
other regarding their initial press releases with respect to the execution of
this Agreement. Thereafter, so long as this Agreement is in effect, neither
the Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective affiliates, shall issue
any press release or other announcement with respect to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consent of the
other party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), except as such
press release or other announcement may be required by Law or the rules of a
national securities exchange or trading market, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best
efforts to provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on such release or announcement in advance of its issuance.

 

 

Section 6.5 Insurance and Indemnification. iv) The Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification than are set forth in the Bylaws of the Company, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of at least six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect
adversely the rights of individuals, who were directors, officers, employees
or agents of the Company at or prior to the Effective Time, unless such
modification shall be required by Law.

 

 

(b) Prior to the fifth Business Day preceding the Effective Time, Parent
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a six-year prepaid
"tail policy" on terms and conditions (in both amount and scope) providing
substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of officers\' and
directors\' liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at or prior to the Effective Time ("DandO Insurance") maintained by the
Company, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated hereby
(the "Tail Policy"). If Parent has not purchased the Tail Policy by
such fifth Business Day preceding the Effective Time, the Company shall have
the right to purchase the Tail Policy prior to the Closing on terms
reasonably acceptable to Parent. In the absence of any such Tail Policy,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain the Company\'s existing
DandO Insurance for a period of not less than six years after the Effective
Time; provided, however, that Parent may substitute therefor policies of
substantially equivalent coverage and amounts containing terms no less
favorable to such former directors or officers; provided that Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
ensure that any substitution or replacement of existing policies shall not
result in any gaps or lapses of coverage with respect to facts, events, acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; provided, further,
that if the existing DandO Insurance expires or is terminated or cancelled
during such period, then Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall obtain
substantially similar DandO Insurance; provided further, however, that in no
event shall Parent or Merger Sub be required to pay annual premiums for
insurance under this Section 6.5(b) in excess of 150% of the current annual
premiums paid by the Company for such insurance.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Effective Time) is made against any individual who is now, or who has been at
any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective
Time, a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, on or prior to
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section
6.5 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

 

 

(d) The covenants contained in this Section 6.5 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the indemnified parties and
their respective heirs and legal Representatives and shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which an indemnified party is entitled,
whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. Parent shall pay all
expenses, including reasonable attorneys\' fees, that may be incurred by the
persons referred to in this Section 6.5 in connection with their successful
enforcement of their rights provided in this Section 6.5.

 

 

(e) In the event that the Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors or assigns of the
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.5.

 

 

Section 6.6 Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company agree to use their respective reasonable best efforts to (i) make
promptly (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after execution
of this Agreement) its respective filings, and thereafter make any other
required submissions, under the HSR Act and the antitrust or competition Laws
of applicable foreign jurisdictions with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable including, but not limited to, using their respective reasonable
best efforts to obtain any requisite approvals, consents, authorizations,
orders, exemptions or waivers by any third Person or Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to
fulfill the conditions to the Merger.

 

 

Section 6.7 State Takeover Laws. If any state takeover statute becomes or
is deemed to become applicable to the Company or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, then the Company Board of Directors shall
take all actions necessary to render such statutes inapplicable to the
foregoing.

and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to

reorganization within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g)

Section 6.13 Employee Benefits.

 

 

(a) Parent intends that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending on the first anniversary thereof or, if sooner, upon the
termination of employment of the applicable Company Employee, each employee
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately before the Effective
Time who remains an employee of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (the "Company Employees") will be
provided with, at Parent\'s election, compensation and benefits substantially
comparable, in the aggregate, to either (i) the compensation and benefits
provided by Parent (or a Subsidiary thereof) to its similarly situated
employees or (ii) the compensation and benefits provided by the Company and
any Company Subsidiary to Company Employees under the Benefit Plans listed in
Section 3.12(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule as in effect immediately
before the Effective Time (excluding defined benefit pension plans, plans
providing for retiree medical benefits, incentive pay plans, plans that
provide equity-based compensation and plans that provide for payments or
benefits upon a change in control).

 

 

(b) Neither this Section 6.13 nor any other provision of this Agreement
shall (i) limit the ability or right of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any of their respective employees
on or after the Closing Date

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(subject to any rights of any such employees pursuant to any contract,
agreement, arrangement, policy, plan or commitment), (ii) limit the ability
or right of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries on or after the Closing Date to modify, amend, suspend or
terminate any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement they may maintain
or establish or to establish any such plan, program or arrangement or (iii)
provide third party beneficiary rights to Company employees, officers and
directors.

 

 

(c) For purposes of all employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements
maintained by or contributed to by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including,
after Closing, the Surviving Corporation) in which Company Employees
participate after Closing, other than any equity or other incentive
compensation plans, programs or arrangements or any sabbatical plans,
programs or arrangements, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to
cause each such plan, program or arrangement to treat service with the
Company or its Subsidiaries of any Company Employee (to the same extent such
service is recognized under analogous plans, programs or arrangements of the
Company or its affiliates prior to the closing) as service rendered to Parent
or its Subsidiaries (including, after Closing, the Surviving Corporation), as
the case may be, for purposes of vesting and eligibility, but not for any
other purposes, including, without limitation, benefit accrual
or determination of level of benefits; provided, however, that
such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the
funding of such benefit under any plan. Company Employees shall also be
given credit for any deductible or co-payment amounts paid in respect of the
plan year in which the Closing occurs, to the extent that, following the
Closing, they participate in any other comparable plan for which deductibles
or co-payments are required. Parent shall also cause each Parent Plan
(as hereinafter defined below) that is a welfare benefit plan in which
Company Employees participate on or following the Closing, to waive any
preexisting condition or waiting period that was waived or satisfied under
the terms of any comparable Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing.
For purposes of this Agreement, a "Parent Plan" shall mean such employee
benefit plan, as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or a nonqualified employee
benefit or deferred compensation plan, stock option, bonus or incentive plan
or other employee benefit or fringe benefit program, that may be in effect
generally for employees of Company and the Company Subsidiaries from time to
time.

 

 

(d) Effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date, each of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and any ERISA Affiliates
shall, unless Parent provides written notice to the Company to the contrary
no later than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, terminate any and
all Benefit Plans intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (each
a "401(k) Plan"), subject to the condition subsequent that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be consummated. Unless Parent provides
such written notice, then the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that
such 401(k) Plan(s) have been terminated (effective as of no later than the
day immediately preceding the Closing Date and subject to the condition
subsequent that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be
consummated) pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board of Directors, the
Company Subsidiaries or such ERISA Affiliates, as the case may be. The form
and substance of such resolutions and related plan amendments shall be
subject to review and approval by Parent, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Company also shall take such other
actions in furtherance of terminating such 401(k) Plan(s) as Parent may
reasonably require. Parent shall cause a tax-qualified defined contribution
plan with a Code Section 401(k) arrangement established or maintained by
Parent or an affiliate (the "Parent

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

401(k) Plan") to accept direct rollovers of eligible rollover distributions
(as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) by Company Employees. To the
extent the rollover of loans is permitted under the Company 401(k) Plans,
rollover of outstanding loans under such plan will be permitted by the Parent
401(k) Plan.

 

 

Section 6.14 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the
Company and Parent shall take all such steps as may be required (to the
extent permitted under applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Shares or
acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including, in each case, derivative
securities) resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company or any employee or director of
the Company who may become an officer or director of Parent to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

 

Section 6.15 Pay-Off Letter. No later than two (2) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a pay-off letter from
the Lender (as defined below) under the Company's Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement, dated as of February 7, 2008, among the Company, Enersyst
Development Center, L.L.C. and Bank of America, N.A. (the "Lender") (such
agreement, the "Credit Agreement"), in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, addressed to the Company and Parent and signed by the
Lender, (i) setting forth the amounts required to pay off in full at the
Closing the Obligations (under and as defined in the Credit Agreement) owing
to the lender (including, without limitation, the outstanding principal,
accrued and unpaid interest and any prepayment or other penalties) and (ii)
stating that, upon payment of such amounts, the commitments of the lender to
make loans or other extensions of credit under the Credit Agreement shall be
terminated and the Surviving Corporation shall be released from all of its
obligations under the Credit Agreement and all related documents, agreements
and instruments and all liens and security interests under the Credit
Agreement and each other documents and agreement related thereto shall be
released, which pay-off letter shall be updated, as necessary, on the Closing
Date to specify the aggregate amount of Obligations outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Closing, and shall specifically authorize the
Company and Parent to file termination statements and release and discharge
documents (including, without limitation, termination statements of any and
all UCC financing statements filed by the lender) with respect to any
Encumbrance existing pursuant to the Credit Agreement. Such pay-off letter
shall also indicate that prior notice of prepayment is waived. The
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with and
assist Parent to file or cause to be filed any UCC termination statements,
releases or other documents required to effect the release of any
Encumbrances under the Credit Agreement.

Section 9.6 Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." As used in this Agreement, the term "affiliates" shall
have the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. The
words describing the singular number shall include the plural and
vice versa. The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question
of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provisions of this Agreement. Headings of the Articles and Sections of
this Agreement, the Table of Contents and the Index of Defined Terms are for
the convenience of the parties only and shall be given no substantive
or interpretive effect whatsoever. The phrase "delivered to Parent" or words
of similar import shall mean that the subject documents were posted to the
"Project Thunderbird" data room hosted by Merrill Corporation or were either
delivered to Parent or its counsel by mail or courier delivery, facsimile or
other electronic transmission.

 

 

Section 9.7 Jurisdiction. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby
expressly and irrevocably submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of
the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and to the
jurisdiction of any other competent court of the State of Delaware
(collectively, the "Delaware Courts"), preserving, however, all rights of
removal to such federal court under 28 U.S.C. Section 1441, in connection
with all disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and agrees not to commence any litigation
relating thereto except in such courts. Each such party hereby waives the
right to any other jurisdiction or venue for any litigation arising out of or
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to
which any of them may be entitled by reason of its present or future
domicile. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each such party agrees that each of
the other parties shall have the right to bring any action or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding for enforcement of a judgment entered by the Delaware Courts in
any other court or jurisdiction.

 

 

Section 9.8 Service of Process. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
irrevocably consents to the service of process outside the territorial
jurisdiction of the courts referred to in Section 9.7 of this Agreement in
any such action or proceeding by mailing copies thereof by registered United
States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to its address as
specified in or pursuant to Section 9.5 of this Agreement. However, the
foregoing shall not limit the right of a party to effect service of process
on the other party by any other legally available method.

 

 

Section 9.9 Specific Performance. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company acknowledges and agrees that in the event of any breach of this
Agreement, each non-breaching party would be irreparably and immediately
harmed and could not be made whole by monetary damages. It is accordingly
agreed that the parties hereto (a) will waive, in any action for specific
performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at Law and (b) shall be
entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at
Law or in equity, to compel specific performance of this Agreement. Nothing
in this Section 9.9 shall affect a party\'s right to terminate (subject in
all respects to payment of any fees specified in Section 8.2 hereof) this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof.

 

 

Section 9.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed manually or by
facsimile by the parties hereto, in any number of counterparts, each of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective
when a counterpart of this Agreement shall have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties. This Agreement and any document
executed and delivered in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments
hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile
machine or as an attachment to an electronic mail message in "pdf" or similar
format, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement
or instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect
as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the
request of any party to any such agreement or instrument, each other party
hereto or thereto shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to
all other parties. No party to any such agreement shall raise the use of a
facsimile machine or electronic mail attachment in "pdf" or similar format
to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or
instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile
machine or as an attachment to an electronic mail message as a defense to the
formation of a contract and each such party forever waives any such defense.
A facsimile signature or electronically scanned copy of a signature shall
constitute and shall be deemed to be sufficient evidence of a party\'s
execution of this Agreement, without necessity of further proof. Each such
copy shall be deemed an original, and it shall not be necessary in making
proof of this Agreement to product or account for more than one such
counterpart.

 

 

Section 9.11 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement
and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes
all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among
the parties or any of them with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof (provided that the provisions of this Agreement shall supersede 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any conflicting provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement). Except as
provided in Section 6.5, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights
or remedies hereunder.

 

 

Section 9.12 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

 

Section 9.13 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.

 

 

Section 9.14 Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub may assign any
or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to Parent, one or
more direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent, or a combination
thereof. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and permitted assigns.

 

 

Section 9.15 Obligation of Parent. Whenever this Agreement requires Merger
Sub to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an
undertaking on the part of Parent to cause Merger Sub to take such action.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

61  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have caused this
Agreement to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized
as of the date first written above.
