Million and No/100 Dollars ($1,850,000,000.00) (the " _Purchase Price_ "). The
Purchase Price consists of (i) One Billion Three Hundred Fifty Million and
No/100 Dollars ($1,350,000,000.00) in cash or other immediately available
funds (the " _Cash Purchase Price_ "), and (ii) Eighteen Million Eight
Hundred Thirty Two Thousand and Eight Hundred Fifty Three (18,832,853) shares
(the " _Equity Consideration_ ") of Parent Common Stock (the " _Parent Shares_
"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that Parent sells Parent
Common Stock after the date hereof for net proceeds to the Company of less
than $26.55 per share (such lesser amount being the " _Lowest Market Price_
"), the number of shares issued pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ shall
equal $500,000,000 divided by the Lowest Market Price; _provided_ , _however_
, that the total number of shares to be issued to Seller shall in no event
exceed 19.9% of the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock immediately
prior to the Closing Date. The Cash Purchase Price (and resulting Purchase
Price) shall be subject to adjustment both prior to, and after, Closing as set
forth herein. The Parent Shares issued to Seller at the Closing shall be
subject to adjustment in the event of stock split, combination, re-
classification, recapitalization, exchange, stock dividend, or other
distribution payable in Parent Common Stock with respect to shares of Parent
Common Stock that occurs prior to Closing and shall be issued in the name of
Seller.

_3.2_   _Deposit_ _._ Within two (2) Business Days of the execution of this
Agreement, Parent has deposited by wire transfer in same day funds into an
account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") with U.S. Bank National Association (the "
_Escrow Agent_ ") the sum of One Hundred Eighty Five Million and No/100
Dollars ($185,000,000.00), to be held, invested, and disbursed in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and an escrow agreement (the " _Escrow
Agreement_ ") of even date herewith (such amount, excluding any interest
earned thereon, the " _Deposit_ "). The Deposit shall be handled in accordance
with _Sections_ __ _ 3.6 and 14.2_. Parent agrees that it is a party to the
Escrow Agreement for the benefit of Buyer and that any rights it has pursuant
to the Escrow Agreement and the deposits made into the Escrow Account are held
by Parent for the benefit of Buyer, to be exercised solely in accordance with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing,
Parent agrees to give any and all instructions required to be given to the
Escrow Agent by Parent or Buyer pursuant to the trms of this Agreement.

 



4 _3.3_ _Adjustments to Cash Purchase Price_. The Cash Purchase Price shall be

_Adjusted Cash Purchase Price_ ":

 

(a) The Cash Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward by the following amounts
(without duplication):

 

(i) an amount equal to the value of all merchantable Hydrocarbons attributable
to the Assets in storage or existing in pipelines, plants and/or tanks
(including inventory, and linefill valued at one million six hundred thousand
dollars ($1,600,000), but excluding basic sediment and water, tank bottoms,
and other linefill or line pack Hydrocarbons) and upstream of the
pipeline connection or upstream of the sales meter as of the Effective Time,
the value to be based upon the actual sales price therefor to a Third Party,
_less_ Burdens on such production;

 

(ii) an amount equal to all Operating Expenses (excluding, for the avoidance
of doubt, any Asset Taxes, Income Taxes and Transfer Taxes) paid by or on
behalf of Seller that are attributable to the Assets and are incurred during
the period following the Effective Time, whether paid before (but only to the
extent set forth on _Schedule_ _3.3_ ) or after the Effective Time, including
(A) bond and insurance premiums paid by or on behalf of Seller with respect to
the period following the Effective Time and (B) Burdens, but excluding,
without limitation, lease bonuses, rental payments, and similar payments
paid prior to the Effective Time;

(iii) the portion of the Overhead Costs attributable to the Assets that are
incurred from and after the Effective Time up to the Closing Date;

(iv) the amount of all Asset Taxes allocated to Buyer in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 15.2_ but paid or otherwise economically borne by Seller;

(v) subject to  _Section_ __ _ 3.10_, and without limiting Buyers rights
with respect to _Section_ __ _ 4.12_, an amount equal to $3,548,768 as
complete and final settlement of all Well Imbalances attributable to
the Assets;

(vi) any other amount provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or otherwise
agreed upon in writing by Seller and Buyer.

 

(b) The Cash Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by the following
amounts (without duplication):

 

(i) an amount equal to all proceeds actually received by or on behalf of
Seller attributable to the sale of Hydrocarbons (1) produced from or
allocable to the Assets during the period from and following the Effective
Time or (2) contained in storage or existing in pipelines, plants and/or tanks
(including inventory) as of the Effective Time for which an upward adjustment
to the Cash Purchase Price was made pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)(_ _i_ _)_ ,
in each case, less Burdens (other than Operating Expenses and other expenses
taken into account pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)_ , Asset Taxes, Income Taxes
and Transfer Taxes) directly incurred in earning or receiving such proceeds,
and any other income earned with respect to the Assets and attributable to
periods from and after the Effective Time (excluding the effects of any Hedge
Contract);

 



5 (ii) an amount determined under Section 11.2(d)(i) with respect to Title
Defects, if applicable;

(iii) an amount determined under Section 12.1(c)(i) with respect to
Environmental Defects, if applicable;

 

(iv) the Allocated Value of the Assets excluded from the transactions
contemplated hereby pursuant to _Section 11.4(a)(_ _i_ _)_ , _Section
11.4(b)(_ _i_ _)_ or _Section_ __ _ 12.1(c)(ii)_;

(v) the amount of all Asset Taxes allocated to Seller in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 15.2_ but paid or otherwise economically borne by Buyer;

 

(vi) an amount equal to all proceeds from sales of Hydrocarbons relating to
the Assets and payable to owners of Working Interests, royalties, overriding

or its Affiliates in suspense as of the Closing Date;

 

(vii) an amount equal to all Third Party cash call payments, revenues, and
other prepaid amounts held by or on behalf of Seller or its Affiliates with
respect to the ownership or operation of the Assets from and after the
Effective Time, to the extent that such amounts are not transferred to such
Third Party prior to Closing or to Buyers exclusive possession and control
at Closing; and

(viii) any other amount provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or otherwise
agreed upon in writing by Seller and Buyer. 

_3.4_ _Adjustment Methodology_. When available, actual figures will be used
for the adjustments to the Cash Purchase Price at Closing. To the extent
actual figures are not available, estimates will be used subject to final
adjustments in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.6 _and _Section_ __ _ 3.8_.
For purposes of allocating production (and accounts receivable with respect
thereto), under _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ and _Section_ __ _ 3.3_, (i) liquid
Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "produced from or allocable to" the Assets
when they are produced into the tank batteries related to each Well, and (ii)
gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be deemed "produced from or allocable to" the
Assets when they pass through the delivery point sales meters or
similar meters at the point of entry into the pipelines through which they
are gathered or transported from the applicable Well. Seller shall utilize
reasonable interpolative procedures to arrive at an allocation of production
when exact meter readings are not available.

_3.5_ _Preliminary Settlement Statement_ _._ Not less than five (5)
Business Days prior to Closing, Seller shall prepare and submit to Buyer for
review a draft settlement statement (the " _Preliminary Settlement Statement_
") that shall set forth the Adjusted Cash Purchase Price, reflecting
each adjustment made in accordance with this Agreement as of the date of
preparation of such Preliminary Settlement Statement and the calculation of
the adjustments used to determine such amount, together with the designation
of Sellers accounts for the wire transfers of funds as required by _Section_
__ _ 3.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.3(e)_. Within two (2) Business Days after
receipt of the Preliminary Settlement Statement, Buyer will deliver to
Seller a written report containing all changes, with explanation therefor,
that Buyer proposes to be made to the Preliminary Settlement Statement. The
Parties shall in good faith attempt to agree on the

 



6  Preliminary Settlement Statement as soon as possible after Sellers receipt
of Buyers written report. The Preliminary Settlement Statement, as agreed
upon by the Parties, will be used to adjust the Cash Purchase Price at
Closing; _provided_ that if the Parties do not agree upon an adjustment set
forth in the Preliminary Settlement Statement, then the amount of such
adjustment used to adjust the Cash Purchase Price at Closing shall be that
amount set forth in the draft Preliminary Settlement Statement delivered by
Seller to Buyer pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.5_, other than with respect
to adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 3.3(b)(ii)_ ,
_3.3(b)(iii), 3.3(b)(iv)_.

_3.6 Escrow_. __

 

(a) At Closing, (i) the Indemnity Escrow shall be deposited with the Escrow
Agent into the Escrow Account and shall be maintained in the Escrow Account
until the end of the Survival Period and so long thereafter as may be required
to resolve any claims asserted by Buyer in accordance with the procedure set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.6(b)_ (the " _Escrow Maintenance Period_ ");
_provided, however_ , that the Indemnity Escrow may be released, in whole or
in part, from time to time or replaced by Seller with cash, in each case in
accordance with  _Sections_ __ _ 3.6(b)_, _(c),_ and _(d)_.

(b) Concurrently with notice to Seller specifying in reasonable details the
basis therefor, Buyer may, prior to the end of the Survival Period, give
written notice to the Escrow Agent of any amounts, including any claim for
indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 13.2_, to which Buyer is entitled from
Seller hereunder. To the extent that it is finally determined that Buyer is
entitled to any such amount, and such claim is not satisfied by Seller within
five (5) Business Days of such final determination, the Parties shall cause
the Escrow Agent to distribute, without offset or counterclaim, such amount
to Buyer from the Indemnity Escrow using the VWAP Price, which distribution
shall satisfy such claim only up to the amount so distributed to Buyer.
Subject to the foregoing, any such notice or distribution shall not
constitute an election of remedies or relieve the obligations of any Party
hereunder.

(c) On a date that is six (6) months after the Closing Date, the Parties
shall cause the Escrow Agent to disburse a portion of the Indemnity Escrow
equal to the positive difference (if any) between sixty-six percent (66%) of
the then-current amount of the Indemnity Escrow (valued based on the VWAP
Price), _minus_ the aggregate amount of all unresolved claims made by Buyer as
of such date pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.6(b)_; _provided, however_ , that
in no event shall any such distribution cause the value of the Indemnity
Escrow, based on the VWAP Price to be less than Parent Shares worth, and/or,
if applicable, cash equal to, ninety two million dollars ($92,000,000). On
and after the end of the Survival Period, and, from time to time upon final
determination of any claim made by Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.6(b)_,
the Parties shall cause the Escrow Agent to disburse a portion of the
Indemnity Escrow equal to the positive difference (if any) between then-
current amount of the Indemnity Escrow, _minus_ the aggregate amount of all
unresolved claims made by Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.6(b)_.

 

(d) Seller shall have an option exercisable from time to time (but not to
exceed three instances) to replace all or any portion of the Parent Shares
being held as the Indemnity Escrow with cash equal to the VWAP Price of such
Parent Shares, and at such time

 



7  such Parent Shares shall be released from escrow to Seller and such cash
shall become the "Indemnity Escrow" (or part of it as applicable). Following
any such replacement, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the VWAP Price shall no longer be relevant to addressing claims
relating to the Indemnity Escrow to the extent settled in cash. Seller shall
bear, and pay as and when due, all costs, fees, and expenses of the Escrow
Agent in connection with any such replacement. If the Indemnity Escrow
consists of cash and Parent Shares, claims, if any, shall be satisfied out of
cash or Parent Shares, as elected by Seller, and the
disbursements contemplated by _Section 3.6(c)_ shall be made in cash or
Parent Shares, as elected by Seller.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amount funded into the Escrow Account
in connection with Title Defects or Environmental Defects pursuant to
_Article_ __ _ XI _or _Article_ __ _ XII_, respectively, shall be retained
in the Escrow Account until all disputes relating to the Title Defects or
Environmental Defects with respect to which such amount was funded have been
resolved and, if Seller has elected to cure such Title Defect or Environmental
Defect, the Cure Period has elapsed. Any such amount shall be disbursed from
the Escrow Account to the Party entitled thereto in accordance with _Article_
__ _ XI _with respect to Title Defects and _Article_ __ _ XII_ with respect
to Environmental Defects.

(f) The Parties shall issue such joint written notices, and otherwise take
such actions, as may be reasonably necessary from time to time to cause the
Escrow Agent to distribute amounts in the Escrow Account in accordance with
this _Section_ __ _ 3.6_.

 

 _3.7 Final Settlement Statement_. __

 

(a) On or before one hundred twenty (120) days after Closing, a final
settlement statement (the " _Final Settlement Statement_ ") will be prepared
by Seller, based on actual income and expenses during the Interim Period and
which takes into account all final adjustments made to the Cash Purchase Price
and shows the resulting final Cash Purchase Price (the " _Final Cash Purchase
Price_ "). The Final Settlement Statement shall set forth the actual proration
of the amounts required by this Agreement. As soon as practicable, and in any
event within thirty (30) days, after receipt of the Final Settlement
Statement, Buyer shall return to Seller a written report containing any
proposed changes to the Final Settlement Statement and an explanation of any
such changes and the reasons therefor (the " _Dispute Notice_ "). Other than
with respect to adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Sections
3.3(b)(ii)_ , _(iii)_ , and _(iv)_ and, without limiting Section 15.2(d), any
changes not so specified in the Dispute Notice shall be deemed waived, and
Sellers determinations with respect to all such elements of the Final
Settlement Statement that are not addressed specifically in the Dispute Notice
shall prevail. If Buyer fails to timely deliver a Dispute Notice to Seller
containing changes Buyer proposes to be made to the Final Settlement
Statement, the Final Settlement Statement as delivered by Seller will be
deemed to be correct and mutually agreed upon by the Parties, and will,
without limiting  _Section 15.2(d)_ , be final and binding on the Parties and
not subject to further audit or arbitration, in each case, other than with
respect to adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Sections 3.3(b)(ii)_
, _(iii)_ , and  _(iv)_. If the Final Cash Purchase Price set forth in the
Final Settlement Statement is mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer, the
Final Settlement Statement and the Final Cash Purchase Price, shall, without
limiting _Section 15.2(d)_ , be final and binding on the Parties hereto. Any
difference in the Adjusted Purchase

 



8  Price as paid at Closing pursuant to the Preliminary Settlement Statement
and the Final Cash Purchase Price shall be paid by the owing Party to the owed
Party within ten (10) days after final determination of such owed amounts in
accordance herewith. All amounts to be paid pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
3.7_ shall be delivered in United States currency and shall bear interest at
five (5) percent from the Closing until paid by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account specified in writing by the relevant Party.

(b) Subject to matters for which a Party has an indemnity obligation pursuant
to _Article_ __ _ XIII_ and any other adjustments to the Purchase Price that
remain outstanding pursuant to _Sections 3.3(b)(ii)_ , _(iii)_ , and  _(iv)_
, and subject to _Section_ __ _ 13.2(h)_, the Final Settlement Statement
shall be the final accounting for any and all revenues, proceeds and Operating
Expenses, and there shall be no adjustment for any revenues, proceeds or
Operating Expenses between the Parties following the Final Settlement
Statement.

_3.8_   _Disputes_. If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve the matters
addressed in the Dispute Notice (if any), each of Buyer and Seller shall,
within fifteen (15) Business Days after the delivery of such Dispute
Notice, summarize its position with regard to such dispute and submit such
summaries to the Houston, Texas office of Ernst and Young LLP or such other
Person as the Parties may mutually select (the " _Accounting Arbitrator_
"), together with the Dispute Notice, the Final Settlement Statement and any
other documentation such Party may desire to submit. Within ten (10) Business
Days after receiving the Parties respective submissions, the Accounting
Arbitrator shall render a decision with respect to the matters addressed in
the Dispute Notice, provided that, in rendering its decision, the Accounting
Arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement; shall not award less
than the amount claimed in Sellers position or more than the amount claimed
in Buyers position with respect to each matter addressed in any Dispute
Notice, based on the materials submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator as
described above. The Accounting Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the
limited purpose of determining the specific matters raised in a Dispute Notice
and may not award damages or penalties to any Party with respect to any
matter. Any decision rendered by the Accounting Arbitrator pursuant hereto
shall be final, conclusive and binding on Seller and Buyer and will be
enforceable against the Parties in any court of competent jurisdiction. The
costs of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne one-half by Buyer and one-
half by Seller.

 

 _3.9_ _Allocated Values_. Buyer and Seller agree that the Purchase Price (as
adjusted herein) shall be allocated among the Assets as set forth in
_Schedule 3.9_ to this Agreement (the " _Allocated Values_ "). The Allocated
Value for any Asset shall be increased or decreased, as applicable, by a share
of each adjustment to the Purchase Price under _Sections_ __ _ 3.3(a)(_ _i_
_)_ \- _(v)_ and _3.3(b)(_ _i_ _),_ _(v)_ , _(vi)_ and _(vii)_. The share of
each adjustment allocated to a particular Asset shall be obtained by
allocating that adjustment among the various Assets on a pro-rata basis in
proportion to the portion of the unadjusted Purchase Price allocated to each
such Asset on _Schedule_ __ _ 3.9_. Buyer and Seller agree that such
allocation is reasonable and shall not take any position inconsistent
therewith, including in notices to Preferential Purchase Right holders.

 

 _3.10_ _Allocation for Imbalances at Closing_. If, prior to Closing, either
Party discovers an error in the Imbalances set forth in _Schedule 4.12_ ,
then the Cash Purchase Price shall be further adjusted at Closing pursuant to
the methodology set forth on _Schedule 3.10_ , and _Schedule_ __ _ 4.12_ will
be deemed amended immediately prior to Closing to reflect the Imbalances for
which the Cash Purchase Price is so adjusted.

(a) The execution, delivery and performance by each Buyer Party of this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and
the consummation of the

 



15  transactions contemplated herein and therein will not (a) conflict with or
result in a breach of any provisions of the organizational or other governing

is defined in Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and will
acquire the Assets for its own account and not with a view to a sale,

_Parent SEC_ _Reports_." The Parent SEC Reports (a) were filed on a timely
basis, (b) comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder and (c) did not, at the time
they were filed, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. As of their respective dates, the financial
statements included in the Parent SEC Reports (x) comply in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect
thereto, (y) were prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission),
and (z) fairly present (subject in the case of unaudited statements to
normal, recurring and year-end audit adjustments) in all material respects the
consolidated financial position and status of the business of Parent as of the
dates thereof and the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows

Global Select Market, and Parent has not received any notice of delisting.
Subject to the filing of a supplemental listing application with the NASDAQ
Global Select Market, the issuance and sale of the Parent Shares does not
contravene the NASDAQ Global Select Market rules and regulations. There is no
suit, action, proceeding or investigation pending or, to each Buyer Partys
Knowledge, threatened against either Buyer Party by the NASDAQ or the SEC with
respect to any intention by such entity to deregister the Parent Common Stock
or prohibit or terminate the listing of Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ.
Parent has taken no action that is designed to terminate the registration of
Parent Common Stock under the Exchange Act.

eligible to register the resale of the Parent Shares for resale by Seller
under Form S-3 promulgated under the Securities Act and (b) is a "well-
known seasoned issuer" as defined in Rule 405 promulgated under the
Securities Act.

transaction, swap, hedge or other arrangement.

ACCESS/DISCLAIMERS

 

 _10.1 Access_. __

 

(a) From and after the Execution Date and up to and including the Closing Date
(or earlier termination of this Agreement), but subject to the other
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 10.1_, Seller shall (i) afford to Buyer and
its authorized representatives (" _Buyer_ __ _s Representatives_ ")
reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the Assets operated by
Seller and all Records in Sellers or any of its Affiliates possession at
such time (together with personnel and representatives of Seller and its
Affiliates responsible for the business conducted by Seller or its Affiliates
with the Assets) and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to request and
obtain any consents or waivers necessary for Buyer and Buyers Representatives
to gain access to those Assets not operated by Seller ( _provided_ that
Sellers shall not be obligated to expend any monies), in each case to the
extent necessary to conduct the title or environmental review described in
this Agreement. All investigations and due diligence conducted by Buyer or
any Buyers Representative shall be conducted at Buyers sole cost, risk and
expense and any conclusions made from any examination done by Buyer or any
Buyers Representative shall result from Buyers own independent review and
judgment.

(b) From the Execution Date to the Title Claim Date, Buyers inspection right
with respect to the Environmental Condition of the Assets shall be limited to
a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment of the Assets, conducted by Enviro
Clean Group, L.L.C. or its Affiliate or another reputable environmental
consulting or engineering firm approved in advance in writing by Seller and
may include only visual inspections and record reviews relating to the Assets.
In conducting such inspection, Buyer shall not operate any equipment,
including leak detection, or conduct any testing or sampling of
soil, groundwater or other materials (including any testing or sampling for
Hazardous Substances, Hydrocarbons or NORM). With respect to Assets operated
by Seller, if a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment determines that Phase II
sampling is necessary in order for Buyer to prove the existence of an
Environmental Defect or establish the Remediation Amount with respect to the
applicable Asset and Seller denies any reasonable request by Buyer to conduct
any such sampling or invasive activities, the Buyer shall have the right to
exclude such Asset from the Assets conveyed to Buyer at Closing and reduce the
Purchase Price by the Allocated Value of such Asset. Buyer acknowledges that
Seller can only provide Buyer access to Assets operated and controlled by
Seller and that, subject to Sellers obligation to use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain access for Buyer or its representatives to non-operated
Assets pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 10.1(a)(ii)_, any inability or delay in
accessing such Assets not operated and controlled by Seller will not extend
the time period allowed under this Agreement for the Environmental Site
Assessment of such Assets. Seller or Sellers designee shall have the right
to be present during any stage of the assessment. Buyer shall give Seller
reasonable prior written notice before entering onto any of the Assets, and
Seller or its designee shall have the right to accompany Buyer and Buyers
Representatives whenever they are on site on the Assets.

(c) Buyer shall reasonably coordinate its access rights, environmental
property assessments and physical inspections of the Assets with Seller to
minimize any inconvenience to or interruption of the conduct of business by
Seller. Buyer shall abide by 

 



28  Sellers safety rules, regulations and operating policies while conducting
its due diligence evaluation of the Assets, including any environmental or
other inspection or assessment of the Assets and, to the extent required by
Seller, execute and deliver any generally-applicable access or boarding
agreement required by Seller before conducting Buyers assessment on such
Assets in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 10.1_. Buyer hereby defends,
indemnifies and holds harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against
any and all Liabilities arising out of, resulting from or relating to any
field visit, environmental property assessment or other due diligence
activity conducted by Buyer or any Buyers Representative with respect to the
Assets, EVEN IF SUCH LIABILITIES ARISE OUT OF OR RESULT FROM, IN WHOLE OR IN
PART, THE SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OF, OR THE VIOLATION OF LAW BY, ANY SELLER
INDEMNIFIED PARTY, EXCEPTING ONLY LIABILITIES TO THE EXTENT ACTUALLY RESULTING
FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY SELLER INDEMNIFIED
PARTY.

(d) Buyer acknowledges that any entry into Sellers offices or onto the Assets
shall be at Buyers sole risk, cost and expense, and, subject to the terms
hereof, that none of the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be liable in any way
for any injury, loss or damage arising out of such entry that may occur to
Buyer or any of Buyers Representatives pursuant to this Agreement. Buyer
hereby fully waives and releases any and all Liabilities against all of the
Seller Indemnified Parties for any injury, death, loss or damage to any of
Buyers Representatives or their property in connection with Buyers due
diligence activities, EVEN IF SUCH LIABILITIES ARISE OUT OF OR RESULT FROM, IN
WHOLE OR IN PART, THE SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE
NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OF, OR THE VIOLATION OF LAW BY,
ANY SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTY, EXCEPTING ONLY LIABILITIES ACTUALLY RESULTING
FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY SELLER INDEMNIFIED
PARTY.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section_ __ _ 12.1(a)_,
Buyer agrees to provide to Seller promptly, but in no event less than five
(5) days after receipt or creation, copies of all final reports and test
results prepared by Buyer and/or any of Buyers Representatives which contain
data collected or generated from Buyers due diligence with respect to the
Assets, but excluding any materials protected by attorney work product or
other legal privilege. Seller shall not be deemed by its receipt of said
documents or otherwise to have made any representation or warranty, express,
implied or statutory, as to the condition of the Assets or to the accuracy of
said documents or the information contained therein.

(f) Upon completion of Buyers due diligence, Buyer shall at its sole cost
and expense and without any cost or expense to Seller or its Affiliates (i)
repair all damage done to the Assets in connection with Buyers and/or any of
Buyers Representatives due diligence, (ii) restore the Assets to the
approximate same condition as, or better condition than, they were prior to
commencement of any such due diligence and (iii) remove all equipment, tools
and other property brought onto the Assets in connection with such due
diligence. Any material disturbance to the Assets (including the leasehold
associated therewith) resulting from such due diligence will be promptly
corrected by Buyer at Buyers sole cost and expense.

 



29 (g) During all periods that Buyer and/or any of Buyers Representatives are on
the Assets, Buyer shall maintain, at its sole expense and with insurers
reasonably satisfactory to Seller, policies of insurance of the types and in
the amounts reasonably requested by Seller. Coverage under all insurance
required to be carried by Buyer hereunder will (i) be primary insurance, (ii)
list the Seller Indemnified Parties as additional insureds, (iii) waive
subrogation against the Seller Indemnified Parties and (iv) provide for ten
(10) days prior written notice to Seller in the event of cancellation,
expiration or modification of the policy or reduction in coverage. Upon
request by Seller, Buyer shall provide evidence of such insurance to Seller
prior to entering the Assets.

 

 _10.2_ _Confidentiality_ _._ Buyer acknowledges that, pursuant to its right
of access to the Records or the Assets, Buyer and/or Buyers Representatives
will become privy to proprietary and confidential information of Seller or its
Affiliates, and Buyer shall maintain the confidentiality of such information
in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement; provided,
however, if Closing should occur, the foregoing confidentiality restriction on
Buyer shall terminate (except as to (a) such portion of the Assets that are
not conveyed to Buyer pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, (b) the
Excluded Assets and (c) information related to Seller or its Affiliates or to
assets other than the Assets). Buyer hereby adopts and agrees to be bound by
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement with the same force and effect as
if Buyer was originally a party thereto and originally subject thereto, and
Buyer shall be subject to the same obligations and Gulfport Buckeye LLC
therein.

ARTICLE XI

 

TITLE MATTERS; CASUALTY; TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

 

 _11.1 Seller s Title_. __

 

(a) _General Disclaimer of Title Warranties and Representations_. Except for
the special warranty of title as set forth in the Assignment and the Deed,
and without limiting Buyers remedies for Title Defects set forth in this
_Article_ __ _ XI_ or Sellers other representations and warranties in
_Article IV_ , Seller makes no warranty or representation, express, implied,
statutory or otherwise, with respect to Sellers title to any of the Assets,
and Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Buyers sole remedy for any
defect of title, including any Title Defect, with respect to any of the
Assets (i) before Closing, shall be as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 11.2_ and
(ii) after Closing, shall be pursuant to the special warranty of title set
forth in the Assignment.

 

(b) _Special Warranty of Title_. If Closing occurs, then effective as of the
Closing Date and until the end of the Survival Period, Seller, pursuant to
the Assignment and the Deed will warrant Defensible Title, without
duplication, to (i) the Wells set forth on _Exhibit B_ (limited to any
currently producing formations), and (ii) survey sections set forth on 
_Schedule 3.9_ , to the extent that the interests in such survey sections are
contributed to by the Leases set forth on _Exhibit A-1_ (the " _Sections_ ")
(limited to the applicable Target Formations), unto Buyer against every
Person whomsoever lawfully claiming or to claim the same or any part thereof
by, through or under Seller or its Affiliates, but not otherwise, subject,
however, to the Permitted Encumbrances;  _provided, however_ , that, except
with respect to any liability of Seller for any claim asserted in writing by
Buyer to Seller in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.1(c)_ on or before the
expiration of the Survival Period for breach of such special warranty, such
special warranty shall cease and terminate at the end of such Survival Period.

(c) _Recovery on Special Warranty_.

(i) _Buyer s Assertion of Title Warranty Breaches_. Prior to the expiration
of the Survival Period, Buyer shall furnish Seller a Title Defect Notice
meeting the requirements of Section 11.2(a) setting forth any matters which
Buyer intends to assert as a breach of Sellers special warranty in the
Assignment. For all purposes of this Agreement, Buyer shall be deemed to have
waived, and Seller shall have no further liability for, any breach of Sellers
special warranty that Buyer fails to assert by a Title Defect Notice given to
Seller on or before the expiration of the Survival Period. Buyer agrees to
reasonably cooperate (but without the obligation to expend any funds or
undertake any obligations) with any attempt by Seller to cure any such Title
Defect, which attempted cure shall be at Sellers sole cost, risk,
and expense.

(ii) _Limitations on Special Warranty_. For purposes of Sellers special
warranty of title, the value of the Sections and/or Wells set forth in
Schedule 3.9, as appropriate

 



32  ((1) for a Well, limited to any currently producing formations, and (2) for
a Section, limited to the applicable Target Formations set forth on Schedule
3.9 for such Section), shall be deemed to be the Allocated Value thereof, as
adjusted herein. Recovery on Sellers special warranty of title shall be
limited to an amount (without any interest accruing thereon) equal to the
reduction in the Purchase Price to which Buyer would have been entitled had
Buyer asserted the defect giving rise to such breach of Sellers special
warranty of title as a Title Defect prior to the Title Claim Date pursuant to
Section 11.2, but without limiting Buyers rights to recover from Seller
costs arising out of, or relating to, such breach, including reasonable
attorneys fees incurred to defend title to the relevant Asset.

 

 _11.2 Notice of Title Defects; Defect Adjustments_. __

 

(a) _Title Defect Notices_. Buyer must deliver, no later than 5 p.m. CST on
February 9, 2017 (the " _Title Claim Date_ "), claim notices to Seller
meeting the requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 11.2(a)_ (collectively, the "
_Title Defect Notices_ " and, individually, a " _Title Defect Notice_ ")
setting forth any matters which, in Buyers reasonable opinion, constitute
Title Defects and which Buyer intends to assert as a Title Defect pursuant to
this _Section 11.2(a)_. For all purposes of this Agreement
and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (other than as set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 11.1(b)_), Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and Seller
shall have no liability for, any Title Defect which Buyer fails to assert as
a Title Defect by a properly delivered Title Defect Notice received by Seller
on or before the Title Claim Date. To be effective, each Title Defect Notice
shall be in writing, and shall include (i) a description of the alleged Title
Defect and the Well or Section (including the legal description of such Well
or affected Leases contributing to such Section), or portion thereof, affected
by such Title Defect (each a " _Title Defect Property_ "), (ii) the Allocated
Value of each Title Defect Property, (iii) supporting documents in Buyers
possession or control reasonably necessary for Seller to verify the existence
of such alleged Title Defect, and (v) the amount by which Buyer reasonably
believes the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property is reduced by such
alleged Title Defect and the computations upon which Buyers belief is based.
To give Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Title Defects,
Buyer agrees to use reasonable efforts to give Seller, on or before the end
of each calendar week prior to the Title Claim Date, written notice of all
alleged Title Defects (as well as any claims that would be claims under the
special warranty set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 11.1_) discovered by Buyer
during the preceding calendar week, which notice may be preliminary in nature
and supplemented prior to the Title Claim Date; _provided_ that neither the
failure to provide such notice, nor the contents of any such notice shall be
actionable or give rise to any rights in favor of Seller, and Seller may not
submit any such notice (or the fact that no such notice was submitted) to the
Title Arbitrator pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 11.2(j)_.

(b) _Title Benefit Notices_. Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to deliver to Buyer on or before the Title Claim Date with
respect to each Title Benefit a notice (a " _Title Benefit Notice_ ")
including (i) a description of the alleged Title Benefit and the Asset, or
portion thereof, affected by such alleged Title Benefit (each a " _Title
Benefit Property_ "), and (ii) the amount by which Seller reasonably believes
the Allocated Value of such Title Benefit Property is increased by such
alleged Title Benefit and the computations upon which Sellers belief is
based. Except as set forth in ___Section _ _11.2_ _(a)_ , Seller shall be
deemed to have waived all Title Benefits for which a Title Benefit Notice has
not been delivered on or before the Title Claim Date.

 



33 (c) _Seller_ __ _s Right to Cure_. Seller shall have the right, but not
the obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost and risk, to cure at any time
prior to one hundred twenty (120) days after Closing (the " _Cure Period_ "),
any Title Defects of which it has been advised by Buyer. During the period of
time from Closing to the expiration of the Cure Period, Buyer agrees to afford
Seller and its officers, employees and other authorized representatives
reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the Assets and all Records
in Buyers or any of its Affiliates possession in order to facilitate
Sellers attempt to cure any such Title Defects. If Seller elects in writing
prior to Closing to cure any Title Defect, the Title Defect Amount alleged by
Buyer with respect to such Title Defect shall, subject to _Section_ __ _
11.2(_ _i_ _)_ , be funded into the Escrow Account at Closing and distributed
in accordance with the terms of this _Article_ __ _ XI_. An election
by Seller to attempt to cure a Title Defect shall be without prejudice to its
rights under _Section 11.2(j)_ and shall not constitute an admission against
interest or a waiver of Sellers right to dispute the existence, nature or
value of, or cost to cure, the alleged Title Defect.

(d) _Remedies for Title Defects_. Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 11.2(_ _i_ _)_
and to Sellers continuing right to dispute the existence of a Title Defect
and/or the Title Defect Amount asserted with respect thereto, and subject to
the rights of the Parties with respect to _Section_ __ _ 7.4 _and _Section_
__ _ 8.4_, in the event that any Title Defect timely asserted by Buyer in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.2(a)_ is not waived in writing by Buyer
or cured during the Cure Period:

(i) the Cash Purchase Price or Final Cash Purchase Price, as applicable, shall
be reduced by the Title Defect Amount determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _
11.2(g)_ or _Section_ __ _ 11.2(j)_; or

(ii) if Buyer, in its sole and absolute discretion agrees, Seller may elect
to indemnify Buyer against all Liability (up to the Allocated Value of the
applicable Title Defect Property) resulting from such Title Defect with
respect to such Title Defect Property pursuant to an indemnity agreement in a
form and substance mutually agreed upon by the Parties (a " _Title Indemnity
Agreement_ ").

 

(e) _Remedies for Title Benefits_. With respect to each Title Benefit Property
reported under _Section_ __ _ 11.2(b)_, the increase in the Allocated Value
for such Title Benefit Property caused by such Title Benefit, as determined
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.2(h) _or _Section_ _11.2(j)_ (the " _Title
Benefit Amount_ ") shall serve to offset the amount of any reduction in the
Purchase Price due to Title Defects pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.2(d)_. In
no event shall a Title Benefit result in an increase to the Purchase Price. 

(f) _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 11.1(b)_ and
without limiting Sellers representations and warranties in _Article IV_ and
Buyers rights under this Agreement with respect to _Section_ __ _ 7.4_, __
the provisions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 11.2(d)_ shall be the exclusive
right and remedy of Buyer with respect to Sellers failure to have Defensible
Title with respect to any Asset or any other title matter.

 



34 (g) _Title Defect Amount_. The amount by which the Allocated Value of a Title
Defect Property is reduced as a result of the existence of a Title Defect
shall be the " _Title Defect Amount_ " and shall be determined in accordance
with the following terms and conditions (without duplication):

 

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

 

(ii) if the Title Defect is an Encumbrance that is undisputed and liquidated
in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be
paid to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect Property;

(iii) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) Sellers Net
Revenue Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue
Interest set forth for such Title Defect Property on _Exhibit B_ or _Schedule
3.9_ , as applicable, and Sellers Working Interest is correspondingly and
proportionately reduced as a result of such Title Defect, then the Title
Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect
Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue
Interest decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest set
forth for such Title Defect Property on _Exhibit B_ or _Schedule 3.9_ , as
applicable;

 

(iv) if the Title Defect represents an increase of (A) Sellers Working
Interest for any Title Defect Property over (B) the Working Interest set
forth for such Title Defect Property in _Exhibit B_ , then the Title Defect
Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect
Property _multiplied_ by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Working
Interest increase and the denominator of which is the Working Interest set
forth for such Title Defect Property in _Exhibit B_ ;

 

(v) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy where (A) the actual Net
Acres for any Title Defect Property, as to the applicable Target Formations,
is less than (B) the Net Acres for such Title Defect Property, as to the
applicable Target Formations, stated on _Schedule 3.9_ , then the Title Defect
Amount shall be the product obtained by multiplying, with respect to each
affected Lease contributing to such Section, (1) such difference in Net Acres,
to the extent attributable to such affected Lease by (2) the Allocated Value
(reduced to a per Net Acre dollar amount as to the applicable
Target Formations) for such Title Defect Property set forth on _Schedule 3.9_
by (3) a fraction, the numerator of which is the actual Net Revenue Interest
of such affected Lease and the denominator of which is the average Net Revenue
Interest for such Section set forth on _Schedule 3.9_ ;

(vi) if the Title Defect represents an obligation or Encumbrance upon or other
defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described above,
then the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the
Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect
Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect,
the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title
Defect Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller
and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper
evaluation;

 



35 (vii) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder; and

(viii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article_ __ _ XI_,
the aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects upon any Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of
such Title Defect Property.

 

(h) _Title Benefit Amount_. The Title Benefit Amount resulting from a Title
Benefit shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology,
terms and conditions (without duplication):

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Benefit Amount, then that
amount shall be the Title Benefit Amount;

(ii) if the Title Benefit represents a discrepancy between (A) Sellers Net
Revenue Interest for any Title Benefit Property and (B) the Net Revenue
Interest set forth for such Title Benefit Property on _Exhibit B_ or _Schedule
3.9_ , as applicable, then the Title Benefit Amount shall be the product of
the Allocated Value of such Title Benefit Property multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest increase and the
denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest set forth for such Title
Benefit Property on _Exhibit B_ or  _Schedule 3.9_ , as applicable;

(iii) if the Title Benefit represents a decrease of (A) Sellers Working
Interest for any Title Benefit Property over (B) the Working Interest set
forth for such Title Benefit Property in _Exhibit B_ , then the Title Benefit
Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Benefit
Property _multiplied_ by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Working
Interest decrease and the denominator of which is the Working Interest set
forth for such Title Benefit Property in _Exhibit B_ ;

 

(iv) if the Title Benefit represents a discrepancy where (A) the actual Net
Acres for any Title Benefit Property, as to the applicable Target Formations,
is greater than (B) the Net Acres for such Title Benefit Property, as to the
applicable Target Formations, stated on _Schedule 3.9_ , then the Title
Benefit Amount shall be the product obtained by multiplying, with respect to
each affected Lease contributing to such Section, (1) such difference in Net
Acres, to the extent attributable to such affected Lease by the Allocated
Value (reduced to a per Net Acre dollar amount as to the applicable
Target Formations) for such Title Benefit Property set forth on _Schedule
3.9_ by (3) a fraction, the numerator of which is the actual Net Revenue
Interest of such affected Lease and the denominator of which is the average
Net Revenue Interest for such Section set forth on _Schedule 3.9_ ; and

(v) if the Title Benefit is of a type not described above, then the Title
Benefit Amounts shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated
Value of Title Benefit Property, the portion of such Title Benefit Property
affected by such Title Benefit, the legal effect of the Title Benefit, the
potential economic effect of the Title Benefit over the life of such Title
Benefit Property, the values placed upon the Title Benefit by Buyer and Seller
and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper
evaluation.

 



36 (i) _Title Defect Threshold and Deductible_. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, (i) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Cash
Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for any individual Title
Defect for which the Title Defect Amount does not exceed $125,000 (the "
_Individual Title Defect Threshold_ "); and (ii) in no event shall there be
any adjustment to the Cash Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller
for any Title Defect for which the Title Defect Amount exceeds the Individual
Title Defect Threshold unless (A) the amount of the sum of (1) the aggregate
Title Defect Amounts of all such Title Defects that exceed the Individual
Title Defect Threshold (but excluding any Title Defect Amounts attributable to
Title Defects cured by Seller), _plus_ (2) the aggregate Remediation Amounts
of all Environmental Defects that exceed the Individual Environmental
Threshold (but excluding any Environmental Defects cured by Seller), exceeds
(B) the Aggregate Deductible, after which point Buyer shall be entitled to
adjustments to the Cash Purchase Price or other applicable remedies available
hereunder, but only to the extent that the amount by which the aggregate
amount of such Title Defect Amounts and Remediation Amounts exceeds the
Aggregate Deductible. For the avoidance of doubt, if Seller indemnifies Buyer
with respect to any Title Defect Property pursuant to a Title Indemnity
Agreement (if permitted pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 11.2(d)(ii)_) in each
case the Title Defect Amount related to such Title Defect Property will not be
counted towards the Aggregate Deductible and will not be considered for
purposes of  _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ and/or _Section_ __ _ 8.4_.

(j) _Title Dispute Resolution_. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree on
matters regarding (i) all Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts
and Title Benefit Amounts, and (ii) the adequacy of any curative materials
provided by Seller to cure an alleged Title Defect (the " _Disputed Title
Matters_ ") prior to Closing. If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree by
Closing (or by the end of the Cure Period if Seller elects to attempt to cure
a Title Defect after Closing), the Title Defect Amount alleged by Buyer with
respect to such Title Defect shall, subject to _Section_ __ _ 11.2(_ _i_ _)_
, be funded into the Escrow Account at Closing and distributed in accordance
with the terms of this  _Article_ __ _ XI _and the Disputed Title Matters
shall be exclusively and finally resolved pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
11.2(j)_. There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be a title attorney
with at least fifteen (15) years experience in oil and gas titles involving
properties in the regional area in which the Title Defect Properties are
located, as selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller within fifteen
(15) days after the Closing or the end of the Cure Period, as applicable (the
" _Title Arbitrator_ "). The Title Arbitrator must (a) be a neutral party who
has never been an officer, director or employee of or performed material
work for a Party or any Partys Affiliate within the preceding five (5) year
period and (b) agree in writing to keep strictly confidential the specifics
and existence of the dispute as well as all proprietary records of the
Parties reviewed by the Title Arbitrator in the process of resolving such
dispute. Absent such mutual agreement between Buyer and Seller as to the Title
Arbitrator, the Title Arbitrator shall be chosen by the Houston office of the
American Arbitration Association. Each of Buyer and Seller shall submit to
the Title Arbitrator its proposed resolution of the Disputed Title Matter. The
Title Arbitrator shall be limited to awarding only one or the other of the two
proposed resolutions. The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston,
Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not
conflict with the terms of this  _Section_ __ _ 11.2(j)_. The Title
Arbitrators determination shall be made within twenty (20) days after
submission of the Disputed Title Matters and shall be final and binding upon
both Parties, without right of appeal. In making his determination with

 



37  respect to any Disputed Title Matter, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by
the rules set forth in _Section_ __ _ 11.2(g)_ and _Section_ __ _ 11.2(h)_
and, subject to the foregoing, may consider such other matters as, in the
opinion of the Title Arbitrator, are necessary to make a proper determination.
The Title Arbitrator, however, may not award Buyer a greater Title Defect
Amount than the Title Defect Amount claimed by Buyer in its applicable Title
Defect Notice. The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited
purpose of determining the specific Disputed Title Matter submitted by either
Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with
respect to any matter. Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own legal fees and
other costs of presenting its case to the Title Arbitrator. Each of Seller and
Buyer shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title Arbitrator.
To the extent that the award of the Title Arbitrator with respect to any Title
Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount is not taken into account as
an adjustment to the Cash Purchase Price pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.5_ or
_Section_ __ _ 3.7(a)_, then, within ten (10) days after the Title Arbitrator
delivers written notice to Buyer and Seller of his award with respect to a
Title Defect Amount or a Title Benefit Amount, and, subject to _Section_ __ _
11.2(i)_, (i) Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount, if any, so awarded by the
Title Arbitrator to Seller, and (ii) Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount, if
any, so awarded by the Title Arbitrator to Buyer; _provided, however_ , that,
if such amount was paid to the Escrow Agent at Closing pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 3.6_, the Parties shall cause the Escrow Agent to disburse the
applicable amount in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 11.2_. Nothing
herein shall operate to cause Closing to be delayed on account of any
arbitration conducted pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 11.2(j)_ (other than
_Sections_ __ _ 8.4_ and _7.4_ ).

_11.3 Casualty and Condemnation Loss_. __

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this _Article XI_ to the contrary, from and
after the Effective Time, if Closing occurs, Buyer shall assume all risk of
loss with respect to production of Hydrocarbons through normal depletion
(including watering out of any well, collapsed casing or sand infiltration of
any well) and the depreciation of Personal Property due to ordinary wear and
tear, in each case, with respect to the Assets, and Buyer shall not assert
such matters as Casualty Losses or Title Defects hereunder.

 

(b) If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of
the Assets is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or is taken in
condemnation or under right of eminent domain (each, a " _Casualty Loss_ "),
and the Closing thereafter occurs, Seller, at Closing, shall pay to Buyer all
sums paid to Seller by Third Parties by reason of any Casualty Loss insofar
as with respect to the Assets and shall assign, transfer and set over to Buyer
or subrogate Buyer to all of Sellers right, title and interest (if any) in
insurance claims, unpaid awards, and other rights against Third
Parties (excluding any Liabilities, other than insurance claims, of or
against any Seller Indemnified Parties) arising out of such Casualty Loss
insofar as with respect to the Assets; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller
shall reserve and retain (and Buyer shall assign to Seller) all right, title,
interest and claims against Third Parties for the recovery of Sellers costs
and expenses incurred prior to Closing in repairing such Casualty Loss and/or
pursuing or asserting any such insurance claims or other rights against Third
Parties.

 



38 _11.4 Preferential Purchase Rights and Consents to Assign._

 

(a) With respect to each Preferential Purchase Right set forth in _Schedule
4.10_ , Seller, on or before five (5) Business Days after the Execution Date,
shall send to the holder of each such Preferential Purchase Right a notice in
material compliance with the contractual provisions applicable to such
Preferential Purchase Right and otherwise in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer. Any Preferential Purchase Right must be
exercised subject to all terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
including the successful Closing of this Agreement on the dates certain set
forth herein. The consideration payable under this Agreement for any
particular Asset for purposes of Preferential Purchase Right notices shall be
the Allocated Value for such Asset, adjusted as set forth in this Agreement.

 

(i) If, prior to Closing, any holder of a Preferential Purchase Right notifies
Seller that it intends to consummate the purchase of the Asset to which its
Preferential Purchase Right applies, then the Asset subject to such
Preferential Purchase Right shall be excluded from the Assets to be assigned
to Buyer at Closing (but only to the extent of the portion of such Asset
affected by the Preferential Purchase Right), and the Cash Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the Asset (or portion thereof) so
excluded. Seller shall be entitled to all proceeds paid by any Person
exercising a Preferential Purchase Right prior to Closing. If such holder of
such Preferential Purchase Right thereafter fails to consummate the purchase
of the Asset (or portion thereof) covered by such Preferential Purchase Right
on or before sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, no suit or other
proceeding by such Person with respect the Preferential Purchase Right is
pending or threatened, and such Person has not disputed the Preferential
Purchase Right in any respect (including the Allocated Value of the
Asset subject thereto), subject to satisfaction of the conditions precedent
in _Article VII_ , (A) Seller shall so notify Buyer, (B) Buyer shall purchase,
on or before ten (10) days following receipt of such notice, such Asset
(or portion thereof) that was so excluded from the Assets to be assigned to
Buyer at Closing, under the terms of this Agreement and for a price equal to
the amount by which the Cash Purchase Price was reduced at Closing with
respect to such excluded Asset (or portion thereof), adjusted as set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 3.3_ and (C) Seller shall assign to Buyer the Asset (or
portion thereof) so excluded at Closing pursuant to an instrument in
substantially the same form as the Assignment. If, as of Closing, the time
for exercising a Preferential Purchase Right has not expired and such
Preferential Purchase Right has not been exercised or waived, then the Asset
subject to such Preferential Purchase Right shall be excluded from the Assets
to be assigned to Buyer at Closing (but only to the extent of the portion of
such Asset affected by the Preferential Purchase Right), and the Purchase
Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the Asset (or
portion thereof) so excluded, and Seller shall, at its sole expense, continue
to use reasonable efforts to obtain the waiver of the Preferential Purchase
Right and shall continue to be responsible for the compliance therewith. In
the event that a Preferential Purchase Right with respect to an Asset deleted
and excluded from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at Closing
pursuant the foregoing is waived or the time for exercise of such right has
expired pursuant to its terms within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date,
and no suit or other proceeding by the holder of such Preferential Purchase
Right with respect thereto is pending or threatened, and such Person has not
disputed the Preferential Purchase Right in any respect (including the
Allocated Value of the Asset subject thereto), subject to satisfaction of the
conditions precedent in _Article VII_ , (A) Seller shall so notify Buyer, (B)
Buyer shall purchase, on 

 



39  or before ten (10) days following receipt of such notice, such Asset (or
portion thereof) that was so excluded from the Assets to be assigned to Buyer
at Closing, under the terms of this Agreement and for a price equal to the
amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced at Closing with respect to such
excluded Asset (or portion thereof), adjusted as set forth in _Section_ __ _
3.3 _and (C) Seller shall assign to Buyer the Asset (or portion thereof) so
excluded at Closing pursuant to an instrument in substantially the same form
as the Assignment.

 

(ii) All Assets for which any applicable Preferential Purchase Right has been
waived, or as to which the period to exercise the applicable Preferential
Purchase Right has expired without exercise by the holder thereof, in each
case, prior to Closing, shall be sold to Buyer at Closing pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement.

 

(b) With respect to each Consent set forth in _Schedule 4.4_ and each other
Consent applicable to the transactions contemplated in this Agreement,
Seller, on or before five (5) Business Days after the Execution Date (unless
Buyer has comments on the form in which case such date shall be extended),
shall send to the holder of each such Consent a notice in material
compliance with the contractual provisions applicable to such Consent (and
otherwise in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer) seeking such
holders consent to the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(i) If (A) Seller fails to obtain a Consent prior to Closing and the failure
to obtain such Consent would cause (1) the assignment of the Assets affected
thereby to Buyer to be void or (2) the termination of a Lease or Contract
under the express terms thereof (including terms permitting termination for a
breach of a provision such Lease or Contract, including the Consent provision
thereof) or (B) a Consent requested by Seller is denied in writing, then, in
each case, the Asset (or portion thereof) affected by such un-obtained Consent
shall be excluded from the Assets to be assigned to Buyer at Closing, and the
Cash Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Asset (or
portion thereof) so excluded, and Seller shall continue to use commercially
reasonable efforts (provided that Seller shall not be required to incur any
costs) to obtain the relevant Consent after Closing. In the event that a
Consent (with respect to an Asset excluded pursuant to this _Section 11.4(b)(_
_i_ _)_ ) that was not obtained prior to Closing is obtained within one
hundred eighty (180) days following Closing, then, subject to the conditions
precedent in _Article VII_ , within ten (10) days after such Consent is
obtained (x) Buyer shall purchase the Asset (or portion thereof) that was so
excluded as a result of such previously un-obtained Consent and pay to Seller
the amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced at Closing with respect to
the Asset (or portion thereof) so excluded and (y) Seller shall assign to
Buyer the Asset (or portion thereof) so excluded at Closing pursuant to an
instrument in substantially the same form as the Assignment.

 

(ii) If (A) Seller fails to obtain a Consent prior to Closing and the failure
to obtain such Consent would not cause (1) the assignment of the Asset (or
portion thereof) affected thereby to Buyer to be void or (2) the termination
of a Lease or Contract under the express terms thereof (including terms
permitting termination for a breach of a provision such Lease or
Contract, including the Consent provision thereof) and (B) such Consent
requested by Seller is not denied in writing by the holder thereof, then the
Asset (or portion thereof) subject to such un-obtained Consent shall
nevertheless be assigned by Seller to Buyer at Closing as part of the Assets
and Buyer shall have no claim against, and Seller shall have no Liability for,
the failure to obtain such Consent.

 



40 (iii) Prior to Closing, Seller and Buyer shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all Consents applicable to the Assets;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither Party shall be required to incur any
Liability or pay any money in order to obtain any such Consent. Subject to the
foregoing, Buyer agrees to cooperate reasonably with Seller in order to
facilitate the process of obtaining such Consents.

(iv) In cases in which the Asset subject to an unobtained Consent is an Asset
other than a Lease, Well or Unit, and Buyer is assigned the Lease, Well or
Unit to which such Asset relates, but such Asset is not transferred to Buyer
due to the unwaived Consent requirement, Buyer and Seller shall continue
after Closing to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent so
that such Asset can be transferred to Buyer upon receipt of the consent, and,
if permitted pursuant to applicable Law and agreement, such Asset shall be
held by Seller for the benefit of Buyer, Buyer shall pay all amounts due
thereunder or with respect thereto, and Buyer shall be responsible for the
performance of any obligations under or with respect to such Asset to the
extent that Buyer has been transferred the other Assets to which such Asset
relates and that are necessary to such performance until the applicable
consent is obtained.

 

ARTICLE XII

 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

 

 _12.1 Notice of Environmental Defects_. __

 

(a) _Environmental Defects Notice_. Buyer must deliver no later than 5 p.m.
CST on February 9, 2017 (the " _Environmental Claim Date_ ") claim notices to
Seller meeting the requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 12.1(a)_
(collectively, the " _Environmental Defect Notices_ " and, individually, an "
_Environmental Defect Notice_ ") setting forth any matters which, in Buyers
reasonable opinion, constitute Environmental Defects and which Buyer intends
to assert as Environmental Defects pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 12.1_.
To be effective, each Environmental Defect Notice shall be in writing and
shall include (i) a description of the matter constituting the alleged
Environmental Condition (including the applicable Environmental Law violated
or implicated thereby) and the Assets affected by such alleged Environmental
Condition, (ii) the Allocated Value of the Assets (or portions thereof)
affected by such alleged Environmental Condition, (iii) supporting documents
in Buyers possession or control that are reasonably necessary for Seller to
verify the existence of such alleged Environmental Condition, and (iv) a
calculation of the Remediation Amount (itemized in reasonable detail) that
Buyer asserts is attributable to such alleged Environmental Defect.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, and for
the avoidance of doubt, any Environmental Defect asserted by Buyer pursuant to
this _Section 12.1(a)_ shall be limited to the Assets only, and Buyer shall
not have the right to assert environmental defects with respect to any other
assets, properties or operations. For all purposes of this Agreement, but
without waiver or limitation of Sellers representations and warranties in
_Article IV_ or indemnity obligations in _Section_ __ _ 13.2_, Buyer shall be
deemed to have waived, and Seller shall have no liability for, (A) any
Environmental Defect which Buyer fails to assert as an Environmental Defect
by a properly delivered Environmental Defect Notice received by Seller on or
before

 



41  the Environmental Claim Date, and/or (B) any Environmental Defect affecting
any assets, properties or operations other than the Assets (other than
contribution requirements in accordance with the applicable operating
agreements), in each case, with such liabilities being " _Buyer s
Environmental Liabilities_." Buyers calculation of the Remediation Amount
included in the Environmental Defect Notice must describe in reasonable
detail the Remediation proposed for the alleged Environmental Condition that
gives rise to the asserted Environmental Defect and identify all assumptions
used by Buyer in calculating the Remediation Amount, including the standards
that Buyer asserts must be met to comply with Environmental Laws. To give
Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Environmental Defects,
Buyer agrees to use reasonable efforts to give Seller, on or before the end of
each calendar week prior to the Environmental Claim Date, written notice of
all alleged Environmental Defects discovered by Buyer during the preceding
calendar week, which notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented
prior to the Environmental Claim Date; _provided_ that neither the failure to
provide such notice, nor the contents of any such notice shall be actionable
or give rise to any rights in favor of Seller, and Seller may not submit any
such notice (or the fact that no such notice was submitted) to the
Environmental Arbitrator pursuant to _Section 12.1(f)_.

(b) _Seller_ __ _s Right to Cure_. With respect to any Asset excluded from
the Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.1(c)(ii)_, Seller shall have the
right, but not the obligation, at its sole cost, risk, and expense, to attempt
to cure any asserted Environmental Defect on or before the expiration of the
Cure Period. During the period of time from Closing to the expiration of the
Cure Period, Buyer agrees to afford Seller and its officers, employees and
other authorized representatives reasonable access, during normal business
hours, to all Records in Buyers or any of its Affiliates possession in order
to facilitate Sellers attempt to cure any such Environmental Defects. The
Allocated Value of any Environmental Defect that Seller elects in writing to
cure in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 12.1(b) _prior to Closing shall,
subject to _Section_ __ _ 12.1(e)_, be funded into the Escrow Account at
Closing and distributed in accordance with the terms of this ___Article_ __ _
XII_. An election by Seller to attempt to cure an Environmental Defect shall
be without prejudice to its rights under _Section 12.1(f)_ and shall not
constitute an admission against interest or a waiver of Sellers right to
dispute the existence, nature or value of, or cost to cure, the alleged
Environmental Defect.

 

(c) _Remedies for Environmental Defects_. Subject to Section 12.1(e) and to
Sellers continuing right to dispute the existence of an Environmental Defect
and/or the Remediation Amount asserted with respect thereto, and subject to
the rights of the Parties with respect to _Section_ __ _ 7.4 _and _Section_
__ _ 8.4_, in the event that any Environmental Defect timely asserted by
Buyer in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 12.1(a)_ is not waived in writing by
Buyer or cured during the Cure Period:

 

(i) Unless _Section_ __ _ 12.1(c)(ii)_ or _(iii)_ applies, the Purchase
Price shall be reduced by the Remediation Amount;

(ii) subject to _Section_ __ _ 12.1(b), _if the Remediation Amount exceeds
the Allocated Value of any affected Asset, at the election of either Buyer or
Seller, Seller shall retain the entirety of the Asset that is subject to such
Environmental Defect, together with all associated Assets, in which event the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of
such Asset and such associated Assets; or

 



42 (iii) subject to Buyers consent (in its sole and absolute discretion), Seller
may elect to indemnify Buyer against all Liability resulting from such
Environmental Defect with respect to the Assets pursuant to an indemnity
agreement in a form and substance mutually agreeable to the Parties (each, an
" _Environmental Indemnity Agreement_ ").

If Seller elects the option set forth in clause (i) above, Buyer shall be
deemed to have assumed responsibility for all of the costs and expenses
attributable to the Remediation of the Environmental Condition attributable to
such Environmental Defect and for all Liabilities with respect thereto and
such responsibility of Buyer shall be deemed to constitute part of
the Assumed Obligations hereunder.

(d) _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for Buyers rights under this Agreement with
respect to  _Section_ __ _ 7.4, _and without limitation or of Sellers
representations and warranties in _Article IV_ or indemnity obligations in
_Section_ __ _ 13.2_, the provisions set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 12.1(b)_
shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect to any
Environmental Defect with respect to any Asset or other environmental matter.

 

(e) _Environmental Deductibles_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, (i) in no event shall there be any adjustment to the Cash Purchase
Price or other remedies provided by Seller for any individual Environmental
Defect for which the Remediation Amount does not exceed $125,000 (the "
_Individual Environmental Threshold_ "); and (ii) in no event shall there be
any adjustment to the Cash Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller
for any Environmental Defect for which the Remediation Amount exceeds the
Individual Environmental Threshold unless (A) the amount of the sum of (1)
the aggregate Remediation Amounts of all such Environmental Defects that
exceed the Individual Environmental Threshold (but excluding any Remediation
Amounts attributable to any Environmental Defects cured by Seller), _plus_
 (2) the aggregate Title Defect Amounts of all Title Defects that exceed the
Individual Title Defect Threshold (but excluding any Title Defect Amounts
attributable to Title Defects cured by Seller), exceeds (B) the Aggregate
Deductible, after which point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the
Cash Purchase Price or other applicable remedies available hereunder, but only
with respect to the amount by which the aggregate amount of such Remediation
Amounts and Title Defect Amounts exceeds the Aggregate Deductible. For the
avoidance of doubt, if Seller indemnifies Buyer with respect to any
Environmental Defect Property pursuant to an Environmental Indemnity Agreement
or retains any Assets pursuant to _Section 12.1(c)(ii)_ , the Remediation
Amounts relating to such retained Assets will not be counted towards the
Aggregate Deductible and will not be considered for purposes of _Section_ __ _
7.4_ and/or  _Section_ __ _ 8.4_.

(f) _Environmental Dispute Resolution_. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to
agree on (i) all Environmental Defects and Remediation Amounts prior to
Closing and (ii) the adequacy of any cure by Seller of any asserted
Environmental Defect prior to the end of the Cure Period (items (i) and (ii),
collectively, the " _Disputed Environmental Matters_ "). If Seller and Buyer
are unable to agree by Closing (or by the end of the Cure Period if Seller
elects to attempt to cure an asserted Environmental Defect after Closing), the
Remediation Amount

 



43  alleged by Buyer with respect to such affected Asset shall, subject to
_Section_ __ _ 12.1(e)_, be funded into the Escrow Account at Closing and
distributed in accordance with the terms of this _Article_ __ _ XII_ and the
Disputed Environmental Matters shall be exclusively and finally resolved by
arbitration pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 12.1(f)_. There shall be a single
arbitrator, who shall be an environmental attorney with at least fifteen (15)
years experience in environmental matters involving oil and gas producing
properties in the regional area in which the affected Assets are located, as
selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller within fifteen (15) days
after the Closing Date or the end of the Cure Period, as applicable, or,
absent such agreement, by the Houston office of the American Arbitration
Association (the " _Environmental Arbitrator_ "). The arbitration proceeding
shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the
extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this _Section_ __ _
12.1_. The Environmental Arbitrators determination shall be made within
twenty (20) days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final
and binding upon both Parties, without right of appeal. In making his
determination, the Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 12.1_ and, subject to the foregoing, may
consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Environmental Arbitrator
are necessary or helpful to make a proper determination. The Environmental
Arbitrator, however, may not award Buyer any greater Remediation Amount than
the Remediation Amount claimed by Buyer in its applicable Environmental
Defect Notice. The Environmental Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the
limited purpose of determining the specific Disputed Environmental Matters
submitted by either Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to
either Party with respect to any matter. Seller and Buyer shall each bear its
own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case to the Environmental
Arbitrator. Each of Seller and Buyer shall bear one-half of the costs and
expenses of the Environmental Arbitrator. To the extent that the award of the
Environmental Arbitrator with respect to any Remediation Amount is not taken
into account as an adjustment to the Cash Purchase Price pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 3.5 _or _Section 3.7(a)_ , then, within ten (10) days after
the Environmental Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer and Seller of
his award with respect to any Remediation Amount, and, subject to  _Section_
__ _ 12.1(e)_, (i) Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount, if any, so awarded
by the Environmental Arbitrator to Seller, and (ii) Seller shall pay to Buyer
the amount, if any, so awarded by the Environmental Arbitrator to Buyer;
_provided, however_ , that, if such amount was paid to the Escrow Agent at
Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.6_, the Parties shall cause the Escrow
Agent to disburse the applicable amount in accordance with this  _Section_ __
_ 12.1(f)_. Nothing herein shall operate to cause Closing to be delayed on
account of any arbitration conducted pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
12.1(f)_, and, to the extent any adjustments are not agreed upon by the
Parties as of Closing, the Cash Purchase Price shall not be adjusted therefor
at Closing and subsequent adjustments to the Cash Purchase Price, if any, will
be made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.6_ or this  _Section 12.1(f)_.

_12.2_ _NORM, Asbestos, Wastes and Other Substances_ _._ Buyer
acknowledges that the Assets have been used for exploration, development, and
production of oil and gas and that there may be petroleum, produced water,
wastes or other substances or materials located in, on or under the Assets or
associated with the Assets. Equipment and sites included in the Assets may
contain asbestos, NORM or other Hazardous Substances. NORM may affix or attach
itself to the inside of wells, materials and equipment as scale, or in other
forms. The wells, materials and equipment located on the Assets or included
in the Assets may contain NORM, asbestos and

 



44  other wastes or Hazardous Substances. NORM containing material and/or other
wastes or Hazardous Substances may have come in contact with various
environmental media, including, water, soils or sediment. Special procedures
may be required for the assessment, remediation, removal, transportation, or
disposal of environmental media, wastes, asbestos, NORM and other Hazardous
Substances from the Assets. The presence of NORM or asbestos-containing
materials that are non-friable cannot be claimed as an Environmental Defect,
except to the extent constituting a violation of Environmental Laws.

The matters described in _Sections_ __ _ 13.2(f) and 13.2(g)_ (but only to
the extent of and any oil and gas properties removed from the Assets pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement) are referred to herein as the " _Retained
Liabilities_ ").

 

 _13.3_ _Indemnities of Buyer_ _._ Effective as of Closing, Buyer and its
successors and assigns shall assume and be responsible for, shall pay on a
current basis, and hereby agrees to defend, indemnify, hold harmless and
forever release Seller and its Affiliates, and all of its and their respective
equity holders, partners, members, directors, officers, managers, employees,

unless the amount with respect to such Liability exceeds $125,000, and (ii)
until and unless the aggregate amount of all Liabilities for which Claim

_13.5_ _Express Negligence_. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN _SECTION 6.3_
AND _SECTION 10.1_ , THE DEFENSE, INDEMNIFICATION, HOLD HARMLESS, RELEASE AND
ASSUMED OBLIGATIONS PROVISIONS PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE
APPLICABLE WHETHER OR NOT THE LIABILITIES, LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES AND DAMAGES
IN QUESTION AROSE OR RESULTED SOLELY OR IN PART FROM THE GROSS, SOLE, ACTIVE,
PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT
OR VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY. BUYER AND SELLER
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS STATEMENT COMPLIES WITH THE EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE AND
IS " _CONSPICUOUS_."

_13.6_ _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, the Parties agree that, from and after Closing, _Section_
__ _ 2.3_, _Section_ __ _ 3.6_,  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, _Section_ __ _
10.1_, _Section 11.1(b), Section_ __ _ 13.2_ and _Section_ __ _ 13.3_, any

exclusive remedies against each other with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, including breaches of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in this Agreement or in any
document or certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement. Except as
specified in _Section 11.1(b)_ , _Section_ __ _ 13.2_ and any Title Indemnity
Agreement or Environmental Indemnity Agreement entered into by the Parties,
effective as of Closing, Buyer, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties, hereby releases, remises and forever discharges Seller
and its Affiliates and all of such Persons equity holders, partners,
members, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives from any
and all suits, legal or administrative proceedings, claims, demands, damages,
losses, costs, Liabilities, interest or causes of action whatsoever, at Law

might now or subsequently have, based on, relating to or arising out of this
Agreement,

 



47  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the ownership, use or
operation of any of the Assets prior to Closing or the condition, quality,
status or nature of any of the Assets prior to Closing, including rights to

Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and any similar Environmental Law, breaches
of statutory or implied warranties, nuisance or other tort actions, rights to
punitive damages, common law rights of contribution and rights under insurance
maintained by Seller or any of its Affiliates (except as provided in _Section
11.3(b)_ ).

 

 _13.7_ _Indemnification Procedures_. All claims for indemnification under 
_Section_ __ _ 6.3_, _Section_ __ _ 10.1_, _Section_ __ _ 13.2_ and
_Section_ __ _ 13.3_ shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

 

(a) For purposes of _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, _Section_ __ _ 10.1_ and this 
_Article_ __ _ XIII_, the term " _Indemnifying Party_ " when used in
connection with particular Liabilities shall mean the Party or Parties having
an obligation to indemnify the other Party and/or other Persons with respect
to such Liabilities pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, _Section_ __ _ 10.1_ or
this _Article_ __ _ XIII_, and the term " _Indemnified Party_ " when used
in connection with particular Liabilities shall mean the Party and/or other
Persons having the right to be indemnified with respect to such Liabilities by
the Indemnifying Party pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.3_,  _Section_ __ _
10.1_ or this _Article_ __ _ XIII_.

(b) To make a claim for indemnification under  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_,
___Section_ __ _ 10.1_, _Section_ __ _ 13.2_ or _Section_ __ _ 13.3_, an
Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of its claim under
this  _Section_ __ _ 13.7_, including the specific details of and specific
basis under this Agreement for its claim (the " _Claim Notice_ "). In the
event that the claim for indemnification is based upon a claim by a Third
Party against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the
Indemnified Party shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the
Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of the Third Party Claim and shall
enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to the Third Party
Claim; _provided_ that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice of
a Third Party Claim as provided in this _Section_ __ _ 13.7(b)_ shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under _Section_ __ _ 6.3_,
_Section_ __ _ 10.1_, _Section_ __ _ 13.2_ or _Section_ __ _ 13.3_ (as
applicable) except to the extent such failure results in insufficient time
being available to permit the Indemnifying Party to effectively defend against
the Third Party Claim or otherwise materially prejudices the Indemnifying
Partys ability to defend against the Third Party Claim. In the event that
the claim for indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice shall
specify the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that was
inaccurate or breached.

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the
Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denies its
obligation to defend and indemnify the Indemnified Party against such Third
Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. The
Indemnified Party is authorized, prior to and during such thirty (30) day
period, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, to file any motion, answer
or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its
interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to
the Indemnifying Party.

(d) If the Indemnifying Party admits its obligation to defend and indemnify
the Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, it shall have the right and
obligation to

 



48  diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Indemnified Party
against such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party
shall in no event have the right to defend against any Third Party Claim to
the extent such Third Party Claim (i) seeks an injunction or non-monetary or
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party, or (ii) seeks monetary damages
in an amount in excess of the then remaining amount of the cap on Liabilities
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 13.4_ hereof. The Indemnifying Party shall have
full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise
or settlement thereof. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate in contesting any Third Party Claim
which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest. The Indemnified Party may
participate in, but not control, at its own expense, any defense or
settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 13.7(d)_. An Indemnifying Party shall not,
without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, (i) settle any Third
Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto which
does not include an unconditional written release of the Indemnified Party
from all Liability in respect of such Third Party Claim or (ii) settle any
Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto
in any manner that may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party
(other than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity).

 

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its obligation or admits its
obligation to defend and indemnify the Indemnified Party against a Third
Party Claim, but fails to diligently prosecute, indemnify against or settle
the Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
defend against the Third Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party, with counsel of the Indemnified Partys choosing, subject
to the right of the Indemnifying Party to admit its liability and assume the
defense of the Third Party Claim at any time prior to settlement or final
determination thereof. If the Indemnifying Party has not yet admitted its
obligation to defend and indemnify the Indemnified Party against a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall send written notice to the Indemnifying
Party of any proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Party shall have the
option for ten (10) days following receipt of such notice to (i) admit in
writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against the
liability and consent to such settlement, (ii) if liability is so admitted,
reject, in its reasonable judgment, the proposed settlement, or (iii) deny
liability. Any failure by the Indemnifying Party to respond to such notice
shall be deemed to be an election under subsection (iii) above.

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of
the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Liabilities complained of, (ii) admit its
liability for such Liability or (iii) dispute the claim for such Liabilities.
If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within such
thirty (30) day period that it has cured the Liabilities or that it disputes
the claim for such Liabilities, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to
dispute the claim for such Liabilities.

 

 _13.8_ _Survival_.

 

(a) Except for the Specified Representations, the representations and
warranties of the Parties in _Article_ __ _ IV_ and  _Article V_ and the
covenants and agreements of the Parties in _Sections_ __ _ 6.1_ shall survive
Closing for a period of twelve (12) months. The Specified

 



49  Representations (other than the representations and warranties set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 4.14_) shall survive Closing without time limit. The
representations and warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.14_ and the
covenants set forth in _Section_ __ _ 15.2 _shall terminate sixty (60) days
after the end of the applicable statute of limitations period. Subject to the
foregoing and _Section_ __ _ 13.8(b)_, the remainder of this Agreement shall
survive Closing without time limit. Representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements shall be of no further force or effect after the date of their
expiration;  _provided_ that there shall be no termination of any bona fide
claim asserted pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement prior to its expiration date.

 

(b) The indemnities in _Section_ __ _ 13.2(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 13.2(b)_, 
_Section_ __ _ 13.3(a) _and __ _ Section_ __ _ 13.3(b) _shall terminate as
of the expiration date of each respective representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement that is subject to indemnification, except in each case as to
matters for which a specific written claim for indemnity has been delivered to
the Indemnifying Party on or before such expiration date. Sellers indemnities
in _Sections 13.2(c)_ , _13.2(d)_ , _13.2(e)_ ,  _13.2(g)_ (other than with
respect to and any oil and gas properties removed from the Assets pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement) and _Section_ __ _ 13.2(h)_, shall terminate
twelve (12) months after the Closing. Sellers indemnities in _Section_ __ _
13.2(f)_ shall terminate sixty (60) days after the end of the applicable
statute of limitations period, and Sellers indemnities in _Section_ __ _
13.2(g)_ with respect to oil and gas properties removed from the Assets
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall survive Closing without time
limit. Buyers indemnities in _Section_ __ _ 6.3_,  _Section_ __ _ 10.1_
and _Section _ _13.3(c)_ shall survive Closing without time limit and shall
be deemed covenants running with the Assets ( _provided_ that Buyer and its
successors and assigns shall not be released from any of, and shall remain
jointly and severally liable to the Seller Indemnified Parties for, the
obligations and Liabilities of Buyer under such Sections of this Agreement
upon any transfer or assignment of any Asset).

 

 _13.9_ _Waiver of Right to Rescission_. Seller and Buyer acknowledge that,
following Closing, the payment of money, as limited by the terms of this
Agreement, shall be adequate compensation for breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein or for any other claim
arising in connection with or with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. As the payment of money shall be adequate compensation,
following Closing, Buyer and Seller waive any right to rescind this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 _13.10_ _Insurance_. The amount of any Liabilities for which any of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement or in
connection with or with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be reduced by any corresponding insurance proceeds from
insurance policies carried by a Party realized or that could reasonably be
expected to be realized by such Party if a claim were properly pursued under
the relevant insurance arrangements.

 

 _13.11_ _Non-Compensatory Damages_. None of the Buyer Indemnified Parties
nor the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover from Seller or
Buyer, as applicable, or their respective Affiliates, any special, indirect,
consequential, punitive, exemplary, remote or speculative damages (including
damages for lost profits of any kind) arising under or in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent
any

 



50  such Party suffers such damages to a Third Party, which damages (including
costs of defense and reasonable attorneys fees incurred in connection with
defending against such damages) shall not be excluded by this provision as to
recovery hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, each of Buyer, on
behalf of each of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, and Seller, on behalf of each
of the Seller Indemnified Parties, waives any right to recover any special,
indirect, consequential, punitive, exemplary, remote or speculative damages
(including damages for lost profits of any kind) arising in connection with or
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

_13.12_ _Disclaimer of Application of Anti-Indemnity Statutes_. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the provisions of any anti-indemnity statute
relating to oilfield services and associated activities shall not be
applicable to this Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

ARTICLE XIV

 

TERMINATION, DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

 

 _14.1_ _Right of Termination_. This Agreement and the transactions
contemplated herein may be terminated at any time prior to Closing:

(a) by Seller or Buyer if Closing shall not have occurred on or before March
17, 2017; or

 

(b) by Seller in its sole discretion if Parent has failed to deposit with the
Escrow Agent the entirety of the Deposit within the time period specified in
_Section_ __ _ 3.2_.

_provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 14.1 _if such Party or its Affiliates
are at such time in material breach of any provision of this Agreement.

 

 _14.2 Effect of Termination._

 

(a) If the obligation to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to any provision of  _Section_ __ _ 14.1_ hereof,
then, except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.2_ and except for the provisions
of _Sections 10.1(c)_ through _10.1(g)_ , _10.2_ , _10.3_ , _13.11_ , this 
_Section_ __ _ 14.2_, _Section_ __ _ 14.3_, _Article I_ and _Article_ __ _
XV_ (other than _Sections_ __ _ 15.2(b) _through _15.2(h)_ , _15.7_ , _15.8,
15.15 _ and _15.17_ ) and such of the defined terms set forth in _Annex I_ to
give context to such Sections, this Agreement shall forthwith become void.

 

(b) If (i) all conditions precedent to the obligations of Buyer set forth in
_Article VII_ (other than those actions or deliveries to occur at Closing or
contingent upon the satisfaction of other conditions precedent set forth in
_Article VII_ at Closing) have been met, or waived by Buyer, and (ii) the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated because of:
(A) the failure of Buyer to perform in any material respect any of its
obligations hereunder (including a failure to proceed with Closing if all
conditions precedent to the obligations of Buyer set forth in _Article VII_
(other than those actions or deliveries to occur at Closing or contingent
upon the satisfaction of other conditions precedent set forth in _Article VII_
at Closing) have been met, or waived by Buyer), or (B) the failure of any of
Buyers 

 



51  representations or warranties hereunder to be true and correct in all
material respects (without regard to materiality qualifiers) as of the
Execution Date and/or as of the Closing (or anticipated Closing if Seller is
ready, willing and able to close in such instance), then, in such event,
Seller shall have the right, as its sole and exclusive remedy, to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 14.1_ and retain the Deposit
together with any interest or income thereon, free of any claims by Buyer with
respect thereto as liquidated damages. It is expressly stipulated by the
Parties that the actual amount of damages resulting from such a termination
would be extremely difficult or impossible to determine accurately because of
(among other things) the unique nature of the Assets and the uncertainties of
applicable commodity markets, and the amount of the Deposit is a fair
and reasonable estimate by the Parties of such damages.

(c) If (i) all conditions precedent to the obligations of Seller set forth
in  _Article VIII_ (other than those actions or deliveries to occur at
Closing or contingent upon the satisfaction of other conditions precedent set
forth in _Article VIII_ at Closing) have been met, or waived by Seller, and
(ii) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated
because of: (A) the failure of Seller to perform in any material respect any
of its obligations hereunder (including a failure to proceed with Closing if
all conditions precedent to the obligations of Seller set forth in _Article
VIII_ (other than those actions or deliveries to occur at Closing or
contingent upon the satisfaction of other conditions precedent set forth in
_Article VIII_ at Closing) have been met, or waived by Seller), or (B) the
failure of any of Sellers representations or warranties hereunder to be true
and correct in all material respects (without regard to materiality
qualifiers) as of the Execution Date and/or as of the Closing (or anticipated
Closing if Buyer is ready, willing and able to close in such instance), then
Buyer, without limiting Buyers other remedies at law or equity, including the
right to specifically enforce Sellers obligation to convey the Assets, shall
be entitled to the delivery of the Deposit together with any interest or
income actually earned thereon, free of any claims by Seller with respect
thereto after the termination of this Agreement.

 

(d) If this Agreement is terminated by the mutual written agreement of the
Parties, or this Agreement is otherwise terminated pursuant to  _Section_ __
_ 14.1_ and the Closing does not occur on or before the Closing Date for any
reason other than as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 14.2(b)_, then Buyer shall
be entitled to the delivery of the Deposit together with any interest or
income actually earned thereon, free of any claims by Seller with respect

MISCELLANEOUS

 

 _15.1_ _Appendices, Exhibits and Schedules_. All of the Appendices, Exhibits
and Schedules referred to in this Agreement are hereby incorporated into this
Agreement by reference and constitute a part of this Agreement. Each Party to
this Agreement and its counsel has received a complete set of Appendices,
Exhibits and Schedules prior to and as of the execution of this Agreement.

_15.2_ _Expenses and Taxes_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all fees, costs and
expenses incurred by Buyer or Seller in negotiating this Agreement or in
consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by
the Party incurring the same, including legal and accounting fees, costs and
expenses.

 

(b) Seller shall be allocated and bear all Asset Taxes attributable to (i) any
Tax period ending prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the portion of any
Straddle Period ending immediately prior to the Effective Time. Buyer shall be
allocated and bear all Asset Taxes attributable to (x) any Tax period
beginning at or after the Effective Time and (y) the portion of any Straddle
Period beginning at the Effective Time.

(c) For purposes of determining the allocations described in
_Section 15.2(b)_ , (i) Asset Taxes that are attributable to the severance or
production of Hydrocarbons (other than such Asset Taxes described in clause
(iii) below) shall be allocated to the period in which the severance or
production giving rise to such Asset Taxes occurred, (ii) Asset Taxes that
are based upon or related to income or receipts or imposed on a transactional
basis (other than such Asset Taxes described in clause (i) above or (iii)
below), shall be allocated to the period in which the transaction giving rise
to such Asset Taxes occurred, and (iii) Asset Taxes that are ad valorem,
property or other Asset Taxes imposed on a periodic basis pertaining to a
Straddle Period shall be allocated between the portion of such Straddle
Period ending immediately prior to the Effective Time and the portion of such
Straddle Period beginning at the Effective Time by prorating each such Asset
Tax based on the number of days in the applicable Straddle Period that occur
before the date on which the Effective Time occurs, on the one hand, and the
number of days in such Straddle Period that occur on or after the date on
which the Effective Time occurs, on the other hand. For purposes of
clause (iii) of the preceding sentence, the period for such Asset Taxes shall
begin on the date on which ownership of the applicable Assets gives rise to
liability for the particular Asset Tax and shall end on the day before the
next such date.

 

(d) To the extent the actual amount of an Asset Tax is not known at the time
an adjustment is to be made with respect to such Asset Tax pursuant to
_Sections 3.3_ , _3.5_ or _3.7_ , as applicable, the Parties shall utilize the
most recent information available in estimating the amount of such Asset Tax
for purposes of such adjustment. To the extent the actual amount of an Asset
Tax (or the amount thereof paid or economically borne by a Party) is
ultimately determined to be different than the amount (if any) that was taken
into account in the Final Settlement Statement as finally determined pursuant
to _Section 3.7_ , timely payments will be made from one Party to the other
to the extent necessary to cause each Party to bear the amount of such Asset
Tax that is allocable to such Party under this _Section 15.2_.

 



53 (e) Subject to Buyers indemnification rights under _Section_ __ _
13.2_, after the Closing Date, Buyer shall (i) be responsible for paying any
Asset Taxes relating to any Tax period that ends before or includes the
Effective Time that become due and payable after the Closing Date and shall
file with the appropriate Governmental Authority any and all Tax Returns
required to be filed after the Closing Date with respect to such Asset Taxes,
(ii) submit each such Tax Return to Seller for its review and comment
reasonably in advance of the due date therefor and (iii) timely file any such
Tax Return, incorporating any comments received from Seller prior to the due
date therefor. The Parties agree that (x) this _Section 15.2(e)_ is intended
to solely address the timing and manner in which certain Tax Returns relating
to Asset Taxes are filed and the Asset Taxes shown thereon are paid to the
applicable taxing authority, and (y) nothing in this _Section 15.2(e)_ shall
be interpreted as altering the manner in which Asset Taxes are allocated to
and economically borne by the Parties (except for any penalties, interest or
additions to Tax imposed as a result of any breach by Buyer of its obligations
under this _Section 15.2(e)_ , which shall be borne by Buyer).

 

(f) All required documentary, filing and recording fees and expenses in
connection with the filing and recording of the assignments, conveyances or
other instruments required to convey title to the Assets to Buyer shall be
borne by Buyer. Any and all sales, use, transfer, stamp, documentary,
registration or similar Taxes incurred or imposed with respect to the
transactions described in this Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ")
shall be borne by Buyer; _provided_ that Seller shall pay or cause to be paid
to the applicable Governmental Authorities any Transfer Taxes that it is
required by Law to collect and remit. Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller
harmless from and against such Transfer Taxes within thirty (30) days of
Sellers written demand therefor. Seller and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate
in good faith to minimize, to the extent permissible under applicable Law,
the amount of any such Transfer Taxes.

(g) The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and
any audit, litigation, or other proceeding with respect to Taxes relating to
the Assets. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
Partys request) the provision of records and information that are relevant to
any such Tax Return or audit, litigation or other proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided under this
Agreement. The Parties agree to retain all books and records with respect to
Tax matters pertinent to the Assets relating to any Tax period beginning
before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations of
the respective Tax periods and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Governmental Authority.

 

(h) Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to agree to an
allocation of the Purchase Price, the Assumed Obligations, and any other
items properly treated as consideration for U.S. federal income Tax purposes
among the Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder within thirty (30) days after the
date that the Final Settlement Statement is delivered pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 3.7_.

 



54  In the event that Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve any disagreement
with respect to such allocation, the Parties shall submit the dispute to the
Accounting Arbitrator in accordance with the procedures set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 3.7_ to resolve such dispute. If Seller and Buyer reach an
agreement with respect to the allocation, (i) Buyer and Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to update the allocation in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code following any adjustment to the Cash Purchase Price
pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause
their Affiliates to, report consistently with the allocation, as adjusted, on
all Tax Returns, including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 (Asset
Acquisition Statement under Section 1060), which Buyer and Seller shall timely
file with the IRS, and neither Seller nor Buyer nor their
respective Affiliates shall take any position on any Tax Return that is
inconsistent with such allocation, as adjusted, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law; provided, however, that neither Party shall be unreasonably
impeded in its ability and discretion to negotiate, compromise and/or settle
any Tax audit, claim or similar proceedings in connection with such
allocation.

 

 _15.3_ _Assignment_. Subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 15.17_,
this Agreement may not be assigned or otherwise transferred (including by
change of control, merger, consolidation, or stock purchase) by either Party
without the prior written consent of the other Party. In the event one Party
consents to any such assignment, such assignment shall not relieve the other
Party of any obligations and responsibilities hereunder, including obligations
and responsibilities arising following such assignment. Any assignment or
other transfer by Buyer or its successors and assigns of any of the Assets
shall not relieve Buyer or its successors or assigns of any of their
obligations (including indemnity obligations) hereunder, as to the Assets so
assigned or transferred.

 

 _15.4_ _Preparation of Agreement_ _._ Both Seller and Buyer and their
respective counsel participated in the preparation of this Agreement. In the
event of any ambiguity in this Agreement, no presumption shall arise based on
the identity of the draftsman of this Agreement.

 

 _15.5_ _Publicity_. Seller and Buyer shall promptly consult with each other
with regard to all press releases or other public or private announcements
issued or made at or prior to Closing concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated herein, and, except as may be required by applicable
Laws or the applicable rules and regulations of any Governmental Authority or
stock exchange, neither Buyer nor Seller shall issue any such press release or
other public or private announcement without the prior written consent of the
other Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Parties
shall be obligated to hold all specific terms and provisions of this Agreement
strictly confidential until the expiration of the two (2)-year period after
the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not restrict
disclosures by the Buyer Party or Seller that are required by applicable
securities or other Laws or regulations or the applicable rules of any stock
exchange having jurisdiction over the disclosing Party or its Affiliates,
_provided_  that such disclosures shall be made only to the extent required
thereunder, prevent Buyer or Seller from recording the Assignment and any
federal or state assignments delivered at Closing or from complying with any
disclosure requirements of Governmental Authorities that are applicable to
the transfer of the Assets from Seller to Buyer, prevent Buyer or Seller from
making any disclosure of information relating to this Agreement if made in a
manner, under conditions and to Persons that would be permitted under the
Confidentiality Agreement so long as such Person continues to hold such

making disclosures in connection with complying with Preferential Purchase
Rights and other transfer restrictions applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 _15.9_ _Entire Agreement; Conflicts_. THIS AGREEMENT, THE APPENDICES,
EXHIBITS AND SCHEDULES HERETO, THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS AND THE
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT COLLECTIVELY CONSTITUTE THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT BETWEEN
THE PARTIES PERTAINING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF AND SUPERSEDE ALL PRIOR
AGREEMENTS, UNDERSTANDINGS, NEGOTIATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS, WHETHER ORAL OR
WRITTEN, OF THE PARTIES PERTAINING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF. THERE ARE NO
WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR OTHER AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES RELATING
TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN
THIS AGREEMENT AND THE CERTIFICATES DELIVERED PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 9.3(i) AND
9.3(j), AND NEITHER SELLER NOR BUYER SHALL BE BOUND BY OR LIABLE FOR ANY
ALLEGED REPRESENTATION, PROMISE, INDUCEMENT OR STATEMENTS OF INTENTION NOT SO
SET FORTH. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT BETWEEN (A) THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF
THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF ANY SCHEDULE OR EXHIBIT HERETO
OR (B) THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS
OF ANY TRANSACTION DOCUMENT, THE TERMS AND

 



57  PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL GOVERN AND CONTROL; _PROVIDED_ ,
_HOWEVER_ , THAT THE INCLUSION IN ANY OF THE SCHEDULES AND EXHIBITS HERETO OR
ANY TRANSACTION DOCUMENT OF TERMS AND PROVISIONS NOT ADDRESSED IN THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL NOT BE DEEMED A CONFLICT, AND ALL SUCH ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS
SHALL BE GIVEN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT, SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS
_SECTION_ __ _ 15.9_.

 

 _15.10_ _Parties in Interest_. The terms and provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Seller and Buyer and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than the
Parties or their respective successors and permitted assigns, or the Parties
respective related Indemnified Parties hereunder any rights, remedies,
obligations or Liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement; _provided_
that only a Party and its successors and permitted assigns will have the
right to enforce the provisions of this Agreement on its own behalf or on
behalf of any of its related Indemnified Parties (but shall not be obligated
to do so).

 

 _15.11_ _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified only by an instrument in writing executed by all Parties
specifically referring to the terms to be amended, restated, supplemented
and/or modified and expressly identified as an amendment, restatement,
supplement or modification.

 

 _15.12_ _Waiver; Rights Cumulative_. Any of the terms, covenants,
representations, warranties or conditions hereof may be waived only by a
written instrument executed by or on behalf of the Party waiving compliance.
No course of dealing on the part of Seller or Buyer or their respective
officers, employees, agents, or representatives, and no failure by Seller or
Buyer to exercise any of its rights under this Agreement, shall, in any such
case, operate as a waiver thereof or affect in any way the right of such Party
at a later time to enforce the performance of such provision. No waiver by
any Party of any condition, or any breach of any term, covenant,
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, in any one or more
instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a further or continuing
waiver of any such condition or breach or a waiver of any other condition or
of any breach of any other term, covenant, representation or warranty. The
rights of Seller and Buyer under this Agreement shall be cumulative, and the
exercise or partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude the
exercise of any other right.

_15.13 Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. __

 

(a) This Agreement and any claim, controversy or dispute arising under or
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or the
rights, duties and relationship of the parties hereto and thereto, shall be
governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the
State of Texas, excluding any conflicts of law, rule or principle that might
refer construction of provisions to the Laws of another jurisdiction.

(b) The Parties agree that the appropriate, exclusive and convenient forum for
any disputes between any of the Parties arising out of this Agreement, the
Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be in any
federal court in Harris County, Texas and each of the Parties irrevocably
submits to the jurisdiction of such courts

 



58  solely in respect of any proceeding arising out of or related to this
Agreement. The Parties further agree that the Parties shall not bring suit
with respect to any disputes arising out of this Agreement, the Transaction
Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby in any court or jurisdiction
other than the above specified courts. The Parties further agree, to the
extent permitted by Law, that a final and nonappealable judgment against a
Party in any action or proceeding contemplated above shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside the United States
by suit on the judgment, a certified or exemplified copy of which shall
be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment.

(c) To the extent that any Party or any of its Affiliates has acquired,
or hereafter may acquire, any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from
any legal process (whether through service or notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect
to itself or its property, such Party (on its own behalf and on behalf of its
Affiliates) hereby irrevocably (i) waives such immunity in respect of its
obligations with respect to this Agreement and (ii) submits to the personal
jurisdiction of any court described in _Section 15.13(b)_.

(d) THE PARTIES HERETO AGREE THAT THEY HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND
INTENTIONALLY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION
BASED HEREON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT,
THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

 

 _15.14_ _Severability_ _._ If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
adverse manner to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
extent possible.

 

 _15.15_ _Removal of Name_ _._ As promptly as practicable, but in any case
within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall to the extent
reasonably practicable eliminate the names "Vitruvian Exploration",
"Vitruvian" and any variants thereof from the Assets and, except with respect
to such grace period for eliminating existing usage, shall have no right to
use any logos, trademarks or trade names belonging to Seller or any of its
Affiliates.

 

 _15.16_ _Counterparts_ _._ This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, and each such counterpart hereof shall be deemed to be an
original instrument, but all of such counterparts shall constitute for all
purposes one agreement. Any signature hereto delivered by a Party by facsimile
or other electronic transmission shall be deemed an original signature
hereto.

_15.17_ _Like-Kind Exchange_ _._ Buyer and Seller agree that either or
both of Seller and Buyer may elect to treat the acquisition or sale of the
Assets as an exchange of like-kind property

 



59  under Section 1031 of the Code (an " _Exchange_ "); _provided_ that the
Closing shall not be delayed by reason of the Exchange. Each Party agrees to
use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the other Party in the completion of
such an Exchange including an Exchange subject to the procedures outlined in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1031(k)-1 and/or Internal Revenue Service
Revenue Procedure 2000-37. Each of Seller and Buyer shall have the right at
any time prior to Closing to assign all or a part of its rights under this
Agreement to a qualified intermediary (as that term is defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(iii)) or an exchange accommodation
titleholder (as that term is defined in Internal Revenue Service Revenue
Procedure 2000-37) to effect an Exchange. Each Party acknowledges and agrees
that neither an assignment of a Partys rights under this Agreement nor any
other actions taken by a Party or any other person in connection with the
Exchange shall release any Party from, or modify, any of its liabilities and
obligations (including indemnity obligations to each other) under this
Agreement, and no Party makes any representations as to any particular
tax treatment that may be afforded to any other Party by reason of such
assignment or any other actions taken in connection with the Exchange. Any
Party electing to treat the acquisition or sale of the Assets as an Exchange
shall be obligated to pay all additional costs incurred hereunder as a result
of the Exchange, and in consideration for the cooperation of the other Party,
the Party electing Exchange treatment shall agree to pay all costs associated
with the Exchange and to indemnify and hold the other Party, its Affiliates,
and their respective former, current and future partners, members,
shareholders, owners, officers, directors, managers, employees, agents and
representatives harmless from and against any and all liabilities and taxes
arising out of, based upon, attributable to or resulting from the Exchange or
transactions or actions taken in connection with the Exchange that would not
have been incurred by the other Party but for the electing Partys
Exchange election.
