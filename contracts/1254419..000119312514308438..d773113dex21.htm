(iii) the Purchaser will deliver to account(s) specified in writing by

Section 1.4 _Closing Indebtedness; Transaction Expenses_.

 

(a) Not less than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers
will deliver to the Purchaser the following:

 

(i) a statement showing the calculation of the Sellers good faith estimate of
the Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ "), which
statement will be prepared in a manner consistent with the reference working
capital statement attached as _Section 1.4_ of the Disclosure Schedule.

 

(ii) a statement setting forth the Sellers good faith estimate of all Closing
Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Closing Indebtedness_ "), a portion of which
shall be discharged at Closing as contemplated by _Section 1.3(a)(i)_. Such
statement will detail to whom each item of Indebtedness is payable and the
amount payable to each such Person (the " _Creditors_ "). In addition, the
Sellers will, not less than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
deliver to the Purchaser pay-off letters from all holders of Closing
Indebtedness referred to in the Estimated Closing Indebtedness, in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser, which letters will contain pay-off
amounts, per diems, wire transfer instructions and an agreement, upon full
payment, to file all appropriate discharges of any security interest
in respect of such Closing Indebtedness or an authorization to the Company or
Purchaser to file such discharges (collectively, the " _Payoff Letters_ ").

 

(iii) a statement setting forth the Sellers good faith estimate of the total
amount of all Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated Transaction Expenses_
"), a portion of which shall be discharged at Closing as contemplated by
_Section 1.3(a)(ii)_. Such statement will include to whom each item of
Transaction Expenses is payable and the amount payable to each such Person.

Section 1.5 _Final Purchase Price Calculation_.

 

(a) As promptly as possible, but in any event within 60 days after the Closing
Date, the Purchaser will deliver to the Sellers Representative a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") as
of the opening of business on the Closing Date and a statement showing the
calculation of Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Transaction
Expenses, the Closing Cash Balance and the Final Cash Consideration (together
with the Closing Balance Sheet, the " _Closing Statement_ "), which statement
will be prepared in a manner consistent with the reference working capital
statement attached as _Section 1.4_ of the Disclosure Schedule. The Closing
Balance Sheet will be prepared and each of the Net Working Capital, the
Closing Indebtedness and the Transaction Expenses will be determined in
accordance with

 



3  GAAP and using the same accounting methods, policies, principles, practices
and procedures, with consistent classifications, judgments and estimation
methodology, as were used in preparation of the Latest Audited Balance Sheet
to the extent consistent with GAAP and will not include any changes in assets
or liabilities as a result of purchase accounting adjustments.

 

(b) The Sellers Representatives accountants may make inquiries of the
Purchaser and its accountants regarding questions concerning, or
disagreements with, the Closing Statement arising in the course of their
review thereof. The Sellers Representative will be given access, upon
reasonable request, to the books and records of the Company and working papers
of the Purchaser created in connection with the preparation of the Closing
Statement to verify the accuracy, presentation and other matters relating to
the preparation of the Closing Statement and the calculations set forth
therein. The Sellers Representatives right of access under this _Section
1.5(b)_ will terminate immediately upon the final determination of Net Working
Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses and the Final Cash
Consideration pursuant to this  _Section 1.5_.

(c) If the Sellers Representative has any objections to the Closing
Statement, they may deliver to the Purchaser within 30 days after delivery of
the Closing Statement a statement setting forth their objections thereto (an "
_Objections Statement_ ") and all amounts that are not in dispute will be paid
by the party owing such payment by wire transfer of immediately available
funds no later than three business days after the time period in which the
Sellers Representative may deliver an Objections Statement. If an Objections
Statement is not delivered to the Purchaser within 30 days after delivery of
the Closing Statement, the Closing Statement will be final, binding and non-
appealable by the parties. The Purchaser and the Sellers Representative will
negotiate in good faith to resolve any such objections, but if they do not
reach a final resolution within 15 days after the delivery of the Objections
Statement, the Purchaser and the Sellers Representative will submit such
dispute to Deloitte and Touche LLP (the " _Dispute Resolution Auditor_ "). Any
submissions to the Dispute Resolution Auditor must be written and delivered to
each party to the dispute.

(d) The Dispute Resolution Auditor will consider only those items and amounts
that are identified in the Objections Statement as being items that the
Purchaser and the Sellers Representative are unable to resolve. The Dispute
Resolution Auditors determination will be based on the definition and method
of calculation of Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Transaction
Expenses and the Final Cash Consideration contained or referred to (as the
case may be) herein. Further, the Dispute Resolution Auditors determination
will be based solely on the presentations by the Sellers Representative and
the Purchaser and the provisions of this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of
an independent review). The Purchaser and the Sellers Representative will
use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Dispute Resolution
Auditor to make a determination of the matters in dispute as soon as
practicable. The resolution of the dispute by the Dispute Resolution Auditor
will be final and will be binding on and non-appealable by the parties. The
costs and expenses of the Dispute Resolution Auditor will be borne 50% by the
Sellers and 50% by the Purchaser.

 



4 Section 1.6 _Payment of Adjustments to Closing Cash Consideration_.

 

(a) If the amount of the final determination of the Final Cash Consideration
pursuant to _Section 1.5_ is greater than the amount of the Closing Cash
Consideration (i) the Purchaser shall promptly (but in any event within five
(5) Business Days following the final determination of the Final Cash
Consideration) pay (A) to each Seller an amount equal to such difference
multiplied by such Sellers Pro Rata Portion, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account designated in writing by such Seller; and (ii)
the Sellers Representative and the Purchaser shall deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow Agent to pay to each of
the Sellers an amount equal to the funds in the Adjustment Escrow Account
multiplied by such Sellers Pro Rata Portion, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated in writing by such
Seller.

(b) If the amount of the final determination of the Final Cash Consideration
pursuant to _Section 1.5_ is less than the amount of the Closing Cash
Consideration, the Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall promptly
(but in any event within five (5) Business Days) deliver a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent to pay to the Purchaser the absolute value of
such difference (the " _Shortfall Amount_ ") by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to one or more accounts designated in writing by
the Purchaser. The instructions to the Escrow Agent shall provide that the
Shortfall Amount shall be paid, first, from the funds available in the
Adjustment Escrow Account and, if such Shortfall Amount exceeds such available
funds, second, from the funds available in the Indemnification Escrow
Account. In the event that the funds available in the Adjustment Escrow
Account are in excess of the Shortfall Amount (such excess, the " _Escrow
Excess Amount_ "), the Sellers Representative and the Purchaser shall
simultaneously with the delivery of the instructions described in the first
sentence of this _Section 1.6(b)_, deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent to pay each Seller an amount equal to the Escrow Excess Amount
multiplied by such Sellers Pro Rata Portion, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account designated in writing by such Seller.

 

Section 1.7 _Escrow_.

 

(a) At Closing, the Purchaser shall deduct from the Closing Cash Consideration

ARTICLE VII

 

TAX RELATED COVENANTS

 

The following provisions will govern the allocation of responsibility as
between Purchaser and Sellers for certain tax matters following the Closing
Date:

Section 7.1 _Tax Indemnification_. Each Seller will indemnify the Purchaser
and the Company and hold them harmless from and against, without duplication,
any loss, claim, liability, expense, or other damage attributable to all Taxes
(or the non-payment thereof) of the Company (except to the extent such Tax
liability is specifically reflected as a liability or reserve

 



38  for Tax liabilities in the determination of the Final Net Working Capital
for all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion
through the end of the Closing Date for any taxable period that includes (but
does not end on) the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "). Sellers will
pay Purchaser for any Taxes of the Company that are the responsibility of
Sellers pursuant to this _Section 7.1_ within fifteen (15) days after
Purchasers written request for payment of such Taxes _provided_ , _that_ the
Sellers shall not be required to make any payment earlier than five days
before it is due to the appropriate taxing authority.

Section 7.2 _Straddle Period_. In the case of any taxable period that includes
(but does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Tax Period_ "), the
amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income, receipts, or payroll of
the Company for the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be determined based on an
interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date
and the amount of other Taxes of the Company for a Straddle Period that
relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be deemed to be the amount of such

(b) The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification under _Section 10.2_ or
of any Claim therefor will be calculated net of any amounts actually
recovered by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies (but
after taking into account any reasonable costs incurred by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties in connection with recovering under such policies).
The Purchaser will, and will cause the Company to use commercially reasonable
efforts to, seek full recovery under all insurance policies and other
indemnification and contribution arrangements covering any Loss to the same
extent as they would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification
hereunder. In the event that an insurance or other recovery is made by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties or the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates with respect to any Loss for which any such Person has been
indemnified hereunder and received payment therefor, then a refund equal to
the aggregate amount of the recovery (net of any reasonable costs incurred by
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in connection with recovering under such
policies) will be made promptly to the Sellers in accordance with each
Sellers Pro Rata Portion thereof.

Section 10.9 _Punitive and Certain Other Damages_. No Indemnified Party will
be entitled to indemnification for any (a) special, punitive or exemplary
damages; (b) loss of enterprise value, diminution in value of any business,
damage to reputation or loss of goodwill; (c) lost profits, consequential,
indirect or incidental damages; or (d) damages calculated based on a multiple
of profits, revenue or any other financial metric, except, in each case, (i)
to the extent such damages are finally awarded and actually paid by the
Indemnified Party in connection with a Third Party Claim, or (ii) to the
extent such damages described in clauses (b)(d) of this _Section 10.9_ arise
from breaches of covenants.

 

Section 10.10 _Indemnification Escrow Release_. On the date that is nine (9)
months following the Closing Date, the Purchaser and the Sellers
Representative shall provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
to deliver promptly from the Indemnification Escrow Account by wire transfer
of immediately available funds an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the
Indemnification Escrow Amount, if any, less the aggregate of any claims for
indemnification under _Section 10.2(a)_ properly asserted prior to such date
by Purchaser Indemnified Parties in writing in accordance with this  _ARTICLE
X_ , but not yet resolved as of such date. On the Final Release Date, the
Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall provide a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent to deliver promptly from the Indemnification
Escrow Account by wire transfer of immediately available funds all or a
portion of the cash held in the Indemnification Escrow Account, such that,
following such transfer, the amount of cash remaining in the Indemnification
Escrow Account equals only the amount, if any, of claims for indemnification
under _Section 10.2(a)_ properly asserted prior to such date by Purchaser
Indemnified Parties in writing in accordance with this _ARTICLE X_ , but not
yet 

 



50  resolved as of the Final Release Date (such claims "Unresolved Claims," and
such amount of funds to be transferred, the "Indemnification Escrow
Remainder"). Such joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent shall cause
the Escrow Agent to pay to each of the Sellers such Sellers Pro Rata Portion
of the Indemnification Escrow Remainder to the bank accounts designated by
each such Seller from the Indemnification Escrow Account. Upon final
resolution of any Unresolved Claim in respect of which an amount had been
retained (to the extent not utilized to satisfy valid claims for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_), the Purchaser and
the Sellers Representative shall provide a joint written instruction to the
Escrow Agent to deliver such amount promptly from the Indemnification Escrow
Account by wire transfer of immediately available funds and such amount shall
be deemed to have become Indemnification Escrow Remainder and shall be paid
to each Seller in accordance with the process set forth in the preceding
sentence and the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 

Section 10.11 _Exclusive Remedy_.

 

(a) The sole and exclusive remedy for all Claims arising under, out of, or
related to this Agreement (including for any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty in the Agreement or any certificate or other
document delivered by a party in accordance with this Agreement or any breach
or failure to perform any covenant in this Agreement or in any certificate or
other document delivered under the terms of this Agreement) is the
indemnification set forth in this _ARTICLE X_ and each party hereby waives, to
the full extent it may do so, any other rights or remedies that may arise
under any applicable Law, except (i) with respect to claims for injunctive
relief or specific enforcement made with respect to breaches of any covenant
or agreement contained in this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, (ii) as
provided in _ARTICLE VII_ with respect to certain Tax matters and (iii) in
the event of fraud.

(b) This _Section 10.11_, together with the other provisions of this 
_ARTICLE X_ , was specifically bargained for among the Purchaser and the
Sellers in arriving at the Purchase Price. In agreeing to the Purchase Price
and in agreeing to provide the specific representations and warranties set
forth in this Agreement and in the Escrow Agreement, the Sellers and the
Purchaser have specifically relied upon this _Section 10.11_ and the
limitations on remedies provided in this _ARTICLE X_.

 

Section 10.12 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Any indemnification
payments made pursuant to this Agreement will be treated as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price, unless determined otherwise by a final Taxing Authority
determination. This _Section 10.12_ will not require any party to appeal a
final Taxing Authority determination or enter into litigation.

(b) either the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) or the
Purchaser if the Closing has not occurred by the close of business on October
27, 2014 (the " _End Date_ "), and the failure to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby on or before such date did not result from the failure by
the party seeking termination of this Agreement to fulfill any undertaking or
commitment provided for herein that is required to be fulfilled prior to the
Closing;

(c) by Purchaser, if a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of the Sellers set forth herein will have occurred, is
not cured within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof from Purchaser
to the Sellers Representative, would cause the conditions set forth in
_ARTICLE VIII_ hereof not to be satisfied, and such condition will be
incapable of being satisfied by the End Date;

 

(d) by the Sellers Representative, if a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Purchaser set forth herein

thereof from the Sellers to the Purchaser, would cause the conditions set
forth in _ARTICLE IX_ hereof not to be satisfied, and such condition will be
incapable of being satisfied by the End Date; or

(e) either the Sellers Representative or the Purchaser if a court of
competent jurisdiction or any other Governmental Authority will have issued
an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated hereby and
such order, decree, ruling or other action will have become final and non-
appealable.

(f) by the Purchaser prior to 5:00 p.m. Central time on September 8, 2014,

is not satisfied by 5:00 p.m. Central Time on September 5, 2014.

 

Section 11.2 _Procedure and Effect of Termination_. In the event of
termination of this Agreement, pursuant to  _Section 11.1_, written notice
thereof will forthwith be given by the terminating party to the other party
specifying the basis for such termination, and this Agreement will thereupon
terminate and become void and have no effect, and the transactions
contemplated hereby will be abandoned without further action by the parties,
except that the provisions of _Section 12.3_ will survive the termination of
this Agreement; provided, however, that termination of this Agreement will
not relieve any party of any liability for any breach occurring prior to the
termination.

Section 12.5 _Forum_.

 

(a) For any Claim, demand, action, cause of action, proceeding, or
counterclaim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, to the
maximum extent permitted under applicable law, each party irrevocably
consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of the Chancery of the
State of Delaware; provided that if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not
have jurisdiction, any Claim, demand, action, cause of action, proceeding or
counterclaim shall be brought exclusively in the United States District Court
for the District of Delaware or any other court of the State of Delaware. A
final judgment rendered by such courts with respect to any such Claim,

conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law.

 



53 (b) To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, each party
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of Claim, demand, action, cause of
action, proceeding, or counterclaim arising out of or relating to this
Agreement in the applicable courts set forth in  _Section 12.5(a)_. To the

of such action or proceeding in such court.

 

Section 12.6 _Jury Trial Waiver_. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH
PARTY HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY, AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, CAUSE OF ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR
COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT. ANY SUCH CLAIM,
DEMAND, ACTION, CAUSE OF ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM MUST BE
DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY. ANY PARTY MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS
AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE THE PARTIES HAVE WAIVED THEIR
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 

Section 12.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits,
Annexes and Schedules thereto), together with the Confidentiality Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement, embodies the parties completely integrated
agreement and supersedes all other agreements.

 

Section 12.8 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended only by a separate
written instrument identified as an amendment to this Agreement and duly
signed and delivered by all parties.

Section 12.9 _Waivers_. Any party may waive another partys breach of or
compliance with this Agreement, but any waiver must be in a writing signed by
the waiving party. A partys waiver does not waive any other earlier,
concurrent, or later breach or compliance.

 

Section 12.10 _Severability_. The parties intend this Agreement be fully
enforced wherever a party seeks to enforce it. If a Governmental Authority or
arbitrator finds any provision unenforceable in a particular jurisdiction,
then the following will apply:

(a) the Governmental Authority or arbitrator considering the matter may amend
the unenforceable provision to the least extent necessary to make it
enforceable;

 

(b) if an unenforceable provision cannot be reformed under this _Section
12.10_, then that provision is ineffective in that jurisdiction, but only to
the least extent necessary to make the rest of this Agreement enforceable
there; and

(c) reforming any provision must not affect the rest of this Agreement and
must not prevent the affected provision  as originally written  from being
enforced elsewhere.

 

Section 12.11 _No Presumption from Authorship_. The parties negotiated this
Agreement at arms length, jointly participated in drafting it, and received
advice from independent legal counsel before they signed it. Accordingly, any
court or other Governmental Authority or arbitrator construing or interpreting
this Agreement will do so as if the parties jointly drafted it and will not
apply any presumption, rule of construction, or burden of proof favoring or
disfavoring a party because that party (or any of its representatives) drafted
any part of this Agreement.

 



54 Section 12.12 _Time of Performance_. Whenever the last day or only day for
performing under this Agreement falls on a non Business Day, the date for
performing extends to the next succeeding Business Day.

Section 12.13  _Assignment_.

(a) _General._ Except as provided in _Section 12.13(b)_, without the prior
written consent of each party to this Agreement, no party may, in any way,
transfer any of its rights under this Agreement or delegate any performance
under this Agreement. This _Section 12.13(a)_ prohibits all transfers of any
rights under this Agreement and all delegations of any performance under this
Agreement, however accomplished, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, whether
by assignment, merger, consolidation, dissolution, operation of law, change of
control, or any other means. The Purchaser or the Sellers, in such partys or
parties sole discretion, may withhold consent under this _Section 12.13(a)_
for any reason or no reason. Any purported transfer of rights or delegation of
performance violating this  _Section 12.13(a)_ is void.

(b) _Exceptions_. The Purchaser and its Affiliates may transfer its rights
under this Agreement to any one or more of the following: (i) a buyer of all
or substantially all of the Purchasers assets or capital stock, (ii) a buyer
of all or substantially all of Purchasers parent entitys assets or capital
stock, or (iii) any Affiliate of the Purchaser; provided, that in each case,
the Purchaser remains the primary obligor for any obligations under this
Agreement. The Purchaser may (and after the Closing, the Company may) assign
to its financing sources as collateral security any or all of its interests
in this Agreement and in the Escrow Agreement.

Section 12.14 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement binds the parties as
well as their successors and, subject to _Section 12.13_, permitted assigns.

 

Section 12.15 _Third-party Beneficiaries_. _ARTICLE X_ confers rights and
remedies upon each of the Sellers and Purchaser Indemnified Party, and each
of them is an intended third party beneficiary of _ARTICLE X_. No Person other
than the parties to this Agreement and such Persons described in the preceding
sentences has any rights or remedies under this Agreement. The parties
reserve the right and power to amend or terminate this Agreement without the
consent of any Person who is not a party to this Agreement.

 

Section 12.16 _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when reasonably
requested by any party hereto and at such partys expense, any other party
will sign and deliver to the other parties any additional documents and will
take any other lawful action that any other party may reasonably request to
carry out the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 12.17 _Counterparts_. The parties may sign this Agreement in multiple
counterparts. Each signed counterpart is considered an original document, but
all signed counterparts, when taken together, constitute one original
document. A party may effectively deliver that partys signed counterpart of
this Agreement by facsimile or by e-mail of a non-editable PDF copy.

 



55 Section 12.18 _Specific Performance_. The parties confirm that the Membership
Interests are unique property and that no adequate remedy at Law exists for
the damage that any of them might sustain for another partys failing to
consummate the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Accordingly, if any party materially breaches any of its
obligations under this Agreement, the non breaching party may seek to obtain a
decree of specific performance requiring the breaching party to fulfill its
obligations under this Agreement. The party seeking specific performance need
not post any bond or other security or show actual damages.
