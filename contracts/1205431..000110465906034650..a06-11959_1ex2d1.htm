deposit in trust additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient to make all
such payments.

  

### (b) _Exchange Procedures_.

  

#### (i) No later than five Business Days following the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Cash Merger Shares (collectively, the "
**Certificates** "), whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted
pursuant to Section 3.1(c) into the right to receive the Cash Merger
Consideration, (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify, among other
things, that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon actual deliv­ery of the Certificates to
the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in customary form), and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for payment of the Cash Merger Consideration.

  

#### (ii) Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be reasonably appointed by the
Surviving Corporation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereon, together
with any other items specified by the letter of transmittal or otherwise
reasonably required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive, within five Business Days of the surrender of such
Certificate, in exchange therefor, the Cash Merger Consideration for each
Cash Merger Share represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until so surrendered, each
Certificate shall be deemed, for all purposes, to evidence only the right to
receive upon surrender of such Certificate the Cash Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof to which the holder thereof is entitled
pursuant to Section 3.1(c) and this Section 3.2. No interest will be paid or
will accrue in respect of any cash payable upon the surrender of any
Certificate.

  

#### (iii) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
then, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Cash Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof to

     

   

#### which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Section 3.1(c) and this
Section 3.2;  _provided_ , that Parent may require the Person to whom any
such Cash Merger Consideration is to be paid, as a condi­tion precedent to
the payment thereof, to give the Surviving Corporation a bond in such sum as
it may direct or otherwise indemnify the Surviving Corporation in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to Parent against any claim that may be made against
the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Certificate claimed to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

#### (iv) If payment of Cash Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered
on the books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered be properly endorsed or be otherwise in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid
any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of Cash Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. Each
of the Paying Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted and withheld, from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder or former holder of Cash Merger Shares such amounts as may be
required to be deducted and withheld therefrom under the Code or any other
applicable Law relating to Taxes. To the extent such amounts are so deducted
or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid and shall be paid to the appropriate Governmental
Entity on behalf of such Person.

  

#### (v) The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses of the
Paying Agent in connection with the exchange of the Cash Merger Consideration
for the Cash Merger Shares.

  

### (c) _No Further Transfer or Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_.
From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed with respect to Company Common Stock and there shall be no
further registration of transfers of the Company Common Stock on the records
of the Surviving Corporation or its transfer agent and, if any Certificates
are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article III, subject to
applicable Law in the case of Appraisal Shares. All Cash Merger Consideration
paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
Article III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Company Common Stock exchanged for Cash Merger
Consideration theretofore represented by such Certificates.

  

### (d) _Termination of Fund; No Liability_. At any time following the date
which is the eighteen month anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall
be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including
any and all interest and other income received with respect thereto) that had
been made available to the Paying Agent and that have not been disbursed to
holders of Certificates, and thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to
look solely to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws) with respect to the Cash Merger Consideration payable upon due
surrender of their Certificates, without any interest thereon; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such holders shall have no greater rights against Parent
than may be accorded to general creditors of Parent under applicable Law. Any
portion of the

     

   

### Payment Fund remaining unclaimed as of a date which is immediately prior
to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Government Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
Parent nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for any amounts
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Laws.

  

## Section 3.3 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Appraisal Shares shall not be converted into or represent
the right to receive Cash Merger Consideration in accordance with Sections
3.1(c) and 3.2, but rather each of the Appraisal Shares shall represent only
the right to receive payment of the appraised value of such Appraisal Shares
in accordance with applicable provisions of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_
, that if any holder of Appraisal Shares shall (a) fail to properly perfect
its appraisal rights as provided in the DGCL, or (b) otherwise shall
waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under the DGCL, then such
Appraisal Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for, the right to
receive Cash Merger Consideration otherwise payable in accordance with
Sections 3.1(c) and 3.2, without any interest thereon. The Company shall give
Parent (a) prompt written notice of any demand for appraisal received by the
Company, the withdrawal of any such demand, and any other notice or
instrument delivered or served relating to appraisal or dissenters rights
pursuant to the DGCL, and (b) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any demand for appraisal under
the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), (a) make any payment with respect to any demand for appraisal, (b)
offer to settle or settle any such demand for appraisal, (c) waive any
failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal in accordance with
the DGCL, or (d) agree to do any of the foregoing.

  

## Section 3.4 _Stock Options_. The Company shall take all requisite actions
so that each outstanding Option (whether or not then vested or exercisable)
granted under the Stock Plan or otherwise, shall be cancelled as of the
Effective Time, and each such outstanding Option shall represent solely the
right to receive, in accordance with this Section 3.4, a cash payment in the
amount of the Option Consideration (as defined below), if any, with respect
to such Option and shall no longer represent the right to purchase Company
Common Stock or any other equity securities of the Company, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any other Person or any other consideration. Each
holder of an Option shall receive from the Surviving Corporation, in respect
and in consideration of each Option so cancelled, as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time (but in any event not later than five Business
Days), an amount (net of applicable withholding Taxes) equal to the excess,
if any, of (a) the Cash Merger Consideration over (b) the exercise price per
share of such Option, multiplied by the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Option, without any interest thereon (the "
**Option Consideration** "). In the event that the exercise price per share
of such Option is equal to or greater than the Cash Merger Consideration,
such Option shall be cancelled without consideration and have no further
force or effect. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, payment of Option Consideration to be made pursuant to this Section
3.4 following the Effective Time may be withheld in respect of any Option
until a written acknowledgement, in a form mutually agreed to by Parent and
the Company, is obtained from the holder of such Option.

     

   

## Section 3.5 _Further Assurances_. If at any time after the Effective Time
the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any agreements,
documents, deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts
or things are necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm,
of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation, its right, title or
interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises,
properties or assets of either of the constituent corporations in the Merger,
or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving
Corporation and its proper officers and directors or their designees are
hereby authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either
of the constituent corporations in the Merger, all such deeds, bills of sale,
assignments and assurances and do, in the name and on behalf of such
constituent corporations, all such other acts and things necessary, desirable
or proper, consistent with the terms of this Agreement and applicable Law, to
vest, perfect or confirm its right, title or interest in, to or under any of
the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of
such constituent corporations and otherwise to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement.

  

# ARTICLE IV

  

# REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  

The Company has delivered to Parent a Disclosure Letter, dated the date
hereof (the " **Company Disclosure Letter** "), the receipt of which has been
acknowledged in writing thereon by Parent. The Company Disclosure Letter is
arranged in sections and subsections corresponding to the sections and
subsections of this Article IV, but to the extent it is reasonably apparent
from a reading of any disclosures contained therein that such disclosures
also qualify or apply to any other representations or warranties, then such
disclosures shall be deemed to modify such other representations and
warranties. The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger
Subsidiary, except as expressly set forth in the corresponding sections and
subsections of the Company Disclosure Letter, as follows:

  

## Section 4.1 _Organization and Qualification_. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is an entity duly organized, validly existing and, except as set

assets and to carry on its business as currently conducted and as
currently contemplated. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed to do business, and is in corporate good standing as a
foreign entity, in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties or
assets owned, operated and leased or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or
licensed or in good standing has not resulted and would not reasonably be
expected to result, individually or in the aggregate, in a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Company has, prior to the date of this Agreement,
delivered to Parent true, complete and correct copies of the Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and the Bylaws of the
Company and the comparable governing documents of each of the Companys
Subsidiaries, in each case as amended and in full force and effect as of the

stock of, or other equity interests in, the Company or any of its

such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or will result in, or is reasonably
likely to result in, a Superior Proposal from the party that made the

Parent promptly following (and in no event later than twenty-four hours
after) the taking by it of any such action.

letter of intent or arrangement with respect to such Superior Proposal, as
applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this sentence, and any purported termination

hours) notify (which notice shall be provided orally and in writing and shall
identify the Person making the Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry regarding
the making of an Acquisition Proposal and set forth in reasonable detail its
material terms and conditions) Parent after receipt of an Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiry regarding the making of an Acquisition Proposal and
thereafter shall keep Parent fully informed of the status and material terms
and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall make available
to Parent (to the extent it has not already done so) all material non-public
information made available to any Person making an Acquisition Proposal at
substantially the same time as it provides it to such other Person.

  

### (e) Prior to taking any of the actions referred to in Section 6.3(a), the
Company shall promptly (but in any event within twenty-four hours) notify
Parent orally and in writing of any action it proposes to take with respect

promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of the status of such action as
developments arise or as requested by Parent. Without limiting the foregoing,
at least three business days prior to taking any of the actions referred to
in Section 6.3(b), the Company shall notify Parent of any such action it
proposes to take and, during such three business day period, the Companys
Board of Directors shall negotiate in good faith with Parent with respect to
any revised proposal to acquire the Company Common Stock that Parent may
make during such three business day period.

  

### (f) From the date of this Agreement, until the earlier of the Effective

such agreements, including, but not limited to, seeking injunctions to
prevent any breaches of such agreements or to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions thereof in a court in the United States or any state thereof
having jurisdiction.

until the earlier of the Effective Date or the date that this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Article VIII, and subject to the requirements

of their respective Representatives, to give Parent and its Representatives
reasonable access, upon reasonable notice and during the Companys normal
business hours, to the offices and other facilities, to the senior officers,
and to the books and records of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries,
except to the extent any such disclosure to Parent and its Representatives
would reasonably be expected to result in a waiver of the privilege attached
to attorney-client communications (including work product). Parent and Merger
Subsidiary, and their Affiliates and Representatives will hold any such
information that is nonpublic in confidence in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement. No information or knowledge obtained in any
investigation pursuant to this Section 6.4 or otherwise shall affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement
or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties to consummate the
Transactions.

actions and/or, prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Company
Stockholders, may modify or change all or any portion of the recommendation
to the Company Stockholders set forth in this Section 6.5.

reasonable assistance to Parent and its Representatives in furtherance

to the Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement prior to consulting with and obtaining the
prior consent of the other Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , that a Party may, without consulting
with or obtaining the prior consent of the other Party, issue such press
release or make such public statement as may be required by applicable Law or
by any listing agreement with a national securities exchange or automated
quotation system to which Parent (or an Affiliate thereof) or the Company, as
the case may be, is a party, if such Party has used commercially reasonable
efforts to consult with the other Party and to obtain such other Partys
consent, but has been unable to do so in a timely manner.

  

## Section 6.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give
prompt written notice to Parent and Parent shall give prompt written notice
to the Company, of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event known to
such Party, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which has resulted in, or is
reasonably likely to result in, any representation or warranty set forth in
this Agreement made by such Party to be untrue or inaccurate (taking into
account any materiality qualification, to the extent applicable) which would
cause the failure of either of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.2(a) or
7.3(a) to be satisfied, (b) any failure by such Party to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it hereunder which would cause the failure of either of the conditions set
forth in Sections 7.2(a) or 7.3(a) to be satisfied, or (c) any action, suit,
proceeding, inquiry or investigation pending or, to the Knowledge of such
Party, threatened which questions or challenges or relates to this Agreement

shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the
Party receiving such notice and that no such notification shall modify the
representations or warranties of any Party or the conditions to the
obligations of any Party hereunder.

  

## Section 6.10 _Subsequent Filings_. Until the Effective Time, the Company
will timely file with the SEC each Subsequent Filing required to be filed by
the Company and will promptly deliver to Parent and Merger Subsidiary copies
of each such Subsequent Filing. Each of the audited consolidated financial
statements and unaudited interim financial statements (including, in each

with, the books and records of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries,

recurring year-end adjustments which will not be expected to be material in
amount.

## Section 6.12 _Indemnification of Officers and Directors; Exculpation_.

  

### (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any officer or director
may have under any Benefit Plan, the Companys Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or Bylaws, or any indemnification
agreement between the Company and its directors and officers in effect as of
the date hereof, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each present
(as of the Effective Time) and former officer or director of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (each, an " **Indemnified Party** " and,
collectively, the " **Indemnified Parties** "), against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs
and expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of actions
taken by them in their capacity as officers or directors at or prior to the
Effective Time (including, to the extent indemnifiable thereunder, this
Agreement and the Transactions (including, without limitation, pursuant to
Section 6.16 hereof)), or taken by them at the request of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law for
a period of six years from the Effective Time. Each Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation from the Surviving Corporation
within ten Business Days of receipt by the Surviving Corporation from the
Indemnified Party of a request therefor; _provided_ , _however_ , that

     

   

### 

  

any Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking
to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not
entitled to indemnification. The Surviving Corporation shall not settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any proceeding or
threatened action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim and in which
indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder, without
the consent of such Indemnified Party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless such
settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such action, suit,
proceeding, investigation or claim.

  

### (b) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation (or any successor to the Surviving Corporation) will contain
provisions with respect to exculpation, indemnification and the advancement
of expenses that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as
those contained in the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as
amended, and Bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date hereof, which
provisions will not, except as required by applicable Law, be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any Indemnified Party unless the Surviving Corporation
(or any successor to the Surviving Corporation) provides other assurance
sufficient to ensure the continued exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses of the Indemnified Parties for six years to the
fullest extent of the law as provided in such Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and Bylaws prior to any
such amendment, repeal or modification.

  

### (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (and if it is unable
to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to)
obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at
least six years from the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with
respect to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance with benefits and levels of coverage at least as
favorable as the Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing
or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with
this Agreement or the Transactions); _provided_ that the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the cost of such "tail" insurance
policy (it being understood that the Company shall not be required to accept
a reduction in the quality of the insurer providing such policy or the scope
of the coverage of such policy as compared to the Companys existing insurer
and policy); and _provided_ , _further_ , that the cost of such "tail"
insurance policy shall not exceed 300% of the current annual premiums paid by
the Company for such insurance (the " **D andO Cap**"). If the Company and the
Surviving Corporation cannot obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the
Effective Time for less than the DandO Cap, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain a "tail" insurance policy providing benefits and
levels of coverage that are available for the amount of the DandO Cap. The
Surviving Corporation shall honor and perform under all indemnification
agreements entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries set forth
in Section 6.12(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  

### (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or
after the Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified Party or any other
party covered by directors and officers liability insurance, on or prior to
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this

     

   

### 

  

Section 6.12 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

  

### (e) This Section 6.12 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and personal
representatives and shall be binding on Parent and the Surviving Corporation
and their respective successors and assigns. In the event Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or its successor or assign (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successor and assign of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, honor the
obligations set forth with respect to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, in this Section 6.12. The indemnification provided for
herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an
Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or
otherwise. Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall pay all reasonable, documented
out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be
incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and
other obligations provided in this Section 6.12.

  

## Section 6.13 _Employee Benefits_. The employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (the " **Retained Employees** ") shall, to the extent permitted
by any underlying insurance carrier or service provider, be provided credit
for all service with the Company or its Subsidiaries to the same extent as
such service was credited for such purpose by the Company or its
Subsidiaries, under all benefit plans of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual. The Surviving
Corporation shall give credit to each Retained Employee for earned but unused
vacation and accrued vacation. From and after the Effective Time, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations, actively-at-work
requirements and eligibility waiting periods (to the extent that such waiting
periods would be applicable) under any group health plan of the Surviving
Corporation or Parent to be waived with respect to Retained Employees and
their dependents, and (ii) give each Retained Employees credit for the plan
year in which the Effective Time occurs towards applicable deductibles and
annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses incurred prior to the
Effective Time for which payment has been made. This Section 6.13 is not
intended to confer upon any person other than the Parties any rights or
remedies.

  

## Section 6.14 _Modification of Debt Commitment Letter_. Parent shall
promptly forward to the Company a copy of all credit documentation (excluding
any fee letters which, by their terms, are confidential) prepared pursuant to
the Debt Commitment Letter. From and after the date hereof until the Closing,
Parent shall not amend, modify or supplement, or permit the amendment,
modification or supplementation of, the Debt Commitment Letter in a manner
that would materially impair, delay or prevent the consummation of the
Transactions without the Companys prior written consent. Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to (a) satisfy on a timely basis all material
terms, conditions, representations and warranties applicable to Parent set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter; (b) negotiate definitive agreements with
respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter or on other terms acceptable to Parent and not in violation
of this Section 6.14; and (c) enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment
Letter. Parent shall furnish correct and complete copies of all such
definitive

     

   

## 

  

agreements (excluding any fee letters which, by their terms, are
confidential) to the Company promptly upon their execution. If any portion of
the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions described
above, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative
financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the
Transactions (on terms and conditions that are no less favorable from the
standpoint of the Company than the terms and conditions as set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter). Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall keep the Company
promptly apprised of material developments of which Parent and
Merger Subsidiary become aware relating to the Debt Financing, including any
breach by any party or any termination of the Debt Commitment Letter or any
other document relating to the Debt Financing.

  

## Section 6.15 _Conveyance Taxes_. The Parties shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or
gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp Taxes, any
transfer, recording, registration and other fees or any similar Taxes which
become payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
the Transactions contemplated hereby that are required or permitted to be
filed on or before the Effective Time, and the Party incurring such Taxes and
fees shall be solely responsible for paying any such Taxes and fees.

  

## Section 6.16 _Company 401(k) Plan_. At Parents request, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the Companys Board of Directors shall adopt
resolutions terminating the Companys 401(k) Plan (the " **401(k)
Plan**") effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. Following the
Effective Time, the Retained Employees shall be entitled to participate in
the 401(k) plan sponsored by Parent.

  

## Section 6.17 _Freely Available Cash_. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts, subject to Section 6.1 above, to maximize the amount of
Freely Available Cash for use in connection with the consummation of the
Merger.

necessary in order for the Board of Directors of the Company to comply with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Company may
not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(f) if (i) such

cured prior to the twentieth business day following receipt by the Company of
written notice of such breach from Parent; or

  

### (i) by the Company, if any representation or warranty on the part of

that (i) none of Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of their respective
Affiliates shall be liable in connection with any such termination of this
Agreement in an amount in excess of ten percent (10%) of the sum of the Cash

liable in connection with any such termination of this Agreement in an amount
in excess of six percent (6%) of the sum of the Cash Merger Consideration and
the Option Consideration (less any amounts paid by such Party pursuant to

## Section 8.3 _Fees and Expenses; Termination Fee_.

  

### (a) Except as set forth in Section 8.2 and this Section 8.3, all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions
shall be paid by the Party incurring such fees and expenses, whether or not

### (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
8.1(d) or Section 8.1(h) (and, in the case of a termination pursuant to
Section 8.1(h), the breach giving rise to Parents right to terminate this
Agreement was either (i) a breach of a covenant or (ii) a willful and
material breach of a representation or warranty), the Company shall pay
Parent (by wire transfer of immediately available funds), concurrently with
(and as a condition to) such termination in the event of a termination by the
Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or within one Business Day following a
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) or by Parent
pursuant to Section 8.1(d), an amount equal to the Expenses of Parent, Merger
Subsidiary and their respective Affiliates, not to exceed $3.5 million (the "
**Company Expense Reimbursement** ").

  

### (c) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to Section 8.1(f), by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or by the
Company for any reason at any time after Parent becomes entitled to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e), or (ii) (A) an Acquisition
Proposal has been made, proposed, communicated or disclosed or a Person has
indicated an intention (whether or not conditional) to make, propose,
communicate or disclose an Acquisition Proposal, (B) solely with respect to a
termination pursuant to Section 8.1(d), such Acquisition Proposal or
indication of intention has been made publicly, (C) such Acquisition Proposal
or indication of intention is not withdrawn at least three Business Days
prior to the event giving rise to a right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(b), Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(h), (D) this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b), Section 8.1(d) or Section
8.1(h) and (E) solely with respect to a termination

     

   

### pursuant to Section 8.1(d), within twelve months following the date of
such termination, the Company enters into any contract or agreement relating
to, or consummates, any Acquisition Proposal, then in any such event Parent
shall be entitled to receive from the Company, as liquidated damages and not
as a penalty, an amount equal to four percent (4%) of the sum of the Cash
Merger Consideration and the Option Consideration less the amount of the
Company Expense Reimbursement, if any, actually paid pursuant to Section
8.3(b) (the " **Company Termination Fee** "). The Company Termination Fee
shall be paid concurrently with (and as a condition to) any termination of
this Agreement by the Company giving rise to the payment of such Company
Termination Fee or within one Business Day following a termination of this
Agreement by Parent giving rise to the payment of such Company Termination
Fee.

  

### (d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company
pursuant to Section 8.1(b) and, at the time of such termination, all of the
conditions set forth in Article VII, other than such conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, have been satisfied, or (ii) by
the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(i), then the Company shall be entitled to
receive from Parent an amount equal to four percent (4%) of the sum of the
Cash Merger Consideration and the Option Consideration (the " **Parent
Termination Fee** ");  _provided_ , that the Parent Termination Fee shall be
an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the sum of the Cash Merger
Consideration and the Option Consideration, as liquidated damages and not as
a penalty, in the event that at the time of termination there has been a
failure to receive the proceeds of the Debt Financing (or an alternative
financing as contemplated by Section 6.14) to the extent such failure arose
out of or resulted from an act, omission, change, event, development,
circumstance or occurrence of or with respect to Parent or any of its
Affiliates. The Parent Termination Fee shall be paid within one Business Day
following a termination of this Agreement by the Company giving rise to the
payment of such Parent Termination Fee.

  

### (e) The Company and Parent acknowledge that the Company Termination Fee
and the Parent Termination Fee provided for in this Section 8.3 is an
integral part of the Transactions and not a penalty, and that, without the
Company Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee provided for above,
neither the Company, Parent nor Merger Subsidiary would enter into this
Agreement.

  

## Section 8.4 _Amendment_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by the Parties, by action taken or authorized by
their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of
the matters presented in connection with the Transactions by the Company
Stockholders; _provided_ , that after any such approval, no amendment shall
be made that, by applicable Law, requires further approval by such Company
Stockholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

  

## Section 8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the Parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein
or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with
any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the
part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of

     

   

## such Party. The failure of any Party to assert any of its rights under
this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

Any Party may give any notice or other communication hereunder using any
other means (including personal delivery, messenger service, facsimile or
ordinary mail), but no such notice or other communication shall be deemed to
have been duly given unless and until it actually is received by the Party
for whom it is intended. Any Party may change the address to which notices
and other communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other
Parties to this Agreement notice in the manner herein set forth.

  

## Section 9.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Company
Disclosure Letter and the other documents and instruments referred to herein
that are to be delivered at the Closing) and the Confidentiality Agreement,
constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties and supersedes any prior
understandings, agreements or representations by or among the Parties, or any
of them, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

  

## Section 9.4 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except for the provisions of
Section 6.12, this Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to
confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, to create any agreement of
employment with any Person or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary
hereto.

     

   

## 

  

## Section 9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated,
in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the Parties
without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void;
_provided_ that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign its rights
and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part,
(a) to one or more of their Affiliates so long as it remains primarily
obligated with respect to any such delegated obligation or (b) to its or its
Affiliates lenders as collateral security. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

  

## Section 9.6 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement
to Sections, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words

## Section 9.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when two or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties.

  

## Section 9.8 _Severability_. If any term, provision, agreement, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Entity to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder
of the terms, provisions, agreements, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the Transactions are not effected in any manner materially adverse to any
Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties
as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in
an acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent.

  

## Section 9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware
(without reference to its choice of law rules).

  

## Section 9.10 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each Party hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees that any action, suit or proceeding, at Law or
equity, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any agreements or
transactions contemplated hereby shall only be brought in any federal court
of the State of Delaware or the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware,
and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally expressly submits to the personal
jurisdiction and venue of such courts for the purposes thereof and hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives (by way of motion, as a defense or
otherwise) any and all jurisdictional, venue and convenience objections
or defenses that such party may have in such action, suit or proceeding.
Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to the service of
process of any of the aforementioned courts, in the manner provided for
notice in Section 9.2 or otherwise. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed
to affect the right of any Party to serve

     

   

## 

  

## process in any manner permitted by Law or commence legal proceedings or
otherwise proceed against any other Party in any other jurisdiction to
enforce judgments obtained in any action, suit or proceeding brought pursuant
to this Section 9.10.

  

## Section 9.11 _Remedies; Specific Performance_. The Parties acknowledge
that money damages would not be an adequate remedy at Law if any Party fails
to perform in any material respect any of its obligations hereunder and
accordingly agree that each Party, in addition to any other remedy to which
it may be entitled at Law or in equity shall, subject to Section 9.10, be
entitled to seek to compel specific performance of the obligations of
any other Party under this Agreement, without the posting of any bond,
in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement in any court of
the United States or any State thereof having jurisdiction, and if any
action should be brought in equity to enforce any of the provisions of this
Agreement, none of the Parties hereto shall raise the defense that there is
an adequate remedy at Law. No remedy shall be exclusive of any other remedy
and all available remedies shall be cumulative.

  

## Section 9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUBSIDIARY,
AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER SUBSIDIARY, OR THE
COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF
THIS AGREEMENT.
