into the Company (the "Merger") in accordance with this Agreement and the

of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist as a separate corporate entity,
and the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

 

B.The respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
have approved this Agreement and approved the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Agreement

 

The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

 

    

Section 1.

 |  

Description of Transaction 

---|--- 

 

1.1Merger of Merger Sub into the Company

 

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company, and the separate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease. The Company will continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger
(the "Surviving Corporation").

 

1.2Effect of the Merger

 

The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the
applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, except as otherwise
agreed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, all of the property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

1.3Closing; Effective Time

 

The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Closing") shall take place at the Company's offices, at 7:00 a.m. San
Francisco time on a date to be designated by the Company (the "Closing Date"),
which shall be no later than the second Business Day after the satisfaction or
waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the

 

1.

 

 

 ~~174046687 v20~~ 

 

conditions set forth in Section 6 (Conditions Precedent to Obligations of
Parent and Merger Sub) and Section 7 (Conditions Precedent to Obligation of
the Company) (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions); provided that if such Business Day would otherwise occur (a) on
or before July 31, 2018, then the Closing shall be delayed until July 31,
2018, and (b) after July 31, 2018 and on or between the 20th day and the last
day of a month, then the Closing shall be delayed until the last Business Day
of such month, in each case, so long as, as of the date the Closing would have
otherwise occurred but for the foregoing proviso (such date, the "Satisfaction
Date") (i) each party has delivered to the other party the certificates
required to be delivered by it pursuant to Section 6.9 (Conditions Precedent
to Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub) and Section 7.6 (Conditions Precedent
to Obligations of the Company), as applicable, and (ii) each party irrevocably
confirms in writing to the other party that the conditions in Section 6.1, 6.2
and 6.10 (Conditions Precedent to Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub) (in
the case of Parent) and Section 7.1 and 7.2 (Conditions Precedent to
Obligations of the Company) (in the case of the Company) have been satisfied
or are waived, that but for the passage of time until such date, there is no
other condition that is not then satisfied or waived nor any other bases then
available to rely on to refuse to close on such date and that it is ready,
willing and able to close on such date subject to the continued satisfaction
of the remaining conditions in Section 6 (Conditions Precedent to Obligations
of Parent and Merger Sub) (in the case of Parent) or Section 7 (Conditions
Precedent to Obligations of the Company) (in the case of the Company), as the
case may be; provided that between the Satisfaction Date and the Closing, the
Company shall not have materially breached its covenants and agreements set
forth in Section 4.2 (Conduct of the Business of the Company). Subject to the
provisions of this Agreement, a certificate of merger satisfying the
applicable requirements of the DGCL (the "Certificate of Merger") shall be
duly executed by the Company and, concurrently with or as soon as practicable
following the Closing (but no later than the Closing Date and no earlier than
the confirmation of receipt of the Payment Amount by the Payment Agent to
Parent and the Company), delivered to and filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective upon the date and time of the filing of such Certificate of Merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as
may be mutually agreed in writing by the Company and Parent and specified in
the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").

 

1.4Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers

 

(a)The certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated as of the Effective Time to conform to the certificate of

incorporation shall be amended to change the name of the Surviving Corporation
to "Counsyl, Inc."

 

(b)The bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated
immediately as of the Effective Time to conform to the bylaws of Merger Sub as

1.7Parent Stock Elections. 

 

(a)Each Company Stockholder, each holder of In-the-Money Options and each

forth in this Section 1.7, to submit an election in accordance with the
following procedures:

 

(i)Each Company Stockholder, holder of In-the-Money Options or holder of
Company RSUs may specify in a request made in accordance with this Section
1.7(a) (herein called an "Election") whether such Company Stockholder, holder
of In-the-Money Options or holder of Company RSUs desires to receive payment
of his, her or its respective portion of the Payment Amount in the form of (A)
100% shares of Parent Stock, (B) 100% cash or (C) a percentage specified by
the Company Stockholder, holder of In-the-Money Options or holder of Company
RSUs in shares of Parent Stock valued at the Parent Stock Price and the
balance in cash.

 

(ii)The Letter of Transmittal and the Election Form shall contain provisions
for the Company Stockholder, holder of In-the-Money Options or holder of
Company RSUs to make an Election, and the Company or the Payment Agent shall
provide Letters of Transmittal or the Election Form, as applicable, to the
Company Stockholders, holders of In-the-Money Options and holders of Company
RSUs promptly after the date hereof so as to permit such Company Stockholders,
holders of In-the-Money Options and holders of Company RSUs to exercise their
right to make an Election on or before the twentieth (20th) day after the date
hereof (the "Election Deadline"). In no event shall the Letter of Transmittal
and the Election Form be made initially available less than ten (10) days
prior to the Election Deadline.

 

(iii)Any Election shall have been made properly only if Parent shall have
received, by 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the date of the Election Deadline, a
Letter of Transmittal or an Election Form, as applicable, properly completed
and signed and, if applicable, accompanied by certificates representing shares
of Company Capital Stock to which such Letter of Transmittal relates. As the
Company Stockholders will be instructed to return any completed Letter of
Transmittal to the Payment Agent, Parent and the Company shall instruct the
Payment Agent to present all Letters of Transmittal received at the Election
Deadline to Parent promptly upon the occurrence of the Election Deadline. The
Company shall present all Election Forms received at the Election Deadline to
Parent promptly upon the occurrence of the Election Deadline.

 

(iv)Any Company Stockholder, holder of In-the-Money Options or holder of
Company RSUs may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, change or revoke
his, her or its Election by written notice received by Payment Agent or Parent
prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed
revised Letter of Transmittal or an Election Form, as applicable. If Parent
shall determine after reasonable consultation with the Company and Payment
Agent that any Election is not properly made or no Election was made with
respect to any shares of Company Capital Stock, such Company Stockholder,
holder of In-

 

6.

 

 

 ~~174046687 v20~~ 

 

the-Money Options or holder of Company RSUs shall be deemed to have elected to
receive 100% cash. 

 

(v)If Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement in accordance with
Section 9.1 (Termination), all Elections shall be revoked automatically, and
Parent and the Company shall promptly instruct the Payment Agent to return all
certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock, if any, to the
respective Company Stockholders.

 

(vi)Each holder of shares of Company Capital Stock, holder of In-the-Money
Options and holder of Company RSUs exchanged pursuant to the Merger that would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Stock
(after taking into account any Certificates delivered by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such
fractional part of a share of Parent Stock multiplied by the Parent Stock
Price, less any applicable withholding Taxes. No such holder will be entitled
to dividends, voting rights or any other rights as a stockholder in respect of
any fractional shares.

 

(b)Each share of Parent Stock issued hereunder shall be issued at a valuation,
solely for purposes of the distributions made hereunder equal to the Parent
Stock Price (it being understood and agreed that the actual trading price of
such shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date such shares are
delivered to the Company Stockholders, holders of In-the-Money Options and
holders of Company RSUs and each day thereafter may vary). The Company and
Parent each hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that the mere change in
the Parent Stock Price shall not give the Company, any Company Stockholder,
any holder of In-the-Money Options, any holder of Company RSUs or Parent any
right of recourse or a basis for the Company or Parent to avoid its
obligations to complete the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. Each Letter of Transmittal shall include an acknowledgement by the
Company Stockholder, holder of In-the-Money Options or holder of Company RSUs
electing to receive shares of Parent Stock that although the Parent Stock
Price is being used for all Parent Stock issued pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, it is likely that, due to the fact that the Parent Stock is traded
on a public market, which can be volatile and unpredictable, the actual value
of the Parent Stock on the date such shares are delivered to the Company
Stockholders, holders of In-the-Money Options and holders of Company RSUs may
differ from the Parent Stock Price.

 

(c)If, as a result of the Election process, the Company Stockholders, holders
of In-the-Money Options and holders of Company RSUs in the aggregate would
receive greater than 2,994,251 shares of Parent Stock, the Payment Agent and
Parent shall adjust the cash/stock Election of each Company Stockholder,
holder of In-the-Money Options and holder of Company RSUs as necessary, as
instructed by the Company and pro rata in accordance with the ownership of
shares of Company Capital Stock by each such Company Stockholder and shares of
Company Capital Stock subject to the In-the-Money Options and Company RSUs
held by such holders of In-the-Money Options and Company RSUs to ensure that
no more than 2,994,251 shares of Parent Stock is paid as the Closing Merger
Consideration Amount. The Letter of Transmittal shall include disclosure that
the Election is subject to adjustment as set forth in this Section 1.7(c).

 

7.

 

 

 ~~174046687 v20~~ 

 

(d)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no shares of
Parent Stock shall be payable to any Company Stockholder, holder of In-the-
Money Options or holder of Company RSUs who will not be an "accredited
investor" as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated
under the Securities Act as of the Effective Time (the "Unaccredited
Investors"), and each such Unaccredited Investor shall instead receive Merger
Consideration in the form of 100% cash. For purposes of this Agreement, all
holders of Company Capital Stock, In-the-Money Options or Company RSUs who
fail to return a questionnaire containing information used to determine
whether such holder is an "accredited investor" (an "Investor Questionnaire")
contained in the Letter of Transmittal or the Election Form, as applicable, or
otherwise fail to demonstrate on his, her or its Investor Questionnaire his,
her or its status as an "accredited investor" shall be deemed to be an
Unaccredited Investor.

 

1.8Payoff Letters

 

Prior to the Closing, the Company shall obtain payoff letters for the Closing
Date Indebtedness set forth on Section 1.8 of the Disclosure Schedule, which
shall provide the dollar amount and the payee of the applicable Closing Date
Indebtedness required to be paid in order to fully pay off such Closing Date
Indebtedness and release any related Liens as of the Closing (the "Payoff
Letters").

 

1.9Further Action

 

If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and
property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall take such action, so long as such
action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and all holders of certificates representing

and each certificate representing any such Company Capital Stock (a "Company

Section 1.5 (Conversion of Shares) (or if applicable, Section 1.14 (Appraisal
and Dissenters' Rights)), if any; and (b) the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Capital Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of

assisting the Securityholders' Representative and its representatives in their
review of the Closing Statement and the calculations contained therein. 

 

(c)If the Securityholders' Representative disagrees with the calculations in
the Closing Statement, the Securityholders' Representative shall notify Parent
of such disagreement in writing (the "Dispute Notice") no later than 45 days
after delivery of the Closing Statement. The Dispute Notice must set forth in
reasonable detail (A) any item on the Closing Statement that the
Securityholders' Representative believes has not been prepared in accordance
with this Agreement and the Securityholders' Representative's determination of
the amount of such item and (B) the Securityholders' Representative's

the failure of the Closing Date Net Working Capital, Final Net Working Capital
Adjustment, the Closing Date Cash Amount, the Closing Date Indebtedness or the
Closing Date Transaction Expenses to be calculated in accordance with this
Section 1.12 (Post Closing Adjustment to Closing Merger Consideration Amount),
the Accounting Principles and the definitions of such terms contained in this
Agreement (including the inclusion or exclusion of items in the definition and
the magnitude of the included or excluded items). Any item or amount that
Securityholders' Representative does not dispute in reasonable detail in the
Dispute Notice within such period shall be final, binding and conclusive for
all purposes hereunder. 

 

(d)In the event any such Dispute Notice is timely provided, Parent and
Securityholders' Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts for
a period of 15 days after the date of such Dispute Notice (or such longer
period as they may mutually agree) to resolve any disagreements with respect
to the calculations included in the Closing Statement that were disputed in
the Dispute Notice. If, at the end of such 15-day period (or such longer
period as mutually agreed), the Securityholders' Representative and Parent
remain unable to resolve the dispute in its entirety, then the unresolved
items and amounts thereof in dispute shall be submitted to KPMG US LLP, or if
such firm cannot or does not accept such engagement, another nationally
recognized accounting firm, reasonably acceptable to Parent and
Securityholders' Representative, which shall not be the independent
accountants of Parent or the Company (the "Dispute Auditor"). The Dispute
Auditor shall determine, based solely on the provisions of this Section 1.12
(Post Closing Adjustment to Closing Merger Consideration Amount), Accounting
Principles and the written presentations by Securityholders' Representative
and Parent, and not by independent review, only those items and amounts that
remain then in dispute as set forth in the Dispute Notice. 

 

(e)The Dispute Auditor's determination of the Closing Date Net Working
Capital, the Final Net Working Capital Adjustment, the Closing Date Cash
Amount, the Closing Date Indebtedness or the Closing Date Transaction
Expenses, as applicable, shall be made within 30 days after the dispute is
submitted for its determination and shall be set forth in a written statement
delivered to Securityholders' Representative and Parent. A judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction selected pursuant to Section 10.5 (Applicable
Law; Jurisdiction) hereof may be entered upon the Dispute Auditor's
determination; provided that no party shall make any filing to obtain such
judgment unless (i) the payment required by such determination shall not have
been made and (ii) 15 days shall have elapsed following delivery of the
Dispute Auditor's determination and; provided, further, that any filing to
obtain such judgment shall respect the confidential nature of the dispute
resolution process provided in this Section 1.12 (Post Closing Adjustment to
Closing Merger Consideration Amount) and shall disclose the details of the
dispute only to the extent necessary to obtain a judgment. The Dispute
Auditor shall have exclusive jurisdiction over, and resorting to the Dispute
Auditor as provided in this Section 1.12 (Post Closing Adjustment to Closing
Merger Consideration Amount) shall be the only recourse and remedy of the
parties against one another with respect to, those items and amounts that
remain in dispute under this Section 1.12 (Post Closing Adjustment to Closing
Merger Consideration Amount), and Parent shall not be entitled to seek
indemnification or recovery of any attorneys' fees or other professional fees
incurred by Parent in connection with any dispute governed by this Section
1.12 (Post Closing Adjustment to Closing Merger Consideration Amount). The
Dispute Auditor shall allocate its fees and expenses between Parent and

 

14.

 

 

 ~~174046687 v20~~ 

 

Securityholders' Representative (on behalf of the Participating
Securityholders) according to the degree to which the positions of the
respective parties are not accepted by the Dispute Auditor.

 

(f)The Securityholders' Representative and Parent shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates and representatives to, cooperate in good faith with the
Dispute Auditor, and shall give the Dispute Auditor access to all data and
other information it reasonably requests for purposes of such resolution. In
no event shall the decision of the Dispute Auditor assign a value to any item
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either Parent or
Securityholders' Representative or lesser than the smallest value for such
item claimed by either Parent or Securityholders' Representative. Any
determinations made by the Dispute Auditor pursuant to this Section 1.12 (Post
Closing Adjustment to Closing Merger Consideration Amount) shall be final,
non-appealable and binding on the parties hereto, absent manifest error or
common law fraud.

 

(g)"Adjustment Amount" shall mean the net amount, which may be positive or
negative, equal to: (i) (a) the amount of the Final Net Working Capital
Adjustment (based on the Closing Date Net Working Capital (as finally
determined in accordance with this Section 1.12 (Post Closing Adjustment to

Days after the final determination of the amount, Parent shall pay the
Adjustment Amount due to the Participating Securityholders that are holders of
Company Common Stock or Company Put Warrants, the Non-Employee Option Holders

such Participating Securityholders based on each such Participating
Securityholder's Ownership Percentage and (B) within one payroll period after
the final determination of the amount, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay the Adjustment Amount due to the Participating
Securityholders who are Employee Option Holders or Employee RSU Holders based

Matters). Parent and Securityholders' Representative also shall instruct the
Escrow Agent to release from the Adjustment Escrow the amount then remaining

instruct the Escrow Agent to pay the Adjustment Amount to Parent from the
Adjustment Escrow and release from the Adjustment Escrow any balance then
remaining in the Adjustment Escrow after payment of the Adjustment Amount to
Parent, if any, and pay such amount to the Payment Agent and the Surviving

(h)On the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the payment of: (i) the Estimated
Closing Date Transaction Expenses, if any, to the Persons identified on the

Indebtedness and the Closing Date Transaction Expenses shall be duplicative of
any other line item included in such other calculations.

shares of Company Capital Stock held by a holder who has made a demand for
appraisal of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and shares
of Company Capital Stock that, as of the Effective Time, constitute
"dissenting shares" within the meaning of Section 1300(b) of the California
Corporations Code (the "CCC") (any such shares being referred to as
"Dissenting Shares" until such time as such holder fails to perfect or
otherwise loses such holder's appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL
or Chapter 13 of the CCC with respect to such shares), will not be converted
into or represent the right to receive cash in accordance with Section 1.5
(Conversion of Shares), but will be converted into the right to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting
Shares pursuant to the DGCL or the CCC (and at the Effective Time, such
Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the rights set forth in Section 262 of the
DGCL or Chapter 13 of the CCC); provided, however, that if a holder of
Dissenting Shares (a "Dissenting Stockholder") withdraws, has failed to
perfect or otherwise loses such holder's demand for such payment and appraisal
or becomes ineligible for such payment and appraisal then, as of the later of
the Effective Time or the date on which such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws
such demand or otherwise becomes ineligible for such payment and appraisal,
such holder's Dissenting Shares will cease to be Dissenting Shares (and the
right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's Dissenting
Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL or Chapter 13 of the CCC will cease) and
will be converted into the right to receive a cash payment determined in
accordance with and subject to the provisions of Section 1.5 (Conversion of
Shares) upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares in
accordance with the terms of Section 1.11 (Exchange/Payment).

 

(b)The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of: (A) any written demand
received by the Company prior to the Effective Time for appraisal rights

delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL or
the CCC. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) make
any payment with respect to any such demands or offer to settle or settle any
such demands.

(a)Section 2.9(a) of the Disclosure Schedule identifies: (i) each item of
Registered IP that constitutes Owned Intellectual Property or that is
exclusively licensed to the Company; and (ii) the jurisdiction in which such
item of Registered IP has been registered or filed and the applicable
registration, application or serial number. Each such item of Registered IP,
other than any pending applications, is subsisting, enforceable and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, valid. The Company is the owner of record of each
item of Registered IP that constitutes Owned Intellectual Property. Section
2.9(a) of the Disclosure Schedule lists all filings, payments and other
actions required to be made or taken within 90 days after the Closing Date to
maintain each item of Registered IP. The Company has materially complied with
all the requirements of all United States and foreign patent offices and all

applications required to be listed in Section 2.9(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule (the "Company Patents") in full force and effect, including payment
of all required fees when due to such offices or agencies. The Company has
complied in all material respects with the duty of disclosure under applicable
U.S. Laws, and to the Company's Knowledge Laws outside the U.S., with respect

to invalidate the Company Patents or any claim thereof or would reasonably be
expected to render the Company Patents or any claim thereof invalid or
unenforceable.

 

(b)The Company has obtained from all parties (including employees) who have
created any portion of, or otherwise who would have any rights in or to, the
Owned Intellectual Property written assignments of any such Intellectual
Property to the Company on the form(s) of such assignments that the Company

Body, or any university, college or other academic institution (each, a
"University") were used in the development of any Company Patents or other
Owned Intellectual Property, and no Governmental Body or University, or
employee or staff member thereof has any rights in any Company Patents or
other Owned Intellectual Property.

 

(c)The Company has taken commercially reasonable measures to establish and
preserve its ownership of, and rights in, all Owned Intellectual Property,
other than such Owned Intellectual Property that the Company in its business
judgment elected to abandon or

 

26.

 

 

 ~~174046687 v20~~ 

 

publicly release. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company has not made
any of its material trade secrets or other confidential or proprietary
information that it intended to maintain as confidential (including source
code with respect to Company Intellectual Property) available to any other
Person except pursuant to written agreements requiring such Person to maintain
the confidentiality of such information.

 

(d)To the Company's Knowledge, there is no Intellectual Property owned by any
third party that (i) is valid and enforceable, (ii) is required by the Company
to conduct its business as currently conducted and (iii) the Company is not
currently authorized to use.

 

(e)Neither the Company nor the conduct of its business as currently conducted,
or as previously conducted since January 1, 2016, and to the Knowledge of the
Company, since January 1, 2013, infringes or misappropriates any Intellectual
Property rights of any third parties. Since January 1, 2016, and to the
Knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 2013, no Person has asserted any
written claim (or to the Company's Knowledge, made or threatened any other
claim) (i) challenging the Company's right, interest or title in any of the
Company Intellectual Property or (ii) alleging infringement or
misappropriation of any third party Intellectual Property by the Company.
None of the Company Intellectual Property is subject to any pending or
outstanding injunction, directive, order, judgment, or other disposition of
dispute that adversely restricts the use, transfer, registration or licensing
of any such Company Intellectual Property by the Company. The representations
in clause (d) and this clause (e) are the only representations by the Company
with respect to the infringement or alleged infringement by the Company of
third party Intellectual Property.

 

(f)To the Company's Knowledge, no Person has infringed or misappropriated, and
no Person is currently infringing or misappropriating, any material Company
Intellectual Property.

 

(g)Section 2.9(g)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule identifies each Contract
pursuant to which the Company is a licensee of, or is otherwise granted any
rights to use any Intellectual Property by, a third party (other than (A) non-
disclosure Contracts, (B) Contracts between the Company and its employees or
consultants under which the only grant of rights to the Company is the
assignment of Intellectual Property to the Company, (C) licenses to Publicly
Available Software and non-exclusive licenses to commercially available third
party software for less than $10,000 annually, (D) non-exclusive licenses with
vendors in the ordinary course of business that do not involve rights to
technology essential to the Company's business for which functionally
equivalent technology rights are not commercially available, and (E) any
Contract in connection with purchases of assays or other laboratory
consumables). Section 2.9(g)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule identifies each
Contract pursuant to which the Company is a licensor or otherwise grants any
rights to use any Company Intellectual Property to a third party (other than
(A) non-disclosure Contracts and (B) Contracts between Company and its
employees or consultants under which the only grant of rights by the Company
is a license to such employee or consultant solely to use Intellectual
Property to perform such employee's or consultant's obligations in accordance
with such Contract). Immediately following the Closing Date, the Surviving
Corporation will be permitted to exercise all of the rights of any member of
the Company under such Contracts to the same extent the Company would have
been able to had the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not occurred
and without the payment of any

 

27.

 

 

 ~~174046687 v20~~ 

 

additional amounts or consideration other than fees, royalties or payments
which the Company would otherwise have been required to pay had the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement not occurred. No Contract to
which the Company is a party confers upon any Person other than the Company
any ownership right with respect to any Intellectual Property developed by the
Company in connection with such Contract.

 

(h)The Company has not used Publicly Available Software in a manner that
subjects, in whole or in part, the Company Intellectual Property to any
Hereditary License. The Company has not received any written notice from a
third party that it is or they are in breach of any license with respect to
Publicly Available Software. No Company Intellectual Property is subject to
any technology or source code escrow arrangement or obligation.

 

(i)The Company has implemented and maintained (or, where applicable, has
required its vendors to maintain), consistent with commercially reasonable and
industry practices and complying with its contractual obligations to other
Persons, reasonable security measures designed to protect all computers,
networks, software and systems used in connection with the operation of the
business of the Company (the "Company Information Systems"), from viruses and
similar malware, and the Company Information Systems and all confidential
information, including Personal Data maintained by the Company from
unauthorized physical or virtual access, use, modification, acquisition,
disclosure or other misuse, including as required by applicable Laws. To the
Company's Knowledge, there has been no unauthorized access to or use of the
Company Information Systems, nor has there been any unscheduled downtime or
unavailability of the Company Information Systems due to unauthorized access
to or use of Company Information Systems either of which resulting in a
material disruption of the business of the Company. The Company Information
Systems are generally in good working condition. During the past 12 months,
there have been no material failures, breakdowns, outages or unavailability of
such Company Information Systems other than scheduled maintenance software
updates, and the Company's disaster recovery and business continuity plans
("DR Plans") were not activated other than for testing purposes. On and after
the Closing Date, the Company Information Systems will be in the possession,
custody or control of the Company, and available for use, as existing
immediately prior to the Closing Date. The Company has made available to
Parent a true and complete copy of the DR Plans. The DR Plans are materially
consistent with generally understood and applied industry standards and
applicable Law. The Company has conducted testing of the DR Plans not less
frequently than annually (and in any event, upon a material change to the DR
Plans) and corrected any material deficiencies in the DR Plans or deficiencies
in compliance of the Company with the DR Plans.

filing (or furnishing) date or, if amended, as of the date of the last such
amendment, each Parent SEC Filings complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, as the case may be, the rules and regulations of the SEC and the Nasdaq

47.

 

 

 ~~174046687 v20~~ 

 

Filings contained (at the time they were furnished or filed or if amended or
superseded by a furnishing or a filing then on the date of such furnishing or
filing) any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading, except to the extent corrected or amended by a subsequently
furnished or filed Parent SEC Filing. Parent is eligible to use Form S-3 to
register the shares of Parent Stock issuable pursuant to the Merger for resale
on a continuous basis on an automatic shelf registration statement that will
become effective immediately upon filing with the SEC under the Securities
Act. Parent is a "well known seasoned issuer" as defined in Rule 405 of the
rules and regulations of the SEC under the Securities Act, pursuant to Section
1(i)(A) of such definition, including not having been and not being an
"ineligible issuer" as defined in such Rule 405. The Parent Financial
Statements, which have been derived from the accounting books and records of
Parent and its subsidiaries, comply as to form in all material respects with
the applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations
of the SEC with respect thereto. The Parent Financial Statements present
fairly in all material respects, in conformity with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods indicated, except that the unaudited
consolidated interim financial statements may not contain all footnotes
required by GAAP and are subject to normal year-end adjustments, the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its subsidiaries as at the
respective dates thereof, and the consolidated statements of income,
consolidated statements of stockholders' equity and consolidated statements of
cash flows (in each case including the related notes) for the respective
periods indicated. Since July 1, 2017, there has not been an adverse effect
that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the
consummation of the Merger.

 

(b)There are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters received
from the SEC with respect to the Parent SEC Filings. To the knowledge of
Parent, none of the Parent SEC Filings is the subject of ongoing SEC review
and there are no inquiries or investigations by the SEC or any internal
investigations pending or threatened, in each case, regarding any accounting
practices of Parent.

 

(c)Parent maintains, and at all times since July 1, 2017 has maintained, a
system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the
maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Parent; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and that receipts
and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of Parent; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the assets of Parent that could have a material effect on its
financial statements. Parent's management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of Parent's system of internal controls over financial reporting
in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, and such assessment concluded that
such controls were effective.

 

48.

 

 

 ~~174046687 v20~~ 

 

(d)Parent maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15
or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that all
information required to be disclosed in Parent's reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that
all such information is accumulated and communicated to Parent's management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
enable each of the principal executive officer of Parent and the principal
financial officer of Parent to make the certifications required under the
Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

to (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage the submission of any Takeover
Proposal by any Person or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-public information with respect
to, or take any other action intended or reasonably expected to facilitate the
making of any inquiry or proposal to the Company that constitutes, or is
reasonably expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal by any Person. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any officer, director or
employee of the Company or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor or
representative of the Company, acting on behalf of, and with the authorization
of, the Company, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 4.3(a) (No
Solicitation) by the Company.

 

(b)Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall (i) withdraw or modify in a manner materially adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub, the approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors or any
such committee of this Agreement or the Merger, (ii) approve or recommend any
Takeover Proposal or (iii) cause the Company to enter into any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar
agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal. 

 

(c)In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this Section 4.3 (No Solicitation), the Company promptly (and in
all events within 24 hours) shall advise Parent orally and in writing of any
request to the Company for nonpublic information that the Company reasonably
believes is likely to lead to a Takeover Proposal or of any Takeover Proposal
submitted to the Company, or any inquiry directed to the Company with respect
to or which the Company reasonably believes is likely to lead to any Takeover
Proposal

and the (i) the identity of the Person making or submitting such inquiry,
indication of interest, proposal, offer or request, and the terms and
conditions thereof; and (ii) an accurate and complete copy of all written

Section 5.

Additional Covenants of the Parties 

---|--- 

 

5.1Stockholder Consent or Approval. 

 

(a)The Company shall, in accordance with the Company Charter and the Company's
bylaws and the applicable requirements of the DGCL and the CCC (including
Sections 228 and 262 of the DGCL), solicit the written consents of
stockholders of the Company for the adoption of this Agreement (the "Written
Consent").

 

(b)If applicable, the Company shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to
secure from any Person who is a "disqualified individual," as defined in
Section 280G of the Code, and who has a right to any payments or benefits or
potential right to any payments or benefits in connection with the
consummation of the Merger that would be deemed to constitute "parachute
payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code, a waiver of such Person's
rights to any such payments or benefits applicable to such Person to the
extent that all remaining payments or benefits applicable to such Person shall
not be deemed to be "parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code
(the "Waived 280G Benefits") and (ii) submit for approval by the Company
Stockholders the Waived 280G Benefits, to the extent and in the manner
required under Sections 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) and 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code (the
"280G Stockholder Vote"). The Company shall not pay any of the Waived 280G
Benefits if such payment is not approved by the Company Stockholders as
contemplated above. If applicable, prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Parent evidence satisfactory to Parent that a vote of the
Company Stockholders was received in conformance with Section 280G of the Code
and the regulations thereunder, or that such requisite stockholder approval
has not been obtained with respect to the Waived 280G Benefits, and, as a
consequence, the Waived 280G Benefits have not been and shall not be made or
provided. Within a reasonable period of time before taking such actions, the
Company shall deliver to Parent for review and comment copies of any documents
or agreements necessary to effect this Section 5.1(b), including, but not
limited to, any stockholder consent form, disclosure statement or waiver, and
the Company shall consider in good faith all comments received from Parent on
such documents or agreements.

 

5.2Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Best Efforts.

 

(a)Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, to file, or cause to be filed, all
documents and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Antitrust Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger as soon
as reasonably practicable, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary
actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, decisions, declarations,
approvals and, expirations or terminations of waiting periods from
Governmental Bodies and the making of all necessary registrations and filings
and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain any such consent,
decision, declaration,

 

53.

 

 

 ~~174046687 v20~~ 

 

approval, clearance or waiver, or expiration or termination of a waiting
period by or from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental
Body in connection with any Antitrust Law, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary
consents, authorizations, approvals or waivers from third parties and (iii)
the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the Merger. 

 

(b)By way of illustration and not limitation, the parties hereto agree to
promptly take, and cause their Affiliates to take, all actions and steps
requested or required by any Governmental Body as a condition to granting any
consent, permit, authorization, waiver, clearance and approvals, and to cause
the prompt expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period and to
resolve objections, if any, as the FTC, DO, or other Governmental Bodies of
any other jurisdiction for which consents, permits, authorizations, waivers,
clearances, approvals and expirations or terminations of waiting periods are
sought with respect to the Merger, so as to obtain such consents, permits,
authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals or termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws, and to avoid the
commencement of a lawsuit by the FTC, the DOJ or other Governmental Bodies
under Antitrust Laws, and to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially
delaying the Closing; provided, however, Parent and its Affiliates shall not
be required to, and without the prior written consent of Parent, the Company
shall not, before or after the Effective Time, sell, license, divest or
dispose of or hold separate (through the establishment of a trust or
otherwise), or agree to any other structural, behavioral or conduct remedy
with respect to, any entities, businesses, divisions, operations, products or
product lines, assets, Intellectual Property or businesses of Parent, the
Company (or any of their respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates) or agree
to any restriction on the conduct of such businesses. Nothing in this Section
5.2 (Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Best Efforts) shall require Parent or the
Company to take or agree to take any action unless the effectiveness of such
action is conditioned upon Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing and any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries be obligated to litigate
or participate in the litigation of any action, whether judicial or
administrative, brought by any Governmental Body challenging or seeking to
restrain, prohibit or place conditions on the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(c)Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates, if applicable, to):
(i) promptly, but in no event later than 10 business days after the date
hereof, make an appropriate filing of all Notification and Report forms as
required by the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby;
(ii) promptly, but in no event later than 10 business days after the date
hereof, make all other filings, notifications or other consents as may be
required to be made or obtained by such party under foreign Antitrust Laws in
those jurisdictions identified in Section 5.2(c) of the Disclosure Schedule,
which contains the list of the only jurisdictions where filing, notification,
expiration of a waiting period or consent or approval is a condition to
Closing; and (iii) cooperate with each other in determining whether, and
promptly preparing and making, any other filings or notifications or other
consents required to be made with, or obtained from, any other Governmental
Bodies in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

54.

 

 

 ~~174046687 v20~~ 

 

(d)Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 5.2
(Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Best Efforts), during the Pre-Closing Period,
each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in
all respects and consult with each other in connection with any filing or
submission in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including
allowing the other party to have a reasonable opportunity to review in advance
and comment on drafts of filings and submissions, (ii) give the other parties
prompt notice of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding brought by a Governmental Body or
brought by a third party before any Governmental Body, in each case, with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) keep the other parties
informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry, investigation, action
or Legal Proceeding, (iv) promptly inform the other parties of any material
communication to or from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), the
Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") or any other
Governmental Body in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or Legal Proceeding, (v) upon request, promptly furnish to the other
party, subject to an appropriate confidentiality agreement to limit disclosure
to outside counsel and consultants retained by such counsel, with copies of
documents provided to or received from any Governmental Body in connection
with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding
(documents provided pursuant to this provision may be redacted (1) to remove
references concerning the valuation of the business of the Company and its
Affiliates, (2) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and (3)
as necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns),
(vi) subject to an appropriate confidentiality agreement to limit disclosure
to counsel and outside consultants retained by such counsel, and to the extent
reasonably practicable, consult in advance and cooperate with the other
parties and consider in good faith the views of the other parties in
connection with any substantive communication, analysis, appearance,
presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal to be made or
submitted in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action
or Legal Proceeding and (vii) except as may be prohibited by any Governmental
Body or by any Law, in connection with any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding in respect of the transactions
contemplated hereby, each party hereto shall provide advance notice of and
permit authorized representatives of the other party to be present at each
meeting or conference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action
or Legal Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in advance in
connection with any argument, opinion or proposal to be made or submitted to
any Governmental Body in connection with such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or Legal Proceeding; provided, however, Parent shall, on behalf of the
parties, control and direct all aspects of the parties' efforts to obtain the
required approvals under the Antitrust Laws, including having principal
responsibility for devising, implementing and making the final determination
as to the appropriate strategy relating to any matters relating to the
Antitrust Laws, including with respect to any filings, notifications,
submissions and communications with or to any Governmental Body, and shall
have the right, in its sole discretion, to determine the nature and timing of
any divestitures or other remedial undertakings made for the purpose of
securing any required approvals under the Antitrust Laws to the extent any
such divestitures or other remedial undertakings would be conditioned upon and
only be effective after the Closing. Each party hereto shall supply as
promptly as practicable such information, documentation, other material or
testimony that may be reasonably requested by any Governmental Body, including
by complying at the earliest reasonably practicable date with any reasonable
request for additional information, documents or other materials received by
any party or any of their respective Subsidiaries from any Governmental Body
in connection with such applications or filings for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall pay all filing fees under the HSR
Act and for any filings required under foreign Antitrust Laws, but the Company
shall bear its own costs for the preparation of any such filings. Neither
party shall commit to or agree with any Governmental Body to stay, toll or
extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, or pull and refile
under the HSR Act, or other applicable Antitrust Laws, without the prior
written consent of the other.

 

(e)Parent further agrees that it shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, acquire or agree to acquire any assets,
business or any Person, whether by merger, consolidation, purchasing a
substantial portion of the assets of or equity in any Person or by any other
manner or engage in any other transaction or take any other action, if the
entering into of an agreement relating to or the consummation of such
acquisition, merger, consolidation or purchase or other transaction or action
would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any delay in the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period or impose any delay in the
obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorization,
consent, clearance, approval or order of a Governmental Body necessary to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
including any approvals and expiration of waiting periods pursuant to the HSR
Act or any other applicable Law, (ii) increase the risk of any Governmental
Body entering, or increase the risk of not being able to remove or
successfully challenge, any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or
other order, decree, decision, determination or judgment that would delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby or (iii) otherwise delay or impede
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(f)Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, to file, or cause to be filed, all documents
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
parties in doing, all things necessary to (i) effectuate the transfer of, all
changes to, or the termination of any Permits held by the Company (such
Permits being set forth in Section 2.11(a) of the Disclosure Schedule), as
required under all applicable Laws or as advised by any Governmental Body as
being necessary for the continued conduct of Company's business after the
Closing and (ii) obtain consents of the counterparties to the Contracts set
forth in Section 2.11(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, it being understood that
for all purposes of this Agreement, in no event shall any failure to
effectuate such transfer, changes or termination or to obtain such consent
constitute a breach of this Agreement. 

 

5.3Employee Benefits. 

 

(a)Parent agrees that from and after the Effective Time, Parent and its
Affiliates shall assume and honor all Company severance, retention and change
of control plans, arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms
as in effect immediately before the Effective Time. Parent shall provide or
shall cause to be provided, to each employee of the Company who continues in
the employ of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) following the Effective Time (each, a "Continuing Employee") (a)
base salary and a target incentive compensation opportunity, each of which is
no less favorable than

 

55.

 

 

 ~~174046687 v20~~ 

 

the base salary and target incentive compensation opportunity provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately before the Effective Time during the period
from the Effective Time to June 30, 2019 and (b) other employee benefit and
compensation programs that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately before the Effective Time
during the period from the Effective Time to December 31, 2018; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not diminish any obligation of the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to any employment or other agreement between the Company
and any of its employees in existence as of the Closing Date. 

 

(b)For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its
Affiliates providing benefits to any Continuing Employees after the Effective
Time (the "New Plans"), each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or
her years of service with the Company before the Effective Time, to the same
extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to
credit for such service under any similar Company Plans (other than with
respect to equity-based New Plans or severance New Plans). In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for purposes of each New
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any
Continuing Employee, Parent shall make commercially reasonable efforts to
cause (i) all pre-existing condition exclusions, waiting periods and actively-
at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his
or her covered dependents, and (ii) any eligible expenses incurred by such
employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately
before the Effective Time ending on the date such employee's participation in
the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.

 

(c)Parent hereby acknowledges that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall constitute a "change of control" or "change in control" (as
applicable) under the Company Plans and the terms of employment-related
agreements, as applicable.

 

(d)Nothing contained herein, express implied, is intended to confer upon any
individual (including employees, retirees or dependents or beneficiaries or
employees or retirees) any right as a third party beneficiary of this
Agreement. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed as a guarantee
of continued employment of any employee of the Company, including the
Continuing Employees, and this Agreement shall not be construed so as to
prohibit Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) from having the right to terminate the employment of any employee
of the Company, including the Continuing Employees, provided that any such
termination is effected in accordance with applicable law.

 

5.4Indemnification of Officers and Directors. 

 

(a)All rights to indemnification by the Company existing in favor of those
Persons who are or were directors and officers of the Company as of the date
of this Agreement (the "DandO Indemnified Persons") for their acts and omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time, as provided in the Company Charter and
the Company's bylaws (as in effect as of the date

 

56.

 

 

 ~~174046687 v20~~ 

 

of this Agreement) and as provided in the indemnification agreements between
the Company and such DandO Indemnified Persons in the forms made available by
the Company to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement, shall survive the
Merger and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified, and shall be
observed by the Surviving Corporation to the fullest extent available under
applicable Law, and any claim made requesting indemnification pursuant to such
indemnification rights shall continue to be subject to this Section 5.4
(Indemnification of Officers and Directors) and the indemnification rights
provided under this Section 5.4 (Indemnification of Officers and Directors)
until disposition of such claim.

 

(b)Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, at its own expense,
purchase an extended reporting period endorsement under the Company's existing
directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage (the "DandO Tail Policy")
for the Company's directors and officers, which shall provide such directors
and officers with coverage for six years following the Effective Time of not
less than the existing coverage under, and have other terms not materially
less favorable to, the insured persons than the directors' and officers'
liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company.

 

(c)In the event that Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
Entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall ensure that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Company or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 5.4 (Indemnification of Officers and Directors).

 

(d)The provisions of this Section 5.4 (Indemnification of Officers and
Directors) shall survive the consummation of the Merger and are (i) intended
to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each of the DandO
Indemnified Persons and their successors, assigns and heirs and (ii) in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such DandO Indemnified Person may have by contract or
otherwise. This Section 5.4 (Indemnification of Officers and Directors) may
not be amended, altered or repealed after the Effective Time without the prior
written consent of the affected DandO Indemnified Person.

 

5.5Disclosure

 

. During the Pre-Closing Period, neither the Company, on the one hand, nor
Parent, on the other hand, shall issue any press release or make any public
statement regarding this Agreement or the Merger, or regarding any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, without the prior written
consent of the other party; provided, however, that (i) each party hereto may,
without such consent, make any public statement in response to questions from
investors, customers or vendors, or make internal announcements to employees,
so long as such statements are consistent with previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made jointly by the parties, or individually,
if approved by the other party and (ii) a party may issue a press release or
public announcement related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
herein that does not disclose the material terms thereof after the Closing
without the consent of the other party.

 

57.

 

 

 ~~174046687 v20~~ 

 

5.6Tax Matters.

 

(a)Parent and the Surviving Corporation, on the one hand, and the
Securityholders' Representative, on the other hand, shall cooperate as and to
the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the
preparation and filing of Company Returns and any proceeding, investigation,
audit or review by a Governmental Body with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include signing any Company Returns, amended Company
Returns, claims or other documents necessary to settle any Tax controversy,
executing powers of attorney, the retention and (upon the other party's
request) the provision of records and information in such party's control
which are reasonably relevant to any such proceeding, investigation, audit or
review, making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided under this
Agreement, and making available to the other and to any taxing authority as
reasonably requested all information, records and documents in such party's
possession relating to Taxes of the Company including any ownership
information in such party's possession necessary to determine the presence or
absence of an "ownership change" within the meaning of Section 382 of the
Code. 

 

(b)Parent shall pay all sales, use, value added, transfer, stamp,
registration, documentary or similar Taxes incurred as a result of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement and shall file all related Tax
Returns, and the Securityholders' Representative and the Participating
Securityholders shall cooperate with Parent in connection with any such
filings.

 

(c)Parent and the Securityholders' Representative further agree, upon request,
to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Governmental Body or any other Person as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent shall file all related Tax
Returns, and the Securityholders' Representative and the Participating
Securityholders shall cooperate with Parent in connection with any such
filings.

 

(d)all applicable Tax purposes, Parent and the Company agree to, and shall not
take any action or filing position inconsistent with, the following Tax
treatment of the items specified below:

 

(i)The Adjustment Escrow Amount and the Securityholders' Representative
Reserve shall be treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside by
the Participating Securityholders on the Closing Date.

 

(ii)Any payments made in respect of In-the-Money-Options and Company RSUs
pursuant to this Agreement (A) shall be treated as compensation paid by the
Company as and when received by the holder or the recipient, as applicable,
thereof to whom such payment is due (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
be the Closing Date with respect to the Adjustment Escrow Amount and the
Securityholders' Representative Reserve), (B) shall be net of any Taxes
withheld pursuant to Section 1.11(k) (Exchange/Payment), and (C) shall, in
respect of payments attributable to Employee Options and Employee RSUs only,
be made through the Surviving Corporation's standard payroll procedures in
accordance with Section 1.11(h) (Exchange/Payment) (provided, however, that
payments of the Adjustment Escrow Amount and Securityholders' Representative
Reserve in respect of Employee Options and

 

58.

 

 

 ~~174046687 v20~~ 

 

Employee RSUs shall be made directly by the Surviving Corporation (and not
through its payroll)). Any applicable withholding Taxes in respect of the
portion of the Adjustment Escrow Amount and the Securityholders'
Representative Reserve borne by Participating Securityholders in respect of
Employee Options and Employee RSUs shall be withheld from their aggregate
Closing Options Payout Amount or Closing RSUs Payout Amount, as applicable.

 

5.7Notification of Certain Events

 

During the Pre-Closing Period, each party hereto shall promptly notify the
other party of, and furnish such other party with any information it may
reasonably request with respect to, the occurrence of any event or condition
or the existence of any fact that may reasonably be expected to cause, in the
case Parent is such notified party, any of the conditions to the obligations
of Parent to consummate the Merger set forth in Section 6 (Conditions
Precedent to Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub) or, in the case the Company
is such notified party, any of the conditions to the obligations of the
Company to consummate the Merger set forth in Section 7 (Conditions Precedent
to Obligation of the Company), not to be satisfied. A party's satisfaction of
its obligations in the foregoing sentence shall not relieve such party of any
of its other obligations under this Agreement.

 

5.8Commercially Reasonable Efforts

 

Prior to the Closing: (a) the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the conditions set forth in Section 6 (Conditions Precedent
to Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub) to be satisfied on a timely basis;
and (b) Parent and Merger Sub shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the conditions set forth in Section 7 (Conditions Precedent to
Obligation of the Company) to be satisfied on a timely basis.

 

5.9Registration Statement.

 

(a)Promptly upon the Closing Date (but no later than five Business Days
following the Closing Date), Parent shall file (the date of such filing, the
"Filing Date") with the SEC a registration statement under Rule 415(a)(1)(i)
promulgated under the Securities Act on Form S-3, or if Parent is not then
eligible to use Form S-3 for a secondary offering, on any appropriate form
under the Securities Act (including any amendment, supplement or new
registration statement contemplated herein, the "Registration Statement")
providing for the offering and sale or other disposition of the shares of
Parent Stock to be issued to the Company Stockholders, holders of In-the-Money
Options and holders of RSUs in the Merger (the "Registrable Shares"). The
Registration Statement and each registration statement filed pursuant to the
next sentence shall become effective automatically upon filing with the SEC.
If the actual number of shares issued in respect of the Payment Amount exceeds
the number of shares registered under the Registration Statement, Parent shall
file, within five Business Days after Parent has notice that the shares to be
issued in respect of the Payment Amount exceeds the number of shares
registered under the Registration Statement, an amendment to the Registration
Statement or file a new registration statement on any appropriate form under
the Securities Act covering the resale to the public by the Company
Stockholders of all such excess shares. The holders of Registrable Shares
(the "Selling Company Stockholders") agree to cooperate with and provide such
assistance to Parent, as Parent may reasonably request, in connection with any

 

59.

 

 

 ~~174046687 v20~~ 

 

registration and sale of the shares of Parent Stock, including accurately
completing and executing selling stockholder questionnaires.

 

(b)Parent shall pay the expenses incurred by it in complying with its
obligations under this Section 5.9, including all preparation, registration,
filing fees, costs and expenses, all exchange listing fees, all fees, costs
and expenses of counsel for Parent, accountant for Parent and other advisors
or persons retained by Parent in connection with the filing. Parent agrees
that it will (i) prepare and file with the SEC any amendments or supplements
to the Registration Statement or prospectus which may be necessary to keep the
Registration Statement continuously effective and to comply with the
provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the offer of the Registrable
Shares until the earlier of (A) the date upon which the sale of all shares
registered thereby is completed and (B) until the date upon which all such
shares may be sold to the public in accordance with Rule 144 under the Act by
a person that is not an "affiliate" (as defined in Rule 144 under the Act) of
Parent without regard to any of the conditions specified therein (other than
the holding period requirement in paragraph (d) of Rule 144 so long as such
holding period requirement is satisfied at such time of determination) or any
rule of similar effect; (ii) prepare and promptly file with the SEC and
promptly notify the Selling Company Stockholders of the filing of such
amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or prospectus as may be
necessary to correct any statement therein or omission therefrom if, at any
time when a prospectus relating to the shares of Parent Stock is required to
be delivered under the Securities Act, any event with respect to Parent shall
have occurred as a result of which any prospectus would include an untrue
statement of material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading; (iii) in case the Selling Company
Stockholders are required to deliver a prospectus, prepare promptly such
amendment or amendments to the Registration Statement and such prospectus or
prospectuses as may be necessary to permit compliance with the requirements of
Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act; and (iv) advise the Selling Company
Stockholders promptly after Parent shall receive notice or obtain knowledge of
the issuance of any stop order by the SEC suspending the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement or amendment thereto or of the initiation or
threatening of any proceedings for that purpose. Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of, and if issued, to obtain the
withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto, and to lift any suspension
of the qualification of any of the Registrable Shares for sale in any
jurisdiction in which they have been qualified for sale, in each case at the
earliest practicable date.

 

(c)At least three Business Days prior to the filing of the Registration
Statement or any prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, or
comparable statements under securities or state "blue sky" laws of any
jurisdiction, or any free writing prospectus related thereto, or before
sending a response to an SEC comment letter related to the Registration
Statement, Parent shall furnish to the Securityholders' Representative copies
of reasonably complete drafts of all such documents proposed to be filed
(including all exhibits thereto and each document incorporated by reference
therein to the extent then required by the rules and regulations of the SEC),
which documents will be subject to the review and comment of the
Securityholders' Representative, and Parent shall consider in good faith the
changes reasonably requested by the Securityholders' Representative prior to

reasonable access to the offices, properties, books, records and other
information of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including, if and to the

Company determines would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of any
person in the Company or that the Company would be entitled to assert to be
undermined with respect to such information and such undermining of such
privilege could, in the Company's good faith judgment, adversely affect in any
material respect the Company's position in any pending or, what the Company
believes in good faith could be, future litigation. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no officer or director of the
Company shall incur any personal liability with respect to the Debt Financing

commitment or other fees or reimburse any expenses) of the Company or any of

with the arrangement of the Debt Financing or (2) any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than historical information related to the Company
provided to Parent in writing by the Company specifically for use in the Debt
Financing offering materials), and this indemnification shall survive
termination of this Agreement.

 

(b) Parent acknowledges and agrees that obtaining the Debt Financing is not a
condition to the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Debt Financing

10.10Severability

 

Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in
any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or
enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in
any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or
unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to

 

72.

 

 

 ~~174046687 v20~~ 

 

delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In
the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such invalid or unenforceable term.

 

10.11Knowledge

 

"Knowledge" of the Company shall mean the actual knowledge of a fact or other
matter, after reasonable inquiry, of the Knowledge Individuals. With respect
to matters involving Intellectual Property, Knowledge does not require that
the Knowledge Individuals have conducted, obtain or have obtained any freedom-
to-operate opinions or similar opinions of counsel or any Intellectual
Property clearance searches, and no knowledge of any third-party Intellectual
Property that would have been revealed by such inquiries, opinions or searches
will be imputed to the Knowledge Individuals or the direct reports of any of
the foregoing; provided that any such opinions or searches that have been
conducted or obtained prior to the date of this Agreement will not be excluded
from the term "Knowledge" as a result of this sentence.

 

10.12Conflict of Interest

 

If the Securityholders' Representative so desires, acting on behalf of the
Participating Securityholders and without the need for any consent or waiver
by the Company or Parent, Cooley LLP ("Cooley") shall be permitted to
represent the Participating Securityholders after the Closing in connection
with any matter, including without limitation, anything related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any other agreements referenced
herein or any disagreement or dispute relating thereto. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, after the Closing, Cooley shall be permitted to
represent the Participating Securityholders, any of their agents and
Affiliates, or any one or more of them, in connection with any negotiation,
transaction or dispute (including any litigation, arbitration or other
adversary proceeding) with Parent, the Company or any of their agents or
Affiliates under or relating to this Agreement, any transaction contemplated
by this Agreement, and any related matter, such as claims or disputes arising
under other agreements entered into in connection with this Agreement,
including with respect to any indemnification claims. Upon and after the
Closing, the Company shall cease to have any attorney-client relationship with
Cooley, unless and to the extent Cooley is specifically engaged in writing by
the Company to represent the Company after the Closing and either such
engagement involves no conflict of interest with respect to the Participating
Securityholders or the Securityholders' Representative consents in writing at
the time to such engagement. Any such representation of the Company by Cooley
after the Closing shall not affect the foregoing provisions hereof.

 

10.13Attorney-Client Privilege

 

Parent and the Company agree that any attorney-client privilege, attorney
work-product protection, and the expectation of client confidence attaching as
a result of counsel's (whether external or internal) representation of the
Company in connection with the transactions

 

73.

 

 

 ~~174046687 v20~~ 

 

contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and all information and
documents covered by such privilege or protection (the "Covered Materials"),
shall belong to and be controlled by the Securityholders' Representative, and
not by the Surviving Corporation, following the Closing, and may be waived
only by the Securityholders' Representative, and not the Surviving
Corporation, and shall not pass to or be claimed or used by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation. Absent the consent of the Securityholders'
Representative, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall have a
right to access the Covered Materials following the Closing and, in the event
Parent or the Surviving Corporation accesses Covered Materials in violation of
this sentence, such access will not waive or otherwise affect the rights of
the Securityholders' Representative with respect to the related privilege or
protection. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a dispute arises between Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, on the one hand, and a third party other than
(and unaffiliated with) the Participating Securityholders and the
Securityholders' Representative, on the other hand, after the Closing, then
the Surviving Corporation may assert such attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure to such Covered Materials; and provided, further, that Parent and
the Surviving Corporation may not waive such privilege without the prior
written consent of the Securityholders' Representative.

 

10.14No Implied Representations

 

The parties acknowledge that, except as expressly provided in Section 2
(Representations and Warranties of the Company) and Section 3 (Representations
and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub), none of the parties hereto has made
or is making any representations or warranties whatsoever, implied or
otherwise. The Company, the Participating Securityholders and their respective
Affiliates and representatives each have not made any representation or
warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any
information concerning the Company or the Participating Securityholders
contained herein or made available in connection with Parent's investigation
of the Company, except as expressly set forth in Section 2 (Representations
and Warranties of the Company), and there shall be no liability that may be
based on such information or errors therein or omissions therefrom.

 

10.15Specific Performance

 

Each of the parties hereto agrees that this Agreement is intended to be
legally binding and specifically enforceable pursuant to its terms and that
Parent and the Company would be irreparably harmed if any of the provisions of
this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms and
that monetary damages would not provide adequate remedy in such event.
Accordingly, in addition to any other remedy to which a non-breaching party
may be entitled at law, a non-breaching party shall be entitled to seek
injunctive relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions hereof, in each case without posting a bond
or undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.
