**Agreement** "), among Allergan Holdco US, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
**Parent** "), Augusta Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" **Merger
Sub** ") and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and Vitae Pharmaceuticals,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " **Company** ").

 



 

WHEREAS, Parent has agreed to cause Merger Sub to commence a cash tender offer
(as it may be extended or amended from time to time in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, the " **Offer** ") to purchase all the outstanding
shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the "
**Company Common Stock** "), at a price per share of Company Common Stock of
$21.00 (such amount or, if the Offer is amended in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and a different amount per share is paid pursuant to the
Offer, such different amount, the " **Offer Price** "), net to the seller in
cash, without interest, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Offer, on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with Section
251(h) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " **DGCL** "), Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company (the " **Merger** "), with the
Company continuing as the surviving corporation, and pursuant to the Merger,
each share of Company Common Stock that is not validly tendered and
irrevocably accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offer, except as provided in
this Agreement, shall be converted in the Merger into the right to receive an
amount equal to the Merger Consideration;

 



 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledge and agree that the
Merger shall be governed by and effected under Section 251(h) of the DGCL and,
subject to the terms of this Agreement, effected as soon as practicable
following the consummation (as defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL) of the
Offer;

 



 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " **Company Board** ") has
(i) determined that the Transactions are fair to and in the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders, (ii) duly authorized and approved the
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the
consummation by the Company of the Transactions, (iii) declared this Agreement
and the Transactions advisable and (iv) resolved to recommend that the
Companys stockholders tender their shares of Company Common Stock in the
Offer, on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub has duly
authorized and approved the execution, delivery and performance by each of
Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation by Parent and
Merger Sub of the Transactions, and the Board of Directors of Merger Sub has
declared this Agreement advisable;

      
 

 



 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Offer and
the Merger.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 



 

 _ARTICLE I_

 



 

 _THE OFFER_

 



 

Section 1.01 _The Offer_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as promptly as
practicable (but in no event later than ten business days after the date of
this Agreement), Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
commence (within the meaning of the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " **SEC** ")) the Offer at the Offer
Price. The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to,
accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of Company Common Stock tendered
pursuant to the Offer are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ (the " **Offer Conditions** "). The
initial expiration date of the Offer shall be at the time that is one minute
following 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the date that is 20 business days
(determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "
**Exchange Act** ")) after the date the Offer is first commenced (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act). Merger Sub
expressly reserves the right to waive any Offer Condition or modify the terms
of the Offer, except that, without the written consent of the Company, Merger
Sub shall not, and Parent shall not permit Merger Sub to, (i) reduce the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the
Offer Price, (iii) waive, amend or modify the Minimum Tender Condition or the
Termination Condition, (iv) add to the Offer Conditions or impose any other
conditions on the Offer or amend, modify or supplement any Offer Condition in
any manner adverse to the holders of Company Common Stock, (v) except as
otherwise provided in _Section 1.01(b)_, extend the expiration date of the
Offer, (vi) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (vii)
otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the terms of the Offer in any
manner adverse to the holders of Company Common Stock or (viii) except as
otherwise provided in _Section 1.01(b)_, provide any "subsequent offering
period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing:

 



 

(i) Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, (A) extend the
Offer for one or more consecutive increments of not more than ten business
days each (or for such longer period as may be agreed by the Company),

 



      
 

 



 

if at the scheduled expiration date of the Offer any of the Offer Conditions
(other than the Minimum Tender Condition) shall not have been satisfied or
waived, until such time as such conditions shall have been satisfied or waived
(irrespective of whether the Minimum Tender Condition has been satisfied) and
(B) extend the Offer for the minimum period required by any rule, regulation
or interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof or The NASDAQ
Global Market (" **Nasdaq** ") applicable to the Offer; _provided_ that Merger
Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date.

 



 

(ii) If at the otherwise scheduled expiration date of the Offer each Offer
Condition (other than the Minimum Tender Condition) shall have been satisfied
or waived and the Minimum Tender Condition shall not have been satisfied,
Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer at
the request of the Company for one or more consecutive increments of not more
than ten business days each; _provided_ that Merger Sub shall not be required
to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date.

 



 

(iii) If, at the time of the applicable expiration date, all of the Offer
Conditions (other than the Minimum Tender Condition) are satisfied, all
comments of the SEC or its staff applicable to the Offer or the Offer
Documents have been resolved and no rule, regulation or interpretation of the
SEC or its staff applicable to the Offer would require Parent or Merger Sub to
extend the Offer, then Merger Sub shall only be required to extend the Offer
and its expiration date beyond the then existing expiration date for up to
three consecutive additional periods not to exceed an aggregate of thirty
business days to permit the Minimum Tender Condition to be satisfied (provided
that each such period will be ten business days unless the Company agrees
otherwise); _provided_ that Merger Sub may, in its discretion (and without the
consent of the Company), continue to extend the Offer beyond the additional
twenty business day period for additional periods of up to ten business days
each (the length of such period to be determined by Parent and Merger Sub).

 



 

(c) On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and this
Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept for
payment, and pay for (or cause to be paid), all shares of Company Common Stock
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that Merger Sub
becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable
after the expiration of the Offer. The date on which Merger Sub first accepts
for payment the shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered in the Offer
following the expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended in accordance
with _Section 1.01(b)_) is referred to as the " **Offer Closing Date** ". The
Offer may not be terminated prior to its expiration date (as such expiration
date may be extended and re-extended in accordance with _Section 1.01(b)_),
unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Section
8.01_. If the Offer is terminated or

 



      
 

 



 

withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
_Section 8.01_, Merger Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any
depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, all tendered shares of
Company Common Stock to the registered holders thereof. Nothing contained in
_Section 1.01_ shall affect any termination rights set forth in _Section
8.01_.

 



 

(d) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer,
Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which shall include an offer to
purchase and a related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement
containing the terms set forth in this Agreement and _Exhibit A_ (such
Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer
will be made, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the "
**Offer Documents** ") and (ii) disseminate the Offer Documents to the holders
of Company Common Stock. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and
Merger Sub all information concerning the Company required by the Exchange Act
to be set forth in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and Merger Sub
shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and
to cause the Offer Documents, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with
the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock, in each case
as and to the extent required by applicable U.S. Federal securities Laws.
Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel with copies of
any written comments, and shall inform the Company and its counsel of any oral
comments, that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of
such comments. Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents (including any
amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or the dissemination thereof to
the holders of Company Common Stock, or responding to any comments of the SEC
or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents, Parent and Merger Sub shall
(x) provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such Offer Documents or response (including the proposed final
version thereof), and (y) give reasonable and good faith consideration to any
comments made by the Company or its counsel.

 



 

(e) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely
basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company Common Stock that
Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

 



 

(f) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring or
having a record date on or after the date of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement and prior to the Offer Closing Date, in each case, effected in
compliance with _Section 5.01_ and the Offer Price as so adjusted shall
provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action.

 



 

Section 1.02 _Company Actions_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Sections 5.03_ and _8.04_ , the Company hereby approves the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(collectively, the " **Transactions** ").

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 5.03_, on the date the Offer Documents are filed with
the SEC or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the Company shall file with
the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect
to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, together with any exhibits, amendments or
supplements thereto, the " **Schedule 14D-9**"), including a description of
the Company Board Recommendation (subject to _Section 5.03_), and shall
disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 to the holders of Company Common Stock. Parent
and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company all information
concerning Parent and Merger Sub required by the Exchange Act to be set forth
in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9
if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall take all steps
necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule
14D-9, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to
the extent required by applicable U.S. Federal securities Laws. The Company
shall provide Parent and its counsel with copies of any written comments, and
shall inform Parent and its counsel of any oral comments, that the Company or
its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule
14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments. Prior to the filing of the
Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or
the dissemination thereof to the holders of Company Common Stock, or
responding to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9, the Company shall (x) provide Parent and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Schedule 14D-9 or
response (including the proposed final version thereof), and (y) give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent or its
counsel. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents
of a description of the Company Board Recommendation (subject to the prior
sentence and except to the extent that the Company Board shall have withdrawn
or modified the Company Board Recommendation in accordance with _Section
5.03(b)_).

 



 

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall cause its transfer agent
to promptly furnish Merger Sub with mailing labels containing the names and
addresses of the record holders of Company Common Stock as of the most recent
practicable date and

 



       
 

 



 

of those Persons becoming record holders subsequent to such date, together
with copies of all lists of stockholders, security position listings, computer
files and all other information in the Companys possession or control
regarding the beneficial owners of Company Common Stock, and shall furnish to
Merger Sub such information and reasonable assistance (including updated lists
of stockholders, security position listings and computer files) as Parent may
reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the Companys stockholders.
Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as
are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents
necessary to consummate the Transactions, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold in
confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files,
shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger
and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request, deliver to
the Company (and shall cause their agents to deliver to the Company) all
copies of such information.

 



 

(d) The Company shall register (and shall instruct its transfer agent to
register) the transfer of shares of Company Common Stock accepted for payment
by Merger Sub effective on or after the Offer Closing Date.

Section 2.08 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

 



 

(c) _Conversion of other Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Sections
2.08(b)_, and _2.08(d)_ , each issued and outstanding share of Company Common
Stock shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash and
without interest (the " **Merger Consideration** "). As of the Effective Time,
all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.09_, without interest.

 



 

(d) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (" **Appraisal Shares** ") of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any
Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section
262 of the DGCL (" **Section 262**") shall not be converted into the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 2.08(c)_, but instead the holders of
Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair market value of such
Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262; _provided_ that if any such
holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the
right to appraisal under Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid
the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares shall cease and such
Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective
Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive,
the Merger Consideration as provided in

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 2.08(c)_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any
demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common
Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in, and after the Offer
Closing Date, direct all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such
demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Parent
shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Company, require the
Company to make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer
to settle or settle any such demands.

 



 

Section 2.09 _Payment of Merger Consideration_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the
" **Paying Agent** ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration to former
holders of Company Common Stock. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, deposit with the Paying Agent, immediately after the Effective
Time, cash necessary to pay for the shares of Company Common Stock converted
into the right to receive cash pursuant to _Section 2.08(c)_ (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " **Payment Fund** ").

 



 

(b) _Payment Procedure_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in no event later than three business days after the
Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (the " **Certificates** ") which were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.08_ (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as are customary and reasonably acceptable to the
Company and Parent) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate to the Paying Agent for cancelation, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares of
Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have
been converted pursuant to _Section 2.08_, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason

 



      
 

 



 

of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been
paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
2.09_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash,
without interest, into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore
represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to _Section
2.08_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the cash payable upon surrender
of any Certificate.

 



 

(c) _Treatment of Book-Entry Shares_. No holder of record of Book-Entry Shares
shall be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of
transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration in respect
of such Book-Entry Shares. In lieu thereof, such holder of record shall upon
receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message" in customary form (or such
other evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), be
entitled to receive, and the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time (but in no event later than two business days after the
Effective Time to each such holder of record as of the Effective Time), an
amount of U.S. dollars equal to the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration
to which such holder is entitled hereunder, and such Book-Entry Shares shall
forthwith be canceled.

 



 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ as a
result of the conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Company Common Stock, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporations
obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record
date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the
Company on such shares of Company Common Stock not in violation of the terms
of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement. After the Effective
Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this _Article II_.

 



 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed as of the 12-month anniversary of the Merger Closing
Date shall be delivered to Parent or its designated affiliate, upon demand,
and any former holder of Company Common Stock entitled to payment of Merger
Consideration who has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent or any successor-in-interest of Parent for
payment of its claim for Merger Consideration (subject to applicable abandoned
property, escheat and other similar Law).

 



 

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has
not been surrendered prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately
prior to such date become the property of the Surviving Corporation or its
designated affiliate, free and clear of any claims or interest of any such
holders or their successors, assigns or personal representative previously
entitled thereto, subject to the claims of any former holder of Company Common
Stock entitled to payment of Merger Consideration who has not theretofore
complied with this _Article II_.

 



 

(h) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the
Paying Agent in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United States of
America or (ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith and credit of
the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of
principal and interest. Nothing contained in this _Section 2.09(h)_ and no
investment losses resulting from the investment of the Payment Fund shall
diminish the rights of the stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration.
To the extent there are losses or the Payment Fund diminishes for any reason
below the level required to promptly pay the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.08(c)_, Parent shall replace or restore the cash in the Payment
Fund to ensure the prompt payment of the Merger Consideration. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall be the property of, and
paid to, Parent or its designated affiliate.

 



 

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Company, Surviving Corporation, Parent
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to
be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " **Code** "), or under any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. Amounts so withheld and paid
over to the appropriate taxing authority shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such
deduction or withholding was made and the Company,

 



      
 

 



 

Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall
deliver a notice to the affected Person of the amount so deducted, withheld
and paid over.

 



 

Section 2.10 _Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option,
whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be canceled and the holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash determined by multiplying (A)
the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Stock Option by (B) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
(such amount, the " **Company Stock Option Cash Consideration** ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, for Company Stock Options the vesting of which
is conditioned upon the attainment of performance goals with respect to a
performance period that has not ended prior to the Effective Time (the "
**Performance Options** "), for purposes of this _Section 2.10_, the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Options shall
be determined at the "target" level of performance for such Company Stock
Options (or, if no target is specified, at the maximum number of shares
subject to such Company Stock Options). Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay the Company Stock Option Cash Consideration at or
reasonably promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than the
first payroll date after the Merger Closing Date).

 



 

(b) Prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company shall have taken action
to (x) suspend the current purchase period in effect under the Company ESPP
and (y) to terminate the Company ESPP effective as of immediately prior to the
Offer Closing Date. Any participant contributions under the Company ESPP shall
be returned to the ESPP participants (without interest) as soon as practicable
after the Offer Closing Date.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof administering any Company Stock Plan) shall adopt such
resolutions or take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting, providing
for the transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.10_. The Company shall
provide that, as of and following the Effective Time, no holder of any Company
Stock Option shall have the right to acquire any equity interest in the
Company or the Surviving Corporation in respect thereof. Effective as of the
Merger Closing Date, the Company shall deregister any unsold securities that
have previously been registered on Form S-8(s) relating thereto.

 



 

(d) The holders of Company Stock Options shall have the right to enforce, and
shall be beneficiaries with respect to, the right to payments to be made
pursuant to this _Section 2.10_.

 



 

Section 2.11 _Treatment of Warrants_. Each of the Company Warrants will, at
the Effective Time, to the extent not previously exercised for shares of
Company Common Stock by the holder thereof, be terminated and convert, without
payment by the holder of

 



      
 

 



 

any exercise price, into the right to receive the product of (a) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Company Warrant and (b) the
excess (if any) of (i) the Merger Consideration over (ii) the per share
exercise price payable pursuant to the terms of such Company Warrant. Promptly
after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company will deliver
to each holder of Company Warrants any notice contemplated by the Company
Warrants regarding the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

publicly propose to take any such action. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, (x) the
Company Board may, in response to an Intervening Event, take or fail to take
any of the actions specified in clause (A) of the definition of Adverse
Recommendation Change (an " **Intervening Event Adverse Recommendation
Change** ") if the Company Board determines, in good faith, after consultation
with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (y) if the
Company Board receives a Superior Company Proposal, the Company may terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(g)_ in accordance with _Section
8.04_; _provided_ that, prior to so making an Intervening Event Adverse
Recommendation Change or so terminating this Agreement, (1) the Company Board
shall have given Parent at least four business days prior written notice of
its intention to take such action and a description of the reasons for taking
such action (which notice, in respect of a Superior

 



      
 

 



 

Company Proposal, shall specify the identity of the Person who made such
Superior Company Proposal and all of the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Company Proposal and attach the most current version of the relevant
transaction agreement), (2) the Company shall have negotiated, and shall have
caused its Representatives to negotiate in good faith, with Parent during such
notice period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to
revise the terms of this Agreement in such a manner that would eliminate the
need for taking such action (and in respect of a Superior Company Proposal,
would cause such Superior Company Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior
Company Proposal), (3) following the end of such notice period, the Company
Board shall have considered in good faith any revisions to this Agreement
offered in writing by Parent in a manner that would form a binding contract if
accepted by the Company, and shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that failure to effect such Company
Intervening Event Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement
to accept a Superior Company Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law and, with respect to a Superior Company Proposal,
that such Superior Company Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Company
Proposal and (4) in the event of any change to any of the financial terms
(including the form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) of such
Superior Company Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, deliver to Parent
an additional notice consistent with that described in clause (1) of this
proviso and a renewed notice period under clause (1) of this proviso shall
commence (except that the four-business-day notice period referred to in
clause (1) of this proviso shall instead be equal to two business days) during
which time the Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of
this _Section 5.03(b)_ anew with respect to such additional notice, including
clauses (1) through (4) of this proviso.

 



 

(c) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.03_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders), including making
any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company,
or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board
determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties or
applicable Law; _provided_ , however, that no Adverse Recommendation Change
may be made unless the Company shall have first complied with its obligations
in _Section 5.03(b)_. Actions permitted under this _Section 5.03(c)_ shall
not be a basis for Parent or Merger Sub to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 8.01(d)_. For the avoidance of doubt, any "stop, look and
listen" communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not constitute an Adverse
Recommendation Change.

 



 

(d) In addition to the requirements set forth in _paragraphs (a)_ and _(b)_
of this _Section 5.03_, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable and in
any event within one

 



      
 

 



 

business day after receipt thereof, advise Parent orally and in writing of (i)
any Company Takeover Proposal or any request for information or inquiry,
proposal or offer that the Company reasonably believes could lead to or
contemplates a Company Takeover Proposal and (ii) the terms and conditions of
such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer (including any
subsequent amendments or modifications thereto) and the identity of the Person
making any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer (and
provide Parent with copies of all written proposals or offers, including
proposed definitive agreements, and oral summaries of any oral proposals or
offers, received by the Company or that the Company delivers to any Person or
group). Commencing upon the provision of any notice referred to above, the
Company and its Representatives shall keep Parent informed on a reasonably
prompt basis as to the status and details of any such Company Takeover
Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer (and any subsequent amendments or
modifications thereto).

 



 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

" **Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement** " means a customary confidentiality
agreement that contains confidentiality and standstill provisions that are no
less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (unless, with respect to the standstill provisions,
the Company offers to amend the Confidentiality Agreement to reflect such more
favorable terms).

 



 

" **Company Takeover Proposal** " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from
any Person or group (other than Parent and its subsidiaries) relating to (i)
any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in a single transaction or a
series of related transactions, of (A) 20% or more (based on the fair market
value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Company Board) of the assets
of the Company, or (B) 20% or more of the aggregate voting power of the
capital stock of the Company or (ii) any tender offer, exchange offer, merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, binding share exchange or similar transaction involving the
Company that, if consummated, would result in any Person or group (or the
stockholders of any Person) beneficially owning, directly or indirectly, 20%
or more of the aggregate voting power of the capital stock of the Company or
of the surviving entity or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the
Company or such surviving entity, other than, in each case, the Transactions.

 



 

" **Intervening Event** " means a material event, change, effect, development,
condition or occurrence that affects (a) the business, assets, financial
condition or continuing results of operations of the Company, or (b) the
stockholders of the Company, in either case that (1) was neither known nor
reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement
and (2) does not relate to a Company Takeover Proposal.

 



      
 

 



 

" **Superior Company Proposal** " means any written bona fide Company Takeover
Proposal received after the date of this Agreement that if consummated would
result in a Person or group (or the stockholders of any Person) owning,
directly or indirectly, (i) more than 50% of the aggregate voting power of the
capital stock of the Company or of the surviving entity or the resulting
direct or indirect parent of the Company or such surviving entity or (ii) more
than 50% (based on fair market value thereof, as determined by the Company
Board) of the assets of the Company, on terms which the Company Board
determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor, are, if consummated, more favorable from a financial point
of view to the stockholders of the Company than the Transactions, taking into
account all financial, legal, financing, regulatory and other aspects of such
Company Takeover Proposal and of this Agreement (including any changes to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent and any fees to be paid by the
Company for terminating this Agreement).

 



 

Wherever the term " **group** " is used in this _Section 5.03(e)_, it is used
as defined in Rule 13d-5 under the Exchange Act.

 



 

 _ARTICLE VI_

 



 

 _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

 



 

Section 6.01 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Except if prohibited by
any applicable Law, the Company shall afford to Parent and to Parents
Representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours (under the
supervision of appropriate personnel and in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of the business of the
Company) during the period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of
this Agreement to all their respective properties, books and records,
Contracts and personnel and, during such period, the Company shall furnish, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, to Parent all information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request.
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall not be
required to afford access or furnish information to the extent (a) such
information is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a
third party, (b) such information relates to the applicable portions of the
minutes of the meetings of the Company Board (including any presentations or
other materials prepared by or for the Company Board) where the Company Board
discussed the Transactions or any similar transaction involving the sale of
the Company, or a material portion of its assets, to, or combination of the
Company with, any other Person, or (c) the Company determines in good faith
that affording such access or furnishing such information would jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of the Company, or violate applicable Law or result
in significant antitrust risk for the Company; _provided_ that the Company
will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any required consents for the

 



      
 

 



 

disclosure of such information and take such other reasonable action
(including entering into a joint defense agreement or similar arrangement to
avoid loss of attorney-client privilege) with respect to such information as
is necessary to permit disclosure to Parent. All information exchanged
pursuant to this _Section 6.01_ shall be subject to the confidentiality
letter agreement dated August 17, 2016 between the Company and Parent (the "
**Confidentiality Agreement** ").

 



 

Section 6.02 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,

instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out
the purposes of this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the
foregoing, the Company and the Company Board shall (A) take all action
necessary to ensure that no Takeover Law or similar statute or regulation is
or becomes applicable to any Transaction or this Agreement and (B) if any
Takeover Law or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to any
Transaction or this Agreement, to use its reasonable best efforts take all
action necessary to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the
Transactions and this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Parent and the Company shall, in consultation and cooperation with the
other, each file, or cause their ultimate parent entities as that term is
defined in the HSR Act to file, with the United States Federal Trade
Commission (the " **FTC** ") and the United States Department of Justice (the
" **DOJ** ") the notification and report form, if any, required under the HSR

the other party to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith
the views of, and secure the participation of, the other party in connection
with, any such filings, submissions, communications, inquiries or requests,
(iii) unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental
Entity, and to the extent reasonably practicable, (A) not participate in or
attend any meeting in person with any Governmental Entity in respect of the
Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions without the other party,
(B) give the other party reasonable prior notice of any such meeting, (C) in
the event one party is prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable
Governmental Entity from participating in or attending any such meeting, keep
such party apprised with respect thereto, (D) cooperate in the filing of any
substantive memoranda, white papers, filings, correspondence or other written
communications explaining or defending this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger
or any of the other Transactions, articulating any regulatory or competitive
argument or responding to requests or objections made by any Governmental
Entity and (E) furnish the other party with copies of all filings,
submissions, correspondence and communications (and memoranda setting forth
the substance thereof) between it and its affiliates and their respective
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of
any Governmental Entitys staff, on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions and (iv) if
advisable, comply with any inquiry or request from the FTC, the DOJ or any
other Governmental Entity as promptly as reasonably practicable.

contrary, Parent shall, on behalf of the parties, control and make the final
determination as to the appropriate strategy relating to any filing or
submission which is necessary under the HSR Act, including with respect to any
filings, notifications, submissions and communications with or to any
Governmental Entity.

 



 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent and Merger
Sub agree to take any and all steps necessary to avoid, eliminate or resolve
each and every impediment and obtain all clearances, consents, approvals and
waivers under the HSR Act that may be required by any Governmental Entity,
including committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
orders, trust, or otherwise, (i) the sale, license, holding separate or other

other arrangements of Parent or Company or their respective subsidiaries and
(iii) creating any relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or
other arrangements of Parent or Company or their respective subsidiaries (each
a " **Remedial Action** "); _provided_ that none of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company shall be obligated to agree to, commit or effect, any Remedial Action
unless such Remedial Action is conditioned upon, or will occur subsequent to,
consummation of the Transactions; and _provided_ , further, that in no event
shall Parent or Merger Sub be required to offer, agree to, commit or effect,
any Remedial Action with respect to, or other disposition of or restriction
on, any product listed on

 



       
 

 



 

 _Section 6.02(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. Notwithstanding the
foregoing and any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no
event shall Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their respective Subsidiaries be
obligated to litigate or participate in the litigation of any action, whether
judicial or administrative, brought by any Governmental Entity challenging or
seeking to restrain, prohibit or place conditions on the consummation of the
Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions.

 



 

Section 6.03 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Offer Closing Date and for a period of one year
following the Effective Time (the " **Continuation Period** "), Parent shall
provide or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to each individual who
is employed by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time and who
continues employment with Parent or the Surviving Corporation (each, a "
**Company Employee** "), during such Company Employees period of employment
following the Effective Time, (i) a base salary or base wages (excluding
equity based compensation) that is no less favorable than those provided to
such Company Employee immediately prior to the Offer Closing Date, (ii) cash
incentive opportunities (excluding equity based compensation) that are not
materially less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent and (iii) employee benefits (including severance
and termination benefits but excluding cash and equity incentive compensation,
employee stock purchase plan participation and change-in-control benefits)
that are not materially less favorable in the aggregate than either (at
Parents discretion) (x) those provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent and its subsidiaries or (y) those in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 



 

(b) If the Effective Time occurs in 2016, then, not later than the first
payroll date following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, pay to each Company Employee cash incentive
compensation in respect of the 2016 fiscal year in an amount equal to such
Company Employees target annual cash bonus for the 2016 fiscal year. No
further payment of cash incentive compensation shall be made to the Company
Employees in respect of the 2016 fiscal year of the Company. In such event,
the Company Employees shall commence to participate in the applicable cash
incentive program of Parent and its affiliates for similarly situated
employees for the 2017 fiscal year.

 



 

(c) To the extent that, following the Effective Time, the Company Employees
become entitled to participate in the plans of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or their respective affiliates (the " **Surviving Corporation
Plans** "), such participation shall be on the same terms and conditions and
to the same extent as other similarly situated employees of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and their respective affiliates, and in each case
without any waiting time, to the extent coverage under any such Surviving
Corporation Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in
which such Company Employee participates immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.03(a)_, from and after the
Offer Closing Date, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
honor all of the Companys employment, severance, retention, termination and
change in control plans, policies, programs, agreements and arrangements
(including any change in control severance agreement or other Company Benefit
Agreement between the Company and any Company Employee) maintained by the
Company, as in effect at the Offer Closing Date, including with respect to any
payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the Transactions (either
alone or in combination with any other event) in accordance with their terms,
including any rights of termination, amendment or nonrenewal applicable
thereto. All of such plans, policies, programs, agreements and arrangements
are set forth on Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(e) With respect to all Surviving Corporation Plans, including any "employee
benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, maintained by Parent or
any of its subsidiaries (including any vacation, paid time-off and severance
plans), for all purposes, including determining eligibility to participate,
level of benefits, vesting, benefit accruals and early retirement subsidies,
each Company Employees service with the Company (as well as service with any
predecessor employer of the Company, to the extent service with the
predecessor employer is recognized by the Company) shall be treated as service
with Parent or any of its subsidiaries, _provided_ that the foregoing shall
not apply (x) for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit
pension plan or with respect to retiree medical or life insurance benefits or
(y) to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits.

 



 

(f) With respect to any Surviving Corporation Plan that is a welfare plan
maintained by Parent or any of its subsidiaries in which any Company Employee
commences to participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their eligible
dependents and beneficiaries, to the extent such limitations were waived,
satisfied or did not apply to such employees or eligible dependents or
beneficiaries under the corresponding welfare Company Benefit Plan in which
such employees participated immediately prior to such commencement of
participation, (ii) provide Company Employees and their eligible dependents
and beneficiaries with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid in the
elapsed portion of the applicable plan year prior to such commencement of
participation in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket maximum
requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan and (iii) waive any
waiting period or evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be
applicable to a Company Employee and his or her eligible dependents on or
after the Effective Time, in each case to the extent such Company Employee or
eligible dependent had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under
an analogous Company Benefit Plan for the elapsed portion of the applicable
plan year prior to such commencement of participation.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) At the request of Parent made at least five business days prior to the
Offer Closing Date, the Company shall take all steps necessary to terminate
the Vitae Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 401(k) Plan and any and all of the Company
Benefit Plans that are intended to be qualified within the meaning of Sections
401(a) and 401(k) of the Code (such plans, the " **Company 401(k) Plans**"),
with such termination to be effective as of the day immediately prior to the
Offer Closing Date and reflected in resolutions of the Company Board (the form
and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to the prior review and
approval of Parent). In connection with the termination of the Company 401(k)
Plans, Parent shall take any and all actions as may be reasonably required to
permit each Company Employee to make rollover contributions of "eligible
rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the
Code), in an amount equal to the full account balance distributed or
distributable to such Company Employee from each Company 401(k) Plan,
including notes evidencing any outstanding loans, from such Company 401(k)
Plan to a Surviving Corporation Plan that is qualified within the meaning of
Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code.

 



 

(h) The provisions of this _Section 6.03_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no Company Employee or any other Person
(including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement (except to the extent provided in _Section
9.07_ with respect to _Section 6.04_), and no provision of this _Section
6.03_ shall create such rights in any such Persons in respect of any benefits
that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any Company Benefit Plan
or Company Benefit Agreement or any employee program or any plan or
arrangement of Parent or any of its subsidiaries shall be construed to modify,
amend, or establish any benefit plan, program or arrangement or in any way
affect the ability of the parties hereto or any other Person to modify, amend
or terminate any of its benefit plans, programs or arrangements.

 



 

Section 6.04 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and rights to
advancement of expenses) now existing in favor of any Person who is or prior
to the Effective Time becomes, or has been at any time prior to the date of
this Agreement, a director, officer, employee or agent (including as a
fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan) of the Company or its
predecessors (each, an " **Indemnified Party** ") as provided in the Company
Charter, the Company Bylaws or any indemnification agreement between such
Indemnified Party and the Company that is in effect as of the date of this
Agreement and that has been made available to Parent (i) shall be assumed by
the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the
Effective Time, (ii) shall survive the Merger, (iii) shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms with respect to any claims
against any such Indemnified Party arising out of such acts or omissions and
(iv) for a period of six years following the date of this Agreement, shall not
be amended,

 



      
 

 



 

repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any
right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party. Parent shall ensure that the
Surviving Corporation complies with and honors the foregoing obligations.

 



 

(b) Without limiting _Section 6.04(b)_ or any rights of any Indemnified Party
pursuant to any indemnification agreement, from and after the acceptance for
payment of, and payment by Merger Sub for, any shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer, in the event of any threatened or actual Proceeding,
whether civil, criminal or administrative, based in whole or in part on, or
arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that the
Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer, employee or agent (including
as a fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan) of the Company or any
of its predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or any of the Transactions, whether
in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold
harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each such
Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs,
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any Proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law upon receipt of any undertaking required by
applicable Law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement of or in
connection with any such threatened or actual Proceeding. None of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment in any threatened or actual Proceeding for which indemnification
could be sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement,
compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Party from all liability arising out of such Proceeding or such Indemnified
Party otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent.
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with an Indemnified Party
in the defense of any matter for which such Indemnified Party could seek
indemnification hereunder. Parents and the Surviving Corporations
obligations under this _Section 6.04(b)_ shall continue in full force and
effect for the period beginning upon the acceptance for payment of, and
payment by Merger Sub for, any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer and ending six years from the Effective Time; _provided_ that all rights
to indemnification in respect of any Proceeding asserted or made within such
period shall continue until the final disposition of such Proceeding.

 



 

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company may obtain and fully pay
the premium for "tail" directors and officers liability insurance policies
in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions) for the period
beginning upon the acceptance for payment of, and payment by Merger Sub for,
any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and ending six years
from the Effective Time, covering each Indemnified Party and containing terms
(including with respect to coverage and amounts)

 



      
 

 



 

and conditions (including with respect to deductibles and exclusions) that
are, individually and in the aggregate, no less favorable to any Indemnified
Party than those of the Companys directors and officers liability insurance
policies in effect on the date of this Agreement (the " **Existing D andO
Policies**"); _provided_ that the maximum aggregate annual premium for such
"tail" insurance policies shall not exceed 300% of the aggregate annual
premium payable by the Company for coverage for its current fiscal year under
the Existing DandO Policies. If such "tail" insurance policies have been
obtained by the Company, Parent shall cause such "tail" insurance policies to
be maintained in full force and effect, for their full term, and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored by it and the Surviving Corporation. In
the event the Company does not obtain such "tail" insurance policies, then,
for the period beginning upon the acceptance for payment of, and payment by
Merger Sub for, any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and
ending six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect the
Existing DandO Policies in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection
with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions);
_provided_ that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required
to pay an aggregate annual premium for such insurance policies in excess of
300% of the annual premium payable by the Company for coverage for its current
fiscal year under the Existing DandO Policies; _provided further_ that if the
annual premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain the most comparable policy
available for an annual premium equal to such amount; and _provided further_
that Parent may substitute therefor policies of a reputable and financially
sound insurance company containing terms (including with respect to coverage
and amounts) and conditions (including with respect to deductibles and
exclusions) that are, individually and in the aggregate, no less favorable to
any Indemnified Party.

 



 

(d) In the event that (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (A) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (B) transfers or conveys all or a substantial
portion of its properties and other assets to any Person or (ii) Parent or any
of its successors or assigns dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in
each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
applicable successors and assigns or transferees expressly assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.04_.

 



 

(e) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
_Section 6.04_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this _Section 6.04_ applies
without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party. The provisions of this
_Section 6.04_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her
representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to

 



      
 

 



 

which each Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or
otherwise.

 



 

(f) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay all reasonable
expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in
this _Section 6.04_.

 



 

Section 6.05 _Fees and Expenses_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth in _Section 6.01_, _Section 6.04_, this _Section
6.05_ and _Section 6.07_, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions shall be paid
by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Offer or the
Merger is consummated.

 



 

(b) The Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $19,160,000 (the " **Company
Termination Fee** ") if:

 



 

(i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(g)_;

Parent and Merger Sub have received and may continue to receive from the
Company certain estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking
information, as well as certain business plans and cost-related plan
information, regarding the Companys business and operations. Parent and
Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such

 



       
 

 



 

estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, with
which Parent and Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger Sub are
making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as such
business plans and cost-related plans, furnished to them (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking information, business plans or cost-related plans),
and that neither Parent nor Merger Sub has relied upon the Company or its
shareholders, directors, officers, employees, affiliates, advisors, agents or
representatives, or any other Person, with respect thereto. Accordingly, each
of Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that neither the Company nor its
shareholders, directors, officers, employees, affiliates, advisors, agents or
representatives, nor any other Person, has made or is making any
representation or warranty or has or shall have any liability (whether
pursuant to this Agreement, in tort or otherwise) with respect to such
estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking information, business plans
or cost-related plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking
information, business plans or cost-related plans), except as expressly set
forth in _Article III_ of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Except for the representations and warranties contained in _Article IV_,
the Company acknowledges that none of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person

Company in connection with the Transactions.

 



 

Section 9.08 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of laws thereof.

 



 

Section 9.09 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties; _provided_ that Merger Sub may
assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Merger Sub of
any of its obligations under this Agreement; _provided further_ that any such
assignment shall not take place after the commencement of the Offer and shall
not otherwise materially impede or delay the consummation of the Transactions
or otherwise materially impede the rights of the stockholders of the Company
under this Agreement. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be
void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their
respective successors and assigns.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.10 _Specific Enforcement; Jurisdiction_.

 



 

(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court referred to in _Section
9.10(b)_, without proof of damages or otherwise (and each party hereby waives
any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with
such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. The right to specific enforcement shall include
the right of the Company to cause Parent and Merger Sub to cause the Offer,
the Merger and the other Transactions to be consummated on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. The parties further
agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable,
invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. Each of the
parties acknowledges and agrees that the right of specific enforcement is an
integral part of the Transactions and without such right, none of the parties
would have entered into this Agreement. If, prior to the Outside Date, any
party brings any Proceeding, in each case in accordance with _Section
9.10(b)_, to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions
hereof by any other party, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by
(i) the amount of time during which such Proceeding is pending, plus 20
business days or (ii) such other time period established by the court
presiding over such Proceeding, as the case may be.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and to the jurisdiction of
the United States District Court for the State of Delaware, for the purpose of
any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the actions of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the negotiation, administration,
performance and enforcement thereof, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably agrees that all claims with respect to such Proceeding may be
heard and determined exclusively in any Delaware state or Federal court. Each
of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the personal
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery, any other court of the State
of Delaware and any Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware in the
event any Proceeding arises out of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or
any of the other Transactions, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court, (iii) irrevocably consents to the service of process in any
Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger
or any of the other Transactions, on behalf of itself or its property, by U.S.
registered mail to such partys respective address set forth in _Section
9.02_ ( _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 9.10(b)_

 



      
 

 



 

shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by Law) and (iv) agrees that it will not bring any Proceeding
relating to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
Transactions in any court other than the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, if
the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any other court of the
State of Delaware or any Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware). The
parties hereto agree that a final trial court judgment in any such Proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law; _provided_ that nothing in
the foregoing shall restrict any partys rights to seek any post-judgment
relief regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment.

 



 

Section 9.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any Proceeding arising out of this Agreement, the Offer,
the Merger or any other Transaction. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event of any
Proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it
and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement
by, among other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this _Section
9.11_.

 



 

Section 9.12 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the
rights and remedies provided in this Agreement shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by applicable Law, and the
exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy.

 



 

Section 9.13 _Cooperation_. The parties agree to provide reasonable
cooperation with each other and to execute and deliver such further documents,
certificates, agreements and instruments and to take such actions as may be
reasonably requested by the other parties to evidence or effect the
Transactions and to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement.

Exhibit A 
to 
Agreement and Plan of Merger

 



 

Offer Conditions

 



 

Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement, Merger Sub
shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger Sub
to, accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of
the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Merger
Subs obligation to pay for or return tendered shares of Company Common Stock
promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), to pay for any
shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer (and not
theretofore accepted for payment or paid for) if (a) there shall not have been
validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) prior to the expiration of the
Offer that number of shares of Company Common Stock (excluding shares tendered
pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been "received",
as defined by Section 251(h)(6) of the DGCL) that, when added to the shares of
Company Common Stock then owned by Parent or Merger Sub, would represent one
share more than 50% of the then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(such condition in this clause (a), the " **Minimum Tender Condition** ") and
(b) any waiting period under the HSR Act (and any extensions thereof)
applicable to the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer and the consummation of the Merger shall have neither expired nor been
terminated.

 



 

Furthermore, notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement,
Merger Sub shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause
Merger Sub to, accept for payment or, subject as aforesaid, to pay for any
shares of Company Common Stock not theretofore accepted for payment or paid
for if, at the expiration of the Offer, any of the following conditions
exists:

 



 

(i) there shall be any Legal Restraint in effect preventing or prohibiting the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger; _provided_ that the party seeking to
assert this condition shall have complied in all material respects with its
obligations of _Section 6.02_ in respect of any such Legal Restraint;

 



 

(ii) (A) any representation and warranty of the Company set forth in _Article
III_ (other than those set forth in _Sections 3.02(a)_- _(d)_ , _3.04_ and
_3.08(a)_ ) shall not be true and correct at such time, except to the extent
such representation and warranty expressly relates to a specified date (in
which case on and as of such specified date), other than for such failures to
be true and correct that would not reasonably be expected to, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect (for purposes of
determining the satisfaction of this condition, without regard to any
qualifications or exceptions contained therein as to " **materiality** " or "
**Company Material Adverse Effect** "), (B) any

 



      
 

 



 

representation and warranty of the Company set forth in _Sections 3.02(a)_-
_(d)_ shall not be true and correct in all respects at such time, except (1)
to the extent such representation and warranty expressly relates to a
specified date (in which case on and as of such specified date) and (2) for
such inaccuracies that would not result in more than a de minimis increase in
the aggregate consideration payable by Parent as contemplated by _Article I_
and _Article II_ of the Agreement and (C) any representation and warranty of
the Company set forth in _Section 3.04_ and _Section 3.08(a)_ shall not be
true and correct in all respects at such time, except to the extent such
representation and warranty expressly relates to a specified date (in which
case on and as of such specified date);

 



 

(iii) the Company shall have failed to perform in all material respects all
obligations to be performed by it as of such time under this Agreement;

 



 

(iv) there shall have occurred, arisen or became known a change, event,
development, effect or occurrence since the date of this Agreement that has
had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect; or

 



 

(v) this Agreement shall have been validly terminated in accordance with its
terms (the " **Termination Condition** ").

 



 

The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the
rights of Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate or modify the Offer in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub
and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, may be waived by
Parent and Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in
their sole discretion (other than the Minimum Tender Condition and the
Termination Condition). The failure by Parent, Merger Sub or any other
affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall
not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such right with
respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver
with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right shall be
deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to
time.

1. The number of directors of the Corporation shall be fixed and may be altered from time to time in the manner provided in the By-Laws, and vacancies in the Board of Directors and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled, and directors may be removed, as provided in the By-Laws.

5. No director of the Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of his or her fiduciary duty as a director, _provided_ that nothing contained in this Article shall eliminate or limit the liability of a director ( _a_ ) for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, ( _b_ ) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of the law, ( _c_ ) under Section 174 of the DGCL or ( _d_ ) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.

 



 

6.

7. (a) Given that certain jointly indemnifiable claims may arise due to the service of the indemnitee as a director of the Corporation at the request of the Indemnitee-related entities, the Corporation acknowledges and agrees that the Corporation shall be fully and primarily responsible for the payment to the indemnitee in respect of indemnification or advancement of expenses in connection with any such jointly indemnifiable claim, pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Section 7 of Article SIXTH of this Certificate of Incorporation, irrespective of any right of recovery the indemnitee may have from the Indemnitee-related entities. Under no circumstance shall the Corporation be entitled to any right of subrogation or contribution by the Indemnitee-related entities and no right of advancement or recovery the indemnitee may have from the Indemnitee-related entities shall reduce or otherwise alter the rights of the indemnitee or the obligations of the Corporation hereunder. In the event that any of the Indemnitee-related entities shall make any payment to the indemnitee in respect of indemnification or advancement of expenses with respect to any jointly indemnifiable claim, the Indemnitee-related entity making such payment shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of the indemnitee against the Corporation, and the indemnitee shall execute all papers reasonably required and shall do all things that may be reasonably necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents as may be necessary to enable the Indemnitee-related entities effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.

following meanings:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) The term "Indemnitee-related entities" means Allergan plc and its
affiliates (but shall not include the Corporation and its subsidiaries).

 



 

(ii) The term " _jointly indemnifiable claims_ " shall be broadly construed
and shall include, without limitation, any action, suit or proceeding for
which the indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification or advancement of
expenses from both the Indemnitee-related entities and the Corporation
pursuant to the DGCL, any agreement or the certificate of incorporation,
bylaws, partnership agreement, operating agreement, certificate of formation,
certificate of limited partnership or comparable organizational documents of
the Corporation or the Indemnitee-related entities, as applicable.

 



 

 _SEVENTH_ : The Corporation reserves the right to amend or repeal any
provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation in the manner now or
hereafter prescribed by the laws of the State of Delaware, and all rights
herein conferred upon stockholders or directors are granted subject to this
reservation

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I, the undersigned, being the incorporator hereinabove
