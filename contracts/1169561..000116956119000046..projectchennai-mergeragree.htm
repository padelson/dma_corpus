Stockholder with respect to such demands shall be submitted to Parent in
advance and, to the extent reasonably practicable, shall not be presented to
any Company Stockholder prior to the Company receiving Parent's written
consent.

3.3 Treatment of Options and Warrants.

(a) Converted Options. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger each Company Option
held by a Continuing Employee that is outstanding and unexercised and unvested
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "Converted Option")
shall automatically be converted into a Replacement RSU Award with respect to
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down for any fractional
share) that is equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the product
obtained by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to the Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (B)
the difference (but not less than zero) between (I) the Closing Date Per Share
Merger Consideration, minus (II) the exercise price of the Converted Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (ii) the greater of (y) the
average closing price per share of Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global
Select Market ("NASDAQ") for the five (5) trading day period ending on the
trading day preceding the date of this Agreement or, if Parent Common Stock
was not available for trading on the NASDAQ on the day preceding the date of
this Agreement, on the last day prior to the day preceding the date of this
Agreement that Parent Common Stock was available for trading on the NASDAQ,
and (z) the average closing price per share of Parent Common Stock on the
NASDAQ for the five (5) trading day period ending on the trading day preceding
the Closing Date or, if Parent Common Stock was not available for trading on
the NASDAQ on the day preceding the Closing Date, on the last day prior to the
day preceding the Closing Date that Parent Common Stock was available for
trading on the NASDAQ, which Replacement RSU Award shall be subject to the
same vesting provisions, terms and conditions as applied with respect to the
Converted Option determined immediately prior to the Closing Date and shall
automatically be settled or paid in shares of Parent Common Stock upon (and
only upon) the applicable vesting date without any election by any Person.
Upon settlement of each Replacement RSU Award, Parent shall withhold shares of
Parent Common Stock that would otherwise be issued to 

the Continuing Employee in satisfaction of any withholding tax obligations of
such Continuing Employee; provided, however, that in no event will Parent
cause any Continuing Employee to surrender Parent Common Stock in excess of
the legally required maximum tax withholding amount. Such Parent Common Stock
shall be valued at its closing price per share on the NASDAQ on the date when
taxes otherwise would be withheld in cash. All of the conversions, adjustments
and calculations made pursuant to this Section 3.3(a), including, without
limitation, the determination of the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to any Parent RSU Award and the payment or settlement of such Parent
RSU Award, shall be made in a manner such that the Replacement RSU Award
shall, in all respects, be exempt from the requirements of Section 409A of the
Code.

(b) Cancelled Options. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action on the part of the Company, the Company Optionholders or any
other Person, each Company Option held by any Person that is outstanding and
unexercised as of the Effective Time and is not subject to Section 3.3(a)
(each, a "Cancelled Option"):

(i) that is vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and has an
exercise price per share of Common Stock less than the Closing Date Per Share
Merger Consideration (a "Cashed Out Company Option") and is set forth on
Schedule 3.3(b)(i) (which schedule the Parties understand and agree may be
updated immediately prior to the Closing Date) shall automatically be canceled
and extinguished and, in consideration therefor, the holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive, in accordance with Section 3.5(d), without interest, an
amount in cash equal to: (1) the amount (if any, but not less than zero) by
which the Closing Date Per Share Merger Consideration exceeds the exercise
price per share of the applicable Option, multiplied by (2) the number of
shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be issuable upon the exercise of
such Option (it being understood that a portion of the amounts to be paid in
exchange for such Options pursuant to this Section 3.3(b) shall be paid into
the Escrow Account and the Representative Expense Fund, and that such amounts
shall be paid, if at all, pursuant to the terms of Sections 3.5(c), (h)-(i)
and Section 3.7(a)) (the "Option Cancellation Payment"). For the avoidance of
doubt, in the event that the Option Cancellation Payment with respect to any
Company Option is zero, such Company Option will be cancelled immediately
prior to the Effective Date without payment of any Option Cancellation Payment
or other consideration;

(ii) that is vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and has an
exercise price per share of Common Stock equal to or greater than the Closing
Date Per Share Merger Consideration and is set forth on Schedule 3.3(b)(ii)
(which schedule the Parties understand and agree may be updated immediately
prior to the Closing Date) will be cancelled immediately prior to the
Effective Date without payment of any consideration therefor (including any
Option Cancellation Payment); or 

(iii) that is held by any Person who is not a Continuing Employee, is unvested
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and is set forth on Schedule
3.3(b)(iii) (which schedule the Parties understand and agree may be updated
immediately prior to the Closing Date) shall automatically be canceled,
without payment of any consideration therefor (including any Option
Cancellation Payment).

(c) Company Warrants. Each Company Warrant, whether vested or unvested, shall,
without any further action on the part of any holder thereof, be cancelled and
extinguished and shall not be assumed by Parent in the Merger. In exchange
therefor each holder of a Company Warrant that has delivered a Warrant
Cancellation Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit C shall be entitled to
receive an amount equal to the sum of (A) the product of (x) the amount by
which the Closing Date Per Share Merger Consideration exceeds the Warrant
Exercise Price and (y) the number of shares of Company Capital Stock subject
to such Company Warrant as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B)
the Pro Rata Share of any portion of the Escrow Amount and the Representative
Holdback Amount released to the Company Securityholders (such amount, the
"Warrant Cancellation Payment").

(d) Company Notes. Provided the applicable holder of a Convertible Note has
executed and delivered a Note Cancellation Agreement in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit D to the Company prior to the Closing (or to the Parent
after the Closing), each holder of a Convertible Note that has delivered a
Note Cancellation Agreement shall be paid the amount set forth on the
Spreadsheet (it being understood that a portion of the amounts to be paid in
exchange for the Convertible Notes pursuant to this Section 3.3(d) shall be
paid into the Escrow Account and the Representative Holdback Amount).

(e) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all actions and
adopt all written resolutions as are necessary to effectuate the provisions of
this Section 3.3.

3.4 Pre-Closing Deliveries. No later than the third (3rd) Business Day prior

e-mail, or cause to be mailed or e-mailed to each Company Stockholder on the
Closing Date, together with instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Company Stockholder's Capital Stock in exchange for the Closing Date Per
Share Merger Consideration), an amount equal to the product (A) of the number
of shares of Capital Stock held by such Company Stockholder and (B) the
Closing Date Per Share Merger Consideration, which amount shall be payable by
wire transfer of immediately available funds on the Closing Date to the

(d) At the Closing, Parent shall pay to the Company, for the benefit of and

understood that each Company Securityholder's Pro Rata Share of the Escrow

under the Code or any other applicable Law, and if any such amounts are
deducted and withheld, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, as the case may be, timely pay such amounts to the appropriate
Governmental Authority. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid
over, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

3.6 Post-Closing Merger Consideration Adjustment and Payments.

(a) Delivery of Closing Statement. As promptly as practicable, but not later
than ninety (90) days after the Closing, Parent shall deliver to the
Representative a certificate of Parent (the "Proposed Closing Statement")
setting forth Parent's good faith determination (each, without duplication) of
(i) the Cash Amount, (ii) the Debt Amount, (iii) the Closing Working Capital
(calculated in accordance with Exhibit B), and (iv) the Company Transaction
Expenses Amount, and based on such calculations, Parent's calculation of the
Closing Date Merger Consideration. Parent shall, and shall cause the Company
and its and their respective officers, employees, agents and representatives
to, assist the Representative and its agents in their review of the Proposed
Closing Statement and shall provide the Representative and its agents access
at all reasonable times upon reasonable prior notice to the personnel,
properties, books and records of the Company for such purpose and for the
other purposes set forth in this Section 3.6, in each case, without cost to
the Representative. Parent acknowledges and waives any actual or potential
conflict of the officers, employees, agents and representatives of the Company
assisting the Representative as described in the immediately preceding
sentence and will not, and will cause the Company not to, prevent such access
by the Representative. If 

Parent fails to deliver a Proposed Closing Statement within such 90 day
period, the Estimated Closing Statement will be deemed to be accepted in the
form presented to the Parent and the Working Capital Escrow Amount shall be
immediately released.

(b) Accounting Policies. The Estimated Closing Statement, the Proposed Closing
Statement and the Final Closing Statement shall be prepared with the same
accounting principles, policies, methodologies or procedures (the "Accounting
Policies") used in preparing the Most Recent Financial Statements. For the
avoidance of doubt, in calculating the component line items of such
statements, no effect shall be given to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(c) Notice of Disagreement. In the event the Representative disputes the
correctness of the Proposed Closing Statement, the Representative shall notify
Parent in writing of its objections within thirty (30) days after receipt of
the Proposed Closing Statement and shall set forth, in writing and in
reasonable detail, the reasons for the Representative's objections (a "Notice
of Disagreement").

(d) Initial Method of Resolution. During the fifteen (15) days immediately
following the delivery of any Notice of Disagreement, Parent and the
Representative shall seek in good faith to resolve any differences that they
may have with respect to any matter specified in such Notice of Disagreement.
During such period, Parent and the Representative and their respective agents
shall each have access to the other party's working papers, trial balances and
similar materials prepared in connection with the other party's preparation of
the Proposed Closing Statement and the Notice of Disagreement, as the case may
be. The matters set forth in any such written resolution executed by Parent
and the Representative shall be final and binding on the parties on the date
of such written resolution.

(e) Dispute Resolution Procedure. If, at the end of such fifteen (15) day
period specified in Section 3.6(d), Parent and the Representative have not
been able to resolve, in writing, all differences that they may have with
respect to any matter specified in such Notice of Disagreement, Parent and the
Representative shall submit to Deloitte and Touche LLP or, if such firm is
unable to serve in such capacity, to such other nationally recognized
independent accounting firm that is mutually agreeable to the Representative
and Parent (the "Accounting Firm") for review and resolution of solely those
matters specified in such Notice of Disagreement that remain in dispute (and
as to no other matter), and the Accounting Firm shall reach a final, binding
resolution of such matters, which final resolution shall not be subject to
collateral attack for any reason (other than fraud or manifest error) and
shall be (i) in writing and signed by the Accounting Firm, (ii) within the
range of the amount of each item in dispute contested by the Representative
and Parent on an item by item basis, (iii) furnished to Parent and the
Representative as soon as practicable after the items in dispute have been
referred to the Accounting Firm, which shall not be more than sixty (60) days
after such referral, (iv) made in accordance with this Agreement and the
Accounting Policies and (v) conclusive and binding upon the parties on the
date of delivery of such written resolution. Parent and the Representative 

agree to execute, if requested by the Accounting Firm, a reasonable engagement
letter in customary form. Parent and the Representative agree to cooperate
fully with the Accounting Firm and promptly provide all documents and
information requested by the Accounting Firm so as to enable it to make such
determination as quickly and as accurately as practicable. The procedure
outlined in this Section 3.6(e) is referred to as the "Dispute Resolution
Procedure".

(f) Final Closing Statement. The Proposed Closing Statement shall become the
"Final Closing Statement" (i) on the earlier of (w) the thirty-first (31st)
day following the delivery of the Proposed Closing Statement if a Notice of
Disagreement has not been delivered to Parent by the Representative, (x) the
date upon which the Representative acknowledges in writing that it has no
objections to the Proposed Closing Statement, (y) the date of resolution of
all matters set forth in the Notice of Disagreement pursuant to Section 3.6(d)
and (z) the date upon which the Accounting Firm reaches a final, binding
resolution of solely those matters specified in any Notice of Disagreement
pursuant to Section 3.6(e), (ii) with such changes as are necessary to reflect
matters resolved pursuant to any written resolution executed pursuant to
Section 3.6(d), on the date such resolution is executed, if all outstanding
matters are resolved through such resolution and (iii) with such changes as
are necessary to reflect the Accounting Firm's resolution of matters in
dispute, on the date the Accounting Firm delivers its final, binding
resolution pursuant to Section 3.6(e). The date on which the Proposed Closing
Statement shall become the Final Closing Statement pursuant to the immediately
foregoing sentence is referred to as the "Final Determination Date".

(g) Dispute Resolution Expenses. Parent and the Representative shall each pay
their own costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Dispute
Resolution Procedure. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm
shall be allocated to and borne by Parent and the Representative (for the
account of the Company Securityholders) based on the inverse of the percentage
that the Accounting Firm's determination (before such allocation) bears to the
total amount of the total items in dispute as originally submitted to the
Accounting Firm. For example, should the items in dispute total in amount to
$1,000 and the Accounting Firm awards $600 in favor of the Representative's
position, 60% of the costs of its review would be borne by Parent and 40% of
the costs would be borne by the Representative (for the account of the Company
Securityholders). The Representative shall be reimbursed in accordance with
Section 13.14 for any Charges incurred by the Representative under this
Section 3.6, including for the reasonable fees and expenses of any
accountants, advisors or other representatives engaged by the Representative
in connection with the determination of the Final Closing Statement under this
Section 3.6 (including any Dispute Resolution Procedure hereunder).

3.7 Final Adjustment Payment.

(a) No later than the second (2nd) Business Day following the Final
Determination Date: 

(i) if the Adjustment Amount is positive, then Parent shall deposit the amount
of the Adjustment Amount with, and the Parent and the Representative shall

Capital Escrow Amount to, (y) the Paying Agent for further distribution to the
Company Stockholders, holders of Company Warrants and holders of Convertible
Notes in accordance with their Pro Rata Share as set forth in the Spreadsheet
and (z) the Surviving Corporation for further distribution to holders of
Cashed Out Company Options in accordance with their Pro Rata Share as set
forth in the Spreadsheet, and,

(ii) if the Adjustment Amount is negative, then Parent and the Representative
shall provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to release (y)
the Adjustment Amount to Parent and (z) the remaining balance of the Working
Capital Escrow Amount (if any) to (1) the Paying Agent for further
distribution to the Company Stockholders, holders of Company Warrants and
holders of Convertible Notes in accordance with their Pro Rata Share as set
forth in the Spreadsheet and (2) the Surviving Corporation for further
distribution to holders of Cashed Out Company Option in accordance with their
Pro Rata Share as set forth in the Spreadsheet; provided, that in no event
shall the amount payable in respect of the amount by which the Estimated
Working Capital exceeds the Closing Working Capital (if any) exceed the
Working Capital Escrow Amount.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent's sole
recourse for payment of any such deficiency pursuant to Section 3.7(a)(ii)
shall be to the Escrow Account and neither Parent nor the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates shall have any claim against any Company
Securityholder or the Representative or any of their respective Affiliates in
respect thereof.

(c) Any amount paid in respect of the Adjustment Amount pursuant to this
Article III shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to the merger
consideration for Tax purposes except as otherwise required by applicable Law
or pursuant to the good faith resolution of a Tax contest.

Representative shall, no later than two (2) Business Days following the
receipt by Parent of such Customer PO, jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to,
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, release and deliver an amount equal to the
amount of net revenue to the Surviving Corporation resulting from such
Customer PO to (i) the Paying Agent for further distribution to the Company
Stockholders, holders of Company Warrants and holders of Convertible Notes in
accordance with their Pro Rata Share as set forth in the Spreadsheet and (ii)
the Surviving Corporation for further distribution to holders 

of Cashed Out Company Options in accordance with their Pro Rata Share as set
forth in the Spreadsheet. No later than two (2) Business Days following the
Delivery Date, Parent and the Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, release and deliver to Parent the
outstanding balance, if any, of the Customer Escrow Amount.

satisfaction of Parent on or prior to the day immediately preceding the

Amount, and the Representative and Parent shall deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to make distributions to Parent from the
Indemnification Escrow Amount in the amount of such additional costs.

3.10 File Lock Holdback. In the event that the Company has not completed each

standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation.
The Company is qualified or licensed to do business and in good standing under
the Laws of each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its
assets or properties or conduct of its businesses requires such qualification,
except where the lack of such qualification would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has the requisite power and authority to carry on the businesses in
which it is engaged and to own and use the properties owned and used by it.

the Organizational Documents of the Company, in each case as amended to the

provisions of this Section 6.7(c) and that either (a) the requisite number of
votes of the stockholders of the Company was obtained with respect to any

the Surviving Corporation on substantially the same terms and conditions as

grants of equity awards).

(b) Parent shall, or cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause, any employee
benefit policies or plans in which Continuing Employees become eligible to
participate after the Closing Date (collectively, the "Post-Closing Plans") to
recognize the service of each Continuing Employee (to the extent such service
was recognized by the Company under a corresponding Employee Benefit Plan) for
all purposes of vesting, eligibility and benefit entitlement (but excluding
benefit accruals), except to the extent such service credit would result in a
duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.4(a), the Company shall, with

following the Closing Date in the Parent 401(k) Plan and to make rollover
contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of

401(k) Plan. If requested by Parent, the Company shall, with respect to any
Employee Benefit Plan that is not intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code, take such actions (including adopting written resolutions)
as are necessary or desirable to terminate any such Employee Benefit Plan as
of least one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing Date (but contingent upon
the Closing). In each case, the Company shall submit to the Parent written
resolutions for review and approval (which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(d) In connection with or shortly following the Closing, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Company to, issue to Continuing Employees identified on
Schedule 10.4(d) employee retention awards with a value equal in the aggregate
to the Retention Amount consistent with the terms set forth on Schedule
10.4(d) (the "Retention Awards").

(e) With respect to any welfare benefit plans in which Continuing Employees
become eligible to participate after the Closing Date, Parent shall use its
reasonable efforts to (y) cause there to be waived any eligibility
requirements to the extent satisfied under any comparable plans of the Company
immediately prior to the Closing Date; and (z) give effect, in determining any
deductible and maximum out of pocket limitations, to amounts paid by such
Continuing Employees in the year of the Closing Date with respect to similar
plans maintained by the Company. Parent shall, or shall cause the Continuing
Corporation or any designated affiliate, to waive any limitations regarding
preexisting conditions, and to take reasonable efforts to give full credit for
any co-payments made and deductibles fully or partially satisfied prior to the
Closing Date with respect to the Employee Benefit Plans or under any welfare
or other employee benefit plans maintained by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent's designated affiliate, or the Company on or after the
Closing Date.

(f) Nothing herein shall be construed to restrict Parent's (or the Surviving
Corporation's or the employer of record designated by Parent) ability after
the Effective Time to terminate, or modify the terms and conditions of, the
employment of any employee (including any Continuing Employee), nor to
preclude, prohibit or otherwise restrict Parent (or the Surviving Corporation)
from merging, modifying, or terminating any Employee Benefit Plan.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each of
Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company hereby acknowledges and agrees that all
provisions contained in this Section 10.4 are included for the sole benefit of
the parties hereto, and that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or
implied, (i) 

shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Employee Benefit
Plan or other employee benefit plan, agreement or other arrangement, (ii)
shall limit the right of Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company or their
respective Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Employee
Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan, agreement or other arrangement
following the Closing Date, or (iii) shall create any third party beneficiary
or other right (x) in any other Person, including any current or former
director, officer, employee or independent contractor of the Company or any
participant in any Employee Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan,
agreement or other arrangement (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof) or
(y) to continued employment with Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation
or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates.

10.5 Non-competition and Non-solicitation. As further consideration in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the
Key Sellers hereby covenants and agrees to the following:

(a) Competition. Until three (3) years following the Closing, such Key Seller
will not enter into Competition with the business of the Company as of the
Closing (the "Company Business"). "Competition" shall mean: (i) participating,
directly or indirectly, as an individual proprietor, partners, stockholder,
officer, employee, director, joint venturer, investor, lender, consultant or
in any capacity whatsoever, anywhere in the world that the Company does
business, in a business in competition with the Company Business; provided,
however, that Competition shall not include (A) the mere ownership of not more
than one percent (1%) of the total outstanding stock of a publicly held
company; or (B) any activity engaged in with the prior written approval of the
Board of Directors of Parent.

(b) Solicitation. For three (3) years following the Closing, such Key Seller
will not engage in any activity or activities that constitute a Solicitation.
"Solicitation" shall mean: (i) recruiting, soliciting or inducing, or any such
attempt, or hiring or assisting another person to recruit, solicit or induce,
or any such attempt of any nonclerical employee or employees of the Company
Group who were a Continuing Employee as of the Closing, or any person who
within six (6) months before had been a nonclerical employee of the Company
Group who was a Continuing Employee as of the Closing and was recruited,
solicited or induced for such employment or other retention while an employee
of the Company Group, to terminate their employment with, or otherwise cease
their relationship with, the Company Group, or (ii) recruiting, soliciting or
inducing, or any such attempt, any Person who or that is a customer of the
Company Group for the purpose of (A) soliciting or selling services in
competition with the Company Business, or (B) causing any such customers to
decrease or refrain from doing business with or patronizing the Company Group
with respect to the Company Business.

(c) Modifications. If any restriction set forth with regard to Competition or
Solicitation is found by any court of competent jurisdiction, or an
arbitrator, to be unenforceable because it extends for too long a period of
time or over too great a range of 

activities or in too broad a geographic area, it shall be interpreted to
extend over the maximum period of time, range of activities or geographic area
as to which it may be enforceable. If any provision of this Section 10.5 shall
be declared to be invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, as a result
of the foregoing, as a result of public policy or for any other reason, such
invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions of this Section which
shall remain in full force and effect.

(d) Each Key Seller acknowledges that the provisions of this Section 10.5 are
reasonable and necessary for the protection of the businesses of the Company
Group and that part of the consideration paid to each of them under this
Agreement is in consideration for the agreements in this Section 10.5.

(e) In the event of a breach or potential breach or threatened breach of this
Section 10.5, each Key Seller acknowledges that the Company Group will be
caused irreparable injury and that money damages may not be an adequate remedy
and agree that the Company Group shall be entitled to injunctive relief (in
addition to its other remedies at law) to have the provisions of this Section
10.5 enforced without the necessity of proving (i) the inadequacy as a remedy
of money damages or (ii) posting a bond or other surety. It is hereby
acknowledged that the provisions of this Section 10.5 are for the benefit of
the Company Group and each such entity may enforce the provisions of this
Section 10.5.

10.6 Allocation of Certain Taxes.

(a) If the Company is permitted but not required under applicable state, local
or foreign income Tax Laws to treat the Closing Date as the last day of a
taxable period, then the Parties shall treat that day as the last day of a
taxable period.

(b) In the case of any Straddle Period, Taxes shall be allocated to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date as follows:

(i) in the case of any Taxes based upon or related to income, profits sales or
receipts, or franchise Taxes, in an amount equal to the amount which would be
payable if the relevant taxable period ended as of the end of the Closing
Date; and

(ii) in the case of any other Taxes, in an amount equal to the amount of such
Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable
period.

10.7 Cooperation. The Representative and Parent shall provide to each other
such cooperation and information, as and to the extent reasonably requested,
in connection with the filing of any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim
for refund, determining liability for Taxes or a right to refund of Taxes, or
in conducting any audit or other Proceeding with respect to Taxes of the
Company. Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of
all 

relevant portions of relevant Tax Returns, together with relevant accompanying
schedules and relevant work papers, relevant documents relating to rulings and
other determinations by Taxing Authorities, and relevant records concerning
the ownership and Tax basis of property, which the requested Party may
possess.

10.8 Tax Returns. The Company shall prepare and file or shall cause to be
prepared and filed all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company on or
before the Closing Date. The Company shall provide a draft of any such Tax
Return and related workpapers to Parent for its review and comment at least
(15) Business Days prior to the due date of such Tax Return. The
Representative shall consider in good faith any changes reasonably requested
by Parent with respect to such Tax Returns. Parent shall prepare and file or
shall cause to be prepared and filed all Tax Returns required to be filed by
the Company after the Closing Date for Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle
Periods. Parent shall provide a draft of any such Tax Return and related
workpapers to the Representative for its review and comment at least (15)
Business Days prior to the respective due date of such Tax Return. Parent
shall consider in good faith any changes reasonably requested by the
Representative with respect to such Tax Returns. Tax Returns governed by this
Section 10.8 shall be prepared in accordance with past practices and customs
unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

10.9 Tax Contests. Parent shall notify the Representative in writing upon
receipt by Parent, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of notice in writing
of any audit or other administrative proceeding or inquiry or judicial
proceeding involving Taxes that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a
claim for indemnification under Section 11.2(a) (a "Tax Contest"), provided
that the failure of the notified party to give any other party notice as
provided herein shall not relieve such other party of its indemnification
obligations under Article XI except to the extent that such other party is
actually prejudiced thereby. To the extent such Tax Contest could not
reasonably be expected to affect any Tax period (or the portion thereof in the
case of a Straddle Period) beginning after the Closing Date, the
Representative shall have the right to control, conduct and settle any such
Tax Contest; provided that the Representative notifies Parent in writing that
the Representative will so control and conduct such Tax Contests, and
provided, further, that the Representative shall keep Parent reasonably
informed of all material developments on a timely basis, shall provide to
Parent copies of any written material correspondence received from the Taxing
authority related to such Tax Contest, and shall permit Parent to participate
in such Tax Contest (to the extent allowed by applicable Law). Parent shall
have the right to control and conduct any other Tax Contest (including any Tax
Contest with respect to which the Representative does not exercise the
Representative's right to control, conduct and settle), provided that Parent
shall keep the Representative reasonably informed of all material developments
on a timely basis, shall provide to the Representative copies of any written
material correspondence received from the Taxing authority related to such Tax
Contest, shall permit the Representative to participate in such Tax Contest
(to the extent allowed by applicable Law), and shall not settle any such Tax
Contest (if such settlement could reasonably be expected to give rise to a
claim for indemnification under Section 11.2(a)) without the consent of the
Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld). In the event of
any conflict or overlap between the provisions of this Section 10.9 and
Section 11.3, the provisions of this Section 10.9 shall control.

in excess of the Escrow Amount) indemnify, defend and hold harmless Parent,
the Surviving Corporation and their respective Affiliates, and each of their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, successors
and permitted assigns (each, a "Parent Indemnitee" and collectively, the
"Parent Indemnitees") from and against all Losses that such Parent Indemnitee
suffers resulting from, relating to or arising from:

(i) any breach of or any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in Article IV on and as of the date hereof or, except to
the extent that any such representation or warranty is made as of the date
hereof or as of another date earlier than the Closing Date, on and as of the
Closing Date;

(ii) any breach or nonperformance by the Company or the Representative prior
to the Closing or the Representative after the Closing of any of their

(v) any Debt Amount not paid and discharged in full on or prior to the Closing

(x) any claims by (A) any current or former holder or alleged current or
former holder of any equity or ownership interest or equity security of the

promised options or other rights or allegedly promised options or other rights
to purchase Capital Stock, relating to or arising out of (1) the Merger, this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, or (2) such Person's status or alleged
status as an owner of equity or ownership interests in the Company or its
predecessors (if any) at any time at or prior to any Effective Time, whether
for breach of fiduciary duty or otherwise, or (B) any Person to the effect
that such Person is entitled to any equity or ownership interest or equity
security or any payment in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement other than as specifically set forth
on the Spreadsheet; and

(xi) the Settlement and License Agreement.

(b) Subject to the limitations set forth in Article XI, after the Closing
Date, Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company
Securityholders and the Representative and each of their respective
Affiliates, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, representatives, successors and permitted assigns (each, a "Seller
Indemnitee" and collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees") from and against all

as of the Closing Date or (y) any Ancillary Agreement delivered by Parent or
Merger Sub; and

(ii) any breach or nonperformance by Parent or Merger Sub of any of the
covenants or agreements of Parent and Merger Sub and the breach or non-
performance by the Company of any of the covenants or agreements of the
Company to be performed after the Closing Date, in each case as set forth this
Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement.

11.3 Notice of Claims; Third Party Claims.

(a) Direct Claims.

(i) Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 11.4, if (x) Parent
determines in good faith that any Parent Indemnitee has a bona fide claim for
indemnification against the Company Securityholders pursuant to this Article
XI, Parent may deliver to the Representative, or (y) if the Representative
determines in good faith that any Seller Indemnitee has a bona fide claim for
indemnification against Parent pursuant to this Article XI, the Representative
may deliver to Parent, in each case, a certificate signed by any officer of
Parent, or the Representative, as applicable (any certificate delivered in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.3(a) a "Claim Certificate"),
(i) stating that an Indemnified Party has paid, incurred, suffered or
sustained, or reasonably anticipates that it may pay, incur, suffer or sustain
Losses, and (ii) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of such
Losses, the date each such item was paid, incurred, suffered or sustained, or
the basis for such anticipated liability, and, if applicable, the nature of
the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant to which such item is
related. Parent may update a Claim Certificate from time to time to reflect
any new information discovered with respect to the claim set forth in such
Claim Certificate.

(ii) No delay in providing such Claim Certificate prior to, with respect to a
Parent Indemnitee, the Indemnification Escrow Expiration Date, shall affect
the applicable Parent Indemnitee's rights hereunder, unless (and then only to
the extent that) the Parent Indemnitee is actually prejudiced thereby.

(iii) If the party that received the Claim Certificate (the "Claim Recipient")
in good faith objects to any claim made in any Claim Certificate, then the
Claim Recipient shall deliver a written notice (a "Claim Dispute Notice") to
the party that delivered the Claim Certificate (the "Claimant") during the
thirty (30) day period commencing upon receipt by the Claim Recipient of the
Claim Certificate. The Claim Dispute Notice shall set forth in reasonable
detail the principal basis for the dispute of any claim made in the Officer's
Claim Certificate. If the Claim Recipient does not deliver a Claim Dispute
Notice to the Claimant prior to the expiration of such thirty (30) day period,
then each claim for 

indemnification set forth in such Officer's Claim Certificate shall be deemed
to have been conclusively determined in Claimant's favor for purposes of this
Article XI on the terms set forth in the Claim Certificate.

(iv) If the Claim Recipient delivers a Claim Dispute Notice, then the Claimant
and the Claim Recipient shall attempt in good faith to resolve any such
objections raised by the Claim Dispute Notice. If the Claimant and the Claim
Recipient agree to a resolution of such objection, then a memorandum setting
forth the matters conclusively determined by the Claimant and the Claim
Recipient shall be prepared and signed by both parties.

(v) If no such resolution can be reached during the forty-five (45) day period
following (i) the Claimant's receipt of a given Claim Dispute Notice or (ii)
expiration of the period in which the Claim Recipient may deliver a Claim
Dispute Notice, then upon the expiration of such forty-five (45) day period,
either the Claimant or the Claim Recipient may bring suit to resolve the
objection in accordance with Section 13.8.

(b) Third Party Claims. The Liabilities of the Indemnifying Party with respect
to Losses resulting from the assertion of Liability by any third party,
including any Governmental Authority (each, a "Third Party Claim") shall be
subject to the following terms and conditions:

(i) The Indemnified Parties shall promptly (and in any event within thirty
(30) days) give written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any Third Party
Claim that might give rise to any Loss by the Indemnified Parties, describing
in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to the Third Party Claim and shall
include in such notice the amount or the method of computation of the amount
of Losses actually incurred or expected to be incurred resulting from,
relating to or arising from such claim, and a reference to the provision of
this Agreement upon which such claim is based. Such notice shall be
accompanied by copies of all relevant documentation with respect to such Third
Party Claim, including any summons, complaint or other pleading which may have
been served, any written demand or any other relevant document or instrument.

(ii) The Indemnifying Party will have the right, upon written notice delivered
to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after receiving the notice
from the Indemnified Party described in Section 11.3(b)(i), to assume and
control the defense of such Third Party Claim, including the employment of
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party and the payment of the
fees and disbursements of such counsel (provided, that such assumption and
control of the defense of such Third Party Claim shall not be deemed to be an
acceptance or assumption of the Liability of such Third Party Claim by the
Indemnifying Party or an admission that any Losses arising from such claim are
indemnifiable Losses for which the Indemnifying Party is liable hereunder). In
the event, however, that the Indemnifying Party declines or fails to assume
the 

defense of the Third Party Claim on the terms provided above within such
thirty (30) day period, then such Indemnified Party may employ counsel to
represent or defend it in any such Third Party Claim. In any Third Party Claim
with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder, the
Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, whichever is not defending such
Third Party Claim, will have the right to participate in such matter and to
retain its own counsel at such party's own expense. The Indemnifying Party or
the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, will at all times keep the
Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, reasonably
apprised of the status of the defense of any matter the defense of which they
are maintaining and to reasonably cooperate with each other with respect to
the defense of any such matter.

(iii) No Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any claim or consent to
the entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being
sought hereunder without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). An
Indemnifying Party may not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), settle or compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder.

(c) The failure of an Indemnified Party to deliver any notice of a direct
claim or a Third Party Claim in accordance with the limitations set forth in
this Section 11.3 shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the
Indemnifying Party's obligations with respect thereto except to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced as a result of such
failure.

11.4 Limitations on Indemnification.

(a) Threshold. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Parent Indemnitees will not be entitled to recover any Losses pursuant to an
indemnification claim under Section 11.2(a)(i), unless and until the Parent
Indemnitees, as a group, shall have paid, incurred, suffered or sustained at
least $500,000 in Losses (the "Deductible") in the aggregate for all such
claims, in which event the Parent Indemnitees is entitled recover all of such
Losses, from the first dollar of such Losses.

(b) Caps; Order of Recovery. Parent Indemnitees will not be entitled to
recover, in the aggregate, any amounts in excess of the balance of the Escrow
Account in respect of any claims for indemnification asserted under this
Article XI, except for (i) any indemnification claims with respect to breaches
of or inaccuracies in the Fundamental Representations, indemnification under
clauses (iv)-(x) of Section 11.2(a) (collectively, the "Fundamental Claims"),
(ii) any breaches of or inaccuracies in the IP Representations (the "IP
Claims") or (iii) fraud by or on behalf of the Company.

(i) In the case of any indemnification claims for Fundamental Claims, IP
Claims or fraud, after the Parent Indemnitees have exhausted the 

Indemnification Escrow Amount, which will be the first source of recovery for
indemnifiable Losses hereunder, each Company Securityholder shall be liable on
a several and not joint basis only up to such Company Securityholder's Pro
Rata Share of any indemnifiable Losses resulting therefrom.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (A) the total
liability of a Company Securityholder for Fundamental Claims shall be limited
to the aggregate amount of cash actually received by such Company
Securityholder pursuant to Sections 3.2 and 3.3, (B) the total liability of a
Company Securityholder for IP Claims shall be limited to thirty percent (30%)
of the aggregate amount of cash actually received by such Company
Securityholder pursuant to Sections 3.2 and 3.3 and (C) in the event of fraud
by or on behalf of the Company, (1) the total liability of a Company
Securityholder that did not have knowledge of or did not participate in such
fraud shall be limited to the aggregate amount of cash actually received by
such Company Securityholder pursuant to Sections 3.2 and 3.3 or (2) the total
liability of a Company Securityholder that had actual knowledge of or
participated in such fraud shall not be subject to any indemnification or
other limitations. For clarity, except for claims under Subsection
11.4(b)(ii)(C)(2) above, in no event shall a Company Securityholder have any
liability in excess of the aggregate amount of cash actually received by such
Company Securityholder pursuant to Sections 3.2 and 3.3.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (A) in the
case of any indemnification claims in connection with clause (xi) of Section
11.2(a), the Parent Indemnitees will not be entitled to recover, in the
aggregate, any amounts in excess of $1,000,000 and (B) in the case of any
indemnification claims in connection with clause (iii) of Section 11.2(a), the
Parent Indemnitees will not be entitled to recover, in the aggregate, any
amounts in excess of $100,000.

(c) Other Limitations. Any indemnifiable claim with respect to any breach or
nonperformance by any Party of a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement shall be net of (i) any insurance proceeds that may be realized and
(ii) amounts recovered from third parties pursuant to indemnification or
otherwise.

(d) Reimbursement. If an Indemnified Party recovers an amount from a third
party (including pursuant to an insurance policy) in respect of a Loss that is
the subject of indemnification hereunder after all or a portion of such Loss
has been paid by or at the direction of the Indemnifying Party pursuant to
this Article XI, the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to the
Indemnifying Party the excess (if any) of (i) the amount paid by or at the
direction of the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Loss, plus the amount
received from the third party in respect thereof (net of any costs or expenses
expended in obtaining such third party amount), less (ii) the full amount of
such Loss.

11.5 Method of Indemnification; Escrow Release. 

(a) Method of Indemnification. Except as set forth in Section 11.4(b), any
payment to any Parent Indemnitees in respect of any claim for indemnification
properly asserted by any of the Parent Indemnitees under this Article XI shall
be paid solely and exclusively from the Escrow Account, and on and after the
Indemnification Escrow Expiration Date, the Parent Indemnitees shall have no
further rights to make any claim for indemnification under this Article XI
other than with respect to Fundamental Claims, the IP Claims and fraud by or
on behalf of the Company.

(b) Escrow Release.

(i) On the Indemnification Escrow Expiration Date, Parent and the
Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to, pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement, release and deliver the entire remaining balance, if any, of
the Escrow Account, less the aggregate amount that in the reasonable judgment
of Parent and Representative may be necessary to satisfy any unresolved or
unsatisfied claims for indemnifiable Losses specified in any Claim Certificate
delivered to the Representative (such amount, the "Pending Claims Amount"), to
(i) the Paying Agent for further distribution to the Company Stockholders,
holders of Company Warrants and holders of Convertible Notes in accordance
with their Pro Rata Share as set forth in the Spreadsheet and (ii) the
Surviving Corporation for further distribution to holders of Cashed Out
Company Options in accordance with their Pro Rata Share as set forth in the
Spreadsheet. From time to time after the release, if any, of funds as
contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence, to the extent the funds
remaining in the Escrow Account exceed the aggregate Pending Claims Amount
(after the settlement or resolution, as applicable, of pending claims from
time to time), such excess shall be promptly released and delivered by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement as directed
by the Representative.

(ii) The Representative and Parent shall, if requested by the Escrow Agent,
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to make any
distributions from the Escrow Account expressly provided for herein.

11.6 Treatment of Payments. All payments made pursuant to this Article XI
shall be treated as adjustments to the Final Merger Consideration, except as
otherwise required by Law or pursuant to the good faith resolution of a Tax
contest.

11.7 Remedies Exclusive. Except in the case of (a) fraud or willful
misrepresentation by Parent, the Company and the Representative, and (b) the
rights and remedies set forth in Section 3.6 and Section 3.7, from and after
the Closing Date, the remedies provided for in this Article XI shall be
exclusive and shall preclude assertion by any Indemnified Party of any other
rights or the seeking of any and all other remedies against the Indemnifying
Party (or the Escrow Account) for claims based on this Agreement or otherwise,
other than for actions for specific performance or other equitable remedies.
In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby waives any provision of
applicable Law to the extent that it would limit or restrict the agreement
contained in this Section 11.7, and each of Parent, the Company and the
Representative expressly 

waives for periods following the Closing any and all other rights or causes of
action it or its Affiliates may have against the other party or its Affiliates
now or in the future under any applicable Law with respect to the subject
matter of such indemnification provisions. The Parent Indemnitees may not
avoid such limitation on liability by seeking damages for breach of contract,
tort or pursuant to any other theory of liability (other than claims or causes
of action based on fraud or willful misrepresentation), all of which are
hereby waived by Parent, on behalf of itself and the Parent Indemnitees.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent may seek specific
performance or sue for damages in connection with a breach of any of the
covenants in Section 10.5.

11.8 Materiality. If any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement is qualified or limited based on materiality, including the terms
"material," Material Adverse Effect or any similar qualifier, such
qualification and/or limitation shall in all respects be ignored and given no
effect for purposes of determining whether any inaccuracy or breach of any
representation or warranty has occurred pursuant to this Agreement.

ARTICLE XII 

TERMINATION

12.1 Termination of Agreement. Certain of the Parties may terminate this
Agreement as provided below:

(a) Parent and the Company may terminate this Agreement by mutual written
consent at any time prior to the Closing;

(b) Parent may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the
Company at any time prior to the Closing in the event the Company or the
Representative has breached any representation warranty or covenant contained
in this Agreement, Parent has notified the Company of the breach and the
breach is incapable of being cured or has continued without cure for a period
of ten (10) days after the notice of such breach to the Company, and if not
capable of being cured or cured within such period, such breach would result
in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1 or 8.2 to be
satisfied (unless the failure results primarily from Parent breaching any

after the notice of breach to Parent , and if not capable of being cured or
cured within such period, such breach would result in the failure of any of
the conditions set forth in Section 8.1 or 8.3 to be satisfied (unless the

representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement); 

(d) Either the Company or Parent, each in its sole discretion, may terminate

order, ruling, consent, decree, judgment or injunction of a Governmental
Authority preventing the Closing shall become final and nonappealable;
provided that this right to terminate this Agreement shall not be available to
any Party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has
been the primary cause of the entry of such order, ruling, consent, decree,
judgment or injunction or its becoming final and nonappealable; or

(g) Parent may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the
Company at any time prior to the Closing in the event that the condition
contained in Section 8.2(b) shall not have been satisfied on or before the

as provided in Section 12.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become wholly void
and of no further force and effect and there shall be no Liability on the part
of any Party to any other Party, except that (i) the obligations of the
Company under Section 6.4, this Section 12.2 and the provisions of Article
XIII shall remain in full force and effect and (ii) termination shall not
preclude any Party from suing any other Party for any breach of this Agreement
prior to the termination of this Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement

any party to the Confidentiality Agreement of its obligations thereunder.

13.8 Governing Law; Submission of Jurisdiction; Selection of Forum.

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or
tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any claim
or cause of action 

based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made
in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic
Laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict
of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware. Each of the Parties hereby agrees that a
final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law.

(b) Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably agrees that all claims or causes of
action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or
relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of
or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with
this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement) shall be
exclusively resolved by any federal or state court in the State of Delaware,
and (ii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so,
any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the resolution of any such
claims or causes of action by any federal or state court in the State of
Delaware.

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY
LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, INCLUDING
WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION THAT INVOLVES EITHER PARTY'S REPRESENTATIVES.

13.9 Amendments and Waivers. No amendment of any provision of this Agreement
shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by all of the
Parties. No waiver by any Party of any provision of this Agreement or any
default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder,
whether intentional or not, shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective, nor shall
such waiver be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default,
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any
way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.

13.10 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid,
illegal or unenforceable by any rule of Law or public policy in any
jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining
terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending
term or provision in any other jurisdiction, all of which shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect.

13.11 Construction. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if

of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the
authorship of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement.

13.12 Incorporation of Exhibits and Schedules. The exhibits and schedules
identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a
part hereof.

13.13 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that (i) irreparable damage
would occur in the event that the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms and (ii) money damages would
be both incalculable and an insufficient remedy for any such failure to
perform or any breach of this Agreement. Accordingly, it is agreed that the
Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court specified in Section
13.8, without proof of actual damages or any requirement to post a bond, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the exercise of the
Company's or the Parent's right to seek specific performance pursuant to this
Section 13.13 reduce, restrict or otherwise limit the Company's or Parent's
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.1 and pursue all
applicable remedies at Law, including seeking money damages. Each of the
parties hereto hereby waives in any action for specific performance the
defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.

13.14 Company Securityholder Representative.

(a) By approval of this Agreement or participating in the Merger and receiving
the benefits thereof, including the right to receive the consideration payable
in connection with the Merger and the Company Securityholders hereby
irrevocably appoint the Representative as the representative, exclusive agent,
proxy, and attorney-in-fact for all the Company Securityholders for all
purposes under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement including the full
power and authority to act in the name, place and stead of each of the Company
Securityholders', including: (i) to consummate the transactions contemplated
under this Agreement and the other agreements, instruments, and documents
contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith, (ii) to negotiate and
settle disputes arising under, or relating to, this Agreement and the other
agreements, instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or executed in
connection herewith (including claims pursuant to Article XI), (iii) to
receive and disburse to the Company Securityholders any funds received on
behalf of the Company Securityholders under this Agreement or otherwise, (iv)
to withhold any amounts received on behalf of the Company Securityholders
pursuant to this Agreement, including the Representative Holdback Amount, or
otherwise to satisfy any and all Liabilities incurred by the Company
Securityholders or the Representative in the performance of their duties
hereunder, (v) to direct the distribution of funds, designate or engage a
paying agent to distribute funds (including, the Closing Date Cash Merger
Consideration, the Adjustment Amount payable in accordance with Section 3.6
and funds from the Escrow Account and Representative Holdback Amount), make or
direct payments of funds from the Representative Holdback Amount, give
receipts for funds, authorize deliveries to Parent or any Parent Indemnitee of
cash from the Escrow Account in satisfaction of claims 

asserted by Parent or any Parent Indemnitee, as applicable, and object to any
claims by any Person against the Escrow Account, (vi) to execute and deliver
any amendment or waiver to this Agreement and the other agreements,
instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection
herewith (without the prior approval of the Company Securityholders) and (vii)
to take or refrain from all other actions, in the sole discretion of the
Representative, to be taken by or on behalf of the Company Securityholders in
connection with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Representative
Engagement Agreement and the other agreements, instruments, and documents
contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith. The Company
Securityholders, by approving this Agreement, further agree that such agency,
proxy and power of attorney and immunities and rights to indemnification
granted to the Representative Group hereunder are coupled with an interest,
are therefore irrevocable without the consent of the Representative and shall
survive the death, incapacity, incompetence, bankruptcy, insolvency,
dissolution or liquidation of any Company Securityholder and shall be binding
on any successor thereto and shall survive the delivery of an assignment by
any Company Securityholder of the whole or any fraction of his, her or its
interest in the Escrow Amount. All decisions and actions by the Representative
shall constitute a decision and action of the Company Securityholders and
shall be binding upon all of the Company Securityholders and their successors
as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by such Company
Securityholder, and no Company Securityholder shall have the right to object,
dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. Parent may conclusively rely,
without independent verification or investigation, upon any such decision,
action, consent or instruction of the Representative as being the binding
decision, action consent or instruction of every Company Securityholder, and
Parent shall not be liable to any Company Securityholder or any other Persons
for any actions taken or omitted from being taken by them or by Parent in
accordance with or reliance upon any such decision, action, consent or
instruction of the Representative. The Representative shall have no duties or
obligations to the Company Securityholders hereunder, except as expressly set
forth in this Agreement, in the Escrow Agreement and in the Representative
Engagement Agreement, and purposes of clarity, there are no obligations of the
Representative in any ancillary agreement, schedule, exhibit or the Schedules.

(b) Certain Company Securityholders have entered into an engagement agreement
(the "Representative Engagement Agreement") with the Representative to provide
direction to the Representative in connection with its services under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Representative Engagement Agreement
(such Company Securityholders, including their individual representatives,
collectively hereinafter referred to as the "Advisory Group"). By the approval
of this Agreement or participating in the Merger and receiving the benefits
thereof, including the right to receive the consideration payable in
connection with the Merger, each Company Securityholder hereby severally, for
itself only and not jointly and up to its Pro Rata Share, agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless the Representative Group against all losses, liabilities,
damages, claims, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees, costs of
other skilled professionals and in connection with seeking recovery from
insurers), judgments, 

fines, amounts paid in settlement and amounts incurred by such Persons in
connection with any action, suit or proceeding to which the Representative or
such other Person is made a party by reason of the fact that it is or was
acting as the Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement or the Representative Engagement Agreement (the "Charges").

(c) Neither the Representative nor any of its members, managers, officers,
agents or other representatives nor any member of the Advisory Group
(collectively, the "Representative Group") shall incur any Liability to any
Company Securityholder by virtue of the failure or refusal of such Persons for
any reason to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or relating to
the performance of their duties hereunder, under the Escrow Agreement and
under the Representative Engagement Agreement except for actions or omissions
constituting intentional and knowing fraud. The Representative Group shall
have no Liability in respect of any action, claim or proceeding brought
against such Persons by any Company Securityholder, regardless of the legal
theory under which such liability or obligation may be sought to be imposed,
whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity, or
otherwise, if such Persons took or omitted taking any action in good faith.

(d) The Representative shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to
recover from any amounts withheld by the Representative, including the
Representative Holdback Amount, its Charges. In the event such amounts are
insufficient to satisfy the Charges, then each Company Securityholder will be
obligated to pay any remaining unpaid amounts to the Representative on a
several, and not joint, basis, up to each such Company Securityholder's Pro
Rata Share. The Company Securityholders acknowledge that the Representative
shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any
financial liability in the exercise or performance of any of its powers,
rights, duties or privileges or pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Furthermore, the
Representative shall not be required to take any action unless the
Representative has been provided with funds, security or indemnities which, in
its determination, are sufficient to protect the Representative against the
costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by the Representative in
performing such actions.

(e) In furtherance of, and without limiting any rights of the Representative
set forth in, Sections 13.14(a)(iv), 13.14(a)(v) and 13.14(d), the
Representative shall have the right, and by the approval of this Agreement
pursuant to Delaware Law (or otherwise) or participating in the Merger and
receiving the benefits thereof, including the right to receive the
consideration payable in connection with the Merger, the Company
Securityholders hereby authorize the Representative, to withhold from the
Closing Date Merger Consideration the Representative Holdback Amount (in
connection with the allocation and distribution of the Closing Date Merger
Consideration in accordance with Article III) to satisfy potential future
obligations of the Company Securityholders and expenses incurred by the
Representative in connection with performing its obligations under this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The Representative Holdback Amount 

shall be retained by the Representative until such time as the Representative
shall determine, and, subject to the terms of this Agreement, the balance of
the Representative Holdback Amount, if any, shall be delivered by a paying
agent designated by the Representative to the Company Securityholders as if
such amounts were being distributed pursuant to Section 3.7(a)(i). The Company
Securityholders will not receive any interest or earnings on the
Representative Holdback Amount and irrevocably transfer and assign to the
Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any
such interest or earnings. The Representative will not be liable for any loss
of principal of the Representative Holdback Amount other than as a result of
its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Representative is not acting
as a withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection with the
Representative Holdback Amount and has no tax reporting or income distribution
obligations. Subject to Advisory Group approval, the Representative may
contribute funds to the Representative Holdback Amount from any consideration
otherwise distributable to the Company Securityholders. The Representative
Holdback Amount shall be held in an FDIC-insured account or accounts at a
nationally recognized financial institution.

(f) Following the Closing Date, a majority‑in‑interest of the Company
Securityholders, by written consent, appoint a new representative as the
Representative. Notice together with a copy of the written consent appointing
such new representative and bearing the signatures of Company Securityholders
of a majority‑in‑interest of those Company Securityholders must be delivered
to Parent not less than ten (10) days prior to such appointment. Such
appointment will be effective upon the later of the date indicated in the
consent or the date such consent is received by Parent.

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event
that the Representative becomes unable or unwilling to continue in its
capacity as Representative, or if the Representative resigns as the
Representative, the Representative shall have right to assign is rights and
obligations under this Agreement without any further obligation to the
assigning party. Notice of such assignment shall be provided to Parent and the
Company Securityholders. Such appointment will be effective upon the later of
the date indicated in such notice or the date such notice is received by
Parent. The immunities and rights to indemnification shall survive the
resignation or removal of the Representative or any member of the Advisory
Group and the Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement.

(h) The Representative shall be entitled to: (i) rely upon the Spreadsheet,
(ii) rely upon any signature believed by it to be genuine, and (iii)
reasonably assume that a signatory has proper authorization to sign on behalf
of the applicable Company Securityholder or other party.

13.15 Waiver of Conflict; Treatment of Company Confidential Information. The
parties acknowledge and agree that subsequent to the Closing, the
Representative and/or any Stockholder (collectively, the "Former Stockholders"
or individually, the "Former Stockholder") shall have the right to retain
Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP ("Pillsbury") to represent any 

Former Stockholder's interest(s) in any dispute even if such representation
relates to or arises out of this Agreement, the Merger, the Ancillary
Agreements, any transaction contemplated by this Agreement or any Acquirer
(defined below) (collectively, the "Merger Dispute"). The Surviving
Corporation, Parent and each of their subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Acquirers" or individually, the "Acquirer") hereby irrevocably waive, consent
to and covenant not to assert any objection, based on conflict of interest or
otherwise, to any representation of any Former Stockholder by Pillsbury in any
Merger Dispute. Each Acquirer further agrees that, as to all pre-Closing
attorney-client privileged materials relating to Pillsbury and the Merger
Dispute ("Privileged Materials") are (a) deemed the sole property of the
Representative and (b) may only be controlled, reviewed, utilized or otherwise
accessed by the Representative and shall not pass to or be claimed by any
Acquirer on any ground, including waiver. Except as to Privileged Materials,
any other pre-Closing privileged communications maintained by the Company
shall be the sole property of the Surviving Corporation. The Parties agree
that Privileged Materials do not include materials or other communications
that constitute evidence of fraud by any of the Former Stockholders.

13.16 Non-Recourse. This Agreement may be enforced only against, and any claim
or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby may be brought only against, the entities
that are expressly named as parties hereto and then only with respect to the

otherwise, or based upon any theory that seeks to impose liability of an
entity party against its owners or affiliates) for any one or more of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or
liabilities of such named party or for any claim based on, arising out of, or
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

13.17 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts
(including by means of facsimile or other electronic means), each of which
shall be deemed an original but all of which together will constitute one and
the same instrument.

THIS VESTING AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of
[DATE], 2019 (the "Effective Date") by and between Commvault Systems, Inc., a
Delaware corporation, with its principal office at 1 Commvault Way, Tinton
Falls, NJ, 07724 ("Parent"), and [NAME] residing at STREET, CITY, STATE ZIP
("Recipient"). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement, not otherwise
defined herein, shall have the meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement (as
defined below).

RECITALS:

A. Parent, Merger Sub, Company and Representative are parties to that certain
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 3, 2019 (as it may be
amended from time to time, the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which, among
other things, Parent has agreed to purchase all of the issued and outstanding
Company Securities pursuant to the Merger, as described in the Merger
Agreement.

B. Immediately prior to the Closing, Recipient owns the issued and outstanding
Company Securities as set forth in the Spreadsheet (the "Recipient Company
Securities").

C. Company and Recipient are parties to that certain employment agreement,
dated as of September 3, 2019 (the "Employment Agreement"), which shall be
effective upon the Closing.

D. Parent and Recipient have agreed that 40% of the Closing Date Cash Merger
Consideration (the "Cash Consideration Holdback") that would otherwise be
payable to Recipient for the Recipient Company Securities under the Merger
Agreement at the Closing shall be held back by Parent, and Parent and shall
pay to Recipient the Cash Consideration Holdback pursuant to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including Schedule 1 attached hereto.

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

1.Cash Consideration Holdback. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Merger Agreement, Parent shall pay to Recipient the Cash
Consideration Holdback in immediately available funds in accordance with
Paragraph 2 hereof and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
The Cash Consideration Holdback shall become payable based on Recipient's
continued service with Parent and its Affiliates, including the Company
(collectively, the "Employer"), as described in Paragraph 2 hereof.

2. Vesting and Payment Conditions. 

(a) General Vesting and Payment Conditions. The Cash Consideration Holdback
shall vest and become payable ratably in ten quarterly substantially equal
installments, with the first installment being payable for the three (3) month
anniversary of the Effective Date and the last installment ending on the
thirty (30)-month anniversary of the Effective Date, which payment
installments are set forth in more detail on Schedule 1 attached hereto. The
last day of each quarterly (or three (3)-month) period following the Effective
Date is a "Vesting Date;" provided that the Cash Consideration Holdback will
only vest and become due and payable on a Vesting Date if Recipient's
employment with the Employer has not been terminated as of the applicable
Vesting Date. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
actual amount of Cash Consideration Holdback that vests and becomes due and
payable as of a Vesting Date is referred to as "Vested Cash". Except as
otherwise provided in subparagraph 2(b), if Recipient's employment with the
Employer has terminated for any reason prior to an applicable Vesting Date,
then, as of the Termination Date (as defined in the Employment Agreement), all
remaining amounts of Cash Consideration Holdback that are not Vested Cash as
of the Termination Date shall be forfeited, no such Cash Consideration
Holdback shall become Vested Cash and Recipient shall have no rights under or
with respect to any amounts of the Cash Consideration Holdback that are not
Vested Cash on the Termination Date.

(b) Termination Without Cause or Good Reason or by Reason of Death or
Disability. Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph 2(a), if
Recipient's employment with Company terminates prior to a Vesting Date by
reason of (i) termination by the Employer without Cause (as defined in the
Employment Agreement), (ii) termination by Recipient for Good Reason (as
defined in the Employment Agreement), or termination by reason of death or
Disability (as defined in the Employment Agreement) then all of the then
remaining unpaid amounts of Cash Consideration Holdback shall immediately vest
and become due and payable and the Termination Date shall be the "Vesting
Date."

(c) Restrictive Covenants. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
Cash Consideration Holdback pursuant to this Agreement is part of the
consideration received by Recipient in connection with the Merger and this
Agreement and the Cash Consideration Holdback is subject to Recipient's
acceptance of and agreement to be bound by the restrictive covenants set forth
in Section 10.5 of the Merger Agreement. The Cash Consideration Holdback is
subject to forfeiture in the event of a breach by Recipient of any of the
restrictive covenants set forth in Section 10.5 of the Merger Agreement.

(d) Payments. Parent or the Paying Agent (as defined in the Merger Agreement)
shall pay to Recipient each payment of Vested Cash no later than two weeks
following the applicable Vesting Date. Payments of Vested Cash to Recipient
shall not be processed through payroll or subject to withholding taxes.

3. Tax Reporting. The parties agree to treat the Cash Consideration Holdback as consideration for Recipient Company Securities for tax purposes and to report consistently with such treatment. 

4. Transferability. Neither the Recipient's rights to the Cash Consideration Holdback nor any payments hereunder may be transferred, assigned or pledged (whether by operation of law or otherwise), except as provided by will or the applicable laws of intestacy.

5. No Employment Rights. Nothing in this Agreement shall be considered to confer on Recipient any right to continue in the employ of the Employer or to limit the right of the Employer to terminate Recipient's employment.

6. Miscellaneous

(a) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without reference to
principles of conflict of laws. Recipient irrevocably consents to the personal
jurisdiction of the state and/or federal courts with jurisdiction to hear
claims arising out of Wilmington, Delaware for any and all disputes arising
out of or related to this Agreement, and the Parties agree that such courts
shall be the exclusive forum for any and all disputes arising out of or
related to this Agreement.

(b) Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding on Parent and Recipient
and on Recipient's respective successors and permitted assigns.

(c) Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law,
but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect
any other provision or any other jurisdiction, but this Agreement will be
reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein.

(d) Complete Agreement. This Agreement (together with the exhibits attached
hereto), the Merger Agreement, the Employment Agreement and other documents
executed in connection with the Merger Agreement embody the complete agreement
and understanding among the parties and supersede and preempt any prior
understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties, written
or oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way.

(e) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts
(including by means of facsimile or portable document file (.pdf)), each of

(d) Disbursement Upon Expiration of Indemnification Escrow. On the second
anniversary of the Closing Date, which is expected to be October 1, 2019 (the
"Indemnification Escrow Expiration Date"), the Parties shall deliver a Joint
Written Instruction to Escrow Agent instructing Escrow Agent to release and
deliver the entire remaining balance, if any, of the Escrow Account, less the
aggregate amount that in the reasonable judgment of the Parties may be
necessary to satisfy any unresolved or unsatisfied claims for indemnifiable
Losses specified in any Claim Certificate delivered to the Representative
(such amount, the "Pending Claims Amount"), to (i) the Paying Agent for
further distribution to the Company Stockholders, holders of Company Warrants
and holders of Convertible Notes in accordance with their Pro Rata Share as
set forth in the Spreadsheet and (ii) the Surviving Corporation for further
distribution to holders of Cashed Out Company Options in accordance with their
Pro Rata Share as set forth in an updated Holders List as indicated in the
Paying Agent Agreement . From time to time after the release, if any, of funds
as contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence, to the extent the funds
remaining in the Escrow Account exceed the aggregate Pending Claims Amount
(after the settlement or resolution, as applicable, of pending claims from
time to time), such excess shall be promptly released and 

delivered by Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms hereof as directed in a
written instruction to the Escrow Agent by the Representative.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 8, any
instructions setting forth, claiming, containing, objecting to, or in any way
related to the transfer or distribution of the Fund, must be in writing and
executed by the appropriate Party or Parties as evidenced by the signatures of
the person or persons signing this Agreement or one of the designated persons
as set forth on the Designation of Authorized Representatives attached hereto
as Schedule 1-A and 1-B (each an "Authorized Representative"), and delivered
to Escrow Agent only by confirmed facsimile or as a Portable Document Format
("PDF") attached to an email only at the fax number or email address set forth
in Section 8 below. Each Designation of Authorized Representatives shall be
signed by a Secretary, any Assistant Secretary or other duly authorized person
of the named Party. No instruction for or related to the transfer or
distribution of the Fund shall be deemed delivered and effective unless Escrow
Agent actually shall have received it by facsimile or as a PDF attached to an
email only at the fax number or email address set forth in Section 8 and in
the case of a facsimile, as evidenced by a confirmed transmittal to the
Party's or Parties' transmitting fax number. Escrow Agent shall not be liable
to any Party or other person for refraining from acting upon any instruction
for or related to the transfer or distribution of the Fund if delivered to any
other fax number or email address, including but not limited to a valid email
address of any employee of Escrow Agent. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, the Parties acknowledge and agree that Escrow Agent (i) shall have
no obligation to take any action in connection with this Agreement on a non-
Business Day and any action Escrow Agent may otherwise be required to perform
on a non-Business Day may be performed by Escrow Agent on the following
Business Day and (ii) may not transfer or distribute the Fund until Escrow
Agent has completed its security procedures.

(a) Parent authorizes Escrow Agent to use the funds transfer instructions
("Initial Standing Instructions") specified for it below to disburse any funds
due to Parent, without a verifying call-back or email confirmation as set
forth below:


 

--- 
| 

Parent:

Credit A/C #

If Applicable:

(b) In the event any funds transfer instructions other than the Initial
Standing Instructions are set forth in a permitted instruction from a Party or
the Parties in accordance with this Agreement (any such additional funds
transfer instructions, "Additional Standing Instructions" and, together 

with the Initial Standing Instructions, the "Standing Instructions"), Escrow
Agent will confirm such Additional Standing Instructions by a telephone call-
back or email confirmation to an Authorized Representative of such Party or
Parties, and Escrow Agent may rely and act upon the confirmation of anyone
purporting to be that Authorized Representative. No funds will be disbursed
until such confirmation occurs. Each Party agrees that after such
confirmation, Escrow Agent may continue to rely solely upon such Additional
Standing Instructions and all identifying information set forth therein for
such beneficiary without an additional telephone call-back or email
confirmation. Further, it is understood and agreed that if multiple
disbursements are provided for under this Agreement pursuant to any Standing
Instructions, only the date, amount and/or description of payments may change
without requiring a telephone call-back or email confirmation.

(c) The persons designated as Authorized Representatives and telephone numbers
for same may be changed only in a writing executed by an Authorized
Representative or other duly authorized person of the applicable Party setting
forth such changes and actually received by Escrow Agent via facsimile or as a
PDF attached to an email. Escrow Agent will confirm any such change in
Authorized Representatives by a telephone call-back or email confirmation to
an Authorized Representative and Escrow Agent may rely and act upon the
confirmation of anyone purporting to be that Authorized Representative.

(d) Escrow Agent, any intermediary bank and the beneficiary's bank in any
funds transfer may rely upon the identifying number of the beneficiary's bank
or any intermediary bank included in a funds transfer instruction provided by
a Party or the Parties and, if applicable, confirmed in accordance with this
Agreement. Further, the beneficiary's bank in the funds transfer instructions
may make payment on the basis of the account number provided in such Party's
or the Parties' instruction and, if applicable, confirmed in accordance with
this Agreement even though it identifies a person different from the named
beneficiary.

(e) As used in this Section 3, "Business Day" shall mean any day other than a
Saturday, Sunday or any other day on which Escrow Agent located at the notice
address set forth below is authorized or required by law or executive order to
remain closed. The Parties acknowledge that the security procedures set forth
in this Section 3 are commercially reasonable. Upon delivery of the Fund in
full by Escrow Agent pursuant to this Section 3, this Agreement shall
terminate, and all the related account(s) shall be closed, subject to the
provisions of Sections 6 and 7.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
the event that an electronic signature is affixed to an instruction issued
hereunder to disburse or transfer funds, such instruction shall be confirmed
by a verifying call-back (or email confirmation) to an Authorized
Representative.

4. Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent shall have only those duties as are specifically and expressly provided herein, which shall be deemed purely ministerial in nature, and no other duties, including but not limited to any fiduciary duty, shall be implied. Escrow Agent has no knowledge of, nor any obligation to comply with, the terms and conditions of any other agreement between the Parties, nor shall Escrow Agent be required to determine if any Party has complied with any other agreement. Notwithstanding the terms of any other agreement between the Parties, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control the actions of Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent may conclusively rely 

upon any written notice, document, instruction or request delivered by the
Parties believed by it in good faith to be genuine and to have been signed by
an Authorized Representative(s), as applicable, without inquiry and without
requiring substantiating evidence of any kind and Escrow Agent shall be under
no duty to inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy or content of
any such document, notice, instruction or request. Any notice, document,
instruction or request delivered by a Party but not required under this
Agreement may be disregarded by Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent shall not be liable
for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in good faith
except to the extent that Escrow Agent's gross negligence or willful
misconduct was the cause of any direct loss to either Party. Escrow Agent may
execute any of its powers and perform any of its duties hereunder directly or
through affiliates or agents. In the event Escrow Agent shall be uncertain, or
believes there is some ambiguity, as to its duties or rights hereunder or
receives instructions, claims or demands from any Party hereto which in Escrow
Agent's judgment conflict with the provisions of this Agreement, or if Escrow
Agent receives conflicting instructions from the Parties, Escrow Agent shall
be entitled either to: (a) refrain from taking any action until it shall be
given (i) a Joint Written Instruction executed by Authorized Representatives
of the Parties which eliminates such ambiguity or conflict or (ii) a court
order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction (it being understood that
Escrow Agent shall be entitled conclusively to rely and act upon any such
court order and shall have no obligation to determine whether any such court
order is final); or (b) file an action in interpleader. Escrow Agent shall
have no duty to solicit any payments which may be due it or the Fund,
including, without limitation, the Escrow Deposit nor shall Escrow Agent have
any duty or obligation to confirm or verify the accuracy or correctness of any
amounts deposited with it hereunder. The Parties grant to Escrow Agent a lien
and security interest in the Fund in order to secure any indemnification
obligations of the Parties or obligation for fees or expenses owed to Escrow
Agent hereunder. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,
in no event shall Escrow Agent be liable for special, incidental, punitive,
indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but
not limited to lost profits), even if Escrow Agent has been advised of the
likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.

5. Succession. Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties or obligations hereunder by giving no less than thirty (30) days advance notice in writing of such resignation to the Parties or may be removed, with or without cause, by the Parties at any time after giving not less than thirty (30) days advance Joint Written Instruction to Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent's sole responsibility after such thirty (30) day notice period expires shall be to hold the Fund (without any obligation to reinvest the same) and to deliver the same to a designated substitute escrow agent, if any, appointed by the Parties, or such other person designated by the Parties, or in accordance with the directions of a final court order, at which time of delivery, Escrow Agent's obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate. If prior to the effective resignation or removal date, the Parties have failed to appoint a successor escrow agent, or to instruct Escrow Agent to deliver the Fund to another person as provided above, or if such delivery is contrary to applicable law, at any time on or after the effective resignation date, Escrow Agent may either interplead the Fund with a court located in the State of Delaware and the costs, expenses and reasonable attorney's fees which are incurred in connection with such proceeding may be charged against and withdrawn from the Fund. Any appointment of a successor escrow agent shall be binding upon the Parties and no appointed successor escrow agent shall be deemed to be an agent of Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent shall deliver the Fund to any appointed successor escrow agent, at which time Escrow Agent's obligations under 

this Agreement shall cease and terminate. Any entity into which Escrow Agent
may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any entity
to which all or substantially all the escrow business may be transferred,
shall be Escrow Agent under this Agreement without further act.

6. Compensation; Acknowledgment. (a) The Parent agrees to pay Escrow Agent upon execution of this Agreement and from time to time thereafter reasonable compensation for the services to be rendered hereunder, which unless otherwise agreed in writing, shall be as described in Schedule 2.

(a) Each of the Parties further agrees to the disclosures and agreements set
forth in Schedule 2.

7. Indemnification and Reimbursement. Parent and the Representative (on behalf of the Company Securityholders)agree jointly and severally to indemnify, defend, hold harmless, pay or reimburse Escrow Agent and its affiliates and their respective successors, assigns, directors, agents and employees (the "Indemnitees") from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, liabilities, costs or expenses (including attorney's fees) (collectively "Losses"), resulting directly or indirectly from (a) Escrow Agent's performance of this Agreement, except to the extent that such Losses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been caused by the gross negligence, willful misconduct, or bad faith of such Indemnitee; and (b) Escrow Agent's following, accepting or acting upon any instructions or directions, whether joint or singular, from the Parties received in accordance with this Agreement. The obligations set forth in this Section 7 shall survive the resignation, replacement or removal of Escrow Agent or the termination of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that the intent of the parenthetical "(on behalf of the Company Securityholders") in this Section is to clarify that the Company Securityholders and the Representative are the parties with economic interests in the Merger Agreement, and the Company Securityholders shall ultimately be responsible to the Representative for any indemnification obligations or liabilities that the Representative has to the Escrow Agent hereunder. Accordingly, such clauses clarify the Representative's recourse to the Company Security holders and are not meant to limit the Representative's capacity or liability as between itself and the Escrow Agent under the Indemnity in this Section or under any other provision in this Agreement.

8. Notices. Except as otherwise provided in Section 3, all communications hereunder shall be in writing or set forth in a PDF attached to an email, and shall be delivered by facsimile, email or overnight courier only to the appropriate fax number, email address, or notice address set forth for each party as follows, provided that notices to the Representative shall be delivered solely by facsimile or email:

9. Compliance with Directives. In the event that a legal garnishment, attachment, levy, restraining notice, court order or other governmental order (a "Directive") is served with respect to any of the Fund, or the delivery thereof shall be stayed or enjoined by a Directive, Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to obey and comply with all such Directives so entered or issued, and in the event that Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such Directive it shall not be liable to any of the Parties hereto or to any other person by reason of such compliance notwithstanding such Directive be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated. Escrow Agent shall, to the extent permitted therein, notify the Parties as soon as practicable of such garnishment, attachment, levy, restraining notice or court order after an officer of the Escrow Agent listed in Section 8 has received actual notice of such garnishment, attachment, levy, restraining notice or court order.

10. Miscellaneous. (a) The provisions of this Agreement may be waived, altered, amended or supplemented only by a writing signed by Escrow Agent and the Parties. Neither this Agreement 

nor any right or interest hereunder may be assigned by any Party without the
prior consent of Escrow Agent and the other Party and any assignment in
violation of this Agreement shall be ineffective and void. This Agreement
shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Delaware.
Each Party and Escrow Agent irrevocably waives any objection on the grounds of
venue, forum non-conveniens or any similar grounds and irrevocably consents to
service of process by mail or in any other manner permitted by applicable law
and consents to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the State of
Delaware. To the extent that in any jurisdiction either Party may now or
hereafter be entitled to claim for itself or its assets, immunity from suit,
execution, attachment (before or after judgment) or other legal process or
immunity from liability, such Party shall not claim, and hereby irrevocably
waives, such immunity. Escrow Agent and the Parties further hereby waive any
right to a trial by jury with respect to any lawsuit or judicial proceeding
arising or relating to this Agreement.

(a) No party to this Agreement is liable to any other party for losses due to,
or if it is unable to perform its obligations under the terms of this
Agreement because of, acts of God, fire, war, terrorism, floods, strikes,
electrical outages, equipment or transmission failure, or other causes
reasonably beyond its control. This Agreement and any joint instructions from
the Parties may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall
be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the
same instrument or instruction, as applicable. This Agreement may be executed
and transmitted by facsimile or as a PDF attached to an email and each such
execution shall be of the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a
manually executed original, wet-inked signature. All signatures of the parties
to this Agreement may be transmitted by facsimile or as a PDF attached to an
email, and such facsimile or PDF will, for all purposes, be deemed to be the
original signature of such party whose signature it reproduces, and will be
binding upon such party. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to
be prohibited or unenforceable by reason of any applicable law of a
jurisdiction, then such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions thereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in such jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provisions in any other jurisdiction. The Parties each
represent, warrant and covenant that (i) each document, notice, instruction or
request provided by such Party to Escrow Agent shall comply with applicable
laws and regulations; (ii) such Party has full power and authority to enter
into this Agreement and to perform all of the duties and obligations to be
performed by it hereunder; and (iii) the person(s) executing this Agreement on
such Party's behalf and certifying Authorized Representatives in the
applicable Schedule 1 has been duly and properly authorized to do so, and each
Authorized Representative of such Party has been duly and properly authorized
to take actions specified for such person in the applicable Schedule 1. Except
as expressly provided in Section 7 above, nothing in this Agreement, whether
express or implied, shall be construed to give to any person or entity other
than Escrow Agent and the Parties any legal or equitable right, remedy,
interest or claim under or in respect of the Fund or this Agreement.





IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the
date set forth above.

Agreement constitute or contain (i) proceeds of municipal securities
(including investment income therefrom and monies pledged or otherwise legally
dedicated to serve as collateral or a source or repayment for such securities)
or (ii) municipal escrow investments (as each such term is defined in the
Municipal Advisor Rule). Each Party also represents and warrants to Escrow
Agent that the person providing this certification has access to the
appropriate information or has direct knowledge of the source of the funds to
be invested to enable the forgoing representation to be made. Further, each
Party acknowledges that Escrow Agent will rely on this representation until
notified in writing otherwise.

Know Your Customer. To assist in the prevention of the funding of terrorism
and money laundering activities, applicable law may require financial
institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each
person who opens an account. What this means for the Parties: when the Parties
open an account, Escrow Agent may ask for each Party's name, address, date of
birth (for natural persons), and/or other information and documents that will
allow Escrow Agent to identify such Party. Escrow Agent may also request and
obtain certain information from third parties regarding any Party. For
purposes of this provision, each Party, to the extent required by applicable
law, shall include any Authorized Representative of such Party. To fulfill
Escrow Agent's "know your customer" responsibilities, Escrow Agent may request
information from each Party from time to time, including, without limitation,
regarding such Party's organization, business and, to the extent applicable,
Authorized Representatives and beneficial owner(s) of such Party, including
relevant natural or legal persons, and such Party shall procure and furnish
the same to Escrow Agent in a timely manner. Escrow Agent may also request
further information and/or documentation in connection with its performance of
this Agreement. Any information and/or documentation furnished by any Party is
the sole responsibility of such Party and Escrow Agent is entitled to rely on
the information and/or documentation without making any verification
whatsoever (except for the authentication under the security procedures, as
applicable). Each Party represents and warrants that all such information
and/or documentation is true, correct and not misleading and shall advise
Escrow Agent promptly of any changes and, except as prohibited by applicable
law, such Party agrees to provide complete responses to Escrow Agent's
requests within the timeframes specified. If any Party fails to provide or
consent to the provision of any information required by this paragraph, Escrow
Agent may close any account or suspend or discontinue providing any service
hereunder without further notice.

OFAC Disclosure. Escrow Agent is required to act in accordance with the laws
and regulations of various jurisdictions relating to the prevention of money
laundering and the implementation of sanctions, including but not limited to
regulations issued by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. Escrow Agent
is not obligated to execute payment orders or effect any other transaction
where the beneficiary or other payee is a person or entity with whom Escrow
Agent is prohibited from doing business by any law or regulation applicable to
Escrow Agent, or in any case where compliance would, in Escrow Agent's
opinion, conflict with applicable law or banking practice or its own policies
and procedures. Where Escrow Agent does not execute a payment order or effect
a transaction for such reasons, Escrow Agent may take any action required by
any law or regulation applicable to Escrow Agent including, without
limitation, freezing or blocking funds. Transaction screening may result in
delays in the posting of transactions.

Abandoned Property. Escrow Agent is required to act in accordance with the
laws and regulations of various states relating to abandoned property,
escheatment or similar law and, accordingly, shall be entitled to remit
dormant funds to any state as abandoned property in accordance with such laws
and regulations. Without limitation of the foregoing, notwithstanding any
instruction to the contrary, Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any Party for
any amount disbursed from an account maintained under this Agreement to a
governmental entity or public official in compliance with any applicable
abandoned property, escheatment or similar law.

Information. The Parties authorize Escrow Agent to disclose information with
respect to this Agreement and the account(s) established hereunder, the
Parties, or any transaction hereunder if such disclosure is: (i) necessary in
Escrow Agent's opinion, for the purpose of allowing Escrow Agent to perform
its duties and to exercise its powers and rights hereunder or for operational
or risk management purposes or compliance with legal, tax and regulatory
requirements, including, without limitation, FATCA; (ii) to a proposed
assignee of the rights of Escrow Agent; (iii) to a branch, affiliate,
subsidiary, employee or agent of Escrow Agent or to their auditors, regulators
or legal advisers or to any competent court; (iv) to the auditors of any of
the Parties; or (v) required by applicable law, regardless of whether the
disclosure is made in the country in which each Party resides, in which the
Escrow Account is maintained, or in which the transaction is conducted. The
Parties agree that such disclosures by Escrow Agent and its affiliates may be
transmitted across national boundaries and through networks, including those
owned by third parties.

Foreign Exchange. If Escrow Agent accepts a funds transfer instruction under
this Agreement for payment in a currency (the "Non-Account Currency") other
than the currency of the account (the "Account Currency"), Escrow Agent is
authorized to enter into a foreign exchange transaction to sell to the Party
or Parties the amount of Non-Account Currency required to complete the funds
transfer and debit the account for the purchase price of the Non-Account
Currency. If Escrow Agent receives a payment to the account in a Non-Account
Currency, Escrow Agent is authorized to purchase the Non-Account Currency from
the Party or Parties, and to credit the purchase price to the account in lieu
of the Non-Account Currency. The applicable foreign exchange rate and spread
for any of the foregoing transactions shall be determined by Escrow Agent in
its sole discretion and may differ from foreign exchange rates and spreads at
which comparable transactions are entered into with other customers or the
range of foreign exchange rates or spreads at which Escrow Agent otherwise
enters into foreign exchange transactions on the relevant date. Escrow Agent
may generate additional profit or loss in connection with Escrow Agent's
execution of a foreign exchange transaction or management of its risk related
thereto in addition to the applicable spread. Further, (i) Escrow Agent has
full discretion to execute such foreign exchange transactions in such manner
as Escrow Agent determines in its sole discretion and (ii) Escrow Agent may
manage the associated risks of Escrow Agent's own position in the market in a
manner it deems appropriate without regard to the impact of such activities on
the Parties. Any such foreign exchange transaction will be between Escrow
Agent and a Party or Parties as principals, and Escrow Agent will not be
acting as agent or fiduciary for the Parties.

Acknowledgment of Compensation and Multiple Roles. Escrow Agent is authorized
to act under this Agreement notwithstanding that Escrow Agent or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates (such subsidiaries and affiliates hereafter
individually called an "Affiliate" and collectively called "Affiliates") may
(A) receive fees or derive earnings (float) as a result of providing an
investment product or account on the books of Escrow Agent pursuant to this
Agreement or for providing services or referrals with respect to investment
products, or (B) (i) act in the same transaction in multiple capacities, (ii)
engage in other transactions or relationships with the same entities to which
Escrow Agent may be providing escrow or other services under this Agreement,
(iii) refer clients to an Affiliate for services or (iv) enter into agreements
under which referrals of escrow or related transactions are provided to Escrow
Agent. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may earn compensation from any of these
activities in addition to the fees charged for services under this Agreement.

FDIC Disclosure. In the event Escrow Agent becomes insolvent or enters into
receivership, Escrow Agent may provide to the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation ("FDIC") account balance information for any account governed by
this Agreement, as reflected on Escrow Agent's end-of-day ledger balance, and
the customer name and tax identification number associated with such accounts
for the purposes of determining the appropriate deposit insurance coverage.
Funds held in such accounts will be insured by the FDIC under its applicable
rules and limits.

THE FOLLOWING DISCLOSURES ARE REQUIRED TO BE PROVIDED UNDER APPLICABLE U.S.
REGULATIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATION D.
WHERE SPECIFIC INVESTMENTS ARE NOTED BELOW, THE DISCLOSURES APPLY ONLY TO
THOSE INVESTMENTS AND NOT TO ANY OTHER INVESTMENT.

Demand Deposit Account Disclosure. Escrow Agent is authorized, for regulatory
reporting and internal accounting purposes, to divide an escrow demand deposit
account maintained in the U.S. in which the Fund is held into a non-interest
bearing demand deposit internal account and a non-interest bearing savings
internal account, and to transfer funds on a daily basis between these
internal accounts on Escrow Agent's general ledger in accordance with U.S. law
at no cost to the Parties. Escrow Agent will record the internal accounts and
any transfers between them on Escrow Agent's books and records only. The
internal accounts and any transfers between them will not affect the Fund, any
investment or disposition of the Fund, use of the escrow demand deposit
account or any other activities under this Agreement, except as described
herein. Escrow Agent will establish a target balance for the demand deposit
internal account, which may change at any time. To the extent funds in the
demand deposit internal account exceed the target balance, the excess will be
transferred to the savings internal account, unless the maximum number of
transfers from the savings internal account for that calendar month or
statement cycle has already occurred. If withdrawals from the demand deposit
internal account exceeds the available balance in the demand deposit internal
account, funds from the savings internal account will be transferred to the
demand deposit internal account up to the entire balance of available funds in
the savings internal account to cover the shortfall and to replenish any
target balance that Escrow Agent has established for the demand deposit
internal account. If a sixth transfer is needed during a calendar month or
statement cycle, it will be for the entire balance in the savings internal
account, and such funds will remain in the demand deposit internal account for
the remainder of the calendar month or statement cycle.

MMDA Disclosure and Agreement. If MMDA is the investment for the escrow
deposit as set forth above or anytime in the future, the Parties acknowledge
and agree that U.S. law limits the number of pre-authorized or automatic
transfers or withdrawals or telephonic/electronic instructions that can be
made from an MMDA to a total of six (6) per calendar month or statement cycle
or similar period. Escrow Agent is required by U.S. law to reserve the right
to require at least seven (7) days' notice prior to a withdrawal from a money
market deposit account.

Unlawful Internet Gambling. The use of any account to conduct transactions
(including, without limitation, the acceptance or receipt of funds through an
electronic funds transfer, or by check, draft or similar instrument, or the
proceeds of any of the foregoing) that are related, directly or indirectly, to
unlawful Internet gambling is strictly prohibited.

Recordings. Each Party and Escrow Agent consent to the other party or parties
making and retaining recordings of telephone conversations between any Party
or Parties on one hand and Escrow Agent on the other hand in connection with
Escrow Agent's security procedures.

Use of Electronic Records and Signatures. As used in this Agreement, the terms
"writing" and "written" include electronic records, and the terms "execute",
"signed" and "signature" include the use of electronic signatures.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the attached Exhibits
and Schedules, any electronic signature that is presented as the signature of
the purported signer, regardless of the appearance or form of such electronic
signature, may be deemed genuine by Escrow Agent in Escrow Agent's sole
discretion, and such electronic signature shall be of the same legal effect,
validity and enforceability as a manually executed, original, wet-inked
signature; provided, however, that any such electronic signature must be an
actual and not a typed signature. Any electronically signed agreement shall be
an "electronic record" established in the ordinary course of business and any
copy shall constitute an original for all purposes. The terms "electronic
signature" and "electronic record" shall have the meanings ascribed to them in
15 USC § 7006\. This Agreement and any instruction or other document furnished
hereunder may be transmitted by facsimile or as a PDF file attached to an
email.

through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise
complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in
favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant
to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of
Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the
circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in
this section, the word "stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a
corporation; the words "stock" and "share" mean and include what is ordinarily
meant by those words; and the words "depository receipt" mean a receipt or
other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more
shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is
deposited with the depository.



(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series
of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be
effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g)
of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of
this title:



(1) Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this
title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the
shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in
respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders
entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the
agreement of merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a merger pursuant to
§ 251(h), as of immediately prior to the execution of the agreement of
merger), were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii)
held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no
appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent
corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its approval
the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in §
251(f) of this title.



(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under
this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock
of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms
of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255,
256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything
except:



a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger
or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;



b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect
thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or
depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will
be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more
than 2,000 holders;



c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts
described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or



d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in
lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the
foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.



(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party
to a merger effected under § 253 or § 267 of this title is not owned by the
parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available
for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.



(4) In the event of an amendment to a corporation's certificate of
incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title, appraisal rights shall
be available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of
this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this
section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word "amendment"
substituted for the words "merger or consolidation," and the word
"corporation" substituted for the words "constituent corporation" and/or
"surviving or resulting corporation."



(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that
appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of
incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a
constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets
of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a
provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in
subsections (d),(e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is
practicable.



(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:



(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are
provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of
stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting,
shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for
notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with
§ 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are
available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal
rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent
corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if
1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114
of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such
stockholder's shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of
the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of
such stockholder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably
informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the
stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's
shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not
constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do
so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the
effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting
corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who
has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented
to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation
has become effective; or



(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), §
253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation before the
effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting
corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any
class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to
appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that
appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series
of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a
copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock
corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on
or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify
such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any
stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of
mailing of such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to §
251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer
contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing
of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation
the appraisal of such holder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it
reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that
the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder's
shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of
the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation
shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or
consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of
such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the
effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or
resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on
or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such
second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first
notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this
title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by §
251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice,
such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to
appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder's shares in
accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant
secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give
either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud,
be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of
determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each
constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not
more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the
notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation,
the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and
the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is
given.



(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation,
the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has complied
with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise
entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a
petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of
the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such
stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the
merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the
requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written
request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the
merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the
aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation
(or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, the
aggregate number of shares (other than any excluded stock (as defined in §
251(h)(6)d. of this title)) that were the subject of, and were not tendered
into, and accepted for purchase or exchange in, the offer referred to in §
251(h)(2)), and, in either case, with respect to which demands for appraisal
have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such
written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such
stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the
surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the
period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this
section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this
section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held
either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such
person's own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the
statement described in this subsection.



(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy
thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which shall
within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in
Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the
names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their
shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been
reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be
filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be
accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so
ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the
hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or
resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the
addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more
publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of
general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such
publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and
by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be
borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.



(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the
stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled
to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded
an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates
to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation
thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder
fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as
to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the
shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to
which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities
exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such
shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total
number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of
the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration
provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares
exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267
of this title.



(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the
appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the
Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal
proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value
of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with
interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.
In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant
factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good
cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the
effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall
be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve
discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time
during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of
payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the
proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to
appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as
provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the
amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court,
and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon
application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder
entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its
discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final
determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder
whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation
pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such
stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is
required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally
determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under
this section.



(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares,
together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to
the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such
stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the
case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to
the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court's
decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be
enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of
this State or of any state.



(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon
the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon
application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the
expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal
proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the
fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all
the shares entitled to an appraisal.



(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no
stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of
this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to
receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except
dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date
which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation);
provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within
the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder
shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal
of such stockholder's demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger
or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger
or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter
with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such
stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any
stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be
conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that
this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party
to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms
offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective
date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this
section.



(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares
of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they assented to
the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued
shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.





Exhibit C



California Corporations Code - Chapter 13: Dissenters' Rights



§ 1300\. Shareholder in short-form merger; Purchase at fair market value;
"Dissenting shares"; "Dissenting shareholder"



(a) If the approval of the outstanding shares (Section 152) of a corporation
is required for a reorganization under subdivisions (a) and (b) or subdivision
(e) or (f) of Section 1201, each shareholder of the corporation entitled to
vote on the transaction and each shareholder of a subsidiary corporation in a
short-form merger may, by complying with this chapter, require the corporation
in which the shareholder holds shares to purchase for cash at their fair
market value the shares owned by the shareholder which are dissenting shares
as defined in subdivision (b). The fair market value shall be determined as of
the day of, and immediately prior to, the first announcement of the terms of
the proposed reorganization or short-form merger, excluding any appreciation
or depreciation in consequence of the proposed reorganization or short-form
merger, as adjusted for any stock split, reverse stock split, or share
dividend that becomes effective thereafter.



(b) As used in this chapter, "dissenting shares" means shares to which all of
the following apply:



(1) That were not, immediately prior to the reorganization or short-form
merger, listed on any national securities exchange certified by the
Commissioner of Corporations under subdivision (o) of Section 25100, and the
notice of meeting of shareholders to act upon the reorganization summarizes
this section and Sections 1301, 1302, 1303 and 1304; provided, however, that
this provision does not apply to any shares with respect to which there exists
any restriction on transfer imposed by the corporation or by any law or
regulation; and provided, further, that this provision does not apply to any
shares where the holder of those shares is required, by the terms of the
reorganization or short-form merger, to accept for the shares anything except:
(A) shares of any other corporation, which shares, at the time the
reorganization or short-form merger is effective, are listed on any national
securities exchange certified by the Commissioner of Corporations under
subdivision (o) of Section 25100; (B) cash in lieu of fractional shares
described in the foregoing subparagraph (A); or (C) any combination of the
shares and cash in lieu of fractional shares described in the foregoing
subparagraphs (A) and (B).



(2) That were outstanding on the date for the determination of shareholders
entitled to vote on the reorganization and (A) were not voted in favor of the
reorganization or, (B) if described in paragraph (1), were voted against the
reorganization, or were held of record on the effective date of a short-form
merger; provided, however, that subparagraph (A) rather than subparagraph (B)
of this paragraph applies in any case where the approval required by Section
1201 is sought by written consent rather than at a meeting.



(3) That the dissenting shareholder has demanded that the corporation purchase
at their fair market value, in accordance with Section 1301.



(4) That the dissenting shareholder has submitted for endorsement, in
accordance with Section 1302.



(c) As used in this chapter, "dissenting shareholder" means the recordholder
of dissenting shares and includes a transferee of record.



§ 1301\. Notice to holder of dissenting shares of reorganization approval;
Demand for purchase of shares; Contents of demand



(a) If, in the case of a reorganization, any shareholders of a corporation
have a right under Section 1300, subject to compliance with paragraphs (3) and
(4) of subdivision (b) thereof, to require the corporation to purchase their
shares for cash, that corporation shall mail to each of those shareholders a
notice of the approval of the reorganization by its outstanding shares
(Section 152) within 10 days after the date of that approval, accompanied by a
copy of Sections 1300, 1302, 1303, and 1304 and this section, a statement of
the price determined by the corporation to represent the fair market value of
the dissenting shares, and a brief description of the procedure to be followed
if the shareholder desires to exercise the shareholder's right under those
sections. The statement of price constitutes an offer by the corporation to
purchase at the price stated any dissenting shares as defined in subdivision
(b) of Section 1300, unless they lose their status as dissenting shares under
Section 1309.



(b) Any shareholder who has a right to require the corporation to purchase the
shareholder's shares for cash under Section 1300, subject to compliance with
paragraphs (3) and (4) of subdivision (b) thereof, and who desires the
corporation to purchase shares shall make written demand upon the corporation
for the purchase of those shares and payment to the shareholder in cash of
their fair market value. The demand is not effective for any purpose unless it
is received by the corporation or any transfer agent thereof (1) in the case
of shares described in subdivision (b) of Section 1300, not later than the
date of the shareholders' meeting to vote upon the reorganization, or (2) in
any other case, within 30 days after the date on which the notice of the
approval by the outstanding shares pursuant to subdivision (a) or the notice
pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1110 was mailed to the shareholder.



(c) The demand shall state the number and class of the shares held of record
by the shareholder which the shareholder demands that the corporation purchase
and shall contain a statement of what the shareholder claims to be the fair
market value of those shares as determined pursuant to subdivision (a) of
Section 1300. The statement of fair market value constitutes an offer by the
shareholder to sell the shares at that price.



§ 1302\. Stamping or endorsing dissenting shares

Within 30 days after the date on which notice of the approval by the
outstanding shares or the notice pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1110
was mailed to the shareholder, the shareholder shall submit to the corporation
at its principal office or at the office of any transfer agent thereof, (a) if
the shares are certificated securities, the shareholder's certificates
representing any shares which the shareholder demands that the corporation
purchase, to be stamped or endorsed with a statement that the shares are
dissenting shares or to be exchanged for certificates of appropriate
denomination so stamped or endorsed or (b) if the shares are uncertificated
securities, written notice of the number of shares which the shareholder
demands that the corporation purchase. Upon subsequent transfers of the
dissenting shares on the books of the corporation, the new certificates,
initial transaction statement, and other written statements issued therefor
shall bear a like statement, together with the name of the original dissenting
holder of the shares.

§ 1303\. Dissenting shareholder entitled to agreed price with interest
thereon; When price to be paid



(a) If the corporation and the shareholder agree that the shares are
dissenting shares and agree upon the price of the shares, the dissenting
shareholder is entitled to the agreed price with interest thereon at the legal
rate on judgments from the date of the agreement. Any agreements fixing the
fair market value of any dissenting shares as between the corporation and the
holders thereof shall be filed with the secretary of the corporation.

(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 1306, payment of the fair market
value of dissenting shares shall be made within 30 days after the amount
thereof has been agreed or within 30 days after any statutory or contractual
conditions to the reorganization are satisfied, whichever is later, and in the
case of certificated securities, subject to surrender of the certificates
therefor, unless provided otherwise by agreement.

§ 1304\. Action by dissenters to determine whether shares are dissenting
shares or fair market value of dissenting shares or both; Joinder of
shareholders; Consolidation of actions; Determination of issues; Appointment
of appraisers



(a) If the corporation denies that the shares are dissenting shares, or the
corporation and the shareholder fail to agree upon the fair market value of
the shares, then the shareholder demanding purchase of such shares as
dissenting shares or any interested corporation, within six months after the
date on which notice of the approval by the outstanding shares (Section 152)
or notice pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1110 was mailed to the
shareholder, but not thereafter, may file a complaint in the superior court of
the proper county praying the court to determine whether the shares are
dissenting shares or the fair market value of the dissenting shares or both or
may intervene in any action pending on such a complaint.

(b) Two or more dissenting shareholders may join as plaintiffs or be joined as
defendants in any such action and two or more such actions may be
consolidated.

(c) On the trial of the action, the court shall determine the issues. If the
status of the shares as dissenting shares is in issue, the court shall first
determine that issue. If the fair market value of the dissenting shares is in
issue, the court shall determine, or shall appoint one or more impartial
appraisers to determine, the fair market value of the shares.

§ 1305\. Duty and report of appraisers; Court's confirmation of report;
Determination of fair market value by court; Judgment and payment; Appeal;
Costs of action



(a) If the court appoints an appraiser or appraisers, they shall proceed
forthwith to determine the fair market value per share. Within the time fixed
by the court, the appraisers, or a majority of them, shall make and file a
report in the office of the clerk of the court. Thereupon, on the motion of
any party, the report shall be submitted to the court and considered on such
evidence as the court considers relevant. If the court finds the report
reasonable, the court may confirm it.

(b) If a majority of the appraisers appointed fail to make and file a report
within 10 days from the date of their appointment or within such further time
as may be allowed by the court or the report is not confirmed by the court,
the court shall determine the fair market value of the dissenting shares.

(c) Subject to the provisions of Section 1306, judgment shall be rendered
against the corporation for payment of an amount equal to the fair market
value of each dissenting share multiplied by the number of dissenting shares
which any dissenting shareholder who is a party, or who has intervened, is
entitled to require the corporation to purchase, with interest thereon at the
legal rate from the date on which judgment was entered.

(d) Any such judgment shall be payable forthwith with respect to
uncertificated securities and, with respect to certificated securities, only
upon the endorsement and delivery to the corporation of the certificates for
the shares described in the judgment. Any party may appeal from the judgment.

(e) The costs of the action, including reasonable compensation to the
appraisers to be fixed by the court, shall be assessed or apportioned as the
court considers equitable, but, if the appraisal exceeds the price offered by
the corporation, the corporation shall pay the costs (including in the
discretion of the court attorneys' fees, fees of expert witnesses and interest
at the legal rate on judgments from the date of compliance with Sections 1300,
1301 and 1302 if the value awarded by the court for the shares is more than
125 percent of the price offered by the corporation under subdivision (a) of
Section 1301).

§ 1306\. Prevention of payment to holders of dissenting shares of fair market
value; Effect



To the extent that the provisions of Chapter 5 prevent the payment to any
holders of dissenting shares of their fair market value, they shall become
creditors of the corporation for the amount thereof together with interest at
the legal rate on judgments until the date of payment, but subordinate to all
other creditors in any liquidation proceeding, such debt to be payable when
permissible under the provisions of Chapter 5.

§ 1307\. Disposition of dividends upon dissenting shares



Cash dividends declared and paid by the corporation upon the dissenting shares
after the date of approval of the reorganization by the outstanding shares
(Section 152) and prior to payment for the shares by the corporation shall be
credited against the total amount to be paid by the corporation therefor.



§ 1308\. Rights and privileges of dissenting shares; Withdrawal of demand for
payment



Except as expressly limited in this chapter, holders of dissenting shares
continue to have all the rights and privileges incident to their shares, until
the fair market value of their shares is agreed upon or determined. A
dissenting shareholder may not withdraw a demand for payment unless the
corporation consents thereto.

§ 1309\. When dissenting shares lose their status



Dissenting shares lose their status as dissenting shares and the holders
thereof cease to be dissenting shareholders and cease to be entitled to
require the corporation to purchase their shares upon the happening of any of
the following:

(a) The corporation abandons the reorganization. Upon abandonment of the
reorganization, the corporation shall pay on demand to any dissenting
shareholder who has initiated proceedings in good faith under this chapter all
necessary expenses incurred in such proceedings and reasonable attorneys'
fees.

(b) The shares are transferred prior to their submission for endorsement in
accordance with Section 1302 or are surrendered for conversion into shares of
another class in accordance with the articles.

(c) The dissenting shareholder and the corporation do not agree upon the
status of the shares as dissenting shares or upon the purchase price of the
shares, and neither files a complaint or intervenes in a pending action as
provided in Section 1304, within six months after the date on which notice of
the approval by the outstanding shares or notice pursuant to subdivision (h)
of Section 1110 was mailed to the shareholder.

(d) The dissenting shareholder, with the consent of the corporation, withdraws
the shareholder's demand for purchase of the dissenting shares.

§ 1310\. Suspension of proceedings for compensation or valuation pending
litigation

If litigation is instituted to test the sufficiency or regularity of the votes
of the shareholders in authorizing a reorganization, any proceedings under
Sections 1304 and 1305 shall be suspended until final determination of such
litigation.

§ 1311\. Shares to which chapter inapplicable



This chapter, except Section 1312, does not apply to classes of shares whose
terms and provisions specifically set forth the amount to be paid in respect
to such shares in the event of a reorganization or merger.

§ 1312\. Attack on validity of reorganization or short-form merger; Rights of
shareholders; Burden of proof



(a) No shareholder of a corporation who has a right under this chapter to
demand payment of cash for the shares held by the shareholder shall have any
right at law or in equity to attack the validity of the reorganization or
short-form merger, or to have the reorganization or short-form merger set
aside or rescinded, except in an action to test whether the number of shares
required to authorize or approve the reorganization have been legally voted in

or indirectly controlled by, or under common control with, another party to
the reorganization or short-form merger, in any action to attack the validity

negotiation and execution of this Agreement, the Merger Agreement, the

Merger Agreement.

options to purchase shares of Common Stock of the Company ("Options") granted
to you under the Hedvig, Inc. 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (previously called the
