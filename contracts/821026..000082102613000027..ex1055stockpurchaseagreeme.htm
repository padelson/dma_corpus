SALE AND PURCHASE



1.Agreement to Sell and Purchase. Each Seller agrees to sell, free and clear
of all Encumbrances, and the Buyer agrees to purchase, the Shares set out
opposite such Seller\'s name in SCHEDULE A, on the terms and conditions
contained in this Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

2.

|

Purchase Price. The total purchase price payable by the Buyer for the Shares
will be the sum of $145,000,000, plus or minus any amount required to be paid
pursuant to Section 2.4(e), if any, (the "Purchase Price"), payable as
follows: (i) $138,500,000 will be paid on the Closing Date by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the single bank account designated in writing
by the Seller Representative; (ii) the Holdback will be paid on the Closing
Date to the Escrow Agent to be held in trust in accordance with the terms of
the Escrow Agreement; and (iii) the amount of any Working Capital in excess of
or less than the Required Working Capital, if any, will be paid in the manner
specified in Section 2.4(e). 

| 
---|--- 

3.

|

Allocation of Purchase Price. The Purchase Price will be allocated among the
Sellers in the proportions set out in column 4 of SCHEDULE A, as such Schedule
may be amended pursuant to Section 5.9. 

| 
---|--- 

4.

|

Purchase Price/Working Capital and Accounts Receivable Adjustment. 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

The Purchase Price has been determined on the basis that the Corporation will
have Working Capital of not less than $45,000,000 (the "Required Working
Capital") on the Closing Date. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

The Buyer will prepare and deliver to the Sellers within 45 days after the
Closing Date: (i) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Corporation
and the Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet")
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied consistently with the Corporation\'s
past practices, as used in the preparation of the Financial Statements; and
(ii) a statement setting forth the consolidated Working Capital of the
Corporation and the Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Working
Capital") determined by reference to the Closing Balance Sheet (the "Working
Capital Statement"), which Working Capital Statement will also be prepared in
accordance with GAAP, applied consistently with the Corporation\'s past
practices, as used in the preparation of the Financial Statements. No change
in such accounting principles and practices will be made from those described
above, including with respect to the nature or classification of accounts. No
reserves or other accruals will be increased or created other than as a result
of objective events occurring in the underlying business other than with
respect to the Special Accruals. The Buyer will provide, or cause to be
provided to the Sellers, copies of all working papers resulting from, or used
in connection with, the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and Working
Capital Statement. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

On or prior to the 20th Business Day after the Sellers\' receipt of the
Closing Balance Sheet and the Working Capital Statement (such 20 Business Day
period, the "Objection Period"), the Sellers may 

give the Buyer a written notice (the "Objection Notice") stating in reasonable
detail the Sellers\' objections, if any, to the Closing Balance Sheet and/or
the Working Capital Statement. Any Objection Notice will specify in reasonable
detail the dollar amount and nature of any objection and the basis therefor.
Except to the extent that the Sellers make a specific objection to a specific
determination set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet and/or the Working
Capital Statement pursuant to the Objection Notice delivered to the Buyer
within the Objection Period, the Closing Balance Sheet and the Working Capital
Statement will be conclusive and binding upon the parties for purposes of
determining the adjustment in subsection (d) below.

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

If the Sellers deliver a timely Objection Notice as described in subsection
(c) above, then the Sellers and the Buyer will negotiate in good faith to
resolve any dispute regarding the Closing Balance Sheet and/or the Working
Capital Statement. If the Sellers and the Buyer are unable to resolve all
disputes regarding the Closing Balance Sheet and the Working Capital Statement
on or prior to the 20th day after the Buyer\'s receipt of the Objection
Notice, then the Sellers and the Buyer will retain an independent national
firm of chartered accountants (selected either by mutual agreement or, in the
absence of mutual agreement, within a further period of five Business Days,
such independent national firm of chartered accountants will be selected by
two such national firms, one nominated by the Sellers and the other nominated
by the Buyer) (an "Independent Accounting Firm"), to resolve the dispute as
soon as practicable, and in any event within 20 Business Days of its
appointment. The Independent Accounting Firm will act as an expert, and not as
an arbitrator, to determine, based solely on the written submissions of the
parties and not by independent investigation, only the specific items under
dispute by the parties. The Independent Accounting Firm will render a written
report as to the resolution of the dispute and the resulting computation of
the Closing Working Capital. The Closing Working Capital as determined by the
Independent Accounting Firm will, absent manifest error, be conclusive and
binding upon the parties and will constitute the Closing Working Capital for
all purposes of this Section 2.4(d). In resolving any disputed item, the
Independent Accounting Firm will be bound by the provisions of this Section
2.4(d) and may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value
for such item claimed by any party or less than the smallest value for such
item claimed by any party. The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent
Accounting Firm in resolving the dispute will be borne equally by the Sellers
(as a group) and the Buyer, except to the extent that the Closing Working
Capital, as finally determined by the Independent Accounting Firm, differs
from the Closing Working Capital initially proposed by the Buyer by more than
$100,000, in which case the fees, costs and expenses of the Independent
Accounting Firm will be borne by: (i) the Buyer if the Closing Working
Capital, as finally determined, is higher than that initially proposed, or
(ii) the Sellers if the Closing Working Capital, as finally determined, is
lower than that initially proposed. 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

If the Closing Working Capital exceeds the Required Working Capital, the Buyer
will pay such amount to the Sellers by wire transfer to an account designated
in writing by the Seller Representative. If the Closing Working Capital is
less than the Required Working Capital, the Sellers (in the proportions set
out in column 4 of SCHEDULE A) will pay such amount expressed as a positive
number to the Buyer by wire transfer to an account designated in writing by
the Buyer (the "Price Reduction"). Any payment made pursuant to this
subsection (e) will be made within ten days of the final determination of the
Closing Working Capital pursuant to this Section 2.4 and will be deemed to be
an adjustment to the Purchase Price. Any payment by the Sellers made pursuant
to this Section 2.4(e) will not be subject to any maximum liability or de
minimus threshold as set out in Section 7.4 hereof. Notwithstanding the
provision herein for a Price Reduction, the parties acknowledge that Sellers
are obligated to maintain the Required Working Capital at the Closing, and any
failure of Sellers to so maintain Required Working Capital will be a default
under Section 5.2(d), which may entitle Buyer not to consummate the Closing
and terminate the Agreement, and the existence of the Price Reduction
provision will not be construed as an amendment or waiver of Sections 5.2(d)
or 6.1(h). If the Sellers fail to maintain the Required Working Capital at the
Closing, and Buyer elects in its sole discretion to consummate the Closing,
then the Price Reduction shall be applied to reduce the Purchase Price. 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

For purposes of complying with the terms set forth herein, each party will
cooperate with and promptly make available to the other party and its auditors
and representatives all information, records, data and supporting papers
reasonably relevant to the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet, the
Objection Notice and any adjustment thereto being disputed and the resolution
of any disputes thereunder. The Buyer will cause the Corporation and the
Subsidiaries to permit the Sellers and their representatives access to such
Corporation\'s and the Subsidiaries\' books and records, facilities and
personnel, as may be reasonably required (upon reasonable advance notice) in
connection with the Sellers\' analysis of the Closing Balance Sheet and their
preparation of any Objection Notice and any adjustment thereto being disputed
and the resolution of any disputes thereunder. 
| 
---|--- 

(g)

|

The Sellers agree that the Holdback shall not be consumed in the event of any
obligation of the Sellers to pay under Section 2.4(e) and similarly the
provisions of Section 7.4 shall not apply.

the terms and conditions contained herein, and required to provide all of the
representations, warranties and covenants that are provided by the Sellers
herein, shall assume all liabilities and duties of any shareholder or Seller
for whom such shareholder is the successor in interest, and provided further
that the Pre-Closing Reorganization: (a) will not have the effect of imposing
any incremental obligations for Taxes for the Buyer, the Holdcos, the

Holdcos, the Corporation or the Subsidiaries or their respective businesses or
Assets or impose any cost, liability or expense on any of them that is not
reimbursed by Sellers. No Pre-Closing Reorganization will be considered in

policy of insurance or agreement in existence as of the date hereof; will, if
commercially reasonable, survive Closing and continue in full force and effect
for a period of not less than six years after the Closing Date. 

| 
---|--- 

11.

|

Taxes. 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

The Buyer will cause each of the Corporation, the Subsidiaries and each Holdco
to prepare and file Tax returns for all taxation years or periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date on a timely basis. The Seller Representative will
have the opportunity to review such returns before they are filed. Such
returns will be prepared consistent with prior practice, except where
otherwise required under Applicable Law. The Buyer will cooperate with the
Seller Representative to effect such filings on a timely basis. The Buyer will
cause the Corporation, Holdcos and the Subsidiaries to remit any Taxes shown
as owing on such Tax returns in a timely manner. 

| 
---|---

|

The Buyer will provide notice to the Seller Representative of any inquiries
made by, discussions with or representations or submissions proposed to be
made to any taxation authority to the extent that the subject matter thereof
relates to representations, covenants or obligations of the Sellers hereunder
or could reasonably give rise to a right of indemnity hereunder. The Buyer
will forthwith advise the Seller Representative of the substance of any such
inquiries or discussions and provide the Seller Representative with copies of
any written communications from any taxation authority relating to such
inquiries or discussions. The Buyer will provide the Seller Representative a
reasonable opportunity 

to comment on any such representations or submissions and to attend any
meeting with any such taxation authority with respect to such matters.

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

The Buyer will provide the reasonable assistance of the employees or personnel
of the Buyer, Corporation, the Subsidiaries and the accounting and legal and
other representatives and advisors of the Buyer, the Corporation and the
Subsidiaries and otherwise take such reasonable steps to cooperate with the
Seller Representative and render all reasonable assistance, as the Seller
Representative may reasonably request (including, to the extent requested by
the Seller Representative, dealing directly with any taxation authority in
relation to audits, inquiries, discussions or disputes), with respect to all
matters relating to any inquiries, discussions or disputes where the subject
matter thereof relates to representations, covenants or obligations of the
Sellers hereunder or could reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of
indemnity hereunder. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

The Buyer will, and will cause the Corporation, Holdcos and Subsidiaries to,
upon reasonable request of the Seller Representative, use all reasonable
commercial efforts to take reasonable steps, including obtaining any
certificate or other document from, or effect any filing with, any taxation
authority as may be considered desirable to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any
Taxes that could be imposed on the Corporation, Holdcos or Subsidiaries and
that could reasonably give rise to a right of indemnity hereunder, provided
that the Buyer and the Corporation will not be required to expend more than
nominal amounts of money to effect same, unless their reasonable costs of
doing so are reimbursed by the Sellers. 

12.Working Capital Certificate. The Sellers will cause the Corporation to
provide the Buyer with one unaudited Working Capital statement within ten
Business Days after receipt of a written request from the Buyer (the
"Certificate Date") (provided that such request is delivered more than ten
Business Days before Closing), such statement to be in keeping with the format
set out in SCHEDULE F and certified by the Seller Representative as being true
and complete to the Knowledge of the Sellers and prepared in accordance with
GAAP, applied consistently with the Corporation\'s past practices as used in
its preparation of Financial Statements (the "Working Capital Certificate").
Where the request is made before the 15th day of the month, the Working
Capital Certificate will be current as of the close of business on the last
Business Day of the second month preceding the Certificate Date. Where the
request is made after the 15th day of the month the Working Capital
Certificate will be current as of the close of business on the last Business
Day of the month immediately preceding the Certificate Date.

| 
---|--- 

13.

|

Accounts Receivable 

 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

The Buyer will cause the Corporation and the Subsidiaries to take commercially
reasonable efforts to collect accounts receivable which were outstanding as of
the Closing Date and included in the Working Capital Statement ("Existing
Accounts"), which efforts will be deemed not to include judicial action or
legal demand. After 120 days following Closing, the Seller Representative may
participate in the Corporation\'s collections efforts with respect to Existing
Accounts then outstanding and subject to this Section 5.13. Such participation
may include contacting customers directly, and the Buyer will cause the
Corporation and the Subsidiaries to cooperate with the Seller Representative
by providing information to enable the Seller Representative to participate in
the collection efforts, including the details of any outstanding Existing
Accounts, and the name and contact information for each applicable customer. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

If the Buyer creates additional accounts receivable from an account debtor who
is also an account debtor under certain Existing Accounts after the Closing
Date ("New Accounts"), and such account debtor makes only partial payment of
its obligations in respect of the New Accounts and the Existing Accounts, such
partial payments will be allocated to payment of the New Accounts or Existing
Accounts as such account debtor designates in writing with its payments. If
the account debtor does not make any such designation, then for the purpose of
this section, such payments will be applied on a first-issued, first-paid
basis. For any account debtor in bankruptcy proceedings, such payments will be
allocated as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the 180th day
following Closing (the "Review Date"), the Buyer will provide the Seller
Representative with a report within five Business Days after the end of each
month listing all Existing Accounts and showing in detail any payment history
as well as, in reasonable detail, a description of collection efforts. After
the Review Date, the Buyer will provide the Seller Representative with such a
report within five Business Days after the end of each month only in respect
of Existing Accounts for which the Buyer received a reimbursement for an AR
Shortfall in accordance with this Section 5.13 until the earlier of: (a) the
date on which the parties agree not to take any further collection proceedings
in respect of such accounts; or (b) the 

date on which collection of the accounts becomes statute barred pursuant to
applicable limitations legislation.

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

The Buyer will produce a statement current to the Review Date (the "AR
Statement") listing all Existing Accounts and identifying all amounts
collected with respect to such Existing Accounts and any collections of other
accounts receivable issued prior to Closing which were written off prior to
Closing and not included in the Working Capital Statement ("Other Pre-Closing
Collections"), which AR Statement will include a calculation showing, as
applicable, either: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

the amount by which the outstanding Existing Accounts exceeds the aggregate of
the reserve referred to in Section 3.1(u) and any Other Pre-Closing
Collections (as such amounts may be adjusted pursuant to the dispute
resolution proceedings described below) ("AR Shortfall"); provided that, in
respect of Existing Accounts which remain outstanding on the Review Date
because of a customer setting off obligations relating to its dealings with
the Corporation or the Subsidiaries after closing, the amount of any such set
off will be excluded from the amount of such Existing Account outstanding on
the Review Date; or 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

the amount by which the aggregate of the reserve referred to in Section 3.1(u)
and any Other Pre-Closing Collections exceeds the outstanding Existing
Accounts (as such amounts may be adjusted pursuant to the dispute resolution
proceedings described below) ("AR Surplus"). 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

The Buyer will deliver such AR Statement to the Seller Representative on or
before the fifth day of the month following the Review Date. Within ten
Business Days after receipt of the AR Statement, the Seller Representative
will either: confirm the calculation of AR Shortfall or AR Surplus, as
applicable; or dispute the calculation of AR Shortfall or AR Surplus, as
applicable, setting out in reasonable detail the Seller Representative\'s
objections to the calculation. If the Seller Representative disputes the AR
Shortfall, the process for dispute resolution in Section 2.4(d) will apply
mutatis mutandis. 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

Upon confirmation of an AR Shortfall pursuant to (e), above, the Sellers will
pay 50% of the AR Shortfall ("Indemnification Amount") to the Buyer as
follows: the Buyer will be entitled to withdraw the lesser of the
Indemnification Amount and the remaining balance of the Holdback within two
days of notice to the Escrow Agent to the Buyer, and the Sellers will pay any
remaining outstanding portion of the Indemnification Amount to the Buyer
within five Business Days of receipt of a written request from the Buyer. Upon
confirmation of an AR Surplus pursuant to (e), above, the Buyer will pay 50%
of the AR Surplus to the Sellers within five Business Days of receipt of a
written request from the Seller Representative. 

| 
---|--- 

(g)

|

In the event of a confirmed AR Shortfall the Sellers will have the right to
pay 50% of any third party costs incurred to pursue collection of accounts
after the Review Date and in such event any collections made net of expenses
will be shared. 

| 
---|--- 

(h)

|

The Sellers will have the right, upon reasonable notice and during business
hours, to designate representatives to audit the financial records of the
Corporation and the Subsidiaries to confirm compliance with this Section 5.13. 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

Several sample calculations based on the provisions of this Section are set
out at SCHEDULE W for illustrative purposes. 

14.Environmental.

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

The parties will jointly engage WESA to perform and complete as soon as
reasonably practicable the Additional Environmental Diligence and provide a
report ("WESA Report") to the parties. If, in the course of conducting the
Additional Environmental Diligence, WESA identifies: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

the presence of any contamination that, if brought to the attention of the
Ministry of the Environment, would result in the issuance of a remediation
order against the Corporation excluding, for certainty, orders arising due to
the absence of an environmental compliance approval ("MOE Event"); 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

the presence of contamination that has migrated, is, or may imminently be,
migrating off of the Owned Real Property at a level in excess of applicable
standard from the "Soil, Ground Water and Sediment Standards for Use under
Part XV.1 of the Environmental Protection Act" published by the Ministry of
the Environment and dated April 15, 2011 ("Migration Event"); or 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

the presence of any contamination (other than those parameters excluded by the
public health unit) exceeding the Ontario Drinking Water Quality Standards in
a groundwater aquifer that is used for drinking water within 250 metres of the
boundary of the Owned Real Property ("Water Event"); 

then the parties will direct WESA to provide its reasonable estimate of the
cost of remediating such condition, in the case of an MOE Event, such that the
Ministry of Environment would not issue a 

remediation order, and in the case of an Environmental Event, to the
applicable standard described above, and include such estimate in the WESA
Report.

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

If the WESA Report identifies one or more MOE Events with an aggregate
estimated remediation cost of $1,000,000 or less, then the Closing Working
Capital will be deemed to be reduced by an amount equal to such aggregate
estimated remediation cost. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

If the WESA Report identifies one or more Migration Events or Water Events
(together, "Environmental Events") and the aggregate estimated remediation
cost for such events is greater than $1,000,000 but less than $2,000,000, then
the Closing Working Capital will be deemed to be reduced by an amount equal to
the amount by which the estimated remediation cost exceeds $1,000,000. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

For the purpose of this section, if the estimated cost of remediation
specified in the WESA is a range, the parties will use the median of such
range as the estimated remediation cost. 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

All costs incurred in connection with the WESA Report will be shared and paid
50% by the Buyer and 50% by the Sellers.

1.Survival of Representations and Warranties. The representations and
warranties of the Sellers in this Agreement will survive Closing and the
payment of the Purchase Price and will continue in full force and effect for a
period of 18 months from the Closing Date: (i) except that the representations
and warranties of the Sellers with respect to Taxes contained in Sections
3.1(h)(xiii), 3.1(oo), 3.1(pp), 3.1(qq) and 3.1(rr) will remain in full force
and effect for a period of 90 days after the later of: (A) the last date on

Taxes can be made against the Relevant Holdco, Corporation or the
Subsidiaries, as applicable, in respect of the period up to the Closing Date;
and (B) the date on which the period for an appeal in respect of an

3.1(e), 3.1(h), 3.1(j) and 3.1(k) (together, "Fundamental Representations")
will survive indefinitely; and (iii) except that the representations and
warranties of the Sellers in Section 3.1(nn) will survive for a period of
three years from the Closing Date; and (iv) except that there will be no time

| 
---|--- 

2.

|

Indemnification of Buyer. The Sellers severally, and not jointly unless
otherwise expressly indicated, covenant and agree to indemnify and hold
harmless the Corporation, the Buyer, their Affiliates, and their respective
directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any Damages
(including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees) suffered or incurred as
a result of, or arising out of: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

any assessment or reassessment for Taxes for any period up to and including
the Closing Date for which no adequate reserve has been provided for and
disclosed in the Financial Statements or Interim 

Financial Statements or in the case of a Seller\'s Relevant Holdco, the
applicable Holdco Financial Statements;

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

any of the representations or warranties of the Sellers in this Agreement
being untrue or incorrect; or 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

a breach of any covenant or obligation made in this Agreement by any Seller; 

(which Damages are collectively referred to as "Buyer\'s Losses").

| 
---|--- 

3.

|

Indemnification of Sellers. The Buyer covenants and agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless the Sellers, their Affiliates, and their respective directors,
officers, employees and agents from and against any Damages (including,
without limitation, reasonable legal fees) suffered or incurred as a result
of, or arising out of: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

any of the representations or warranties of the Buyer in this Agreement being
untrue or incorrect; or 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

a breach of any covenant or obligation made in this Agreement by the Buyer; 

(which Damages are collectively referred to as "Sellers\' Losses").

| 
---|--- 

4.

|

Limitations on Sellers\' Liability. The Sellers will not be liable under the
indemnity provision in Section 7.2 in respect of any claim unless: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

written notice of the claim providing reasonable details of the alleged
Buyer\'s Losses has been provided to the Seller Representative on or before
the expiry dates specified in Section 7.1; and 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

the aggregate of the Buyer\'s Losses exceeds the sum of $1,000,000 (in which
event, the Sellers will only be liable for the aggregate amount of such
Buyer\'s Losses in excess of such amount) provided that to the extent that any
Buyer\'s Losses are based on fraud or on any breach of the Fundamental
Representations, Section 3.1(u) or that any AR Shortfall under Section 5.13
arises, the foregoing de minimus threshold will not apply. 

The aggregate liability of the Sellers under this Agreement will not in any
circumstances exceed: (i) for Buyer\'s Losses arising out of a breach of
Fundamental Representations, the Purchase Price, and (ii) for any other
Buyer\'s Losses, 10% of the Purchase Price, except to the extent that such
Buyer\'s Losses arise from fraud, Section 3.1(u) or in the event and to the
extent of any AR Shortfall under Section 5.13, in which case no maximum
threshold will apply. For purposes of determining whether minimum or maximum
indemnifiable Buyer Losses have occurred, any misrepresentation or warranty
that is qualified in scope as to materiality, Material Adverse Change or
similar qualifications will be deemed to be made or given without such
qualification, except where any such representation or warranty requires
disclosure of lists or items of a material nature or above a specified
threshold. The Buyer will not be entitled to make a claim for indemnification
based on breach of the representations and warranties of the Sellers in
Section 3.1(nn) for matters identified in the WESA Report which are the
subject of a deemed reduction of the Closing Working Capital.

| 
---|--- 

5.

|

Limitations on Buyer\'s Liability. The Buyer will not be liable under the
indemnity provision in Section 7.3 in respect of any claim unless written
notice of the claim providing reasonable details of the alleged Sellers\'
Losses has been provided to the Buyer within 18 months after the Closing Date,
except in respect of a claim arising out of the Buyer\'s breach of Section
5.10. 

| 
---|--- 

6.

|

No Double Recovery. No party will be entitled to double recovery for any
Damages even though they may have resulted from the breach of more than one of
the representations, warranties, agreements and covenants made by another
party in this Agreement. The amount of any Buyer\'s Losses or Sellers\'
Losses, as applicable, will be: (i) increased to take into account any net Tax
cost incurred by the Indemnified Party arising out of the receipt of the
indemnity payments hereunder; (ii) reduced to take account of any Tax benefit
realizable by the Indemnified Party arising out of the incurrence or payment
of any such Buyer\'s Losses or Sellers\' Losses, as applicable. 

| 
---|--- 

7.

|

Eligible Damages. No Party will be liable for any special, indirect,
incidental, consequential, punitive or aggravated Damages, including Damages
for loss of profits and lost business opportunities. 

| 
---|--- 

8.

|

Awareness of Buyer. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, if on the Closing Date an Indemnified Party knows of any
information that would cause one or more of the representations and warranties
made by any Indemnifying Party in this Agreement to be inaccurate, the
Indemnified Party will have no right or remedy after the Closing with respect
to such inaccuracy and will be deemed to have waived its rights to
indemnification in respect thereof. 

| 
---|--- 

9.

|

Exclusive Remedy. The rights of indemnity set forth in this Part 7 are, from
and after Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy of each party in respect of
any misrepresentation, incorrectness in or breach of any representation or
warranty, or breach of covenant, by the another party under this Agreement.
Accordingly, the parties waive, from and after the Closing, any and all
rights, remedies and claims that one party may have against another, whether
at law, under any statute or in equity (including claims for contribution or
other rights of recovery, claims for breach of contract, breach of
representation and warranty, negligent misrepresentation and all claims for
breach of duty), or otherwise, directly or indirectly, relating to the
provisions of this Agreement 

or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement other than as expressly
provided for in this Part 7 and other than those arising with respect to any
fraud. The parties agree that if a claim for indemnity is made by one party in
accordance with Sections 7.2 or 7.3, as the case may be, and there has been a
refusal by another party to make payment or otherwise provide satisfaction in
respect of such indemnity, then a legal proceeding is the appropriate means to
seek a remedy for such refusal. This Section 7.9 will remain in full force and
effect in all circumstances and will not be terminated by any breach
(fundamental, negligent or otherwise) by any party of its representations,
warranties or covenants under this Agreement or under any agreement or
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or by any termination or
rescission of this Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

10.

|

Duty to Mitigate. Nothing in this Agreement will in any way restrict or limit
the general obligation at law of a party to mitigate any Damages which it may
suffer or incur by reason of the breach by the another party of any
representation, warranty or covenant of that other party under this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

11.

|

Agency for Non-Parties. Each party hereby accepts each indemnity in favour of
each of its Indemnified Parties who are not parties as agent and trustee of
that Indemnified Party. Each party may enforce an indemnity in favour of any
of that party\'s Indemnified Parties on behalf of each such Indemnified Party. 

| 
---|--- 

12.

|

Notice of Claim. If any of the Sellers or the Buyer become aware of any act,
omission or state of facts that may give rise to Damages in respect of which a
right of indemnification is provided for under this Part 7, that party will
promptly give written notice thereof (a "Notice of Claim") to the other
parties. The Notice of Claim will specify whether the potential Damages arise
as a result of a claim by a Person against that party (a "Third Party Claim")
or whether the potential Damages do not so arise (a "Direct Claim"), and will
also specify with reasonable particularity (to the extent that the information
is available) the factual basis for the Direct Claim or Third Party Claim, as
the case may be, and the amount of the potential Damages arising therefrom, if
known. 

| 
---|--- 

13.

|

Direct Claims. In the case of a Direct Claim, the Indemnifying Party will have
60 days from receipt of a Notice of Claim in respect thereof within which to
make such investigation as the Indemnifying Party considers necessary or
desirable. For the purpose of such investigation, the Indemnified Party will
make available to the Indemnifying Party the information relied upon by the
Indemnified Party to substantiate its right to be indemnified under this Part
7, together with all such other information as the Indemnifying Party may
reasonably request. If the Parties fail to agree at or before the expiration
of such 60 day period (or any mutually agreed upon extension thereof), the
Indemnified Party will be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to
it. 

| 
---|--- 

14.

|

Third Party Claims. In the case of a Third Party Claim, the provisions in the
following paragraphs of this Section 7.14 apply. 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Rights of Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party will have the right, at
its expense, to participate in but not control the negotiation, settlement or
defence of the Third Party Claim, which control will rest at all times with
the Indemnified Party, unless the Indemnifying Party: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

irrevocably acknowledges in writing complete responsibility for, and agrees to
indemnify the Indemnified Party in respect of, the Third Party Claim; and 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

furnishes evidence to the Indemnified Party which is satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party of its financial ability to indemnify the Indemnified Party; 

in which case the Indemnifying Party may assume such control at its expense
through counsel of its choice.

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Respective Rights on Indemnifying Party\'s Assumption of Control. If the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume control as contemplated in Section
7.14(a), the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party for all
of the Indemnified Party\'s out-of-pocket expenses incurred as a result of
such participation or assumption up to the date of the Indemnifying Party\'s
election. The Indemnified Party will continue to have the right to participate
in the negotiation, settlement or defence of such Third Party Claim and to
retain counsel to act on its behalf, provided that the fees and disbursements
of such counsel will be paid by the Indemnified Party unless the Indemnifying
Party consents to the retention of such counsel at its expense or unless the
named parties to any action or proceeding include both the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party and a representation of both the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to
the actual or potential differing interests between them (such as the
availability of different defences), in which case the fees and disbursements
of such counsel will be paid by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party
will co-operate with the Indemnifying Party so as to permit the Indemnifying
Party to conduct such negotiation, settlement and defence and for this purpose
will preserve all relevant documents in relation to the Third Party Claim,
allow the Indemnifying Party access on reasonable notice to inspect and take
copies of all such documents and require its personnel to provide such
statements as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably require and to attend and
give evidence at any trial or hearing in respect of the Third Party Claim. 
| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Lack of Reasonable Diligence. If, having elected to assume control of the
negotiation, settlement or defence of the Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party thereafter fails to conduct such negotiation, settlement or defence with
reasonable diligence, then the Indemnified Party will be entitled to assume
such control and the Indemnifying Party will be bound by the results obtained
by the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Other Rights of Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume
control of the defence of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will
have the exclusive right to contest, settle or pay the amount claimed and the
Indemnifying Party will be bound by the results obtained by the Indemnified
Party with respect to such Third Party Claim. Whether or not the Indemnifying
Party assumes control of the negotiation, settlement or defence of any Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not settle any Third Party Claim
without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

15.Several Obligations. Except in respect of Buyer\'s Losses arising as a
result of a Seller\'s representations or warranties under Sections 3.1(a)
through 3.1(i) being untrue or incorrect, each Seller\'s obligations under
this Part will be limited to such Seller\'s proportionate share of Buyer\'s
Losses based on the percentages set out in column 4 of SCHEDULE A. The
obligations of each Seller hereunder are several, except that the obligations
of each Seller within a Seller Group are joint and several with each other
Seller within such Seller Group, and the obligations of each Seller Group will
be limited to the aggregate portion of the Purchase Price received by such
Seller Group.

| 
---|--- 

16.

|

Purchase Price Adjustment. Any amount paid by the Buyer or the Sellers
pursuant to this Part will be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price
for all Tax purposes. 

| 
---|--- 

17.

|

Notice/Agency. Each Seller hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints Wesley
T. Thompson ("Seller Representative") as such Seller\'s attorney-in-fact and
agent for the purpose of dealing with the Buyer for all matters relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, and the Sellers acknowledge and agree that, as
agent, Wesley T. Thompson has authority to deal with the Buyer on behalf of
all Sellers in respect of any matter arising out of this Agreement. This power
is irrevocable and coupled with an interest, and will not be affected by the
death, incapacity, illness, dissolution or other inability to act of any
Seller. Any notice or other deliverable required to be given to the Sellers
under this Part will be effective if provided to Wesley T. Thompson in
accordance with Section 10.2. The Seller\'s may designate a replacement Seller
Representative from among the individual Sellers by notice in writing to the
Buyer signed by all Sellers delivered to the Buyer no later than five Business
Days before such designation takes effect. All Sellers agree that any notices
or deliverables from the Sellers to the Buyer hereunder, including though not
limited to Section 2.4, shall be provided exclusively through the Seller
Representative and the Buyer may rely on the authority of the Seller
Representative in that regard and further will deal exclusively with the
Seller Representative and not individual Sellers.

TERMINATION

1.Termination. This Agreement may be terminated, by notice given prior to
completion of the sale and purchase of the Shares herein contemplated:

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

by the Buyer if any of the conditions in Section 6.1 have not been satisfied
as of the Closing Date or if satisfaction of such a condition is or becomes
impossible (other than through the failure of the Buyer to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement) and the Buyer has not waived such condition
on or before the Closing Date; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

by the Seller Representative if any of the conditions in Section 6.3 have not
been satisfied as of the Closing Date or if satisfaction of such a condition
is or becomes impossible (other than through the failure of the Sellers to
comply with their obligations under this Agreement) and the Sellers have not
waived such condition on or before the Closing Date; 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

by written agreement of the Seller Representative and the Buyer; or 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

by the Seller Representative or the Buyer if the completion of the sale and
purchase of the Shares herein contemplated has not occurred (other than
through the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to comply
fully with its obligations under this Agreement) on or before the Outside
Date. 

2.Effect of Termination. Each party\'s right of termination under Section 8.1
is in addition to any other rights it may have under this Agreement or
otherwise, and the exercise of a right of termination will not be an election
of remedies. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, all
further obligations of the parties under this Agreement will terminate, except
that the obligations in Sections 5.6, 7.17, 10.2, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6 and 10.12
will survive; provided, however, that if this Agreement is terminated by a
party because of a breach of a representation or warranty, covenant,
obligation or other provision of this Agreement by the other party or because
one or more of the conditions to the terminating party\'s obligations under
this Agreement is not 

satisfied as a result of the other party\'s failure to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement, the terminating party\'s right to pursue all
legal remedies with respect to such breach will survive such termination
unimpaired.
