Section 2.01. The Merger. (a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall
be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with
Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall
cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation") and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

 

 

(b) The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place in New York
City at the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New
York, New York, 10017 as soon as possible, but in any event no later than two
Business Days after the date the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other
than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those
conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent permissible,
waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or
at such other place, at such other time or on such other date as Parent and
the Company may mutually agree.

 

 

(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a
certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other
filings or recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger.
The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as
the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State
(or at such later time as may be agreed to by the parties and specified in
the certificate of merger).

 

 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to
all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the
Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.

Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of shares of Company
Stock or any holder of shares of common stock of Merger Subsidiary:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(c), each share of Company
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any
shares of Company Stock relating to each restricted stock award or
performance share award outstanding under the Company's equity compensation
plans immediately prior to the Effective Time) shall be converted into the
right to receive 0.7098 shares of Parent Stock (the "Per
Share Consideration" and, together with the cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Stock as specified below, the "Merger Consideration"). As
of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and the right to receive any dividends or other distributions
pursuant to Section 2.03(f), in each case to be issued or paid in accordance
with Section 2.03, without interest.

 

 

(b) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

(c) Each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or
owned by Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled,
and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

 

 

Section 2.03. Surrender and Payment. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange
Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i)
certificates representing shares of Company Stock (the "Certificates") and
(ii) uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares").
At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with or otherwise
make available to the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of
shares of Company Stock, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares. Parent agrees to make
available to the Exchange Agent from time to time as needed, any dividends or
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.03(f) of
this Agreement. Promptly after the Effective Time, and in any event no later
than the 10th Business Day following the Effective Time, Parent shall send,
or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record of shares
of Company Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and
instructions reasonably acceptable to the Company (which shall specify that
the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated
Shares to the Exchange Agent and which shall otherwise be in customary form
and shall include customary provisions with respect to delivery of an
"agent's message" regarding the book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares)
for use in such exchange.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon
(i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a
properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's
message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer
as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry
transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the
Company Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. The
shares of Parent Stock constituting part of such Merger Consideration, at
Parent's option, shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a
physical certificate is requested by a holder of shares of Company Stock or
is otherwise required under Applicable Law. Until so surrendered or
transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated
Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the
right to receive such Merger Consideration and the right to receive any
dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.03(f).

 

 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a
result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures
set forth, in this Article 2.

 

 

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with or otherwise
made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that
remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Stock nine months after
the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such
holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Stock for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for,
payment of the Merger Consideration, and any dividends and distributions with
respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.03(f), in respect of such shares
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not
be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any amounts properly
paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of
Company Stock five years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date,
immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority)

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of
Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 

 

(f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to securities of
Parent constituting part of the Merger Consideration, and no cash payment in
lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 2.07, shall be paid to the
holder of any Certificates not surrendered or of any Uncertificated Shares
not transferred until such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, as provided in this Section
2.03. Following such surrender or transfer, there shall be paid, without
interest, to the Person in whose name the securities of Parent have been
registered, (i) at the time of such surrender or transfer, the amount of any
cash payable in lieu of fractional shares to which such Person is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.07 and the amount of all dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time previously paid or
payable on the date of such surrender with respect to such securities, and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and prior to
surrender or transfer and with a payment date subsequent to surrender or
transfer payable with respect to such securities.

 

 

(g) The payment of any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added and other such Taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred by a holder of Company Stock in connection
with the Merger, and the filing of any related Tax returns and other
documentation with respect to such Taxes and fees, shall be the sole
responsibility of such holder.

 

 

Section 2.04. Equity-Based Awards.  (a) Except as set forth in Section
2.04(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the terms of each outstanding
option to purchase shares of Company Stock under any equity compensation plan
of the Company (a "Company Stock Option"), whether or not exercisable or
vested, shall be adjusted as necessary to provide that, at the Effective
Time, each Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into an option (each, an "Adjusted Option")
to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, the number of
shares of Parent Stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of
Company Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Consideration, with any
fractional shares rounded down to the next lower whole number of shares. The
exercise price per share of Parent Stock subject to any such Adjusted Option
will be an amount (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the
quotient of (A) the exercise price per share of Company Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (B)
the Per Share Consideration, with any fractional cents rounded up to the next
higher number of whole cents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
the conversion of a Company Stock Option in accordance with the preceding
provisions of this Section 2.04(a) would cause the related Adjusted Option to
be treated as the grant of new stock right for purposes of Section 409A

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the Code, such Company Stock Option shall not be converted in accordance
with the preceding provisions but shall instead be converted in a manner that
would not cause the related Adjusted Option to be treated as the grant of new
stock right for purposes of Section 409A. Except as set forth in Section
2.04(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, no Company Stock Option shall be
subject to accelerated vesting upon or in connection with the transactions
contemplated herein.

 

 

(b) Each restricted stock award or performance share award outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time under any equity compensation plan of
the Company (each, a "Company Stock Award") shall be adjusted as necessary
to provide that, at the Effective Time, such Company Stock Award shall be
converted into a restricted stock award or performance share award, as
applicable, relating to the number of shares of Parent Stock equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Company Stock relating to such Company
Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii)
the Per Share Consideration, with any fractional shares rounded down to the
next lower whole number of shares. Except as set forth in Section 2.04(b) of
the Company Disclosure Letter, each converted Company Stock Award shall
be subject to the same terms, conditions and restrictions as were applicable
under such Company Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Company Stock Award vesting condition
contingent on the achievement of specified Company stock targets ("Stock
Vesting Targets") shall be adjusted so that each Stock Vesting Target is
equal to the quotient of: (A) the Stock Vesting Target divided by (B) the Per
Share Consideration, with any fractional cents rounded up to the next higher
number of whole cents. Except as set forth in Section 2.04(b) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, no Company Stock Award shall be subject to
accelerated vesting upon or in connection with the transactions
contemplated herein.

 

 

(c) Parent shall take such actions as are necessary for the assumption of the
Company Stock Options pursuant to this Section 2.04, including the
reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Stock as is necessary to
effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.04. Parent shall
prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on an appropriate
form, or a post-effective amendment to a registration statement previously
filed under the 1933 Act, with respect to the shares of Parent Stock subject
to the Company Stock Options and, where applicable, shall use its reasonable
best efforts to have such registration statement declared effective as soon
as practicable following the Effective Time and to maintain the effectiveness
of such registration statement covering such Company Stock Options (and to
maintain the current status of the prospectus contained therein) for so long
as any such Company Stock Options remain outstanding. With respect to those
individuals, if any, who, subsequent to the Effective Time, will be subject
to the reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act, where
applicable, Parent shall administer any equity compensation plan of the
Company assumed pursuant to this Section 2.04 in a

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manner that complies with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act to the
extent such equity compensation plan of the Company complied with such rule
prior to the Merger.

 

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, with respect to stock
option or compensation plans or arrangements, use its reasonable efforts to
give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.04.

 

 

Section 2.05. Treatment of Company Warrants. At the Effective Time, each
warrant to purchase shares of Company Stock (each, a "Company Warrant"),
which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
represent a right to acquire shares of Company Stock and shall be converted,
at the Effective Time, into a right to acquire shares of Parent Stock (a
"Converted Warrant"), on the same contractual terms and conditions as were in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time under the terms of the Company
Warrant or other related agreement or award pursuant to which such Company
Warrant was granted. The number of shares of Parent Stock subject to each
such Converted Warrant shall be equal to (a) the number of shares of Company
Stock subject to each such Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by (b) the Per Share Consideration, with any fractional
shares rounded down to the next lower whole number of shares, and such
Converted Warrant shall have an exercise price per share (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient of (i) the exercise price per share
of Company Stock subject to such Converted Warrant immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by (ii) the Per Share Consideration, with any
fractional cents rounded up to the next higher number of whole cents.

 

 

Section 2.06. Adjustments. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company or Parent shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period,
or any other similar event, but excluding any change that results from (a)
the exercise of Company Warrants, stock options or other equity awards to
purchase shares of Parent Stock or Company Stock or (b) the grant of
stock based compensation to directors or employees of Parent or (other than
any such grants not made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) the
Company under Parent's or the Company's, as applicable, stock option or
compensation plans or arrangements, the Merger Consideration and any other
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement, as applicable, shall be
appropriately and proportionately adjusted.

 

 

Section 2.07. Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Parent Stock shall
be issued in the Merger. All fractional shares of Parent Stock that a holder
of shares of Company Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive as a result
of the Merger shall be aggregated and if a fractional share results from
such aggregation, such holder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof,
an amount in

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cash without interest determined by multiplying the closing sale price of a
share of Parent Stock on the NYSE on the trading day immediately preceding
the Effective Time by the fraction of a share of Parent Stock to which such
holder would otherwise have been entitled.

 

 

Section 2.08. Withholding. Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to
the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be entitled to deduct or withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it
is required to deduct or withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, assist Parent in making such
deductions and withholding as reasonably requested by Parent. If the Exchange
Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds
amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Stock in respect of
which the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case
may be, made such deduction and withholding.

 

 

Section 2.09. Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate and any dividends
or distributions with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.03(f), as
contemplated by this Article 2.

 

 

 

ARTICLE 3

 

The Surviving Corporation

 

 

Section 3.01. Certificate of Incorporation. At the Effective Time and by
virtue of the Merger, the certificate of incorporation of the Company shall
be amended to be identical to the certificate of incorporation of Merger
Subsidiary in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except (a) for
Article FIRST, which shall read "The name of the corporation is XTO Energy
Inc.", (b) that the provisions of the certificate of incorporation of Merger
Subsidiary relating to the incorporator of Merger Subsidiary shall be omitted
and (c) as otherwise required by Section 7.05(b), and as so amended shall be
the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law.

 

 

Section 3.02. Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company shall
be amended to be identical to the bylaws of Merger Subsidiary in effect

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immediately prior to the Effective Time and as so amended shall be the bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with
Delaware Law.

 

 

Section 3.03. Directors and Officers. From and after the Effective Time,
until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance
with Applicable Law, (i) the directors of Merger Subsidiary at the Effective
Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the
officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

 

 

ARTICLE 4

 

Representations and Warranties of the Company

 

 

Subject to Section 11.05, except (a) as disclosed in the Company SEC
Documents filed or furnished since January 1, 2009 but prior to the date
hereof (and excluding any supplement, modification or amendment thereto made
after the date hereof) (collectively, the "Filed Company SEC Documents") or
(b) as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company represents and
warrants to Parent that:

 

 

Section 4.01. Corporate Existence and Power. The Company is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the State of Delaware and has all corporate powers and all governmental
licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals required to carry
on its business as now conducted, except for those licenses, authorizations,
permits, consents and approvals the absence of which would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Company is duly qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions
that recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction where such qualification
is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified
or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Prior to the
date hereof, the Company has delivered or made available to Parent true and
complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company
as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 

 

Section 4.02. Corporate Authorization. (a) The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby are within the Company's
corporate powers and, except for the required approval of the Company's
stockholders in connection with the consummation of the Merger, have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company.
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of Company Stock (the "Company Stockholder Approval") is the only vote of the
holders of any of the Company's capital stock necessary in connection with
the consummation of the Merger. This Agreement, assuming due authorization,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Subsidiary, constitutes a valid
and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting
creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity).

 

 

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, as of the date of this Agreement, the
Company's Board of Directors has (i) determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby are in the best interests of the Company's
stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) resolved, subject to Section
6.03(b), to recommend adoption of this Agreement by its stockholders
(such recommendation, the "Company Board Recommendation").

 

 

Section 4.03. Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby require no authorizations,
consents or approvals of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority,
other than (a) the filing of a certificate of merger with respect to
the Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and appropriate documents
with the relevant authorities of other states in which the Company is
qualified to do business, (b) compliance with any applicable requirements of
the HSR Act and any other Competition Laws, (c) compliance with any
applicable requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act and any other
applicable state or federal securities, takeover and "blue sky" laws, (d)
compliance with any applicable requirements of the New York Stock Exchange
(the "NYSE") and (e) any authorizations, consents or approvals or filings the
absence of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially
impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the Merger.

 

 

Section 4.04. Non-contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not (a) contravene, conflict with, or
result in any violation or breach of any provision of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (b) assuming compliance with the
matters referred to in Section 4.03, contravene, conflict with or result in a
violation or breach of any provision of any Applicable Law, (c) assuming
compliance with the matters referred to in Section 4.03, require any consent
or approval by any Person under, constitute a default, or an event that, with
or without notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default,
under, or cause or permit the termination, cancellation, acceleration or
other adverse change of any right or obligation or the loss of any benefit to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled under any provision
of any agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any license, franchise, permit, certificate, approval or
other similar authorization affecting, or relating in any way to, the assets
or business of the Company and its Subsidiaries

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or (d) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien, other than Permitted
Liens, on any asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the
case of clauses (b) through (d), for such as would not be reasonably expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect
or materially impair the ability of the Company to consummate the Merger.

 

 

Section 4.05. Capitalization. (a) The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of (i) 1,000,000,000 shares of Company Stock and (ii)
25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01, of the Company
(including 70,000 shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock).
As of December 11, 2009, there were outstanding (A) 580,408,780 shares of
Company Stock (including restricted shares and performance shares), (B)
Company Stock Options to purchase an aggregate of 20,603,005 shares of
Company Stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $37.00 per share
of Company Stock (of which options to purchase an aggregate of 16,584,852
shares of Company Stock were exercisable), (C) Company Stock Options held by
non-employee directors or former non-employee directors of the Company (each
a "Director Option") to purchase an aggregate of 608,053 shares of Company
Stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $33.00 per share of Company
Stock (of which options to purchase an aggregate of 608,053 shares of Company
Stock were exercisable) and (D) Company Warrants to purchase 2,318,804 shares
of Company Stock at an exercise price of $20.7766 per share of Company Stock.
There are no shares of preferred stock (including any Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock) outstanding. All outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Company have been, and all shares that may be issued pursuant to
any employee stock option or other compensation plan or arrangement will be,
when issued in accordance with the respective terms thereof, duly authorized
and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights. No Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company owns any shares
of capital stock of the Company or any Company Securities.

 

 

(b) There are outstanding no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness
of the Company having the right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable
for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which
stockholders of the Company may vote. Except as set forth in this Section
4.05, as permitted under Section 6.01 and for changes since December 11, 2009
resulting from the exercise of Company Stock Options outstanding on such date
and the vesting of restricted shares and performance shares outstanding on
such date, there are no issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding (i)
shares of capital stock or other voting securities of or other ownership
interests in the Company, (ii) securities of the Company convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of capital stock or other voting securities of or
other ownership interests in the Company, (iii) warrants, calls, options or
other rights to acquire from the Company, or other obligation of the Company
to issue, any capital stock, voting securities or securities convertible into
or exchangeable for capital stock or other voting securities of or other
ownership interests in the Company or (iv) restricted

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shares, stock appreciation rights, performance shares or units, contingent
value rights, "phantom" stock or similar securities or rights that are
derivative of, or provide economic benefits based, directly or indirectly, on
the value or price of, any capital stock of or other voting securities of or
other ownership interests in the Company (the items in clauses (i) through
(iv) being referred to collectively as the "Company Securities"). There are
no outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of the Company Securities. A
complete and correct list of each outstanding Company Stock Option and
Director Option as of December 11, 2009, including the holder, date of grant,
exercise price, vesting schedule and number of shares of Company Stock
subject thereto has been made available to Parent. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any voting trust, proxy, voting
agreement or other similar agreement with respect to the voting of any
Company Securities.

 

 

Section 4.06. Subsidiaries. (a) Each Subsidiary of the Company is an entity
duly incorporated or otherwise duly organized, validly existing and (where
applicable) in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization, has all corporate, limited liability company
or comparable powers and all governmental licenses, authorizations, permits,
consents and approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted,
except for those licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals
the absence of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each such Subsidiary
is duly qualified to do business as a foreign entity and is in good standing
(with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) in each
jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. All Subsidiaries of the Company and their respective
jurisdictions of organization are identified in Section 4.06(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

 

 

(b) All of the outstanding capital stock or other voting securities of, or
ownership interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company, is owned by the
Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien and free of any
other limitation or restriction (including any restriction on the right to
vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other voting
securities or ownership interests, other than any such restriction imposed by
Applicable Law). There are no issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding
(i) securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries convertible into, or
exchangeable for, shares of capital stock or other voting securities of, or
ownership interests in, any Subsidiary of the Company, (ii) warrants, calls,
options or other rights to acquire from the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or other obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to issue, any capital stock or other voting securities of, or ownership
interests in, or any securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, any
capital stock or other voting securities of, or ownership interests in, any
Subsidiary of the Company or (iii) restricted shares, stock appreciation
rights,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

performance units, contingent value rights, "phantom" stock or similar
securities or rights that are derivative of, or provide economic benefits
based, directly or indirectly, on the value or price of, any capital stock or
other voting securities of, or ownership interests in, any Subsidiary of the
Company (the items in clauses (i) through (iii) being referred to
collectively as the "Company Subsidiary Securities"). There are no
outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of the Company Subsidiary
Securities.

 

 

(c) Section 4.06(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists, as of the date of
this Agreement, each Person other than a Subsidiary of the Company in which
the Company owns, directly or indirectly, any capital stock, or other equity,
voting or ownership interest, other than (i) ownership interests in gas
plants and operational joint-ventures and co-operatives customary in
connection with the operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii)
publicly traded securities held for investment which do not exceed 5% of the
outstanding securities of any Person and (iii) securities held by any
employee benefit plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
trustee or other fiduciary in such capacity under any such employee benefit
plan. All of the capital stock or other voting securities of, or ownership
interests in, each entity set forth on Section 4.06(c) of the Company
Disclosure Letter that are owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company, are
owned by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company free and clear of all
Liens and any other limitation or restriction (including any restriction on
the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other
voting securities or ownership interests).

 

 

Section 4.07. SEC Filings and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. (a) The Company
has filed with or furnished to the SEC all reports, schedules, forms,
statements, prospectuses, registration statements and other documents
required to be filed or furnished by the Company since January 1, 2008
(collectively, together with any exhibits and schedules thereto and other
information incorporated therein, as they have been supplemented, modified or
amended since the time of filing, the "Company SEC Documents").

 

 

(b) As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing, on the
date of such filing), each Company SEC Document complied as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the 1933 Act and the
1934 Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be.

 

 

(c) As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing, on the
date of such filing), each Company SEC Document filed pursuant to the 1934
Act did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Each Company SEC Document that is a registration statement, as amended
or supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the 1933 Act, as of the
date such registration statement or amendment became effective, did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading.

 

 

(e) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the 1934 Act).
Such disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure
that material information relating to the Company, including its
consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be included in the Company's periodic
and current reports under the 1934 Act, is made known to the Company's
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by others
within those entities Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective
in timely alerting the Company's principal executive officer and
principal financial officer to material information required to be included
in the Company's periodic and current reports required under the 1934 Act.

 

 

(f) The Company and its Subsidiaries have established and maintained a system
of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15
under the 1934 Act) ("internal controls"). Such internal controls are
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the
Company's financial reporting and the preparation of Company financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of internal controls prior to
the date hereof, to the Company's auditors and audit committee (i) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
of internal controls which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in internal
controls. There has not been any such disclosure made by management to the
Company's auditors and audit committee since January 1, 2008.

 

 

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has extended or
maintained credit, arranged for the extension of credit, or renewed an
extension of credit, in the form of a personal loan to or for any executive
officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the 1934 Act) or director of the
Company in violation of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 

 

(h) The Company is in compliance with, and since January 1, 2008 has
complied, in each case in all material respects with (i) the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) the applicable listing and
corporate governance rules and regulations of the NYSE.

 

 

(i) Each of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer
of the Company (or each former principal executive officer and principal
financial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer of the Company, as applicable) have made all certifications required

enacted under U.S. state or federal laws apply to this Agreement or any of

ARTICLE 5

 

Representations and Warranties of Parent

 

 

Subject to Section 11.05, except (a) as disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents
filed or furnished since January 1, 2009 but prior to the date hereof (and
excluding any supplement, modification or amendment thereto made after the
date hereof) (collectively, the "Filed Parent SEC Documents") or (b) as set
forth in the Parent Disclosure Letter, Parent represents and warrants to the
Company that:

 

 

Section 5.01. Corporate Existence and Power. Each of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has all
corporate

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

powers and all governmental licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and
approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for
those licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals the absence
of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction where such
qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to
be so qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Prior to the date hereof, Parent has delivered or made available to the
Company true and complete copies of the certificates of incorporation and
bylaws of Parent and Merger Subsidiary as in effect on the date of this
Agreement. Since the date of its incorporation, Merger Subsidiary has not
engaged in any activities other than in connection with or as contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

 

Section 5.02. Corporate Authorization. The execution, delivery and
performance by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and the
consummation by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated
hereby are within the corporate powers of Parent and Merger Subsidiary and,
except for the approval of Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger
Subsidiary (which approval Parent shall effect on the date hereof immediately
following execution of this Agreement), have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and Merger Subsidiary. No
vote of the holders of any of Parent's capital stock is necessary in
connection with the consummation of the Merger. This Agreement, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes a valid and
binding agreement of each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary, enforceable
against Parent and Merger Subsidiary in accordance with its terms (subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and general
principles of equity).

 

 

Section 5.03. Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery and
performance by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and the
consummation by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated
hereby require no authorizations, consents or approvals of, or filing with,
any Governmental Authority, other than (a) the filing of a certificate of
merger with respect to the Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and
appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other states in which
Parent is qualified to do business, (b) compliance with any applicable
requirements of the HSR Act and any other Competition Laws, (c) compliance
with any applicable requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act and any other
applicable state or federal securities, takeover and "blue sky" laws, (d)
compliance with any applicable requirements of the NYSE and (e) any
authorizations, consents or approvals or filings the absence of which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the
consummation of the Merger.

 

 

Section 5.04. Non-contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and the consummation by Parent
and Merger Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will
not (a) contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of
any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Parent or
Merger Subsidiary, (b) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in
Section 5.03, contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or breach of
any provision of any Applicable Law, (c) assuming compliance with the matters
referred to in Section 5.03, require any consent or approval by any Person
under, constitute a default, or an event that, with or without notice or
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default, under, or cause or permit
the termination, cancellation, acceleration or other adverse change of any
right or obligation or the loss of any benefit to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is entitled under any provision of any agreement or other
instrument binding upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any license,
franchise, permit, certificate, approval or other similar authorization
affecting, or relating in any way to, the assets or business of Parent and
its Subsidiaries or (d) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien,
other than Permitted Liens, on any asset of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, except in the case of clauses (b) through (d), for such as
would not be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Parent Material Adverse Effect or materially impair the ability of Parent
or Merger Subsidiary to consummate the Merger.

 

 

Section 5.05. Capitalization. (a) The authorized capital stock of Parent
consists of (i) 9,000,000,000 shares of Parent Stock and (ii) 200,000,000

incorporation or organization, has all corporate, limited liability company
or comparable powers and all governmental licenses, authorizations, permits,
consents and approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted,
except for those licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals
the absence of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each such Subsidiary is
duly qualified to do business as a foreign entity and is in good standing
(with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) in each
jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. The Parent 10-K identifies, as of its filing date,
all "significant subsidiaries" (as defined under Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation
S-X promulgated pursuant to the 1934 Act) (each, a "Significant Subsidiary")
of Parent and their respective jurisdictions of organization.

 

 

(b) As of the date hereof, there were no issued, reserved for issuance or

rights that are derivative of, or provide economic benefits based, directly
or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indirectly, on the value or price of, any capital stock or other voting
securities of, or ownership interests in, any Significant Subsidiary of
Parent (the items in clauses (i) through (iii) being referred to collectively
as the "Parent Subsidiary Securities"). As of the date hereof, there are no
outstanding obligations of Parent or any of its Significant Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of the Parent
Subsidiary Securities.

 

 

(c) The authorized capital stock of Merger Subsidiary consists of 1,000

validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of Merger Subsidiary is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned

material respects with the applicable requirements of the 1933 Act and the
1934 Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be.

 

 

(c) As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing, on the
date of such filing), each Parent SEC Document filed pursuant to the 1934 Act
did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

 

 

(d) Each Parent SEC Document that is a registration statement, as amended
or supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the 1933 Act, as of the
date such registration statement or amendment became effective, did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading.

 

 

(e) Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the 1934 Act). Such disclosure
controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that material
information relating to Parent, including its consolidated Subsidiaries,
required to be included in Parent's periodic and current reports under the
1934 Act, is made known to Parent's principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer by others within those entities. Such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting Parent's principal
executive officer and principal financial

officer to material information required to be included in Parent's periodic

(f) Parent and its Subsidiaries have established and maintained a system of
internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under

financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Parent
has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of internal controls prior
to the date hereof, to Parent's auditors and audit committee (i) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
of internal controls which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parent's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in internal controls. There has not
been any such disclosure made by management to Parent's auditors and audit
committee since January 1, 2008.

 

 

(g) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has extended or maintained
credit, arranged for the extension of credit, or renewed an extension of
credit, in the form of a personal loan to or for any executive officer (as
defined in Rule 3b-7 under the 1934 Act) or director of Parent in violation
of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 

 

(h) Parent is in compliance with, and since January 1, 2008 has complied, in
each case in all material respects with (i) the applicable provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate governance
rules and regulations of the NYSE.

 

 

(i) Each of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer
of Parent (or each former principal executive officer and principal financial
officer of Parent, as applicable) have made all certifications required by
Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the 1934 Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the
SEC and the NYSE, and the statements contained in any such certifications are
complete and correct.

series of similar transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings,
nor is there any proposed transaction as of the date of this Agreement, or
series of similar transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings to
which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries was or is to be a party, that would
be required to be disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated
under the 1933 Act that has not been disclosed in Parent's definitive proxy
statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on April 13, 2009.

 

 

Section 5.08. Financial Statements. The audited consolidated financial
statements and unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of Parent

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

included or incorporated by reference in the Parent SEC Documents (including
all related notes and schedules thereto) fairly present in all material
respects, in conformity with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited
consolidated interim financial statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the
SEC) applied on a consistent basis (except as may be indicated therein or in
the notes thereto), the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their consolidated

amendments or supplements thereto, when filed, will comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the 1933 Act. At the
time the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto
becomes effective, the Registration Statement, as amended or supplemented,
will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The information supplied by Parent in writing for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto shall not, at the time the Proxy Statement or any
amendment or supplement thereto is first mailed to stockholders of the
Company and at the time of the Company Stockholder Approval, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,

and to the knowledge of Parent, it is not under pending investigation with
respect to and has not been threatened to be charged with or given notice of
any violation of any, Applicable Law, except for failures to comply or
violations that have not had and would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. There is no
judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any arbitrator or Governmental
Authority outstanding against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that has had
or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect or that in any manner seeks to prevent,
enjoin, alter or materially delay the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

 

Section 5.13. Litigation. There is no Action pending against, or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened against, Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective properties, or any present or former officer,
director or employee of Parent or its Subsidiaries in their capacity as such,

any Governmental Authority or arbitrator, that (i) would, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect or (ii) that, as of the date of this Agreement, challenges or seeks to
prevent, enjoin, alter in any material respects or materially delay the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

Section 5.14. Tax Treatment. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates has
taken or caused to be taken, agreed to take or cause to be taken or agreed
not to take or cause to be taken any action or is aware of any fact or
circumstance that would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a 368
Reorganization.

 

 

Section 5.15. Finders' Fees. Except for J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., whose
fees will be paid by Parent, Parent has not employed or engaged any
investment banker, broker, finder or other intermediary that is or will be

Person, was at any time, or became, an "interested stockholder" (as such term
is defined in Section 203 of the Delaware Law) thereunder with respect to the
Company or has taken any action that would cause any anti-takeover statute
under the Delaware Law or other Applicable Law to be applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. None
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has any direct or indirect beneficial
ownership, or sole or shared voting power, with respect to any shares of

respect to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has any liability.

and warranties made by Parent in this Article 5, none of Parent, Merger
Subsidiary or any other Person makes any express or implied representation or
warranty with respect to Parent, Merger Subsidiary or their respective
Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities,
conditions (financial or otherwise) or prospects in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and Parent hereby
disclaims any such other representations or warranties. In particular,
without limiting the foregoing disclaimer, none of Parent, Merger Subsidiary

financial projection, forecast, estimate, budget or prospect information
relating to Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of their respective Subsidiaries

Section 6.02. Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts in accordance with Delaware Law, its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws and the rules of the NYSE to duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholder
Meeting") as soon as reasonably practicable following effectiveness of the
Registration Statement under the 1933 Act for the purpose of obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval. In connection with the Company
Stockholder Meeting, the Company shall (i) mail the Proxy Statement and all
other proxy materials for such meeting by first class mail to its
stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Registration
Statement is declared effective under the 1933 Act, (ii) unless there has
been an Adverse Recommendation Change, use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Company Stockholder Approval and (iii) otherwise comply with all
legal requirements applicable to such meeting. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, this Agreement and the Merger shall be submitted
to the Company's stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting whether or
not (x) the Company's Board of Directors shall have effected an Adverse
Recommendation Change or (y) any Acquisition Proposal shall have been
publicly proposed or announced or otherwise submitted to the Company or any
of its advisors.

 

 

Section 6.03. No Solicitation; Other Offers; Adverse Recommendation Change.
(a) General Prohibitions. Subject to Section 6.03(b), neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, nor shall the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries authorize or permit any of its or their officers,
directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants
or other agents or advisors ("Representatives") to, directly or indirectly,
(i) solicit, initiate or take any action to knowingly facilitate or encourage
the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into or participate in
any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any nonpublic information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the
business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to, otherwise cooperate in any way with, or knowingly
assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by any Third Party
that is seeking to make, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) make
an Adverse Recommendation Change, (iv) grant any waiver or release under
any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (v) approve any
transaction under, or any Person becoming an "interested stockholder" under,
Section 203 of Delaware Law or (vi) enter into any agreement in principle,
letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement or other similar instrument relating to an Acquisition Proposal
(other than a confidentiality agreement to the extent contemplated in Section
6.03(b)); provided that (so long as the Company and its Representatives have
otherwise complied with this Section 6.03) none of the foregoing shall
prohibit the Company and its Representatives from contacting in writing any
Persons or group of Persons who has made an Acquisition Proposal after the
date of this Agreement solely to request the clarification of the terms and
conditions thereof so as to determine whether the Acquisition Proposal is, or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and any such
actions shall not be a breach of this Section 6.03(a). It is agreed that
any violation of the restrictions on the Company set forth in this Section by
any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a
breach of this Section by the Company.

 

 

(b) Exceptions. Notwithstanding Section 6.03(a), at any time prior to the
Company Stockholder Approval:

 

 

(i) the Company, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may (A)
engage in negotiations or discussions with any Third Party that, subject to
the Company's compliance with Section 6.03(a), has made after the date of
this Agreement a Superior Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal that the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside financial and legal advisors, could reasonably be expected to
lead to a Superior Proposal by the Third Party making such Acquisition
Proposal and (B) furnish to such Third Party and its Representatives non-
public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
access to the business, properties, assets, books and records of the Company
and its Subsidiaries pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement (a
copy of which shall be provided for informational purposes only to Parent)
with such Third Party with terms no less favorable to the Company than those
contained in the confidentiality agreement dated October 13, 2009 between the
Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement") (it being understood and
hereby agreed that such confidentiality agreement need not contain a
"standstill" or similar provision that prohibits such Third Party from making
any Acquisition Proposals, acquiring the Company or taking any other action);
provided that all such information (to the extent that such information has
not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made
available to Parent, as the case may be, prior to or substantially
concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to such Third
Party) and (C) take any action required by Applicable Law and any action that
any court of competent jurisdiction orders the Company to take; and

 

 

(ii) the Board of Directors of the Company may make an Adverse
Recommendation Change (A) following receipt of an Acquisition Proposal made
after the date hereof that the Board of Directors of the Company determines
in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial and legal
advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal or (B) solely in response to any
material event, development, circumstance, occurrence or change in
circumstances or facts (including any change in probability or magnitude of
circumstances) not related to an Acquisition Proposal that was not known to
the Board of Directors of the Company on the date hereof (or if known, the
magnitude or material consequences of which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were not known to or understood by the Board of Directors of the Company as
of the date hereof) (an "Intervening Event");

 

 

in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) only if the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith by a majority
vote, after consultation with its outside legal advisors, that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Delaware Law.

 

 

In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company or its Board
of Directors from (i) complying with Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) under the 1934
Act (or making any similar communication to stockholders in connection with
any amendment to the terms of a tender offer or exchange offer) so long as
any action taken or statement made to so comply is consistent with this
Section 6.03, (ii) disclosing factual information regarding the business,
financial condition or results of operations of Parent or the Company or the
fact that an Acquisition Proposal has been made, the identity of the party
making such proposal or the material terms of such proposal in the Proxy
Statement or otherwise, to the extent the Company in good faith determines
that such information, facts, identity or terms is required to be disclosed
under Applicable Law or that failure to make such disclosure would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law or (iii) making
any statement or disclosure to the Company's stockholders required by
Applicable Law; provided that any such action taken or statement or
disclosure made that relates to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be
an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Board of Directors of the Company
reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such statement or disclosure or
in connection with such action (except that a mere "stop, look and listen"
disclosure in compliance with Rule 14d-9(f) of the 1934 Act shall not
constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change).

 

 

(c) Required Notices. The Board of Directors of the Company shall not
take any of the actions referred to in Section 6.03(b) unless the Company
shall have delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it
intends to take such action, and, after taking such action, the Company
shall, if such action is in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, continue
to advise Parent on a reasonably current basis on the status and terms of any
discussions and negotiations with the Third Party. In addition, the Company
shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after
receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Acquisition
Proposal, any written indication that a Third Party is considering making an
Acquisition Proposal or any request for information relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets,
books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party
that has indicated it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall provide such notice orally and in writing and
shall identify the Third Party making, and the terms and conditions of, any
such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. The Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed, on a current basis, of the status and details of
any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request, and shall

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours after receipt) (x) provide to
Parent copies of all correspondence and written materials sent or provided to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by the Third Party that describes any
terms or conditions of any Acquisition Proposal and (y) notify Parent after
it becomes aware of any intentional and material breach of any of this
Section 6.03 expressly sanctioned or knowingly permitted by the Company. Any
material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new
Acquisition Proposal for purposes of the Company's compliance with this
Section 6.03(c).

 

 

(d) "Last Look". Further, the Board of Directors of the Company shall not
make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Acquisition
Proposal as permitted by Section 6.03(b)(ii), unless (i) the Company
promptly notifies Parent, in writing at least three Business Days before
taking that action, of its intention to do so, attaching the most current
version of the proposed agreement under which such Acquisition Proposal is
proposed to be consummated and the identity of the Third Party making the
Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) Parent does not make, within three Business
Days after its receipt of that written notification, an offer that the
Company's Board of Directors determines, in good faith, after consultation
with its outside financial and legal advisors, is at least as favorable to
the stockholders of the Company as such Acquisition Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or other
material terms of such Acquisition Proposal shall require a new written
notification from the Company and a new three Business Day period under
clause (ii) of this Section 6.03(d)). The Board of Directors of the Company
shall not make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening
Event as permitted by Section 6.03(b)(ii), unless (A) the Company has
provided Parent with written information describing such Intervening Event in
reasonable detail promptly after becoming aware of it, or becoming aware of
or understanding the magnitude or material consequences of it, as applicable,
and keeps Parent reasonably informed of material developments with respect to
such Intervening Event, (B) the Company has provided Parent at least three
Business Days prior written notice advising Parent of its intention to make
an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such Intervening
Event, attaching a reasonably detailed explanation of the facts underlying
the determination by the Board of Directors of the Company that an
Intervening Event has occurred and its need to make an Adverse Recommendation
Change in light of the Intervening Event and (C) Parent does not make, within
three Business Days after its receipt of that written notification, an offer
that the Company's Board of Directors determines, in good faith, after
consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, would obviate the
need for an Adverse Recommendation Change in light of the Intervening Event.
During any three Business Day period prior to its effecting an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 6.03(d), the Company and its
Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) Definition of Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Superior Proposal" means a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal for at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Stock
or all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith by a majority vote, after consultation with a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, and taking into
account all the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, including
the expected timing and likelihood of consummation, any break-up
fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation, are
more favorable and would reasonably be expected to provide greater value to
the Company's stockholders (other than Parent and any of its Affiliates) than
as provided hereunder (taking into account any binding proposal by Parent to
amend the terms of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.03(d)), which the
Board of Directors of the Company determines is reasonably likely to be
consummated and for which financing, if a cash transaction (whether in whole
or in part), is then fully committed or reasonably determined to be available
by the Board of Directors of the Company.

 

 

(f) Obligation to Terminate Existing Discussions. The Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, cease
immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its
Representatives and its financing sources conducted prior to the date hereof
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly request
that each Third Party, if any, that has executed a confidentiality agreement
within the 12-month period prior to the date hereof in connection with its
consideration of any Acquisition Proposal return or destroy all confidential
information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and all analyses and other materials
prepared by or on behalf of such Person that contains, reflects or analyzes
that information), and the Company shall provide to Parent all certifications
of such return or destruction from such other Persons as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof. The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to secure all such certifications as promptly as
practicable. If any such Person fails to provide any required certification
within the time period allotted in the relevant confidentiality agreement (or
if no such period is specified, then within a reasonable time period after
the date hereof), then the Company shall take all actions that may be
reasonably necessary to secure its rights and ensure the performance of such
other party's obligations thereunder as promptly as practicable.

 

 

Section 6.04. Tax Matters. (a) From the date hereof until the Effective
Time, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, except as
required by Applicable Law, make or change any material Tax election, change
any annual tax accounting period, adopt or change any method of tax
accounting, file any material amended Tax Returns or claims for material Tax
refunds, enter into any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

material closing agreement, surrender any material Tax claim, audit or
assessment, surrender any right to claim a material Tax refund, offset or
other reduction in Tax liability, consent to any extension or waiver of the
limitations period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment or take or omit
to take any other action, if any such action or omission would have the
effect of increasing the Tax liability or accrual of Tax liability under FASB
Interpretation No. 48 or reducing any Tax asset or accrual of Tax asset under
FASB Interpretation No. 48 of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

 

(b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall establish or cause to be
established in accordance with GAAP on or before the Effective Time an
adequate accrual for all Taxes due with respect to any period or portion
thereof ending prior to or as of the Effective Time.

 

 

(c) Other than Taxes described in Section 2.03(g), all transfer, documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration, value added and other such Taxes and fees
(including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the Merger
(including any real property transfer tax and any similar Tax) shall be paid
by the Company when due, and the Company shall, at its own expense, file all
necessary Tax returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes
and fees, and, if required by Applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax returns and
other documentation.

 

 

Section 6.05. Access to Information. From the date hereof until the
Effective Time and subject to Applicable Law and the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Company shall upon reasonable prior notice (a) give Parent,
its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
representatives reasonable access to the offices, properties, books and
records of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including access to core
samples, well logs and seismic data, in each case, which are in the
possession of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) during normal
business hours, (b) furnish to Parent, its counsel, financial advisors,
auditors and other authorized representatives such financial and operating
data and other information as such Persons may reasonably request and (c)
instruct the employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other
authorized representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to reasonably
cooperate with Parent in its investigation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the Company may restrict the foregoing
access and the disclosure of information pursuant to this Section 6.05 to the
extent that (i) in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Company, any
Applicable Law requires the Company or its Subsidiaries to restrict or
prohibit access to any such properties or information, (ii) in the reasonable
good faith judgment of the Company, the information is subject to
confidentiality obligations to a Third Party, (iii) such disclosure would
result in disclosure of any trade secrets of Third Parties or (iv) disclosure
of any such information or document would reasonably be expected to result in
the loss of attorney-client privilege; provided, further, that with respect
to clauses (i) through (iv) of this Section 6.05, the Company shall use its

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercially reasonable efforts to (A) obtain the required consent of such
Third Party to provide such access or disclosure, (B) develop an alternative
to providing such information so as to address such matters that is
reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company or (C) in the case of clauses
(i) and (iv), enter into a joint defense agreement or implement such other
techniques if the parties determine that doing so would reasonably permit the
disclosure of such information without violating Applicable Law or
jeopardizing such privilege. Any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.05
shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries. No information
or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.05
shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by
any party hereunder.

 

 

 

ARTICLE 7

 

Covenants of Parent

 

 

Parent agrees that:

 

 

Section 7.01. Conduct of Parent. From the date hereof until the Effective
Time, except as expressly contemplated or permitted by this Agreement, except
as set forth in Section 7.01 of the Parent Disclosure Letter or as consented
to in writing by the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) or except as required by Applicable Law, Parent
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to conduct its business in
all material respects in the ordinary course consistent with past practice
and use its commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact its business
organizations and relationships with material Third Parties. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, except as expressly contemplated or
permitted by this Agreement, except as set forth in Section 7.01 of the
Parent Disclosure Letter or as consented to in writing by the Company (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), or except
as required by Applicable Law, from the date hereof until the Effective Time
Parent shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to:

 

 

(a) amend the articles of incorporation or bylaws of Parent in a manner that
would have a material and adverse impact on the value of Parent Stock;

 

 

(b) pay any extraordinary dividend or other extraordinary distribution
(whether in cash, stock or property or any combination thereof) in respect of
the capital stock of Parent, or redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire or
offer to redeem, repurchase, or otherwise acquire any capital stock of Parent
in a manner inconsistent with past practice;

 

 

(c) acquire (or agree to acquire) (i) any assets utilized in production
or transportation of natural gas or (ii) more than 50% of the voting
interests of any entity that is a going concern, if, individually or in the
aggregate, such acquisition

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or acquisitions would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially
impede, interfere with or delay the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

 

(d) knowingly and intentionally take any action that would reasonably be
expected to make any material representation or warranty of Parent hereunder
inaccurate in any material respect at, or immediately prior to, the Effective
Time; or

 

 

(e) authorize or enter into any agreement to do any of the foregoing.

 

 

Section 7.02. Obligations of Merger Subsidiary. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement.

 

 

Section 7.03. Approval by Sole Stockholder of Merger Subsidiary. Immediately
following the execution of this Agreement by the parties, Parent, as sole
stockholder of Merger Subsidiary, shall approve and adopt this Agreement, in
accordance with Delaware Law, by written consent, and promptly deliver to the
Company a correct and complete copy of such written consent, certified by the
Secretary of Parent.

 

 

Section 7.04. Voting of Shares. Parent shall vote all shares of Company
Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries (other than for
the avoidance of doubt any such shares held by any employee benefit plan of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any trustee or other fiduciary in such
capacity under any such employee benefit plan) in favor of adoption of this
Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

 

 

Section 7.05. Director and Officer Liability. (a) For six years after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless, and provide the
advancement of expenses to, the present and former officers and directors of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Person") in respect
of (i) acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, (ii)
the fact that such Indemnified Person was a director or officer, or is or was
serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
director or officer of another Person prior to the Effective Time and (iii)
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case whether
asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
permitted by Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or provided under the
Company's or its Subsidiaries' certificate of incorporation and bylaws in
effect on the date hereof; provided that such indemnification and advancement
of expenses shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time
under Applicable Law; provided, further, that any Person to whom expenses are
advanced shall provide an undertaking to repay such advances to the extent
required by Applicable Law. From and after the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Effective Time, Parent hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the
payment and performance obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this
Section 7.05(a).

 

 

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporation's and the
Company's Subsidiaries' certificates of incorporation, bylaws and similar
organizational documents (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time that are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of
this Agreement in the Company's and its Subsidiaries' certificate of
incorporation and bylaws.

 

 

(c) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall procure the
provision of officers' and directors' liability insurance from an insurance
carrier with the same or better rating as the Company's current insurance
carrier in respect of matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective
Time (including with respect to acts or omissions occurring in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby) covering each
such Person currently covered by the Company's officers' and directors'
liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and in amounts
no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof (it
being understood that Parent may discharge its obligations pursuant to this
paragraph by providing an insurance policy underwritten by Ancon Insurance
Company, Inc., a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, so long as at the time of
underwriting such policy, Ancon Insurance Company, Inc. has the same or
better rating as the Company's current insurance carrier); provided that if
the aggregate annual premiums for such insurance at any time during
such period shall exceed 300% of the per annum rate of premium paid by the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof for such insurance, then
Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide only such coverage
as shall then be available at an annual premium equal to 300% of such rate.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time, the Company may
procure a fully prepaid "tail" policy of comparable coverage with a claims
period of six years after the Effective Time from Ancon Insurance Company,
Inc. (or if Ancon Insurance Company, Inc. does not have, at the time
of underwriting such policy, the same or better rating as the Company's
current insurance carrier, any other insurance carrier with the same or
better rating as the Company's current insurance carrier) in respect of
matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time (including with
respect to acts or omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby) covering each such Person currently
covered by the Company's officers' and directors' liability insurance policy
on terms with respect to coverage and in amounts no less favorable than those
of such policy in effect on the date hereof; provided that if the aggregate
annual premiums for such "tail" policy exceeds

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

300% of the per annum rate of premium paid by the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the date hereof for their existing officers' and
directors' liability insurance policy, then the Company shall procure the
maximum coverage that will then be available at an equivalent annual premium
equal to 300% of such rate; provided, further, that the Company's procurement
of such fully prepaid "tail" policy in accordance with this sentence shall be
deemed to satisfy in full Parent's obligations pursuant to this Section
7.05(c).

 

 

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.05.

 

 

(e) Each Indemnified Person shall cooperate with Parent and the Surviving
Corporation in the defense of any claim or Action for which indemnification
may be sought pursuant to Section 7.05(a), shall furnish or cause to be
furnished records, documents, information and testimony, and shall attend
such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may
be reasonably requested by Parent in connection therewith.

 

 

(f) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.05 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 7.05
shall not be terminated, amended or modified in any manner so as to adversely
affect any Indemnified Person (including their successors, heirs and legal
representatives) to whom this Section 7.05 applies without the consent of
such affected Indemnified Person (it being expressly agreed that the
Indemnified Persons to whom this Section 7.05 applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 7.05, and this Section 7.05 shall survive
consummation of the Merger and shall be enforceable by such
Indemnified Persons and their respective successors, heirs and legal
representatives against Parent and the Surviving Corporation and their
respective successors and assigns).

 

 

Section 7.06. Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Stock to be issued as part of the
Merger Consideration to be listed on the NYSE, subject to official notice of
issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

Section 7.07. Employee Matters. (a) For a period of one year following the
Effective Time, Parent shall provide to employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time who continue employment with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates ("Continuing Employees")
(i) base salaries that are not less than the salaries provided to such
employees by the Company and its Subsidiaries, as in effect on December 1,
2009, (ii) except for the employees set forth in Section 7.07(a)(ii) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, annual or semi-annual, as applicable, cash bonuses
that are not less than the annual or semi-annual, as applicable, cash bonuses
provided to such employees by the Company and its Subsidiaries on December 1,
2009 and (iii) benefits (other than equity-based compensation and other than
benefits referenced in Section 7.07(d)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter
or Section 7.07(a)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Letter) that (A) to the
extent provided under any Company Plan, are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the benefits provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries under
such Company Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) to the
extent provided under any Continuing Employee Plan, are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the benefits provided to similarly-situated
Parent employees under such Continuing Employee Plan; provided that, for
the avoidance of doubt and without limiting the foregoing clauses (A) and
(B), nothing shall require that the aggregate level of benefits for
Continuing Employees across all Company Plans and Continuing Employee Plans
after the Effective Time be substantially comparable to the benefits provided
prior to the Effective Time under the Company Plans; and provided, further,
that nothing shall prohibit Parent from terminating or causing the Company
to terminate any Company Plan or Continuing Employee Plan following the
Effective Time. Except as set forth in Section 7.07(d)(ii) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, if the occurrence of the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated under this Agreement would impose any limitation on
the ability of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates to amend or terminate any Company Plan, the Company
shall, to the fullest extent permitted under the terms of such Company Plan
and prior to the date that such limitation would be imposed, amend such
Company Plan to (i) remove such limitation and (ii) provide for such other
modifications to such Company Plan as requested by Parent, with such
modifications to become effective as of the date immediately preceding the
Closing Date.

 

 

(b) With respect to any "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3)
of ERISA, maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Corporation, in which any Continuing Employee becomes a
participant, such Continuing Employee shall receive full credit for service
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the
extent the Company provides such past service credit) for purposes of
eligibility to participate and vesting, to the same extent that such service
was recognized as of the Effective Time under a comparable plan of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employee participated
(but not for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension
plans, special or early retirement programs, window separation programs, or
similar plans which may be in effect from time to time).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Parent shall waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employees (and their eligible
dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective
Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods would not have
been satisfied or waived under the comparable plan of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employee participated. If a Continuing
Employee commences participation in any health benefit plan of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries after the commencement of a calendar year, to the extent
commercially practicable, Parent shall cause such plan to recognize the
dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred
by such Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during such
calendar year for purposes of satisfying such calendar year's deductible and
co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such
Continuing Employee (and dependents) commences participation.

 

 

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall and shall
cause Surviving Corporation to (i) enter into and perform under the
consulting agreements with each of the individuals listed in Section
7.07(d)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter, in the form agreed to prior to
the date hereof and (ii) continue, in accordance with their respective terms,
the plans and arrangements set forth in Section 7.07(d)(ii) of the Company
Disclosure Letter for the benefit of the employees who are eligible to
participate therein.

 

 

(e) Nothing in this Section 7.07 shall (i) be treated as an amendment of,
or undertaking to amend, any benefit plan, (ii) prohibit Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, from amending or
terminating any employee benefit plan or (iii) confer any rights or benefits
on any person other than the parties to this Agreement.

 

 

Section 7.08. Continuation of Company's Existence. For a period of two years
following the Effective Time (a) Parent shall maintain (or shall cause to
be maintained) the Surviving Corporation as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent with the name "XTO Energy Inc." (and shall continue the commercial use
of such name) and (b) Parent shall maintain and continue (or cause to be
maintained and continued) the operations of the Company's current facilities
in Fort Worth, Texas. Furthermore, so long as Company employees who as of
the Effective Time work from or are based at such Fort Worth, Texas locations
remain employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent shall retain
such employees at their current location for the one-year period following
the Effective Time.

or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
Applicable Law to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) preparing and filing as
promptly as practicable with any Governmental Authority or other Third Party
all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions,
statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other
documents and (ii) obtaining and maintaining all approvals,

required to be obtained from any Governmental Authority or other Third Party
that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that the
parties hereto understand and agree that in no event shall Parent be required
(or the Company, without Parent's prior written consent, be permitted) by
this Section 8.01 or any other provision of this Agreement (A) to enter into
any settlement, undertaking, consent decree, stipulation or agreement with
any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby or (B) to divest or otherwise hold separate (including by establishing
a trust or otherwise), or take any other action (or otherwise agree to do any
of the foregoing) with respect to any of their respective Subsidiaries or any
of their respective Affiliates' businesses, assets or properties, except, in
the case of either of the foregoing clause (A) or (B), to the extent such
action or actions would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, restrict, in any material respect, or otherwise negatively and
materially impact the natural gas (including natural gas liquids)
exploration, production and sales businesses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the natural gas (including natural gas
liquids) exploration, production and sales businesses of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and

one another in (i) the overall strategic planning for the approach
to Governmental Authorities under the HSR Act or any other

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

62  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable Competition Law, (ii) the making of any filings, including the
initial filing under the HSR Act, (iii) the receipt of any necessary

any such Governmental Authority. Parent, in consultation with the
Company, shall take the lead in communicating with any Governmental Authority
and developing strategy for responding to any investigation or other inquiry
by any Governmental Authority under the HSR Act or other applicable
Competition Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, except as prohibited
by Applicable Law, each of Parent and the Company shall promptly notify the
other of, and if in writing, furnish the other with copies of (or, in the
case of oral communications, advise the other of) any substantive
communications with any Governmental Authority, shall consult with each other
prior to taking any substantive position with respect to the filings under
the HSR Act or any other Competition Law in discussions with or filing to be
submitted to any Governmental Authority, shall permit the other to review and
discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in
connection with, any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions and proposals to be submitted to any Governmental Authority with
respect to filings under the HSR Act or any other Competition Law, shall not
participate in any meeting or have any substantive communication with any
such Governmental Authority unless it has given the other an opportunity to
consult with it in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, shall give the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate therein, and shall coordinate with the other in preparing and
exchanging such information and promptly provide the other party (and its
counsel) with copies of all filings, material correspondence, presentations
or submissions (and a summary of any oral presentations) made by such party
with any Governmental Authority under the HSR Act or any other Competition
Law relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

Section 8.02. Proxy Statement; Registration Statement. (a) As promptly
as practicable, the Company and Parent shall prepare and file the Proxy
Statement and the Registration Statement (in which the Proxy Statement will
be included) with the SEC. The Company and Parent shall use their reasonable
best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become effective under
the 1933 Act as soon after such filing as practicable and to keep the
Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the
Merger. Subject to Section 6.03, the Proxy Statement shall include the
recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company in favor of approval
and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its
stockholders, as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement
becomes effective. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Registration Statement and the
Proxy Statement comply as to form in all material respects with the rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC under the 1933 Act and the 1934
Act, respectively.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

63  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) The Company and Parent shall make all necessary filings with respect to
the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby under the 1933 Act and
the 1934 Act and applicable state "blue sky" laws and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

 

 

(c) Each of the Company and Parent shall provide the other parties and their
respective counsel with (i) any comments or other communications, whether
written or oral, that such party or its counsel may receive from time to time
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement or the
Registration Statement, as applicable, promptly after receipt of those
comments or other communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the response to those comments.

 

 

(d) No amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Registration
Statement will be made by Parent or the Company without the approval of the
other parties hereto, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; provided, that with respect to documents filed by a party which are
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or Proxy Statement,
this right of approval shall apply only with respect to information relating
to the other party or its business, financial condition or results of
operations; and provided, further, that the Company, in connection with an
Adverse Recommendation Change, may amend or supplement the Proxy Statement
(including by incorporation by reference) pursuant to an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement (including by incorporation by reference)
to the extent it contains (i) an Adverse Recommendation Change, (ii) a
statement of the reasons of the Board of Directors of the Company for making
such Adverse Recommendation Change and (iii) additional information
reasonably related to the foregoing. Each party will advise the other
parties, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the
Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment
has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of Parent Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment
of the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement. If, at any time prior
to the Effective Time, Parent or the Company discovers any information
relating to any party, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors, that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement, so that none of
those documents would include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements in any such
document, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party that discovers that information shall promptly notify
the other party and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing that
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
by law or regulation, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

release, making any other public statement or scheduling any press conference
or conference call with investors or analysts with respect to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, except for any public
statement or press release as may be required by Applicable Law, order of a
court of competent jurisdiction or any listing agreement with or rule of any
national securities exchange or association, shall not issue any such press
release, make any such other public statement or schedule any such press
conference or conference call before such consultation and providing each
other the opportunity to review and comment upon any such press release or
public statement. The initial press release of the parties announcing
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release of Parent and
the Company in a form that is mutually agreed.

 

 

Section 8.04. Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger
Subsidiary, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take

other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise
in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and
under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to
be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection
with, the Merger.

 

 

Section 8.05. Notices of Certain Events. Each of the Company and Parent
shall promptly notify and provide copies to the other of:

 

 

(a) any written notice from any Governmental Authority alleging that the
consent or approval of such Governmental Authority is required to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or written notice from any
other Person alleging that the consent of such Person is required to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

 

(b) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

 

(c) any Actions commenced or, to its knowledge, threatened against, relating
to or involving or otherwise affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed
pursuant to any of such party's representations or warranties, as the case
may be, or that are material and relate to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

 

 

(d) any occurrence or event that is reasonably likely to cause an inaccuracy
of any representation or warranty of that party contained in this Agreement
at any time during the term hereof that could reasonably be expected to cause
any condition set forth in Article 9 not to be satisfied;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

65  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 8.05 shall
not affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by any
party hereunder or limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder
to the party receiving such notice.

 

 

Section 8.06. Tax-free Reorganization. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, each
of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Merger to qualify as a 368 Reorganization, and shall not take any action
reasonably likely to cause the Merger not so to qualify. Provided the
opinion conditions contained in Sections 9.02(d) and 9.03(b) of this
Agreement have been satisfied, each of Parent and the Company shall report
the Merger for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

 

(b) Officers of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company shall execute and
deliver to Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP, tax counsel for Parent, and Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, tax counsel for the Company, Tax
Representation Letters. Each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts not to take or cause to be taken any
action that would cause to be untrue any portion of the Tax
Representation Letters.

 

 

Section 8.07. Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
Parent and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause
any dispositions of Company Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Stock) or acquisitions of Parent Stock (including
derivative securities with respect to Parent Stock) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by Article 2 of this Agreement by each individual
who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act
with respect to the Company or will become subject to such reporting
requirements with respect to Parent to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the 1934 Act.

 

 

Section 8.08. Stock Exchange De-listing; 1934 Act Deregistration. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under Applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the
de-listing by the Surviving Corporation of the Company Stock from the NYSE
and the deregistration of the Company Stock and other securities of the

may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time (notwithstanding any
approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company):

 

 

(a) by mutual written agreement of the Company and Parent;

 

 

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if:

 

 

(i) the Merger has not been consummated on or before September 15, 2010 (the
"End Date"); provided that, if on the End Date any of the conditions to
Closing set forth in Sections 9.01(c), 9.02(b) or 9.02(c) shall not have been
satisfied but all other conditions to Closing shall be satisfied or (to the
extent legally permissible) waived, or are then capable of being satisfied,
then the End Date shall be extended to December 31, 2010; provided, further,
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10(b)(i)
shall not be available to any party whose breach of any provision of this
Agreement results in the failure of the Merger to be consummated by such
time;

 

 

(ii) there shall be any Applicable Law in effect that (A) makes consummation
of the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited or (B) permanently enjoins
the Company or Parent from consummating the Merger and, in the case of
clauses (A) and (B) any such Applicable Law, including an injunction, shall
have become final and nonappealable; provided that the party seeking to
terminate this agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01(b)(ii) shall have
fulfilled its obligations under Section 8.01; or

 

 

(iii) at the Company Stockholder Meeting (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof), the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been
obtained; or

 

 

(c) by Parent, if:

 

 

(i) if (a) the Company's Board of Directors shall have made an Adverse
Recommendation Change, (b) the Company's Board of Directors shall have failed
to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within 10 Business Days after
receipt of any written request to do so from Parent,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

70  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or (c) prior to the Company Stockholder Approval having been obtained, an
intentional and material breach (x) by the Company of Section 6.03 shall have
occurred that is sanctioned or permitted by the Company or (y) by the Company
of the first sentence of Section 6.02 shall have occurred; or

 

 

(ii) a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement
shall have occurred that would cause the condition set forth in Section
9.02(a) not to be satisfied, and such condition is incapable of being
satisfied by the End Date; or

 

 

(d) by the Company, if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure
to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger
Subsidiary set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred that would cause
the condition set forth in Section 9.03(a) not to be satisfied, and such
condition is incapable of being satisfied by the End Date.

 

 

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01
(other than pursuant to Section 10.01(a)) shall give written notice of such
termination to the other party.

 

 

Section 10.02. Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 10.01, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect
without liability of any party (or any stockholder, director, officer,
employee, agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the other
party hereto; provided that, except as set forth in Section 11.04(d), if such
termination shall result from the intentional and willful material failure of
any party to perform a covenant hereof, such party shall be fully liable for
any and all liabilities and damages incurred or suffered by the other party
as a result of such failure. None of Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the Company
shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages (which the
parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of
expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may include to the extent proven the
benefit of the bargain lost by a party's stockholders (taking into
consideration relevant matters, including other combination opportunities and
the time value of money), which shall be deemed in such event to be damages
of such party) arising out of its intentional and willful breach of any
provision of this Agreement. The provisions of this Section 10.02 and Article
11, and the Confidentiality Agreement, shall survive any termination hereof
pursuant to Section 10.01.

signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or

(ii) (A) the termination of this Agreement by Parent or the Company pursuant

73  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Acquisition Proposal shall have been consummated (provided that for purposes
of this clause (C), each reference to "30%" in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%").

 

 

(c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
11.04 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Subsidiary would not
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay

any costs and expenses actually incurred by Parent or Merger Subsidiary in

judgment against the Company for such amount, together with interest on the
amount of any unpaid fee, cost or expense at the publicly announced prime
rate of Citibank, N.A. from the date such fee, cost or expense was required
to be paid to (but excluding) the payment date.

 

 

(d) In the event of a termination of this Agreement under the circumstances
giving rise to a Company Payment Event, any payment by the Company under this
Section 11.04 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and its
Subsidiaries for damages against the Company with respect to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby. In no event shall the Company be
required to pay any amounts due to Parent pursuant to this Section 11.04 on
more than one occasion.

 

 

Section 11.05. Disclosure Letter and SEC Document References. (a) The
parties hereto agree that any reference in a particular Section of either the
Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to
be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (i)
the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the
relevant party that are contained in the corresponding Section of this
Agreement and (ii) any other representations and warranties of such party
that is contained in this Agreement (regardless of the absence of an express
reference or cross-reference in a particular Section of this Agreement or a
particular Section of either the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent
Disclosure Letter), but only if the relevance of that reference as an
exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and
warranties would be reasonably apparent.

 

 

(b) The parties hereto agree that any information contained in any part of
any Filed Company SEC Document or Filed Parent SEC Document shall only be
deemed to be an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) the applicable
party's representations and warranties if the relevance of that information
as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations
and warranties would be reasonably apparent; provided that, except for
any specific factual information contained therein, in no event shall
any information contained in any part of any Filed Company SEC Document or

this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies,
obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

 

 

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights
or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in
part, to (i) one or more of their Affiliates at any time and (ii) after
the Effective Time, to any Person; provided that any such transfer or
assignment described in clause (i) or (ii) shall not relieve Parent or Merger
Subsidiary of its obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any
obligation of any other party hereto or due to Parent or Merger Subsidiary.

construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or
in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(whether brought by any party or any of its Affiliates or against any party
or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in the Delaware Chancery Court or,
if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court located in the
State of Delaware or other Delaware state court, and each of the parties
hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such Action and irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such Action in any such
court or that any such Action brought in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum. Process in any such Action may be served on any party
anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such
court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of
process on such party as provided in Section 11.01 shall be deemed effective
service of process on such party.

 

 

Section 11.09. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS

75  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 11.10. Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto.
Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the
other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall
have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral
or written agreement or other communication). Electronic or facsimile
signatures shall be deemed to be original signatures.

 

 

Section 11.11. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement and the exhibits, schedules and annexes hereto constitute the
entire agreement between the parties with respect to their subject matter and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written,
between the parties with respect to that subject matter.

 

 

Section 11.12. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 

 

Section 11.13. Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or
any Delaware state court, in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.
