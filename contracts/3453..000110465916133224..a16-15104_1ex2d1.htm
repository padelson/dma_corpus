of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing
Balance Sheet_ "); (ii) a calculation of the actual (A) Net Working Capital as
of the Closing (the " _Closing Net Working Capital_ "), (B) Indebtedness as of
the Closing (the " _Closing Indebtedness_ "), (C) Cash as of the Closing (the
" _Closing Cash_ ") and (D) Transaction Expenses as of the Closing (the "
_Closing Transaction Expenses_ ") (with each of Closing Net Working Capital,
Closing Indebtedness and Closing Cash determined without giving effect to the
transactions contemplated herein) and (iii) on the basis of the foregoing, a
calculation of the Purchase Price. The Closing Balance Sheet, Closing Net
Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Cash shall be calculated in
accordance with the definitions of such terms set forth in this Agreement. All
calculations of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Cash and Closing Transaction Expenses shall be accompanied by a certificate of
the Buyers Chief Financial Officer certifying that such amounts have been
prepared in good faith in accordance with this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Closing Statement shall become final and binding on the 30th day
following the Buyers delivery thereof, unless prior to the end of such
period, the Seller delivers to the Buyer written notice of its disagreement (a
" _Notice of Disagreement_ ") specifying the nature and amount of any dispute
as to the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash
and/or Closing Transaction Expenses, as set forth in the Closing Statement.
The Seller shall be deemed to have agreed with the Buyers calculation of
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Closing
Transaction Expenses not specifically referenced in the Notice of
Disagreement, and such items and amounts shall not be subject to review in
accordance with Section 2.4(c). Any Notice of Disagreement may reference only
disagreements based on mathematical errors or based on amounts of the Closing
Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Closing
Transaction Expenses as reflected on the Closing Statement not being
calculated in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, including the
definitions set forth herein. If a timely Notice of Disagreement is delivered
by Seller, then the Closing Statement shall become final and binding on the
parties on the earlier of (i) the date the Buyer and Seller resolve in writing
any differences they have with

 



      
 

 



 

respect to the matters set forth in the Notice of Disagreement and (ii) the
date all matters in dispute are finally resolved by the Firm.

 



 

(c) During the fifteen (15) day period following delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement by the Seller to the Buyer, the parties in good faith shall seek
to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to the
computation of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Cash and/or Closing Transaction Expenses as specified therein and any related
items. Any disputed items resolved in writing between the Seller and the Buyer
within such fifteen (15) day period shall be final and binding with respect to
such items, and if the Seller and the Buyer agree in writing on the resolution
of each disputed item specified by the Seller in the Notice of Disagreement
and the amount of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness,
Closing Cash and Closing Transaction Expenses, the amounts so determined shall
be final and binding on the parties for all purposes hereunder. If the Seller
and the Buyer have not resolved all such differences by the end of such
fifteen (15) day period, the Seller and the Buyer shall, within thirty (30)
days following the end of such period, submit in writing to a nationally
recognized independent firm with a nationally recognized dispute resolution
practice (the " _Firm_ "), their briefs detailing their views as to the
correct nature and amount of each item remaining in dispute and the amounts of
the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and
Closing Transaction Expenses, and the Firm shall make a written determination
as to each such disputed item and the amount of the Closing Net Working
Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Closing Transaction Expenses,
which determination shall be final and binding on the parties for all purposes
hereunder and shall not be subject to appeal or further review. The Firm shall
consider only those items and amounts in the Sellers and the Buyers
respective calculations of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Closing Transaction Expenses that are
identified as being items and amounts to which the Seller and the Buyer have
been unable to agree. In resolving any disputed item, the Firm may not assign
a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by
either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either
party. The Firm shall be Duff and Phelps, LLP or, if such firm is unable or
unwilling to act, such other nationally recognized firm expert in resolving
such disputes as shall be agreed in writing by the Seller and the Buyer. The
Seller and the Buyer shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Firm to render a written decision resolving the matters submitted to it as
promptly as practicable, and in any event within thirty (30) days following
the submission thereof. Judgment may be entered upon the written determination
of the Firm in accordance with Section 10.9. In acting under this Agreement,
the Firm will be entitled to the privileges and immunities of an arbitrator.

 



 

(d) The fees and expenses of the Firm shall be borne 50% by the Seller and 50%
by the Buyer, unless the Firm adopts in full all the positions of one of the
parties, in which case the other party shall bear 100% of such amounts. The
other fees and disbursements of each party incurred in connection with the
dispute resolution pursuant to this Section 2.4(c) shall be borne by such
party.

 



 

(e) The Buyer and the Seller will, and will cause the Company (in the case of
the Seller, prior to the Closing and, in the case of the Buyer, during the
period from and after the date of delivery of the Closing Statement through
the resolution of any adjustments contemplated by this Section 2.4) to afford
the other party and its Representatives reasonable access, during

 



       
 

 



 

normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice, to the personnel,
properties, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to any
other information reasonably requested for purposes of preparing and reviewing
the calculations contemplated by this Section 2.4. Each party shall authorize
its accountants to disclose work papers generated by such accountants in
connection with preparing and reviewing the calculations of the Net Working
Capital, Cash and Indebtedness as specified in this Section 2.4; _provided_ ,
that such accountants shall not be obligated to make any work papers available
except in accordance with such accountants disclosure procedures and then
only after the non-client party has signed an agreement relating to access to
such work papers in form and substance acceptable to such accountants.

 



 

(f) The Final Closing Statement, once final and binding in accordance with
this Section 2.4, shall be used to determine the Purchase Price.

 



 

(i) For the purposes of this Agreement, the " _Net Adjustment Amount_ " means
the aggregate amount, which aggregate amount may be positive or negative,
equal to the Purchase Price _minus_ the Estimated Purchase Price.

 



 

(ii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is positive, (A) within three (3) Business
Days following the date on which the Final Closing Statement becomes final and
binding on the parties, the Buyer shall immediately pay to the Seller, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to the Net Adjustment
Amount to an account or accounts designated by the Seller; and

 



 

(iii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is negative (in which case the "Net
Adjustment Amount" for purposes of this clause (iii) shall be deemed to be
equal to the absolute value of such amount), within three (3) Business Days
following the date on which the Final Closing Statement becomes final and
binding on the parties, the Seller shall immediately pay to the Buyer, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to the Net Adjustment
Amount to an account or accounts designated by the Buyer.

 



 

(iv) The payments (if any) by the Buyer contemplated by Section 2.4(f)(ii)
above shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for the Seller for payment of any
Net Adjustment Amount pursuant to this Section 2.4, and recourse against the
Buyer in accordance with Section 2.4(f)(ii) shall be Sellers and its
Affiliates sole and exclusive source of recovery for any amounts owing to the
Seller pursuant to this Section 2.4.

 



 

(v) The payment (if any) by the Seller contemplated by Section 2.4(f)(iii)
above, or payment by Evergreen pursuant to the Evergreen Guaranty, shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy for Buyer for payment of any Net Adjustment
Amount pursuant to this Section 2.4, and recourse against the Seller in
accordance with Section 2.4(f)(iii), or Evergreen pursuant to the Evergreen
Guaranty, shall be Buyers and its Affiliates sole and exclusive source of
recovery for any amounts owing to Buyer pursuant to this Section 2.4, except
as set forth in Section 8.2(d). The dispute resolution provisions provided in
this Section 2.4 shall be the exclusive remedies for the matters addressed
herein. For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, except as provided in, or for breaches of, this Section 2.4 and
except in the event of fraud, no claim by the Seller or the Buyer or any other
Person for the

 



      
 

 



 

payment of any Net Adjustment Amount pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall be
asserted against the Buyer, the Seller, Evergreen or any other Person.

 



 

(vi) All payments required pursuant to Sections 2.4(f)(ii) and 2.4(f)(iii)
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for income tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 2.5 _Purchase Price Allocation._

 



 

(a) For applicable income Tax purposes, the Purchase Price (plus any
liabilities treated as consideration for the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for federal income tax purposes) shall be allocated among the
assets of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries in a manner consistent with
Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder
(the " _Price Allocation_ "). The Buyer shall be responsible for the
preparation the Price Allocation. Following the final determination of the
Final Closing Statement pursuant to Section 2.4, the Buyer shall forward the
proposed Price Allocation and a draft IRS Form 8594 to the Seller for its
review. If the Seller agrees in writing with the Price Allocation or fails to
object in writing to the Price Allocation within twenty (20) days following
receipt thereof from the Buyer, the Price Allocation shall be conclusive and
binding upon the Buyer and the Seller for all Tax purposes. If the parties are
unable to agree on the Price Allocation after good faith consultation, the
matters in dispute shall be referred for resolution to the Firm. The fees and
expenses of the Firm shall be borne 50% by the Seller and 50% by the Buyer,
unless the Firm adopts in full all the positions of or one of the parties, in
which case the other party shall bear 100% of such amounts. The Firm shall
resolve any disputed matters as promptly as practicable, and the Firms
decision with respect to any such matter shall be conclusive and binding on
the Buyer, the Seller, and their respective Affiliates for applicable Tax
purposes.

 



 

(b) Each party agrees to timely file any form required to be filed by
applicable Tax Law reflecting the Price Allocation (including IRS Form 8594
and any similar filing required by applicable state or local Tax Law). The
Price Allocation made pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall be binding on the
Buyer and the Seller for all income Tax reporting purposes. Neither the Buyer
nor the Seller shall take any position inconsistent with the Price Allocation
in connection with any income Tax proceeding, except to the extent that (i)
the Buyers cost for the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries may differ
from the amount so allocated to the extent necessary to reflect its
capitalized acquisition costs not included in the amount realized by the
Seller or (ii) the amount treated as purchase price has changed by reason of
payments of amounts between the Buyer and the Seller subsequent to the Closing
Date that were not previously reflected in the Price Allocation. If any
Governmental Authority disputes the Price Allocation, the party receiving
notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the other party hereto, and the
parties shall cooperate in good faith in responding to such dispute in order
to preserve the effectiveness of the Price Allocation.

 



 

(c) Any indemnification or other payment treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 8.8 hereof or otherwise, or any other
payment treated as an adjustment to the purchase price for the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries under applicable Law, shall be reflected as an
adjustment to the price allocated to a specific asset, if

 



      
 

 



 

any, giving rise to the adjustment and if any such adjustment does not relate
to a specific asset, such adjustment shall be allocated among the assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with this Section 2.5.

 



 

Section 2.6 _Withholding Rights_. The Buyer and its agents shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable to any Person
pursuant to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements such amounts as it
determines it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any provision of applicable Tax Law. Any such
deducted and withheld amounts that are paid over to the proper Governmental
Authority shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements as having been paid to the applicable Person in respect
of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

December 26, 2015 (such balance sheet, together with all related notes and

a system of internal accounting controls which are effective in providing
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP (including the

complete description and amount of all Indebtedness of the Seller and its
Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement (other than Indebtedness of the
type identified in clause (iv) of the definition of Indebtedness that would be
included as a current liability in Net Working Capital as of the date of this
Agreement). The Company has no outstanding letters of credit.

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is and, for the past three (3)
years has been in compliance in all material respects with all Laws applicable
to it. None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their

"). Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is and has been in compliance in
all material respects with all such Permits. No suspension, cancellation,
adverse modification, revocation or nonrenewal of any Permit is pending or, to
the knowledge of the Seller, threatened. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Seller of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, will not result in
the suspension, cancellation, adverse modification or revocation of any of the
Permits. No Permit is held in the name of any employee, officer, limited
liability company manager, director, member or agent on behalf of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries.

deferred compensation plan" (as defined for purposes of Section 409A(d)(1) of
the Code), (i) such plan or arrangement has been operated in all material
respects since January 1, 2005 in compliance with Section 409A of the Code and

interest or penalty on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries thereunder; (ii)
the document or documents that evidence each such plan or arrangement have

Person for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, by such Person), for U.S. federal
and (where permitted) all applicable state and local income tax purposes as of
the Closing. Each of the Buyer and the Seller shall prepare and file all Tax

From and after the Closing, the Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the

been incurred but for a breach of a representation by the Seller)).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the foregoing
indemnification obligation shall not be subject to any limitations set forth
in Section 8.6(a).

 



 

Section 6.3 _Tax Returns._

the Company shall reasonably consider any comments made in writing by the
Seller at least three (3) Business Days prior to the due date thereof. The

Governmental Authority.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Tax Contests_. The Buyer shall with reasonable promptness notify
the Seller following receipt of any notice of any Tax Action for which the
Seller may have liability pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ , that,

entitled to participate in the defense of such Tax Action, at its sole

liability thereunder.

promptness after receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third
Party Claim and the determination by such Indemnified Party that such Third
Party Claim has given or could give rise to a right of indemnification under
this Agreement, and shall provide the Indemnifying Party with such information
with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. Without

Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be
entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim that primarily seeks
equitable or injunctive relief or for any claim that would impose criminal
liability or damages, and the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
defend, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, any such Third Party Claims.
If the Indemnifying Party does not expressly elect (or is not entitled) to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim within the time period and
otherwise in accordance with the first sentence of this Section 8.4(b), the
Indemnified Party shall have the sole right to assume the defense of and to
settle, with the consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to
participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party unless (i) the employment of
such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the
Indemnifying Party or (ii) the named parties to the Third Party Claim
(including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party reasonably determines that
representation by counsel to the Indemnifying Party of both the Indemnifying
Party and such Indemnified Party may present such counsel with a conflict of
interest (it being understood that, in such case, such legal fees and expenses
may constitute Losses hereunder). If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall, at the
Indemnifying Partys expense, cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such
defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party all witnesses, pertinent
records, materials and information in the Indemnified Partys possession or
under the Indemnified Partys control relating thereto as is reasonably
required by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, enter into any settlement
or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to such
Third Party Claim if such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) involves a
finding or admission of wrongdoing, (ii) does not include an unconditional
written release by the claimant or plaintiff of the Indemnified Party from all
liability in respect of such Third Party Claim or (iii) imposes equitable
remedies or any obligation on the Indemnified Party other than solely the
payment of money damages for which the Indemnified Party will be indemnified
hereunder.

 



 

(c) An Indemnified Party seeking indemnification in respect of, arising out of
or involving a Loss in respect of a claim or demand hereunder that does not
involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected
from such Indemnified Party (a " _Direct Claim_ ,") shall deliver a Claim
Notice in respect thereof to the Indemnifying Party with reasonable promptness
after becoming aware of facts supporting such Direct Claim, and shall provide
the Indemnifying Party with such information with respect thereto as the
Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. Without limiting the provisions of
Section 8.1, the failure to

 



      
 

 



 

deliver a Claim Notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from
any of its obligations under Article VI and this Article VIII except to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure
and shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any other obligation or
liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party or pursuant to Article VI
and this Article VIII. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the
Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days following its receipt of a Claim
Notice in respect of a Direct Claim that the Indemnifying Party disputes its
liability to the Indemnified Party hereunder, such Direct Claim specified by
the Indemnified Party in such Claim Notice shall be conclusively deemed a Loss
hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party agrees that it has an indemnification
obligation but asserts that it is obligated for a lesser amount than that
claimed by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall pay or direct
the Escrow Agent to release payment from the Indemnity Escrow Account, as
applicable, such lesser amount promptly to the Indemnified Party, without
prejudice to or waiver of the Indemnified Partys claim for the difference.

 



 

(d) The indemnification of the Buyer Indemnified Parties required under this
Agreement shall be made, to the extent available, by prompt payment by the
Escrow Agent (to the extent of any amounts then available in the Indemnity
Escrow Account if applicable) or payment made by the Indemnifying Party (to
the extent of any amounts not then available in the Indemnity Escrow Account
if applicable) of the amount of Losses in connection therewith. With respect
to indemnification required under this Agreement for Losses arising out of or
relating to Fundamental Representations or Fundamental Pre-Closing Covenants,
Losses arising out of or relating to the Earnout Obligations described in
Section 5.8 or Losses described in Section 6.2, the Buyer may elect to payment
by the Escrow Agent from the Indemnity Escrow Account as set forth in Section
8.5 or by payment made by the Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(e) The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to require that any action be
made or brought against any other Person before action is brought or claim is
made against it hereunder by the Indemnified Party.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.9, each Indemnifying Party
hereby consents to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any court in which an
Action in respect of a Third Party Claim is brought against any Indemnified
Party for purposes of any claim that an Indemnified Party may have under this
Agreement with respect to such Action or the matters alleged therein and
agrees that process may be served on each Indemnifying Party with respect to
such claim anywhere.

 



 

(g) For purposes of this Article VIII, whether there has been a breach of a
representation in Section 3.17 and the amount of Losses payable in connection
with any such breach shall be determined without regard to any information set
forth in the Disclosure Schedules (other than (i) solely with respect to the
last sentence of Section 3.17(a), the information set forth in _Schedule
3.17(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedules and (ii) solely with respect to the
first sentence of Section 3.17(h), the identification of the Tax Actions set
forth in _Schedule 3.17(h)_ of the Disclosure Schedules).

 



 

Section 8.5 _Indemnity Escrow for Claims Against the Seller_. From and after
the Closing (but subject to the provisions of Article VI and this Article
VIII) the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to receive amounts from
the Indemnity Escrow Account in respect of any

 



      
 

 



 

Losses incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties under Section 6.2 and Section
8.2 hereof. The Buyer Indemnified Parties sole and exclusive recourse in
respect of the matters identified in Sections 8.2(a) and 8.2(b) (except for
such matters arising from the representations and warranties of the Seller
identified in Section 8.6(a)(A) and the pre-Closing covenants to be performed
by the Seller identified in Section 8.6(a)(B)) shall be the amounts then
remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account, and such recourse may be sought
only in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.
No Person (including Seller or any of its members or its or their respective
Affiliates) shall have any obligation to fund or replenish the Indemnity
Escrow Account at any time after the Closing.

 



 

Section 8.6 _Limits on Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:

 



 

(i) an Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.3(a), as the case may
be, unless and until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be
recovered from the Indemnifying Party equals or exceeds $987,500.00 in the
aggregate (the " _Deductible_ "), in which case the Indemnifying Party shall
be responsible only for such Losses exceeding the Deductible;

 



 

(ii) the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be
recovered from an Indemnifying Party arising out of or relating to the causes
set forth in Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.2(b), as the case may be, shall be an
amount equal to the amount then remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account; and

 



 

(iii) the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be
recovered from an Indemnifying Party arising out of or relating to the causes
set forth in Section 8.3(a) or Section 8.3(b), as the case may be, shall be an
amount equal to the Indemnity Escrow Amount.

 



 

 _provided_ , that the foregoing clauses (a)(i), (a)(ii) and (a)(iii) shall
not apply to Losses arising out of or relating to:

 



 

(A) the inaccuracy or breach of any of the representations and warranties set
forth in Sections 3.1 and 4.1, Sections 3.2 and 4.2, Section 3.4, Section 3.5,
Section 3.6, Section 3.17 and Section 3.30 (Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6,
3.17, 3.30, 4.1 and 4.2 are collectively referred to herein as the "
_Fundamental Representations_ "); and

 



 

(B) the intentional breach of any covenants and agreements of the Seller and
the Buyer set forth in Sections 5.1(a) through 5.1(v), Section 5.2(c), Section
5.3, Sections 5.5 through 5.13 (excluding Section 5.7) (collectively, the "
_Fundamental Pre-Closing Covenants_ ") of the Seller and the Buyer contained
in this Agreement, it being understood that, for purposes of this Article
VIII, "intentional breach" shall mean an action taken (which may include a
decision not to take an action) with willful disregard or actual conscious
awareness that such action constitutes a breach;

 



      
 

 



 

 _provided further_ , that the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable
Losses which may be recovered arising out of or relating to Section 8.2 shall
be an amount equal to the Purchase Price as of the Closing.

 



 

(b) Without limiting Section 8.4(e) above, any Losses claimed hereunder shall
be net of any proceeds actually recovered under any insurance policy of the
Company and its Subsidiaries listed on _Schedule 3.21_ of the Disclosure
Schedules by any Person entitled to indemnification or escrow recovery, as
applicable, hereunder. In the event that an insurance recovery under any
insurance policy of the Company and its Subsidiaries listed on _Schedule 3.21_
of the Disclosure Schedules is made by any such Person with respect to any
Loss for which any such Person has been indemnified or otherwise recovered
hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate net amount of the insurance
recovery shall be made promptly to the Person providing the indemnity or other
recovery (in the case of recovery from the Indemnity Escrow Account, such
Person being Seller).

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall any
Person be entitled to recover or make a claim for any amounts in respect of
punitive or exemplary damages (except to the extent payable to a third party
in connection with a Third Party Claim).

 



 

(d) None of the provisions in this Article 8 (other than Section 8.9) shall
apply with respect to a fraud claim.

 



 

Section 8.7 _Remedies Not Affected by Investigation, Disclosure or Knowledge_.
If the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Buyer expressly
reserves the right to seek indemnity for any Losses arising out of or relating
to any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein,
notwithstanding any investigation by, disclosure to, knowledge or imputed
knowledge of the Buyer or any of its Representatives in respect of any fact or
circumstance that reveals the occurrence of any such breach, whether before or
after the execution and delivery hereof. In furtherance of the foregoing, the
Seller agrees that as knowledge or lack of reliance shall not be a defense to
any indemnity claim for breach of representation, warranty or covenant by the
Seller herein, the Seller shall not in such proceeding for an indemnity claim
hereunder seek to introduce evidence or argument in any such proceeding
regarding the knowledge or lack of reliance of the Buyer or any of its
Representatives prior to the Closing on or with respect to any such
representations, warranties or covenants with respect to such indemnity
claims.

 



 

Section 8.8 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. The parties agree to
treat all indemnification payments (whether paid directly by the Indemnifying
Party or from the Indemnity Escrow Account) made under Section 6.2 and this
Article VIII as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for income tax purposes,
unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 8.9 _Remedies_. After the Closing, _Section 2.4_, _Section 2.5_,
_Article VI_, this _Article VIII_ and _Section 10.11_ will provide the
exclusive remedies for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement and/or the
transactions contemplated hereby, except for claims for fraud. The remedies

 



       
 

 



 

expressly available to a party hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive
of any other remedy which is expressly available to a party hereunder.

to the Closing:

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of the Buyer and the Seller;

 



 

(b) (i) by the Seller, if the Seller is not then in material breach of its
obligations under this Agreement and the Buyer breaches or fails to perform in
any respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in
this Agreement and such breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2, (B) cannot be or has not
been cured within ten (10) days following delivery to the Buyer of written
notice of such breach or failure to perform and (C) has not been waived by the
Seller; _provided_ that neither a breach or violation of the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 4.4 nor the Buyers failure to make any of
the payments required to be made by the Buyer at the Closing in accordance
with Section 2.2 shall be subject to notice or cure hereunder, unless the
Buyers failure to make any such payments at the Closing is due to a closure
of financial institutions in the United States resulting from an act of God,
an outbreak of war, military acts or acts of terrorism, in which case such
failure to pay shall be subject to cure no later than two (2) Business Days
following such failure; or (ii) by the Buyer, if the Buyer is not then in
material breach of its obligations under this Agreement and the Seller

warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement and such breach or failure
to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in

following delivery to the Seller of written notice of such breach or failure

the Buyer, if any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.3
shall have become incapable of fulfillment prior to the End Date; _provided_ ,
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(c)
shall not be available if the failure of the party so requesting termination
to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall have been the cause of,
or shall have resulted in, the failure of such condition to be satisfied on or
prior to such date;

 



 

(d) by the Buyer if (i) the first Key Employee set forth on _Schedule A_
communicates to an officer of the Buyer that he will not continue employment
under the terms of the Employment Agreement on or after the Closing Date
(other than as a result of the termination of such Employment Agreement by the
Buyer) or such Key Employee has entered into a termination agreement with
respect to such Employment Agreement prior to the Closing Date or commenced
negotiations in such regard or (ii) the first Key Employee set forth on
_Schedule A_ provides a notice of termination (but with it being understood
that the foregoing termination right

 



      
 

 



 

of the Buyer shall terminate with respect to such Key Employee if such
termination right is not exercised by the Buyer (A) within thirty (30) days
following the occurrence of any event described in the foregoing clause (i),
or (B) within thirty (30) days following (x) the occurrence of any event
described in the foregoing clause (ii) if such writing is delivered to the
Buyer or any of its Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
or (y) the Sellers delivery of notice to the Buyer in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement of the occurrence of any event described in the
foregoing clause (ii) if such writing is delivered to the Seller or any of its
Affiliates).

 



 

(e) by either the Seller or the Buyer if the Closing shall not have occurred
by the End Date; _provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 9.1(e) shall not be available if the failure of the party so
requesting termination to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall
have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure of the Closing
to occur on or prior to such date; or

 



 

(f) by either the Seller or the Buyer in the event that any Governmental
Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other
action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and such order, decree, ruling or other action
shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ , that the party so
requesting termination shall have used its reasonable best efforts (subject to
Section 5.7) to have such order, decree, ruling or other action vacated.

 



 

The party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1
(other than Section 9.1(a)) shall give prompt written notice of such
termination to the other party.

 



 

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and there shall be no liability on the part of either party except (a)
for the provisions of Article X and this Section 9.2 and Section 9.3, each of

contemplated by this Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall remain in
effect; _provided_ that such privilege from and after the Closing shall be
controlled by the Seller. As to any privileged attorney client communications
between Kirkland and Ellis LLP and the Company or any of their Subsidiaries
prior to the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Privileged Communications_ "),
the Buyer and the Company, together with any of their respective Affiliates,
