Section 1\. _Purchase and Sale_

 

1.1 _Sale and Purchase_.

 

(a) At the Closing, immediately prior to (and conditioned upon the occurrence
of) the Effective Time, Parent agrees to (and hereby does) purchase from each
Blocker Owner, and each Blocker Owner agrees to (and hereby does) sell,
transfer and assign to Parent, its Blocker Interests, free and clear of any
and all Liens, and Parent hereby agrees to pay to each Blocker Owner no later
than the later of (i) the Business Day after submission of a properly
completed Letter of Transmittal by the Blocker Owner, and (ii) the Business
Day after the Closing, cash (without interest) representing such Blocker
Owners respective portion of the Blocker Merger Consideration which would
have represented the portion of the Merger Consideration payable to the
Blocker Entity under the Merger Agreement but for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement set forth opposite such Blocker Owners name
on _Exhibit A_ attached hereto. The Escrow Funding Percentage of each Blocker
Owner shall be set forth opposite such Blocker Owners name on _Exhibit A_
attached hereto.

 

(b) Each Blocker Owner hereby directs Parent to deposit a portion of the
Blocker Merger Consideration equal to such Blocker Owners Escrow Funding
Percentage of the Escrow Amount, Special Escrow Amount, Adjustment Fund Amount
and Representative Fund Amount in the Escrow Account to be held in escrow by
the Escrow Agent and distributed pursuant to the Escrow Agreement as if
such Blocker Owner was a Unitholder under the terms and conditions set forth
in the Escrow Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision in the Merger Agreement or this
Agreement, the applicable Per Unit Consideration in respect of each of the
Blocker Units that would otherwise be payable to the Blocker Entities out of
the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4 of the Merger Agreement,
subject to and in accordance with Section 1.5 of the Merger Agreement
(including the escrow obligations described therein), instead shall be payable
to the Blocker Owners (in lieu of the Blocker Entities) as the
aggregate purchase price in exchange for all right, title and interest to the
Blocker Interests pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement or in the Merger Agreement, in no event shall
Parent and/or any of its Affiliates be required to pay any consideration to
the Unitholders (including the Blocker Entities) and the Blocker Owners in an
amount in the aggregate in excess of the Merger Consideration (as adjusted
pursuant to the Merger Agreement) or at a time that is different than is
contemplated by the Merger Agreement (except as provided in this Agreement).

 



2 1.2 _Closing; Deliverables_.

 

(a) The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall take
place on the Closing Date and be effective as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
is conditional upon the Closing of the Merger Agreement occurring.

 

(b) On the Closing Date, each Blocker Owner shall deliver, or cause to be
delivered, to Parent certificates representing all of the Blocker Interests
being sold hereunder, accompanied by a stock transfer power duly endorsed in
blank relating to such certificates.

1.3  _Representative_. The Blocker Owners hereby acknowledge and agree that
the Representative has been appointed as the true and lawful agent and
attorney-in-fact of such Blocker Owners for all purposes under Section 7.10 of
the Merger Agreement as if such Blocker Owners were Indemnifying
Securityholders thereunder. The Blocker Owners also acknowledge and agree to
all provisions of Section 7.10 of the Merger Agreement as expressly set forth
therein, as if the Blocker Owners were Indemnifying Securityholders
thereunder.

1.4 _Further Assurances_. From and after the Closing, the parties
hereto shall do such acts and execute such documents and instruments as may
be reasonably required to make effective the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

1.5 _Withholding_. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from each
Blocker Owners respective portion of the Blocker Merger Consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any provision of United States federal, state or local, or
any foreign, Tax Law; provided that Parent shall have notified the Blocker
Owners that it intends to deduct and withhold at least three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date or any subsequent date on which the applicable
payment is to be made pursuant to this Agreement to provide the Blocker
Owners with sufficient opportunity to provide any forms or other documentation
or take such other steps in order to avoid such withholding. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax Authority
by Parent, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the applicable Blocker Owners in respect of which Parent
made such deduction and withholding.

 

Section 2\. _Representations and Warranties of the Blocker Owners_

 

Each Blocker Owner severally and separately with respect to the Blocker Entity
it owns only (and notwithstanding any implication herein to the contrary not
with respect to the other Blocker Entity), but not jointly or jointly and
severally, represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

 

2.1 _Organization, Qualification and Power; Enforceability_. Each Blocker
Entity is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of Delaware. Each Blocker Entity is an entity which was formed
solely for the purposes of investing in the Company and has not engaged in any
other business activity other than the holding of the Blocker Units and
such other activities related to the exercise of rights and the fulfillment
of obligations arising under the purchase agreements relating to the
acquisition of the Blocker Units

 



3  by each Blocker Entity, the activities expressly contemplated by this
Agreement and the charter Documents of the Company. Each Blocker Owner and the
Blocker Entity has the corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on
the part of each Blocker Entity and each Blocker Owner. This Agreement
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each Blocker Owner and each
Blocker Entity, is enforceable against each Blocker Entity and each Blocker
Owner in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforceability
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other
similar laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally.

 

2.2 _Capitalization and Related Matters_.

 

(a) The issued and outstanding equity interests of each Blocker Entity and the
number of Company Units held by each Blocker Entity is set forth on _Exhibit
A_ attached hereto. All the Blocker Interests have been duly authorized, have
been validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable.

 

(b) Each Blocker Owner owns its respective Blocker Interests free and clear of
any and all Encumbrances. Each Blocker Entity owns its respective Blocker
Units, free and clear of any and all Encumbrances, except for Encumbrances
under the Charter Documents of the Company.

 

2.3 _Tax Matters_.

(a) Each Blocker Entity has filed all material Tax Returns that it was
required to file. All such Tax Returns as so filed disclose all Taxes required
to be paid for the periods covered thereby in all material respects. All such
Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in all material respects. All
material Taxes due and owing by each Blocker Entity (whether or not shown on
any Tax Return) have been paid. Neither Blocker Entity currently is the
beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return,
which Tax Return has not yet been filed. There are no Encumbrances for Taxes
upon any of the assets of either Blocker Entity other than for (i) Taxes not
yet due and payable or (ii) for Taxes being contested in good faith through
appropriate proceedings and adequately reserved for in accordance with GAAP.
Each Blocker Entity has withheld and paid all material Taxes required to have
been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any
employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder, or other third
party, and all Forms W-2 and 1099 required with respect thereto have been
properly completed and timely filed in all material respects.

 

(b) There is no dispute or claim concerning any Tax liability of either
Blocker Entity claimed or raised by any authority in writing.

 

(c) _Schedule 2.3(c)_ lists all material federal, state, local, and non-U.S.
Tax Returns filed with respect to each Blocker Entity for taxable periods
ended on or after December 31, 2010, indicates those Tax Returns that have
been audited, and indicates those Tax Returns that currently are the subject
of audit. The Blocker Owners have delivered to Parent correct and 

 



4  complete copies of all federal income Tax Returns, examination reports, and
statements of deficiencies assessed against, or agreed to by either Blocker
Entity since December 31, 2010. No Blocker Entity has waived any statute of
limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with
respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency, which is still in effect.

 

(d) No Blocker Entity is a party to any agreement, contract, arrangement, or
plan that has resulted or would result, separately or in the aggregate, in
the payment of any "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Code §280G
(or any corresponding provision of state, local, or non-U.S. Tax law). No
Blocker Entity is a party to or bound by any tax allocation or sharing
agreement. No Blocker Entity (A) has been a member of an Affiliated Group
filing a consolidated federal Income Tax Return or (B) has any liability for
the Taxes of any person under Reg. §1.1502-6 (or any similar provision
of state, local, or non-U.S. law), as a transferee or successor, by contract,
or otherwise.

(f) No Blocker Entity will be required to include any material item of income
in, or exclude any material item of deduction from, taxable income for any
taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result
of any:

 

(i) change in method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or prior to
the Closing Date;

 

(ii) "closing agreement" as described in Code §7121 (or any corresponding or
similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. income Tax law) executed on or
prior to the Closing Date;

(iii) intercompany transactions or any excess loss account described in
Treasury Regulations under Code §1502 (or any corresponding or similar
provision of state, local, or non-U.S. income Tax law);

 

(iv) installment sale or open transaction disposition made on or prior to the
Closing Date (other than in the ordinary course of business); or

(v) prepaid amount received on or prior to the Closing Date (other than in the
ordinary course of business).

(g) No Blocker Entity has distributed stock of another person, or has had its
stock distributed by another person, in a transaction that was purported or
intended to be governed in whole or in part by Code §355 or Code §361\.

(h) No Blocker Entity is or has been a party to any "listed transaction," as
defined in Code §6707A(c)(2) and Reg. §1.6011-4(b)(2).

(o) Limitation of Tax Representations and Warranties. The representations and
warranties in this Section 2.3 are the sole and exclusive representations and
warranties of the Blocker Owners concerning Tax matters of the Blocker
Entities. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Blocker Owners make no representation as to the amount of, or limitations
on, any net operating losses, tax credits or other tax attributes that the
Blocker 

 



5  Entities may have, and no breach or inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty in this Section 2.3 shall entitle any Indemnified Person to be
indemnified for Taxes in respect of any taxable period (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Closing Date.

2.4 _No Other Liabilities_. No Blocker Entity has any liabilities or
obligations, whether known or unknown, accrued, absolute, contingent,
unliquidated or otherwise (and there is no valid basis for any such liability
or obligation or any valid claim in respect thereof), other than any
liabilities retained by the Blocker Entities for unpaid Taxes.

Section 3\. _Representations and Warranties of Parent_

 

Parent represents and warrants to the Blocker Entities and the Blocker Owners
as follows:

 

3.1 _Organization, Qualification and Power; Enforceability_. Parent is a
corporation, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of Georgia. Parent has the corporate power and authority, to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action
on the part of Parent. This Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of Parent, is enforceable against Parent in accordance with its
terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting the
rights and remedies of creditors generally.

 

3.2 _Other Representations and Warranties_. Parent hereby acknowledges and
agrees that all representations and warranties made by Parent pursuant to
Article 3 of the Merger Agreement are incorporated herein as though fully set
forth herein and made to each Blocker Owner _mutatis mutandis_.

 

Section 4\. _Covenants_

 

4.1 _Tax Covenants_. Without the prior written consent of Parent, no Blocker
Entity shall make or change any election, change an annual accounting period,
adopt or change any accounting method, file any amended Tax Return, enter into
any closing agreement, settle any Tax claim or assessment relating to the
Blocker Entity (other than in the ordinary course of business), surrender any
right to claim a refund of Taxes, consent to any extension or waiver of the
limitation period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment relating to the
Blocker Entity (other than automatic extensions of time to file Tax Returns),
or take any other similar action relating to the filing of any Tax Return or
the payment of any Tax, if such election, adoption, change, amendment,
agreement, settlement, surrender, consent or other action would have the
effect of materially increasing the Tax liability of the Blocker Entity for
any period ending after the Closing Date.

 



6 4.2 _Transactions_.

 

(a) It is the intent of the parties that:

 

(i) The transactions contemplated hereby and the Merger Agreement provide that
the Blocker Units held by the Blocker Entities are excluded from the effect
of the Merger and will be treated as sale of the Blocker Interests to Parent
for all U.S. federal income tax purposes and not as sale of the underlying
Blocker Units held by the Blocker Entities. For avoidance of doubt, the
Blocker Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Blocker Units is being
paid directly by Parent pursuant to this Agreement and not pursuant to the
Merger Agreement.

 

(ii) Each Blocker Owner shall have no greater and no fewer rights or
obligations with respect to the transactions, agreements, covenants,
indemnities and other provisions of the Merger Agreement than such Blocker
Owner would have had if, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Blocker
Units held by each Blocker Entity had instead been held directly by such
Blocker Owner (in proportion to such Blocker Owners interest in such Blocker
Entity) and been acquired by the Parent by virtue of the Merger pursuant to
the Merger Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall limit
the rights or obligations of any Blocker Owner with respect to such Blocker
Entity as expressly provided in this Agreement.

(iii) Each Indemnified Person shall have no greater and no fewer rights or
obligations with respect to the transactions, agreements, covenants,
indemnities and other provisions of the Merger Agreement than such Indemnified
Person would have had if, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Units held by the Blocker Entities had instead been held directly by
such Blocker Owner (in proportion to such Blocker Owners interest in such
Blocker Entity) and been acquired by the Parent by virtue of the Merger
pursuant to the Merger Agreement, except that (for the avoidance of doubt)
Parent will obtain no step-up in basis with respect to its acquisition of the
Blocker Interests; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall limit
the rights or obligations of any Indemnified Person with respect to such
Blocker Entity as expressly provided in this Agreement.

 

(b) Each party shall take such other actions and execute such other agreements
as are reasonably necessary to assure that the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement and this Agreement, when taken together, equitably
reflect the relative rights and obligations of the respective parties
(including the rights of the Indemnified Persons and the Indemnifying
Securityholders under the Merger Agreement) and the intent of the parties
described in this _Section 4.2_.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement or in the Merger Agreement to the
contrary, no Indemnified Person shall have any obligations (including
indemnity obligations) with respect to the ownership of the Blocker Units
or as a Unitholder under the Merger Agreement.

Section 5\. _Closing Conditions_

 

5.1 _Merger_. The obligations of the parties hereto to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be subject to the consummation of the
Merger.

 



7 5.2 _FIRPTA Certificate_. The obligation of Parent to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be subject to the delivery by each
Blocker Entity to Parent, at the Closing, of an affidavit, under penalties of
perjury, stating that as to each Blocker Owner the Blocker Owner is not a
"foreign person" within the meaning of Code §§1445 and 7701 ("Non-Foreign
Person Statement").

Section 6\. _Survival of Representations and Warranties; Indemnification_

6.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. Subject to the limitations
and other provisions of this Agreement, the representations and warranties
set forth in _Sections 2.1_ , _2.2_ , ___2.4_ _,_ _3.1_ and _3.2_ shall
survive the Closing and continue in perpetuity. The representations
and warranties provided in _Section 2.3_ shall survive the Closing and
continue in effect until the date that is 60 months after the Closing Date.

 

6.2 _Indemnification of Parent_. Following the closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Indemnified Persons shall be indemnified
and held harmless by each of the Blocker Owners, severally, but not jointly,
from and against, any and all Losses actually incurred by any of them,
resulting from or arising out of:

 

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by such Blocker Owner in
this Agreement; and

 

(b) any breach by such Blocker Owner of any covenant of such Blocker Owner in
this Agreement.

 

6.3 _Indemnification of Blocker Owners_. Following the closing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Blocker Owners and their
affiliates, directors, officers, partners, employees, successors, assigns,
representatives and agents shall be indemnified and held harmless by Parent
from and against, any and all Losses actually incurred by any of them,
resulting from or arising out of:

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Parent in this
Agreement or the Merger Agreement; and

(b) any breach by Parent of any covenant of Parent in this Agreement.

 

6.4 _Limitation on Liability_. Any indemnity payments payable under this
Agreement by a Blocker Owner, including, without limitation any indemnity
obligations arising under _Section 7_ of this Agreement, shall be limited to
the portion of the Blocker Merger Consideration actually received by such
Blocker Owner. In addition, in no event shall the Blocker Owners have
any obligation to indemnify Parent or Indemnified Persons for any Taxes
attributable to or resulting from actions taken by Parent after the Closing.
The amount of Loss for which indemnification is provided under this ARTICLE 6
shall be net of any Tax benefits actually realized by an Indemnified Person
in connection with such claim or recovery in the year of such indemnity
payment or earlier.

 



8 6.5 _Tax Matters_ _._ Notwithstanding any other provision of this  _Section
6_, any indemnification with respect to Taxes shall be governed exclusively by
_Section 7_ below; _provided, however,_ that the limitations set forth in
_Section 6.4_ of this Agreement shall also apply for purposes of _Section
7_.

Section 7\. _Tax Matters_

 

7.1 _Tax Indemnification_.

 

(a) Each Blocker Owner shall individually and with respect to the Blocker
Entity sold by it hereunder only (and not jointly and severally
and notwithstanding any implication herein to the contrary not with respect
to the Blocker Entity sold by the other Blocker Owner hereunder) indemnify the
Blocker Entities, Parent, and each affiliate of Parent and hold them harmless
from and against (i) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the Blocker
Entity sold by such Blocker Owner hereunder for all taxable periods ending on

for any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date
("Pre-Closing Tax Period"), excluding Taxes due as a result of actions taken
by Parent after the Closing, (ii) any and all Taxes of any member of an
affiliated, consolidated, combined, or unitary group of which such Blocker

prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation §1.1502-6
or any analogous or similar state, local, or non-U.S. law or regulation, and
(iii) any and all Taxes of any person (other than the Blocker Entities)
imposed on a Blocker Entity as a transferee or successor, by contract or
pursuant to any law, rule or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or
transaction occurring before the Closing.

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
the Blocker Owners obligation to indemnify Parent or Indemnified Persons for
any Tax shall be limited to any Tax properly attributable to taxable periods
or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date, excluding any Taxes
due as a result of actions taken by Parent after the Closing.

7.2 _Straddle Period_. In the case of any taxable period that includes (but
does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), all Taxes and Tax
liabilities with respect to the income, property or operations of Blocker
Entities, that relate to the Straddle Periods shall be apportioned to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period as follows: (A) in the case of Taxes other than income,
sales and use and withholding Taxes, on a per-diem basis, and (B) in the case
of income, sales and use and withholding Taxes, as determined from the books
and records of the Blocker Entities as though the taxable year of the Blocker
Entities or any relevant Subsidiary or partnership terminated at the close of
business on the Closing Date; _provided_ that the parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that tax deduction related Third Party Expenses shall be reported
on the Blocker Entities income Tax Return for its taxable year that ends on
the Closing Date and shall be apportioned to the Pre-Closing Period of the
Company, unless otherwise required by Law

agree that (a) the US federal income tax year of the Blocker Entities will
end at the end of the Closing Date, and (b) the Blocker Entities shall become

Blocker Entities.

7.3 _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_.

consistent with the Blocker Entities past practices. Parent shall cooperate
with the Blocker Owners in filing such Pre-Closing Tax Returns, including
causing the Blocker Entities to sign such returns. At least twenty (20) days

or consent to any settlement or payment involving a Tax Matter with respect to
any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to the Blocker Entities with
respect to any Pre-Closing Period or with respect to any Straddle Period, if
such amendment, refiling or other modification or consent to any settlement or
payment may increase the amount payable by any Blocker Owner in respect of
Taxes of the Blocker Entities or otherwise cause a material adverse Tax
consequence to any or all of the Blocker Owners, without the written consent
of the Blocker Owners.

 



10 7.4 _Refunds and Tax Benefits_. The Blocker Owners will be entitled to any
credits and refunds (including any interest in respect thereof) with respect
to any Pre-Closing Period received by Parent or the Blocker Entities, and any
amounts of overpayments of Tax credited against Tax that Parent or the Blocker
Entities otherwise would be or would have been required to pay, and Parent
shall pay over to the Blocker Owners any such amounts within fifteen (15) days

with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this _Section 7_ and any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any

the Blocker Entities relating to any taxable period beginning before the

extent notified by Parent or the Blocker Owners, any extensions thereof) of
the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (B) to give the other
party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so requests, the
Blocker Entities or Parent, as the case may be, shall allow the other party
to take possession of such books and records.

(b) Parent and the Blocker Owners further agree, upon request, to use
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any governmental authority or any other Person as may be
reasonably necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be
imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby).

(c) Parent and Blocker Owners further agree, upon request, to provide
the other party with all information that either party may be required to
report pursuant to Code §6043, or Code §6043A, or Treasury Regulations
