RECITALS

 

A. Seller, together with its Subsidiaries, is a global orthopaedic medical
device company specializing in the design, manufacture and marketing of
devices and biologic products for extremity, hip and knee repair and
reconstruction. As further described in Sellers Annual Report on Form 10-K
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 22, 2013,
as supplemented by its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed on May 5, 2013,
Seller operates its business under two reportable segments, described as its
OrthoRecon and Extremities segments.

 

B. Seller will be retaining its business operations operating under the
Extremities operating segment, which engages in the research, development,
design, manufacture, assembly, testing, marketing, qualification,
distribution, fulfillment, sale, licensing, delivery, provision,
configuration, service, obtaining intellectual property protection for, and
other commercialization of products that are used primarily in foot and ankle
repair, upper extremity products, including repairing bones after traumatic
injury, and biologics products, which are used to replace damaged or diseased
bone, including in extremity-related procedures as well as in trauma induced
voids, to stimulate bone growth and to provide other biological solutions for
surgeons and their patients and includes the operations acquired in the
completion of the acquisition of BioMimetic Therapeutics, Inc. on March 1,
2013 (such operations, as currently conducted, the " _Retained Business_ ").

C. Purchaser and/or one or more of Parents Subsidiaries desire to purchase
and assume from Seller, and Seller desires to sell and assign to Purchaser and

collectively, the " _Asset Transferring Companies_ ," and together with
Seller, the " _Transferring Companies_ ").

 

I. At the Closing, Seller shall cause each of the Asset Transferring Companies
to transfer the assets and liabilities relating to the Business to Purchaser
or one or more Subsidiaries designated by Purchaser, and Purchaser shall, or
shall cause such Subsidiaries to, acquire certain assets and assume certain
liabilities relating to the Business, pursuant to the applicable
Asset Transfer Agreements.

condition and material inducement to the willingness of Seller to enter into
this Agreement, Purchaser is delivering executed commitment letters attached
hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Commitment Letters_ ") evidencing a loan of Two
Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000) from Otsuka Medical Devices Co., Ltd.

Affiliates to, as applicable, enter into a transition services agreement on
substantially the terms set forth as  _Exhibit D_ (the " _Transition
Services Agreement_ ").

Representatives, including, upon reasonable advance notice, access during
normal business hours to relevant personnel and records of Purchaser. The
Post-Closing Statement shall become final and binding on the twentieth (20th)
Business Day following delivery thereof, unless prior to the end of such

Post-Closing Statement not specifically referenced in the Notice of
Disagreement, and such items and amounts shall not be subject to review under
_subsection (c)_ below.

 

(c) During the twenty (20) Business Day period following delivery of a Notice
of Disagreement by Seller to Purchaser, the Parties shall seek in good faith
to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the matters

Accounting Firm shall be authorized to resolve only those items remaining in
dispute between the Parties in accordance with the provisions of this Section
within the range of the difference between Purchasers position with respect
thereto and Sellers position with respect thereto. The determination of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be accompanied by a certificate of the
Independent Accounting Firm that it reached such determination in accordance
with the provisions of this Section. Seller and Purchaser shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accounting Firm to
render a written decision resolving the matters submitted to it within twenty
(20) Business Days following the submission thereof. Judgment may be entered
upon the written determination of the Independent Accounting Firm in any
competent court. Subject to the following sentence, the costs of any dispute
resolution pursuant to this subsection, including the fees and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm and of any enforcement of the determination
thereof, shall be borne by Purchaser and Seller in inverse proportion as they
may prevail on the matters resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, which
proportionate allocation shall be calculated on an aggregate basis based on
the relative Dollar values of the amounts in dispute and shall be determined
by the Independent Accounting Firm at the time the determination of such firm
is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the fees and disbursements of the Representatives of each Party
incurred in connection with their preparation or review of the Post-Closing
Statement and preparation or review of any Notice of Disagreement, as
applicable, shall be borne by such Party.

 



11 (e) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by the amount (if any) by
which Net Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant to this Section, is
less than Estimated Net Working Capital (the " _Downward Adjustment Amount_
"). The Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward by the amount (if any) by
which Net Working Capital is greater than Estimated Net Working Capital, as
finally determined pursuant to this Section (the " _Upward Adjustment Amount_
"). In the event of a Downward Adjustment Amount, Seller shall, within five
(5) Business Days after the Post-Closing Statement becomes final and binding
in accordance with this Section, make payment to Purchaser to an account or
accounts designated by Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, of an amount equal to the Downward Adjustment Amount. In the event of
an Upward Adjustment Amount, Purchaser shall, within five (5) Business Days
after the Post-Closing Statement becomes final and binding in accordance with
this Section, make payment to Seller to an account or accounts designated by
Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, of an amount equal to
the Upward Adjustment Amount. Notwithstanding anything contained in this

or Downward Adjustment Amount, as applicable, is greater than or equal to Six
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($600,000).

Days after the Post-Closing Statement becomes final and binding in accordance
with this Section, make payment to Seller to an account or
accounts designated by Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, of an amount equal to the Estimated Assumed Extremities Accounts
Payable minus the Assumed Extremities Accounts Payable as of the Closing, as
finally determined pursuant to this Section. In the event the Assumed
Extremities Accounts Payable as of the Closing, as finally determined pursuant
to this Section, is greater than the Estimated Assumed Extremities Accounts
Payable, Seller shall, within five (5) Business Days after the Post-Closing
Statement becomes final and binding in accordance with this Section, make
payment to Purchaser to an account or accounts designated by Purchaser, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, of an amount equal to
the Assumed Extremities Accounts Payable as of the Closing, as finally
determined pursuant to this Section minus the Estimated Assumed Extremities
Accounts Payable.

Section 1.7 _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

(a) The sum of the Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities shall be
allocated among the Purchased Assets, including the Equity Interests (the "
_Allocation_ "). The Allocation (including any revision thereof) will be
consistent with the principles of Section 1060 and the related Treasury
Regulations or any similar provisions under foreign Laws, as applicable.
Within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof, Purchaser shall
provide Seller with a proposed Allocation for Sellers review and comment,
which proposed Allocation shall also set forth in a reasonable manner the
principles used in establishing such Allocation. If Seller does not provide
any comments to Purchaser in writing within fifteen (15) Business Days
following

 



12  delivery by Purchaser of the proposed Allocation, then the Allocation
proposed by Purchaser shall be deemed to be final and binding, subject to (i)
subsequent adjustments to the sum of the Purchase Price and Assumed
Liabilities, and (ii) the identification of additional Purchased Assets or
Excluded Assets pursuant to _Section 5.5_, as discussed below. If, however,
Seller submits comments to Purchaser within such fifteen (15) Business Day
period, Seller and Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any
differences within fifteen (15) Business Days thereafter. If Seller and
Purchaser are unable to reach a resolution within such fifteen (15) Business
Day period, then Seller and Purchaser shall either (i) agree to disagree with
respect to the Allocation, or (ii) submit all disputed items for resolution by
an internationally recognized, independent accounting firm mutually selected
by Purchaser and Seller (the " _Allocation Accounting Firm_ "), which shall
make a final determination as to the disputed items within fifteen (15)
Business Days after such submission, and such determination shall be final,
binding and conclusive on Seller and Purchaser; it being understood that the
Allocation Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator to
determine, based solely on the written submissions of Seller, on the one hand,
and Purchaser on the other hand, the appropriate Allocation of the disputed
items in a manner consistent with the principles of Section 1060 and the
related Treasury Regulations or any similar provisions under foreign Laws, as
applicable. The fees and disbursements of the Allocation Accounting Firm
shall be shared equally between Seller and Purchaser. Any subsequent
adjustments to the sum of the Purchase Price and Assumed Liabilities shall be
reflected in the Allocation in accordance with the principles set forth on,
and in a manner consistent with, the Allocation as previously agreed between
the Parties or determined by the Allocation Accounting Firm to the extent such
an agreement was reached or such a determination was made. If additional
Purchased Assets or Excluded Assets are properly identified after Closing
pursuant to _Section 5.5_, the Purchase Price shall be re-allocated among the
Purchased Assets in accordance with the principles set forth on, and in
a manner consistent with, the Allocation as previously agreed between the
Parties or determined by the Allocation Accounting Firm to the extent such an
agreement was reached or such a determination was made. For all Tax purposes,
Purchaser and Seller agree that all transactions contemplated in this
Agreement shall be reported in a manner consistent with the terms of this
Agreement, including the Allocation, if any, and that none of them will take
any position inconsistent therewith in any Tax Return, in any refund claim,
in any litigation, or otherwise, except as required by a final determination.
To the extent the Parties have agreed to an Allocation, or such an Allocation
was determined by the Allocation Accounting Firm, each of Seller and
Purchaser agrees to cooperate with the other in preparing IRS Form 8594 and
any similar form under any Applicable Law, and to furnish the other with a
copy of such Form prepared in draft form within a reasonable period before
its filing due date.

(b) _Transfer Taxes_. Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other
hand, shall each be liable for, and shall pay one-half (1/2) of any Transfer
Taxes. Purchaser and Seller each shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
consult and cooperate with each other with respect to the filing of any Tax
Return or other document required to be filed with respect to, and to
minimize, such Transfer Taxes. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall pay
one hundred percent (100%) of any and all Tax imposed by Section 4191 of the
Code or any related provision of Law as a result of or in connection with the
Transactions.

 



13 (c) _Withholding_. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement
to any Person such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under any provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax
Law or under any applicable legal requirement. Any amounts so deducted shall
be remitted by Purchaser to the appropriate Taxing Authority on a timely
basis. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and remitted to
the appropriate Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid.

Section 1.8 _Shared Contracts_.

(a) Each Shared Contract that, pursuant to its terms, permits the assignment
to Purchaser of only those rights of Seller or its Subsidiary under such
Shared Contract related to the OrthoRecon Products or the Business without the
consent of the counterparty thereto or other conditions, including conditions
requiring the payment of any transfer or other fee (the " _Assignable Shared
Contracts_ "), shall be deemed to be an Assumed Contract hereunder and Seller
shall cause to be assigned to Purchaser, as of the Closing, Sellers or its
Subsidiaries respective rights under such Assignable Shared Contract, to the
extent related to the OrthoRecon Products or the Business, in accordance with
its terms. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts prior to the
Closing to cause the counterparty to each Shared Contract that is not an
Assignable Shared Contract (the " _Non-Assignable Shared Contracts_ ") to
consent to the assignment to Purchaser of such Non-Assignable Shared Contract
or partial assignment of those rights of Seller or its Subsidiary under such
Non-Assignable Shared Contract related to the OrthoRecon Products or the
Business, or to otherwise reasonably cooperate with Purchaser in Purchasers
efforts to enter into a new Contract with such counterparty on substantially
the same terms as exist under such Non-Assignable Shared Contract, in each
case as of the Closing. The portion related to the OrthoRecon Products or the
Business of each such Non-Assignable Shared Contract for which the Parties
have received consent to the entire or partial assignment shall thereafter be
deemed to be an Assumed Contract hereunder and, if applicable, Seller shall
wholly assign, or partially assign, such portion to Purchaser as of the
Closing such Non-Assignable Shared Contract in accordance with its terms.
Purchaser and Seller understand and agree that with respect to any Shared
Contract, Seller may require transition services from Purchaser to provide
it with the rights and benefits of such Shared Contract to the extent such
contract relates to the Retained Business, and Purchaser agrees to provide
such services to Seller in the manner set forth in (and subject to the terms
and conditions of) the Transition Services Agreement.

(b) Any Shared Contract that is a Non-Assignable Shared Contract for which the
arrangements described in _Section 1.8(a)_ could not be entered into prior

Section 1.9 _Non-Transferable Assets_.

(a) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Purchased Asset is not assignable
or transferable (each, a " _Non-Transferable Asset_ ") without a Consent, and
any such Consent is not

 



14  obtained on or prior to the Closing Date, this Agreement and the related
instruments of transfer shall not constitute an assignment or transfer of such
Non-Transferable Asset, and Purchaser or Parents designee(s) shall not
assume Sellers rights or obligations under such Non-Transferable Asset (and
such Non-Transferable Asset shall not be included in the Purchased Assets),
and instead Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) if
applicable and requested by Purchaser, negotiate and enter into a mutually
agreed upon transition services agreement with Purchaser or Parents designees
with respect to such Non-Transferable Asset, including access to and the use
and benefit of such Non-Transferable Asset, and (ii) obtain any such Consent
as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date and thereafter Seller
shall transfer and assign to Purchaser such Non-Transferable Assets for
no additional consideration. Following any such assignment or transfer, such
Non-Transferable Assets shall be deemed Purchased Assets for purposes of this
Agreement.

(b) After the Closing, Seller shall, at Purchasers expense, use commercially
reasonable efforts (including negotiating and entering into a mutually agreed
upon transition services agreement with Purchaser or Parents designees,
which, notwithstanding anything in this paragraph to the contrary, such
services shall be provided at the cost to the service provider to provide such
service, and making any necessary payments to third parties or otherwise
incurring expenses or costs) to provide Purchaser or Parents designee(s) with
all of the rights and benefits of any Non-Transferable Assets after the
Closing as if the appropriate Consent had been obtained, including by
granting subleases, sublicenses, subcontractor arrangements or other rights
and establishing arrangements whereby Purchaser shall have the benefits of and
shall undertake the obligation to perform under the Assumed Contracts
(including enforcement for the benefit of Purchaser of any and all rights of
Seller against any other party arising out of any breach or cancellation of
any such Non-Transferable Assets by such other party and, if requested by
Purchaser, acting as an agent on behalf of Purchaser or as Purchaser shall
otherwise reasonably require). In any such arrangement with respect to an
Assumed Contract, Purchaser shall (i) pay, perform or discharge when due any
Liabilities arising thereunder after the Closing but not transferred
to Purchaser, and shall be solely responsible for completion of the work or
provision of goods and services, (ii) bear the economic costs of all Taxes
with respect thereto or arising therefrom and (iii) be solely entitled to all
benefits thereof, economic or otherwise. If and when such Consents or
approvals are obtained or such other required actions have been taken, the
assignment of such Non-Transferable Asset will be effected in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement. Seller shall advise Purchaser in writing at
least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing with respect to any Assumed
Contract that Seller knows or has substantial reason to believe will or may
not be assignable or transferable to Purchaser hereunder at the Closing.

department, organization, agency or other Governmental Entity in a country
that is material to the Business, to be invalid. Neither Seller nor any of its
Subsidiaries has committed fraud or engaged in misconduct before the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office or any corresponding office, department,
organization, agency or other Governmental Entity in a country that is
material to the Business with respect to any Patents covering or claiming any

on _Section 2.17(a)(iv)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. In the five (5)
years prior to the Closing Date, neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received any notice or claim challenging Sellers or any of its
Subsidiaries sole and exclusive ownership of any Owned Business
Intellectual Property or Owned Shared Intellectual Property or suggesting
that any other Person has any claim of legal or beneficial ownership with
respect thereto or that any such Owned Business Intellectual Property or Owned
Shared Intellectual Property is invalid, unenforceable or has been misused,
and no Owned Business Intellectual Property or Owned Shared Intellectual
Property has been challenged or threatened in any way.

(b) _Trademarks_.

(i) All Trademarks included in the Owned Business Intellectual Property and
Owned Shared Intellectual Property are current and in good standing (i.e.,
there has been payment of all registration, renewal and other fees and the
timely post-registration filing of affidavits of use and renewal applications
and timely filing of affidavits as required to cause such Trademarks to become
incontestable) other than any requirement that, if not satisfied, would not
result in a cancellation of any such registration or otherwise affect the
use, priority or enforceability of the Trademark in question, the defenses
potentially available to any accused infringer thereof, or the remedies
potentially available for infringement thereof.

 

(ii) In the five (5) years prior to the Closing Date, no Trademark included in
the Registered Business Intellectual Property or Registered Shared
Intellectual Property has been involved in any opposition or cancellation
proceeding in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or any corresponding

country that is material to the Business, and no such proceeding has been
threatened.

 



35 (iii) All Trademarks included in the Registered Business
Intellectual Property and Registered Shared Intellectual Property (other than

and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries in all locations or jurisdictions where

(iv) _Section 2.17(b)(iv)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
complete and correct list of the common law or unregistered Trademarks of
Seller and each of its Subsidiaries that are included in the Business
Intellectual Property or Shared Intellectual Property, in each case, that are
material to the Business.

 

(c) _Patents_. All Patents included in the Owned Business Intellectual
Property and Owned Shared Intellectual Property are current and in good
standing (i.e., there has been payment of correct filing, examination, and
maintenance fees). No Patent included in the Owned Business Intellectual
Property or Owned Shared Intellectual Property has been or is now involved in
any interference, reissue, reexamination or opposition proceeding in the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office or any corresponding office, department,
organization, agency or other Governmental Entity elsewhere, and no such
action has been threatened. To Sellers Knowledge, no Patent included in the
Owned Business Intellectual Property or Owned Shared Intellectual Property is
subject to any compulsory license.

(d) _Copyrights_. With respect to Copyrights in Software included in Owned
Business Intellectual Property (including Prophecy Intellectual Property that
is Owned Shared Intellectual Property), neither Seller nor any of its
Subsidiaries has taken any action or failed to take any action (including a
failure to disclose required information to the U.S. Copyright Office, or any
corresponding office, department, organization, agency or other Governmental
Entity elsewhere), or used or enforced (or failed to use or enforce) such
Copyrights in a manner that would result in (or reasonably be expected to
result in) the invalidity or unenforceability of any such Copyrights, or that
would result in (or reasonably be expected to result in) any such Copyrights
passing into the public domain. Purchaser acknowledges that Seller and its
Subsidiaries have not registered any such Copyrights.

 

(e) _Trade Secrets_. Seller and its Subsidiaries have taken appropriate steps
in accordance with generally-accepted industry standards and Applicable Law,
in any event no less than reasonable steps, to prevent disclosures to third
parties who are not bound by a valid and enforceable confidentiality agreement
or a fiduciary or similar obligation, and to protect their rights in, and to
safeguard and maintain the secrecy and confidentiality of, the Trade Secrets
included in the Business Intellectual Property or Shared Intellectual
Property, in each case, that are material to the Business. There has been
no misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of any Trade Secret included
in the Business Intellectual Property or Shared Intellectual Property (or
claimed or understood to be so included), or breach of any obligations of
confidentiality with respect to Seller or its Subsidiaries or the Business
Intellectual Property or Shared Intellectual Property, in each case, that is
material to the Business.

its Subsidiaries of proprietary (i.e., not open source) Software that is
commercially available on reasonable terms to any Person for a license fee,
royalty or other consideration of no more than One Hundred Thousand Dollars
($100,000) per copy or user.

is no outstanding or threatened dispute or disagreement with respect to any
Transferred License Agreement. Complete and correct copies of all Transferred
License Agreements have been made available to Purchaser. Neither Seller nor
any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of Seller, any other party to
any Transferred License Agreement is in material breach or default of such
Transferred License Agreement.

 

(iv) There is no Assumed Contract, judicial decree, arbitral award or other
provision or requirement that obligates Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to
grant licenses in the future with respect to any currently existing or future
Owned Business Intellectual Property or Transferred Shared Intellectual
Property.

 

(v) Neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the
Transaction Documents and such other agreements, documents and instruments to
be executed and delivered after the date hereof, nor the consummation of this
transaction will violate or result in the breach, material modification,
cancellation, termination or suspension of, or acceleration of any payments
under any Transferred License Agreement (or give rise to any right with
respect to any of the foregoing). Following the Closing Date and upon
obtaining any consents required to assign the Transferred License
Agreements to Purchaser, Purchaser will have and be permitted to exercise all
rights under the Transferred License Agreements (and will have the same rights
with respect to the Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights of
third parties licensed thereunder) to the same extent that Seller or the
applicable Subsidiary would have had, and been able to exercise, had this
Agreement, the Transaction Documents and such other agreements, documents and
instruments to be executed and delivered after the date hereof not been
entered into and this transaction not occurred, without the payment of any
additional amounts or consideration other than ongoing fees, royalties or
payments that Seller or its Subsidiaries would otherwise have been
required to pay anyway. Except as provided in the Assumed Contracts, neither
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Transaction
Documents and such other agreements, documents and instruments to be executed
and delivered after the date hereof, nor the consummation of this transaction
will cause or require (or purports to cause or require) Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates to (A) grant to any other Person any license, covenant not to
sue, immunity or other right with respect to or under any of Purchasers or
its Affiliates Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Rights, or (B)
be obligated to pay any royalties or other amounts, or offer any discounts, to
any other Person.

 



37 (vi) Seller or its Subsidiaries solely and exclusively own all right,
title and interest in and to (including the sole right to enforce) the Owned
Business Intellectual Property and Owned Shared Intellectual Property, free
and clear of all Encumbrances, except Permitted Encumbrances, and have not
licensed any such Owned Business Intellectual Property or Owned Shared
Intellectual Property, or any other Business Intellectual Property or Shared
Intellectual Property, to any Person, except pursuant to an Outbound License
Agreement listed in  _Section 2.17(f)(ii)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule. All of the Licensed Business Intellectual Property and all Shared
Intellectual Property that is not Owned Shared Intellectual Property is duly
and validly licensed to Seller or its Subsidiaries pursuant to an Inbound
License Agreement that is listed in _Section 2.17(f)(i)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule for use in the manner in which it is currently used and is
planned to be used by Seller and its Subsidiaries. All Owned Business
Intellectual Property and Transferred Shared Intellectual Property is freely
transferable and assignable (and, upon the Closing, shall be assigned and
transferred) to Purchaser without restriction and without payment of any
kind to any third party. Except for those Inbound License Agreements set
forth in _Section 2.5_ or _Section 2.17(f)(vi)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, all Transferred License Agreements are freely assignable and
transferable to Purchaser without restriction and without payment of any kind
to any third party.

(vii) The Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights included in
the Owned Business Intellectual Property and the Licensed Business
Intellectual Property that are to be assigned and transferred to Purchaser as
part of the Purchased Assets pursuant to this Agreement include all of the
Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights that are owned by or
licensed to Seller or any of its Affiliates and used, held for use, or
practiced by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries _exclusively_ in connection
with any OrthoRecon Products and/or the Business, and following the Closing,
Purchaser will own or have (pursuant to the Transferred License Agreements)
the same rights that Seller and its Subsidiaries had immediately prior to the
Closing with respect to such Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property
Rights. The Owned Business Intellectual Property, Transferred Shared
Intellectual Property, the Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property
Rights licensed under the Inbound License Agreements that are included in the
Assumed Contracts, the Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights
licensed to Purchaser under the Shared IP Cross License, and the Intellectual
Property to which access is provided under the Transition Services Agreement
include all of the Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights that
are owned by or licensed to Seller or any of its Affiliates and used, held for
use, or practiced by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with any
OrthoRecon Products and/or the Business.

(g) _OrthoRecon Products_. _Section 2.17(g)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule sets forth the aggregate royalties as a percentage of net sales of
each OrthoRecon Product paid by Seller and its Subsidiaries to third parties
pursuant to all Assumed Contracts on sales of such OrthoRecon Product. 

(h) _No Infringement by Seller_. To Sellers Knowledge, the Business as
currently conducted, including the design, development, use, provision,
import, branding,

 



38  advertising, promotion, marketing, manufacture and sale of any OrthoRecon
Products does not infringe, misappropriate, dilute, use or disclose without
authorization, or otherwise violate any Intellectual Property Rights of any
third party. In the five (5) years prior to the Closing Date, either Seller
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice or claim from any
Governmental Authority or any third party that the Business as currently
conducted constitutes unfair competition or unfair trade practice under the
Laws of the United States and any other country that is material to the
Business. No Action has been initiated or is pending, and no notice of
any Action has been received by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, alleging
that Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, or any OrthoRecon Product has
infringed, misappropriated, diluted, used or disclosed without authorization,
or otherwise violated the Intellectual Property Rights of any third party.
Without limiting the foregoing, neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any correspondence asking or inviting Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into a Patent license or similar agreement, to pay for
or obtain a release for Patent infringement, or otherwise to enter into other
arrangements with respect to the Patents of any other Person relating to the
Business.

 

(i) _No Orders_. No Business Intellectual Property or Shared Intellectual
Property that is material to the Business is subject to any outstanding
Order, judgment, injunction, decree, stipulation or agreement restricting the
use or other practice or exploitation thereof by Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries or, in the case of Owned Business Intellectual Property or Owned
Shared Intellectual Property, restricting the sale, transfer, assignment or
licensing thereof by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(j) _No Infringement by Third Parties_. Except as disclosed in _Section
2.17(j)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, in the five (5) years prior to
the Closing Date, neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has instituted,
asserted or threatened any Action against any third party with respect to
infringement, misappropriation, dilution, use or disclosure
without authorization, or other violation of any Business Intellectual
Property or Shared Intellectual Property, nor has Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries issued any written communication inviting any third party to take
a license, authorization, covenant not to sue or the like with respect to any
Business Intellectual Property or Shared Intellectual Property (other than in
connection with licenses granted by Seller or its Subsidiaries in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice and not related to any
infringement or other violation by the licensee or potential licensee).

(k) _Software_. The Software that is included in the Owned Business
Intellectual Property and Owned Shared Intellectual Property (" _Seller
Software_ ") was (i) developed solely by employees of Seller and its
Subsidiaries acting within the scope of their employment who assigned any
Intellectual Property Rights that they may have in or to such Seller Software
to Seller or the applicable Subsidiary pursuant to valid and enforceable
written agreements, or (ii) developed by independent contractors who assigned
any Intellectual Property Rights that they may have in or to such Software to
Seller or the applicable Subsidiary pursuant to valid and enforceable written
agreements. _Section 2.17(k)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule lists all of
the Seller Software that is material to the Business.

(l) _Open Source and Related Matters_.  _Section 2.17(l)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and accurate list of all Open Source
Technology that is

 



39  incorporated into, integrated or bundled with, linked with, or otherwise
used in any OrthoRecon Product, and a description of (i) the license terms
(and version) under which such Open Source Technology is licensed, and (ii)
the manner in which each such OrthoRecon Product incorporates, is integrated
or bundled with or links to such Open Source Technology or in which any such
OrthoRecon Product otherwise uses such Open Source Technology. Seller and its
Subsidiaries have taken sufficient steps, including by implementing and
enforcing appropriate policies in accordance with industry standards, to (A)
identify Open Source Technology used by Seller or its Subsidiaries or
otherwise included in the OrthoRecon Products, and (B) regulate the use,
modification, and distribution of Open Source Technology in connection with
the OrthoRecon Products, in compliance with the applicable licenses. No Seller
Software is or has become subject to any Open Source Technology license.

(m) _Contaminants_. Any Seller Software included in or otherwise necessary to
the design or manufacture of any OrthoRecon Product is substantially free of
any material defects, bugs and errors in accordance with generally accepted
industry standards, and does not contain or make available any
disabling codes or instructions, spyware, Trojan horses, worms, trap doors,
backdoors, Easter eggs, logic bombs, time bombs, cancelbots, viruses and other
software or programming routines that permit or cause (or are suspected or
known to permit or cause) unauthorized access to, or disruption,
modification, recordation, misuse, transmission, impairment, disablement, or
destruction of, Software, data, Systems or other materials, or that consume
resources or alter the operation of any Systems (" _Contaminants_ ") that
would materially affect the Business.

(n) _Systems_. The computer, information technology and data processing
systems, facilities and services used by or for Seller and its Subsidiaries in
connection with the Business and primarily used in, held for use primarily in,
or necessary to conduct the Business as currently conducted, including all
Software, hardware, networks, communications facilities, platforms and related
systems and services (collectively, " _Systems_ "), are reasonably sufficient
for the existing needs of Seller and its Subsidiaries.

and market value, on a first-in, first-out basis, in accordance with GAAP
applied on a basis consistent with past practice. All of the Inventory

in any material respect prior to the EGM. Purchaser shall cause the Circular,
as so corrected, to be filed with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and to be
disseminated to its shareholders, in each case, as and to the extent required

Section 4.12 _Otsuka Loan_. Each of Parent and Purchaser shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an executed loan agreement from

reasonable efforts of Purchaser be deemed or construed to require, Purchaser
to seek any financing (i) in any amount in excess of that contemplated by the
Commitment Letters, or (ii) on terms less favorable than those provided in
the Commitment Letters. For the avoidance of doubt, the Closing is not
conditioned upon Purchasers ability to obtain financing.

Section 4.13 _Financing_.

(a) Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to arrange and
obtain the proceeds of the Financing on the terms and conditions described in
the Commitment Letters, including to (i) maintain in effect the Financing and
the Commitments Letters, (ii) enter into definitive financing agreements with
respect to the Financing on the terms and conditions specified in the
Commitment Letters, so that such agreements are in effect as promptly as
practicable but in any event no later than the Closing and (iii) consummate
the Financing at or prior to the Closing. Without limiting the generality of

breach or default by any party to any Commitment Letter or definitive
document related to the Financing of which Purchaser becomes aware; (B) of the
receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any
Financing source with respect to any: (x) material breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to any Commitment Letter or any
definitive document related to the Financing of any provisions of the
Commitment Letters or any definitive document related to the Financing or (y)
material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any
Commitment Letters or any definitive documents related to the Financing; and
(C) if for any reason Purchaser believes in good faith

 



65  that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on
the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Commitment
Letters or the definitive documents relating to the Financing. As soon as
reasonably practicable, but in any event within five (5) days of the date
Seller delivers Purchaser a written request, Purchaser shall provide any
information reasonably requested by Seller relating to any circumstances
referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) of the immediately preceding sentence.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Closing is not conditioned upon Purchasers
ability to obtain financing.

 

(b) Seller shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the officers, employees,
representatives and advisors of Seller and each of its Subsidiaries to,
provide to Purchaser and Otsuka such cooperation, at Purchasers sole cost and
expense, reasonably requested in writing by Purchaser to assist Purchaser
in obtaining the Otsuka Loan, including delivering to Purchaser and Otsuka
monthly the financial information required pursuant to _Section 4.9_ (
_Monthly Financial Statements_ ), assisting in the preparation of presentation
or other materials requested by Otsuka, having its senior officers attend and
participate in calls or meetings as requested by Purchaser or Otsuka to
discuss the Otsuka Loan, and executing and delivering any certifications,
legal opinions or other documents related to the Business and the Purchased
Assets. For the avoidance of doubt, unless such breach is caused by Sellers
willful misconduct or gross negligence, a breach of this _Section 4.13(b)_
shall in no event permit Purchaser to assert any rights or remedies under
_Section 6.1(a)(i)_ or _Section 9.1_ ( _Termination_ ), which, for purposes
of clarity, means that Sellers failure to comply with this covenant would not
result in a failure of Seller to satisfy any closing condition or permit
Purchaser to terminate this Agreement. For purposes of further clarity,
regarding the immediately preceding sentence, in the event of Sellers willful
misconduct or gross negligence, Purchaser shall be entitled to all available
rights and remedies under this Agreement or at law or in equity.

Section 4.14 _Treatment of Unallocated Shared Intellectual Property_. During
the period commencing on the date hereof and continuing until the earlier of:
(a) the termination of this Agreement; and (b) the Closing, the Parties shall,
subject to the terms of this  _Section 4.14_ ( _Treatment of Unallocated
Shared Intellectual Property_ ), negotiate in good faith to determine by the
Closing the allocation of any and all Unallocated Shared Intellectual Property
existing as of the date of this Agreement or created, or acquired by Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries prior to Closing as either Intellectual Property
and Intellectual Property Rights (i) to be retained by Seller or its
Subsidiary (and as of the Closing to be deemed Retained Shared Intellectual
Property), or (ii) to be transferred to Purchaser or one of its Subsidiaries
(and as of Closing to be deemed Transferred Shared Intellectual Property).
Seller and Purchaser agree that the foregoing allocation shall be governed by
the principle of relative materiality to the Business and the Retained
Business such that if the reasonably anticipated financial benefit to the
Business of any item of Unallocated Shared Intellectual Property exceeds its
reasonably anticipated financial benefit to the Retained Business, such item
of Unallocated Shared Intellectual Property shall be deemed Transferred Shared
Intellectual Property, and correspondingly, if the reasonably anticipated
financial benefit to the Retained Business of any item of Unallocated Shared
Intellectual Property exceeds its reasonably anticipated financial benefit to
the Business, such item of Unallocated Shared Intellectual Property shall be
deemed Retained Shared Intellectual Property.

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

Section 5.1 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) The Parties understand and agree that this Agreement and any information
exchanged in connection with this Agreement or the negotiation of the
Transactions is subject to the terms and conditions of that certain Mutual
Confidentiality Agreement entered into between Purchaser, Wright Medical
Technology, Inc. and Seller, dated April 26, 2013 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "). In the event that either Party (the " _Receiving Party_ ")
receives a request to disclose all or any part of any confidential information
under the terms of a subpoena, Order, civil investigative demand or similar
process issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by another Governmental
Entity or the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the Receiving Party agrees to (i)
immediately notify the other Party (the " _Disclosing Party_ ") of the
existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such request; (ii) consult with
the Disclosing Party on the advisability of taking legally available steps to
resist or narrow such request; and (iii) if disclosure of such information is
required, furnish only that portion of the confidential information that, in
the advice of counsel to Receiving Party, such Receiving Party is legally
required to disclose and advise the Disclosing Party as far in advance of
such disclosure as reasonably possible so that the Disclosing Party may seek
an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded such confidential information. In any event, the
Disclosing Party shall not oppose actions by the Receiving Party to obtain an
appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded such confidential information. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, each Party and its Representatives will be
permitted to disclose confidential information or any portion thereof, without
notice to the other Party, upon the routine request of any Governmental Entity
having authority to regulate or oversee any aspect of such Party or its
Representatives business or that of such Partys Affiliates, _provided_ that
each Party or its Representatives shall advise the Governmental Entity of the
confidential nature of such information.

 

(b) From and for a period of two (2) years after the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) treat and hold as confidential
any proprietary information provided or exchanged in connection with this
Agreement or the negotiation of the Transactions relating to the Retained
Business and any other business or activities of Seller or any of its
Affiliates (the " _Extremities Confidential Information_ "), and (ii) refrain
from using and disclosing the Extremities Confidential Information except to
the extent in connection with its obligations under this Agreement or to the
extent reasonably necessary to operate its business (which disclosures shall
be subject to reasonably appropriate restrictions on further use and
disclosure). From and for a period of two (2) years after the Closing
Date, Seller shall, and shall its Affiliates to, (i) treat and hold as
confidential any proprietary information provided or exchanged in connection
with this Agreement or the negotiation of the Transactions relating to the
Business and any other business or activities of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (the

 



67  " _OrthoRecon Confidential Information_ "), and (ii) refrain from using and
disclosing the OrthoRecon Confidential Information except to the extent in
connection with its obligations under this Agreement or to the extent
reasonably necessary to operate its business (which disclosures shall be
subject to reasonably appropriate restrictions on further use and disclosure).
Neither Extremities Confidential Information nor OrthoRecon Confidential
Information shall include information that (A) is or becomes generally
available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement
by a Party or any of its Affiliates, (B) is or becomes available to a Party
or any of its Affiliates on a non-confidential basis from a source other than
the other Party and its Affiliates; _provided_ that such source is not bound
by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary
obligation of, confidentiality to the other Party or any of its Affiliates, or
(C) is independently developed by a Party or any of its Affiliates without use
of any Extremities Confidential Information or OrthoRecon
Confidential Information, as applicable, or violation of any obligation
hereunder, as evidenced by such Partys or its Affiliates (as applicable)
contemporaneous written records.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party may disclose the terms and
conditions of any Transaction Document, or the confidential information
referred to in _subsections (b)_ above: (i) to the extent permitted with the
other Partys prior written consent; (ii) to the extent such disclosure is
reasonably determined by such Party to be required by Applicable Law,
regulation, legal process or stock exchange regulation (including any public
filing requirements under the rules and regulations of any U.S. or non-U.S.
securities exchange), in which case the disclosing Party shall give the
other Party to the extent practicable reasonable advance notice of any such
required disclosure and the reasonable opportunity to consult with such Party
in advance of the disclosure; (iii) to the extent reasonably necessary in
connection with the enforcement of its rights or satisfaction of its
obligations hereunder; or (iv) in confidence to legal counsel, accountants and
their advisors.

Section 5.2 _Public Announcements_. Neither Party nor any of its Affiliates or
Representatives shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public
statements with respect to Transactions without the prior written consent of
the other Party, except as such release or statement may be required by
Applicable Law, including the rules or regulations of any U.S. or non-U.S.
securities exchange, in which case such Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to allow the other Party reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance and will consider in good
faith the advice of the other Party with respect thereto.

 

Section 5.3 _Employees and Contractors_.

(a) Purchaser shall make an offer of employment to those Business Employees
set forth on _Schedule 5.3(a)_ , but shall not make an offer of employment to
any employee of Seller or its Subsidiaries not set forth on such _Schedule
5.3(a)_. Prior to the Closing, the Parties agree to use good faith efforts to
identify any Business Employees who were unintentionally omitted from
_Schedule 5.3(a)_ or identified as a non-Business Employee, and upon the
mutual agreement of the Parties, shall revise _Schedule 5.3(a)_ to account for
such unintentional omissions or misallocations. Employment will only be
offered to Business 

 



68  Employees who are actively at work. Business Employees who are not actively
at work will only be offered employment upon their return to work. With
respect to any employee of Seller or its Subsidiaries set forth on _Schedule
5.3(a)_ , Seller shall assist Purchaser with its efforts to enter into
compensation profiles and/or offers with such employee as soon as practicable
after the date hereof and in any event prior to the Closing Date, which
compensation profiles and/or offers shall become effective upon the Closing.
Seller shall pay any and all Liabilities arising in connection with the
termination, notice, severance and similar payments with respect to any
Business Employee arising out of the termination by Seller of such Business
Employees employment with Seller. The Parties expect that Business Employees
located in jurisdictions subject to EU Council Directive 2001/23/EC or other
similar Applicable Law (" _Transfer Laws_ ") shall transfer to Purchaser
either by operation of such Transfer Laws or through execution of any
necessary agreements with such Business Employees. The Parties shall work
together in good faith to determine which method shall apply in each such
jurisdiction.

(b) Employees of Seller and its Subsidiaries who accept compensation
profiles and/or offers of employment from Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries and who commence active employment with Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries (each, a " _Transferring Employee_ ") shall be entitled to the
terms described in their respective compensation profiles and/or offers,
which, during the period starting on the Closing Date and ending on the date
that is six (6) months following the Closing Date, shall (i) be for a position
that entails duties and responsibilities that are no less favorable in the
aggregate to those held by the Transferring Employees immediately prior to the
Closing Date (except for changes to such duties and responsibilities relating
to the fact that the Business is no longer a separate publicly traded
entity), (ii) include base salary and incentive opportunities (excluding
equity-based incentive opportunities) that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those provided by Seller to the Transferring Employee,
immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (iii) include employee benefits
that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided by Seller to
the Transferring Employee, immediately prior to the Closing Date,
including, with respect to any Transferring Employee that is a party to a pay
and separation agreement (such Business Employees with a pay and separation
agreement as set forth on _Section 5.3(b)_) benefits no less favorable in the
aggregate to the benefits provided in such pay and separation agreement. With
respect to each Transferring Employee, Purchaser shall credit or cause its
subsidiaries to credit, the period of employment and service recognized by
Seller and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date for the
purposes of vacation accrual, and eligibility and vesting (but not benefit
accrual) under all employee benefit plans, programs, policies or similar
arrangements of Purchaser and Parents Subsidiaries in which the Transferring
Employee is eligible to participate. Purchaser shall not terminate the
employment of any Transferring Employee other than for cause (as determined by
Purchaser in its reasonable discretion and in accordance with Applicable Law)
prior to the date that is six (6) months following the Closing Date. Purchaser
shall provide severance benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate
to those provided by Seller to the Transferring Employees immediately prior
to the Closing Date to any Transferring Employee who is terminated without
cause (as determined by Purchaser in its reasonable discretion and in
accordance with Applicable Law) prior to the one (1) year anniversary of the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no
Transferring Employee, and no other employee of Seller or its Subsidiaries,
shall be deemed to be a third party beneficiary of this Agreement.

 



69 (c) Seller shall cooperate and work with Purchaser to help Purchaser identify
independent contractors of Seller and its Subsidiaries to whom Purchaser may
elect to offer employment or an engagement following the Closing with
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries. With respect to any independent
contractor of Seller or its Subsidiaries designated by Purchaser, Seller
shall assist Purchaser with its efforts to enter into offers (if employment is
offered) or an independent contractor agreement (if an engagement is offered)
in a form deemed appropriate by Purchaser with such independent contractor as
soon as practicable after the date hereof and in any event prior to the
Closing Date, which employment offers or independent contractor agreement, as
the case may be, shall become effective upon the Closing. Notwithstanding any
of the foregoing, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall have any
obligation to make an offer of employment or an offer of engagement to any
independent contractor of Seller or its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, no independent contractor of Seller or its
Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a third party beneficiary of this
Agreement.

(d) The timing and content of any announcement or notification to the
Employees, independent contractors, sales representatives, consultants,
suppliers, Distributors, and Customers with respect to the Transactions
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include any press release or
other public statement (which are separately addressed in _Section 5.2_ (
_Public Announcements_ )) or any offers of employment or
independent contractor agreements or related communications to individual
employees or contractors of Seller and its Subsidiaries) shall be subject to
the approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, of each of Purchaser
and Seller. Except with respect to any announcement or notification covered
by the preceding sentence, Seller will consult with Purchaser (and will
consider in good faith the advice of Purchaser) prior to sending any notices
or other communication materials to employees or independent contractors of
Seller and its Subsidiaries.

(e) As soon as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, Seller
shall notify the Employees of Seller and its Subsidiaries that all claims for
expenses that qualify for coverage under the terms of the Employee Plans and
that are incurred on or prior to the Closing Date must be submitted within the
time limit provided by the Employee Plans and no later than five (5) Business
Days after the Closing Date.

(f) With respect to all Business Employees in the U.S. (and their respective
covered dependents) who are "MandA Qualified Beneficiaries" (as defined in
Section 54.4980B-9 QandA-4(a) of the Treasury Regulations), Seller shall provide
any notice required by Section 4980B(f)(6) of the Code and shall make
available to such individuals continuation coverage under a group health plan
maintained by Seller, as provided by Section 54.4980B-9 QandA-7 of the Treasury
Regulations. Sellers shall indemnify and hold Purchaser harmless for any
liability Purchaser incurs at any time under the provisions of Code section
4980B or ERISA sections 601 through 609 with respect to any individual who was
an employee of the Business prior to the Closing Date, or a dependent or
spouse of any such employee, and who had a "qualifying event" (within the
meaning of Code section 4980B) in connection with the Transaction at any time.

 

(g) Seller shall give all notices and other information required to be given
to the Employees and any applicable Governmental Entity under the WARN Act,
the Code and other Applicable Laws in connection with the Transactions with
respect to occurrences up to and

 



70  including the Closing Date. Purchaser shall give all notices and other
information required to be given to any Transferring Employees and any
applicable Governmental Entity under the WARN Act, the Code and other
Applicable Laws in connection with the Transactions with respect to
occurrences after the Closing Date.

 

Section 5.4 _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Cooperation in Tax Matters_. Seller and Purchaser shall provide each
other with such cooperation and information as either of them reasonably may
request of the other in (i) filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or
claim for refund, (ii) determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a
refund of Taxes, or (iii) participating in or conducting any audit or other
proceeding in respect of Taxes. Such cooperation and information shall
include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together
with accompanying schedules, related work papers and documents in their
possession relating to rulings or other determinations by Taxing
Authorities. Seller and Purchaser shall make themselves (and their respective
employees) available on a basis mutually convenient to both Parties to provide
explanations of any documents or information provided under this _Section
5.4_ ( _Tax Matters_ ).

(b) _Document Retention_. To the extent commercially reasonable, each of
Seller and Purchaser shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers,
records and other documents in its possession (or in the possession of its
Affiliates) relating to Tax matters relevant to the Purchased Assets or the
Business for each taxable period first ending after the Closing and for all
prior taxable periods until the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of
limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and other
documents relate, without regard to extensions except to the extent notified
by the other Party in writing of such extensions for the respective Tax
periods and (ii) six (6) years following the due date (without extension) for
such Tax Returns. After such time, before Seller or Purchaser shall dispose
of any such documents in its possession (or in the possession of its
Affiliates), the other Party shall be given the opportunity, after sixty (60)
Business Days prior written notice, to remove and retain all or any part of
such documents as such other Party may select (at such other Partys
expense). Any information obtained under this _Section 5.4_ ( _Tax Matters_ )
shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection
with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit
or other proceeding.

(c) _Notification of Tax Claims_. In the event any Taxing Authority informs
Seller or Purchaser of any notice of proposed audit, claim, assessment or
other dispute concerning an amount of Taxes with respect to which the other
Party may incur Liability hereunder, the Party so informed shall promptly
notify the other Party of such matter; _provided_ that, failure to promptly
notify shall not reduce the other Partys indemnity obligation hereunder,
except to the extent such Party is actually prejudiced thereby; and
_provided further_ , that resolution of such audit, claim, assessment or
other dispute shall be governed by _Section 8.3_ ( _Third Party Actions_ ).

(d) _Effect on Indemnity Rights of Purchaser_. Nothing in this Section shall
be deemed to limit or otherwise affect the rights of Purchaser under _Article
VIII_ ( _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants;
Indemnification_ ) hereof.

(e) _Allocation of Transferred Company Tax Liability_. The Equity Transfer
Agreement shall allocate the liability for Taxes of the Transferred Company in

(a) At any time or from time to time after the Closing, at Purchasers
request, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) execute and

assignment, provide such materials and information and take such
other actions as Purchaser may reasonably deem necessary in order to
effectively transfer, convey and assign to Purchaser, and to confirm
Purchasers title to, all of the Purchased Assets, free and clear of all
Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances), in accordance with the

contract, to put Purchaser in actual possession and operating control of the
Purchased Assets and otherwise to cause Seller to fulfill its obligations

orderly transfer of those business relationships of Seller existing prior to
the Closing and relating to the Business; (iv) satisfy the Excluded
Liabilities in a manner that is not detrimental to any of such relationships;

promptly deliver to Purchaser any mail, packages and other communications

(b) If after the Closing, Purchaser in good faith identifies in writing or
Seller discovers any Purchased Asset or Assumed Liability, possession or
ownership of which has not been transferred to, or assumed by, Purchaser, then
Seller will, or will cause its Subsidiaries to, as promptly as practicable
after written notice by Purchaser, transfer, convey, assign, or deliver, or
cause to be transferred, conveyed, assigned, or delivered (without further
consideration) to Purchaser, all right, title and interest of Seller and its
Subsidiaries in and to such Purchased Asset or Assumed Liability.

 

(c) If after the Closing, Purchaser in good faith identifies or Seller
discovers Purchaser to be in possession of any Excluded Asset or subject to

Seller or its Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall accept or assume,
as applicable, such asset or Excluded Liability; (ii) Seller or its
Subsidiary shall assume, and agree to pay, perform, fulfill and discharge
(without further consideration) any Liabilities associated with such assets or
Excluded Liabilities; and (iii) Purchaser and Seller or its Subsidiary shall
execute such documents or instruments of conveyance or assumption and take
such further acts which are reasonably necessary or desirable to effect the
transfer of such asset or Excluded Liability back to the Subsidiary.

(d) To the extent that Purchaser cannot be granted physical possession of any
Purchased Asset as of the Closing Date, such Purchased Asset shall be held by

take possession thereof.

 



72 Section 5.6 _Change of Corporate Name_.

 

(a) Upon the earlier of (i) thirty (30) months following the Closing, and (ii)
two (2) years after receipt from the relevant Governmental Entities in Japan
of the Permit allowing Purchaser or a designated Subsidiary of Parent to
replace "Wright" with "MicroPort" in the legal name of the Transferred Entity,
Purchaser shall, or shall cause its appropriate Subsidiary to, change the
name of the Transferred Company to remove the name "Wright."

(b) Purchaser shall, in each jurisdiction where Purchaser acquires Purchased
Assets, upon the earlier of (i) thirty (30) months following the Closing, and
(ii) two (2) years following receipt in such jurisdiction of all Permits
necessary to allow Purchaser or a designated Subsidiary of Parent to replace
the name "Wright" with "MicroPort" in the product name or product label of any
OrthoRecon Product or other Purchased Asset in such jurisdiction, remove and
cease using in such jurisdiction any trademarks, trade names, product names,
brand marks, brand names, trade dress or logos owned or licensed by Wright or
its Affiliates (collectively, the " _Wright Branding_ ") from all OrthoRecon
Products, advertising and marketing materials, or other Purchased Assets. In
each jurisdiction where Purchaser acquires Purchased Assets, effective as of
the Closing Date and continuing until the date on which Purchaser or a
designated Subsidiary of Parent are required to remove and cease using the
Warlock Branding in such jurisdiction pursuant to this Section, Seller hereby
grants to Purchaser and its Affiliates a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
royalty-free license to use the Wright Branding in each such jurisdiction in
substantially the same manner as such trademarks, trade names, brandmarks,
brand names, trade dress or logos were used prior to the Closing Date since
January 1, 2008. Thereafter, Purchaser shall neither use nor permit or allow
any of its Affiliates to use any of the Wright Branding in connection with the
Business or otherwise. Purchaser will ensure that the quality of all products
and services that bear Wright Branding pursuant to the foregoing trademark
license are of substantially the same or better quality as the same products
and services possessed prior to the Closing Date. Other than as a result of a
material breach by Seller of the Transition Services Agreement or any
other Transaction Document, if Purchaser violates the foregoing quality
control requirements with respect to any particular product or service bearing
the Wright Branding and is unable to cure such violation within a reasonable
period of time, Seller may terminate the foregoing trademark license with
respect to such product or service and require Purchaser to remove the Wright
Branding from such product or service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
in this _Section 5.6(b)_ shall permit Parent or its Affiliates to use the
Wright Branding to advertise, promote, market or sell any products or services
other than the OrthoRecon Products.

Section 5.7 _Records and Documents_.

(a) For a period of five (5) years after the Closing, at Purchasers request,

those records and documents related to the Business, the possession of which
is retained by Seller or its Subsidiaries, as may be necessary or useful in
connection with Purchasers conduct of the Business after the Closing. If
during such period Seller or any of its Subsidiaries elects to dispose of such
records and documents, Seller shall give Purchaser sixty (60) Business Days
prior written notice, during which period Purchaser shall have the right to
take such records and documents without further consideration.

(b) For a period of five (5) years after the Closing, at Sellers request,
Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide, at Sellers

possession of which is retained by Purchaser or Parents Subsidiaries, as may
be necessary or useful in connection with Sellers conduct of its business
after the Closing. If during such period Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries
elects to dispose of such records and documents, Purchaser shall give Seller
sixty (60) Business Days prior written notice, during which period Seller
shall have the right to take such records and documents without further
consideration.

 

Section 5.8 _Non-Solicit; Non-Hire_.

Seller and its Subsidiaries and their Affiliates and successors shall not,
directly or indirectly, whether on such Persons own behalf or on behalf of
some other Person solicit or hire, or attempt to solicit or hire, any Business
Employee or Business Contractor employed or engaged by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates as of the Closing; _provided_ , that the foregoing restrictions
shall not apply to any Person who is hired as a result of the use of a general
solicitation (such as an advertisement in a publication of regional or
national circulation) not specifically directed to employees of Purchaser or
its Affiliates.

(b) Except as expressly provided herein, from and after the date hereof and
until one (1) year after the Closing, Parent and its Subsidiaries and their
Affiliates and successors shall not, directly or indirectly, whether on such
Persons own behalf or on behalf of some other Person, solicit or hire, or
attempt to hire or solicit, any employees or consultants employed or engaged
by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries following the Closing; _provided_ , that
the foregoing shall not apply to any Person who is hired as a result of the
use of a general solicitation (such as an advertisement in a publication of
regional or national circulation) not specifically directed to employees of
Seller or its Affiliates.

Section 5.9 _Non-Disparagement_. On and after the Closing Date, neither Seller
nor any of its Affiliates will: (a) make any negative statement or
communication regarding the Business, the Purchased Assets or Purchaser, or
(b) make any derogatory or disparaging statement or communication regarding
the Business, the Purchased Assets, or Purchaser. On and after the Closing
Date, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates will make any negative
statement or communication regarding Seller or the Retained Business or make
any derogatory or disparaging statement or communication regarding Seller or
the Retained Business.

 



74 Section 5.10 _Customer Inquiries_. After the Closing, Seller shall promptly

receives relating to the Business from an existing customer of the Business or
any other Person that states its desire to explore a commercial relationship
related to Business or an interest in the OrthoRecon Products.

Section 5.11 _Refunds and Remittances_. If, after the Closing, Seller (or
any of its Affiliates), on the one hand, or Purchaser (or any of its
Affiliates), on the other hand, receives any funds properly belonging to the
other Party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the receiving
Party will promptly so advise such other Party, will segregate and hold such
funds in trust for the benefit of such other Party and will promptly deliver
such funds, together with any interest earned thereon, to an account or
accounts designated in writing by such other Party. 

Section 5.12 _Privileges_. Seller acknowledges that the Purchased Assets
include all attorney work-product protections, attorney-client privileges and
other legal protections and privileges to which Seller may be entitled in
connection with any of the Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities. Seller is
not waiving, and will not be deemed to have waived or diminished, any of its
attorney work-product protections, attorney-client privileges or similar
protections or privileges as a result of the disclosure of information to
Purchaser and its Representatives in connection with this Agreement and
the Transactions. Seller and Purchaser agree and acknowledge that they (a)
share a common legal and commercial interest in all of the information and
communications that may subject to such protections and privileges, (b) are or
may become joint defendants in Actions to which such protections and
privileges may relate and (c) intend that such protections and privileges
remain intact should either Party become subject to any actual or threatened
Action to which such information or communications relate. Seller will take
any actions reasonably requested by Purchaser, at the sole cost and expense of
Purchaser unless Purchaser is entitled to indemnification therefor under the
provisions of _Article VIII_ , in order to permit Purchaser to preserve and
assert any such protection or privilege included in the Purchased Assets.

shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, comply with all obligations of

the Corporate Integrity Agreement in connection with the conduct
and operations of the Business after the Closing, and any failure after the
Closing by Parent or its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to comply with the terms
and provisions of the Corporate Integrity Agreement will be an Assumed
Liability.

commercially reasonable efforts to improve the design history files referenced

sale, import any and all products, services and technologies, and otherwise
practice, use, develop, improve, reproduce, distribute, make derivative works
of, display, perform, market, commercialize and otherwise exploit such

76 (c) Upon the Closing (in accordance with _Sections 6.1(a)_ and _6.2(b)_ ),
the Parties shall execute and deliver a cross license agreement (the "
_Shared IP Cross License_ ") to formalize the terms and conditions relating to
the Retained Shared IP License and the Transferred Shared IP License,
including, without limitation, the Parties respective reporting,
prosecution, maintenance and enforcement obligations with respect to any
Retained Shared Intellectual Property and Transferred Shared Intellectual
Property.

 

(d) For purposes of this _Section 5.17_, Patents contained in the Prophecy
Intellectual Property listed on _Schedule 5.17(d)(i)_ shall be referred to as
the " _Purchaser Prosecuted Prophecy Patents_ ", and Patents contained in the
Prophecy Intellectual Property listed on _Schedule 5.17(d)(ii)_ shall be
referred to as the " _Seller Prosecuted Prophecy Patents_." The Shared IP
Cross License will give (i) Purchaser the exclusive right to control
prosecution of (A) the Shared Intellectual Property (other than the Seller
Prosecuted Prophecy Patents) in the Business Field, and (B) the Purchaser
Prosecuted Prophecy Patents, and (ii) Seller the exclusive right to control
prosecution of (A) the Shared Intellectual Property (other than the Purchaser
Prosecuted Prophecy Patents) in the Retained Business Field, and (B) the
Seller Prosecuted Prophecy Patents. Each Party shall provide the other Party
all reasonable cooperation, at the other Partys request and expense, in the
prosecution efforts provided in this  _Section 5.17(d)_, including providing
copies of all correspondence with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (or any
corresponding office, department, organization, agency or other Governmental
Entity in the relevant jurisdiction), any necessary powers of attorney and
executing any other required documents or instruments for such prosecution,
including as necessary to allow for the filing of continuations and
divisionals and, with respect to Seller Prosecuted Prophecy Patents,
the signing of terminal disclaimers).

(e) The Shared IP Cross License will give (i) Purchaser the first right, but
not the obligation, to enforce against third party infringers in the Business
Field the Shared Intellectual Property, and (ii) Seller the first right, but
not the obligation, to enforce against third party infringers in the Retained
Business Field the Shared Intellectual Property. Each Party shall provide to
the enforcing Party reasonable assistance in such enforcement, at such
enforcing Partys request and expense, including joining such action as a
party plaintiff if required by applicable Laws to pursue such action. The
Shared IP Cross License will be freely assignable by each Party, either in
whole or in part, provided that the assignee or any successor agrees to be
bound by the terms of the Shared IP Cross License.

(a) _Indemnification by Seller_. Subject to _Section 8.1_ ( _General
Survival_ ) and the other provisions of this Article, from and after the

Affiliates and Representatives (collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnitees_
"), from and against and in respect of any and all Losses resulting from,
arising out of, relating to, or imposed upon or incurred by any Purchaser
Indemnitee by reason of:

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of Seller
contained in this Agreement, the Seller Disclosure Schedule or any other
Transaction Document to which it is a party (it being understood that for the
sole purpose of determining Losses (and not for purposes of determining
whether or not there are any inaccuracies in or breaches of any representation
or warranty), the representations and warranties shall not be deemed to

(vii) any costs and expenses of enforcement to recover Losses due to any

No Purchaser Indemnitee shall be precluded from seeking indemnification under
any of the preceding subparagraphs of this Section solely by virtue of such
Purchaser Indemnitees inability to seek indemnification under any other
subparagraph of this Section.

(b) _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Subject to _Section 8.1_ ( _General
Survival_ ) and the other provisions of this Article, from and after the
Closing Date, Parent and Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller
and its Affiliates and Representatives (collectively, the " _Seller
Indemnitees_ "), from and against and in respect of any and all Losses
resulting from, arising out of, relating to, or imposed upon or incurred by
any Seller Indemnitee by reason of:

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of Parent
or Purchaser contained in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document to

 



84  which either Parent or Purchaser is a party (it being understood that for
the sole purpose of determining Losses (and not for purposes of determining
whether or not there are any inaccuracies in or breaches of any
representation or warranty), the representations and warranties shall not be
deemed to be qualified by any references to materiality or Material Adverse
Effect);

 

(ii) any breach by Parent or Purchaser of any covenant or agreement contained
in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document to which either Parent or
Purchaser is a party;

(iii) any and all Assumed Liabilities; and

(c) _Limitations_.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Purchaser
Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification for any Losses arising from a
claim for indemnification pursuant to  _subsection (a)(i)_ above (A) for any
individual item, unless the Loss related to the claim related to such item (or
series of claims from the same or substantially the same facts and
circumstances) is at least Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000), and (B)
until the aggregate amount of all Losses indemnifiable by Seller under
_subsection (a)(i)_ that satisfy the requirement under subclause (A) exceeds
Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) (the " _Basket_ "), at which time all
Losses incurred shall be subject to indemnification hereunder, including the
amount of the Basket. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement (but subject to the proviso in this sentence), Sellers aggregate
Liability for indemnification pursuant to _subsection (a)(i)_ above shall not
exceed Sixty Million Dollars ($60,000,000); _provided, however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth above in this
subsection shall not apply with respect to Losses arising from fraud, any
intentional misrepresentation or any inaccuracy in or breach of any
Fundamental Representation, for which Sellers Liability for indemnification
shall not exceed the Purchase Price unless the Loss arises from fraud or
intentional misrepresentation, in which case it is not limited.

(ii) Sellers Liability for indemnification pursuant to _subsections (a)(ii)_
through _(vii)_ above shall not exceed the Purchase Price unless the Loss
arises from fraud or intentional misrepresentation, in which case it is not
limited.

(iii) Neither a Purchaser Indemnitees nor a Seller Indemnitees right to
indemnification under this Article based on any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall be diminished or
otherwise affected in any way as a result of such Purchaser Indemnitees or
Seller Indemnitees knowledge of such inaccuracy, breach or untruth as of the
date hereof, regardless of whether such knowledge arises as a result of
Purchaser Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees investigation or as a result of
disclosure by Seller or any of its Affiliates or Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, as applicable, unless such disclosures were set forth in this
Agreement or in all applicable Schedules hereto.

 



85 (iv) The waiver of any condition to Closing based upon the accuracy of
any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with
any covenant or agreement, shall not affect the right to indemnification or
other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements.

 

(v) _LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES_. TO THE
MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS PURSUANT TO
_SECTION 4.6_ ( _EXCLUSIVITY_ ) AND _SECTION 5.1_ ( _CONFIDENTIALITY_ ), NO
PARTY WILL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF
USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR OTHER SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED, UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY,
ARISING FROM THE PERFORMANCE OF, OR RELATING TO, THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF
WHETHER SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF, OR THE
FORESEEABILITY OF, SUCH DAMAGES EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT AN INDEMNITEE IS LIABLE
TO AN UNAFFILIATED THIRD PARTY WITH RESPECT THERETO.

Section 8.3 _Third Party Actions_.

(a) If a Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee (as applicable, an "
_Indemnitee_ ") becomes aware of a third party Action that such Indemnitee
believes, in good faith, may result in a Purchaser Indemnification Claim or
Seller Indemnification Claim (as applicable, an " _Indemnification Claim_ "),
Such Indemnitee shall promptly notify to Seller or Purchaser (such party
obligated to provide indemnification under this Article, the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") of such Action. The Indemnitor shall have the right (exercisable
within fifteen (15) Business Days of receipt by Indemnitor of Indemnitees
notice), but not the obligation to conduct the defense thereof. The party
conducting such defense (the " _Defending Party_ ") shall, to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party from time to time, give updates as to
the status of such Action. The party not conducting such defense shall be
entitled to participate in any such defense at its sole cost and expense, as
set forth below:

(i) If Indemnitor is the Defending Party, it may agree to any settlement or
compromise of any such third party Action in its sole discretion, so long as
such settlement or compromise (A) does not obligate Indemnitee to take or
refrain from taking any action and (B) provides for a complete release of
Indemnitee by such third party. Any such settlement or compromise by
Indemnitor shall represent the agreement of Indemnitor that the Losses
incurred in connection therewith shall be indemnifiable hereunder.

 

(ii) If Indemnitee is the Defending Party, it shall seek the prior written
consent of Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or

 



86  delayed by Indemnitor) in connection with Indemnitees agreement to any
settlement or compromise of any such third party Action. Any such written
consent by Indemnitor shall represent the agreement of Indemnitor that the
Losses incurred in connection therewith shall be indemnifiable hereunder. If
Indemnitee shall fail to obtain such written consent of Indemnitor, Indemnitee
may agree to any such settlement or compromise, and may make an
Indemnification Claim under this Article therefor, but the resolution of such
claim (including whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement for such claim) shall remain subject to
this Article. 

Section 8.4 _Indemnification Procedures_.

(a) In the event that an Indemnitee seeks a recovery, in accordance with the
terms of this Article, in respect of an Indemnification Claim, Purchaser (on
behalf of such other Purchaser Indemnitee, if applicable) or Seller (on
behalf of such other Seller Indemnitee, if applicable) shall deliver a written
notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") the Indemnifying Party, as the case may be. Each
Claim Notice shall, with respect to each Indemnification Claim set forth
therein, (i) specify in reasonable detail and in good faith the nature of the
Indemnification Claim being made and (ii) state the aggregate Dollar amount of
Losses to which such Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this Article that have been incurred, or a good faith estimate of the
aggregate Dollar amount of such Losses reasonably expected to be incurred, by
such Indemnitee pursuant to such Indemnification Claim (the " _Claim Amount_
").

(b) If the Indemnifying Party wishes to object to the allowance of some or
all Indemnification Claims made in a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party
must deliver a written objection to Purchaser (on behalf of any Purchaser
Indemnitee) or Seller (on behalf of any Seller Indemnitee), as the case may
be, within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt by the Indemnifying Party
of such Claim Notice expressing such objection and explaining in reasonable
detail and in good faith the basis therefor. Following receipt by Purchaser or
Seller, as the case may be, of the Indemnifying Partys written objection, if
any, Purchaser (on behalf of any other Purchaser Indemnitee, if applicable) or
Seller (on behalf of any other Seller Indemnitee, if applicable), as the case
may be, and the Indemnifying Party shall promptly, and within twenty (20)
Business Days, meet to agree on the rights of the respective parties with
respect to each Indemnification Claim that is the subject of such written
objection. If the Parties should so agree, (i) a memorandum setting forth
such agreement shall be prepared and executed by Purchaser (on behalf of any
other Purchaser Indemnitee, if applicable) or Seller (on behalf of any other
Seller Indemnitee, if applicable), as the case may be, and the Indemnifying
Party, and (ii) with respect to any Purchaser Indemnification Claim, as
promptly as practicable and within five (5) Business Days following execution
of such memorandum, subject to _subsection (d)_ below, Seller shall pay to
Purchaser (on behalf of any other Purchaser Indemnitee, if applicable) in cash
the aggregate Dollar amount of Losses payable to such Indemnitee pursuant to
such memorandum and (iii) with respect to any Seller Indemnification
Claim, as promptly as practicable and within five (5) Business Days following
execution of such memorandum, subject to _subsection (d)_ below, Purchaser
shall pay to Seller (on behalf of any other Seller Indemnitee, if applicable),
in cash the aggregate Dollar amount of Losses payable to such Indemnitee
pursuant to such memorandum. In the event that the Parties do not prepare and
sign such a

 



87  memorandum or such memorandum does not address in full the written
objections timely delivered, within twenty (20) Business Days of receipt by
Purchaser (on behalf of any other Purchaser Indemnitee, if applicable) or
Seller (on behalf of any other Seller Indemnitee, if applicable), as the case
may be, from the Indemnifying Party of the written objection, then Purchaser
or Seller, as the case may be, may resolve such dispute in accordance with
_Section 10.5_ ( _Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_ ).

(c) If Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, does not receive a response
from the Indemnifying Party with respect to any Indemnification Claim set

The parties agree that any provisions relating to the appointment of emergency
arbitrators shall apply to any arbitral proceedings commenced pursuant to
this clause. The arbitration tribunal (" _Tribunal_ ") shall consist of three
arbitrators to be appointed in accordance with the Rules. The seat of the
arbitration shall be Hong Kong. This agreement to arbitrate shall be governed
by the laws of the Hong Kong. The language of the arbitration proceedings
shall be English . Any award of the Tribunal shall be made in writing and
shall be final and binding on the parties from the day it is made. The
parties undertake to carry out the award without delay. The parties waive any
right to apply to any court of law and/or other judicial authority to
determine any preliminary point of law and/or review any question of law
and/or the merits, insofar as such waiver may validly be made. Nothing in this
Section shall be construed as preventing any party from seeking conservatory
or interim relief from any court of competent jurisdiction.

 

You hereby irrevocably and unconditionally designate and appoint the New York
office of The Corporation Trust Company (the " _Process Agent_ ") (and any
successor entity) at 111 Eighth Avenue, 13th Floor, New York City, New York,
10011, as your authorized agent to receive and forward on your behalf service
of any and all process that may be served in any such suit, action or
proceeding in any federal and New York State courts located in The City of New
York (and any appellate courts thereof) and agree that service of process upon
the Process Agent shall be deemed in every respect effective service of
process upon it in any such suit, action or proceeding and shall be taken and
held to be valid personal service upon it. Said designation and appointment
shall be irrevocable. Nothing in this paragraph shall affect the right of 

 



\- 8 -   Otsuka, its affiliates or any Indemnified Party to serve process in any
manner permitted by law. You further agree to take any and all action,
including the execution and filing of any and all such documents and
instruments, as may be necessary to continue such designation and appointment
of the Process Agent in full force and effect. You hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally authorize and direct the Process Agent to accept such
service on your behalf. If for any reason the Process Agent ceases to be
available to act as such, you agree to designate a new agent in New York City
on the terms and for the purposes of this provision reasonably satisfactory to
Otsuka.

 

If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any Dispute, it is necessary to
convert a sum due hereunder in dollars into another currency, the
parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so,
that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with
normal banking procedures, Otsuka could purchase (and remit in New York City)
dollars with such other currency on the business day preceding that on which
final judgment is given. Your obligation in respect of any sum due hereunder
shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than dollars, be
discharged only to the extent that on the business day following its receipt
of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency, Otsuka may, in
accordance with normal banking procedures, purchase (and remit in New York
City) dollars with such other currency; if the dollars so purchased and
remitted are less than the sum originally due to Otsuka or any Indemnified
Party in dollars, you agree, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any
such judgment, to indemnify the relevant payee against such loss, and if the
dollars so purchased exceed the sum originally due in dollars, such excess
shall be remitted to you.

Dear Sirs,

entered into by a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the "Purchaser") and
Wright Medical Group, Inc. (the "Seller"), pursuant to which the Purchaser
will purchase and assume from the Seller and the Seller will sell and assign
to the Purchaser and its designees, all of the Purchased Assets and the
Assumed Liabilities (as to be defined under the APA), on the terms and subject
to the conditions to be set forth in the APA; and (ii) the proposed provision
by Otsuka Medical Devices Co., Ltd, a major shareholder in the Company,
("Otsuka") to the Company of US$200 million senior loan facilities
("Facilities") for the purpose of financing part of the purchase price
payable by the Purchaser under the APA. It is understood that the terms of the
Facilities will be set out initially in a commitment letter to be entered into
between the Company and Otsuka at the time the APA is entered into (as it may
be amended from time to time, the "Commitment Letter"). The Facilities will
comprise three tranches: (i) term loan A of US$60 million, repayable one year
after drawdown and including an option for Otsuka to purchase the Japanese
subsidiary which the Purchaser will acquire from the Seller under the APA;
(ii) term loan B of US$40 million, repayable three years after drawdown and
convertible at the option of Otsuka into ordinary shares of the Company; and
(iii) term loan C of US$100 million and repayable one year after drawdown.

The Proposed Acquisition and the financing pursuant to the senior credit
facilities envisaged by the Commitment Letter and all related transactions are
hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Transaction". We acknowledge
that, pursuant to the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities FORM OF VOTING UNDERTAKINGS

be sent to the shareholders of the Company in connection with the
Transaction ("Circular").

We confirm and undertake that we are the absolute beneficial owner
("Beneficial Owner") of [ ] ordinary shares of US$0.00001 each in

acknowledge is to be done in reliance on the undertakings given by us in this
Letter), we hereby irrevocably undertake:

favour, and/or to procure that all of the Shares are voted in favour, of such
resolutions relating to the approval of the Proposed Acquisition, the

Transition Service Schedule and the terms of this Agreement, the terms of such
Transition Service Schedule shall govern.

 

2.2. _Information_. Each Transition Service Schedule shall set forth, among
other things:

 

(a) a description of the Service to be provided;

 

(b) the term during which the Service will be provided (the " _Service Term_

(e) the maximum percentage of the applicable Service Provider
Representatives working time to be allocated to the Services, based upon a

(g) any other terms applicable thereto on the Transition Service Schedule.

 

2.3. _Service Levels_. Each Party shall ensure Services provided by such Party
are performed in a manner consistent with the terms and conditions contained
herein and at a level that is substantially similar to the reasonable past
practices with respect to such Service as performed internally by Seller
immediately preceding the Effective Date, and in accordance with applicable
law.

2.4. _Additional Resources_. Except as provided in a Transition Service
Schedule, and except as provided by Applicable Law, in providing the
Services, neither Party, in providing Services hereunder, shall be obligated
to:

(a) hire any additional employees;

(b) maintain the employment of any specific employee;

in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (the " _Additional Services_
"). Upon Agreement, the parties shall execute additional written Transition
Service Schedules for such Additional Services. Neither Party shall have any
obligation to execute any additional Transition Service Schedules.

2.6. _Change Order Process_. Any change in the scope or duration of any
Service described in or other amendment to a Transition Service Schedule must
be in writing and signed by the parties. 

3\. TERM AND TERMINATION.

3.1. _Term_. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and remain in
effect until the last day that any Service Term in any Transition Service
Schedule remains in effect (the " _Term_ "), unless earlier terminated under
this _Section 3_. With respect to each Service, such Service shall begin upon
the applicable start date set forth in the Transition Services Schedule (or
the Effective Date if no start date is identified) and shall continue for

 



-3-   the longest duration, or until the end date, for such Services set forth in
the Transition Services Schedule, unless earlier terminated under this
_Section 3_. This Agreement may be extended by the parties in writing,
either in whole or with respect to one or more of the Services.

3.2.  _Termination_.

3.2.1. Either Party may terminate this Agreement, either with respect to all
or with respect to any one or more of the Services provided to such Party as
Service Recipient hereunder, for any reason or for no reason, at any time upon
at least sixty (60) days prior written notice to the other Party in its
capacity as Service Provider, unless the specific Transition Service Schedule
provides otherwise and provided that any termination will not relieve the
terminating Party of any payment obligations for Services provided to such
Party prior to the date such written notice of termination is delivered. Any
termination of Services under this _Section 3.2.1_ shall have no effect on
the obligations of the terminating Party as Service Provider under this
Agreement.

 

3.2.2. Subject to the provisions of _Section 13_ below, either Party may
terminate this Agreement in its entirety or with respect to affected Services
if the other Party materially breaches a material provision with regard to
those Services and does not cure such breach (or does not take reasonable
steps required under the circumstances to cure such breach going forward)
within ninety (90) days (thirty (30) days in the event of a payment breach)
after receiving notice of the breach.

3.2.3. Any provision that by its nature should survive, including but not
limited to, the provisions of _Section 4_, _Section 10_, _Section 11_,
_Section 12_ and  _Section 14_, shall survive the termination of this
Agreement.

4\. PAYMENT TERMS.

 

4.1. _Charges for Services_. Each Party shall pay the charges, if any, set
forth on the applicable Transition Service Schedule for each Service listed
therein as adjusted, from time to time, in accordance with _Section 4.3_
hereof. Each Service shall be provided at the Service Providers cost, without
any percentage mark-up or other measure of profit.

4.2. _Expenses_. Each Party, in its capacity as Service Recipient, shall, for
each Service performed, reimburse Service Provider for any reasonable
documented out-of-pocket expenses payable to third parties which are incurred
by such Service Provider or its Affiliates in connection with such Service
Providers provision of the Services (" _Expenses_ "); _provided_ , that the
Expenses shall not include the allocation of any corporate overhead or similar
expenses incurred by such Service Provider or its Affiliates in connection
with the performance of the Services.

4.3. _Payment Terms_. Each Party shall invoice the other Party monthly for all
charges pursuant to this Agreement. Such invoices shall contain reasonable
detail of the Service provided and the charge therefor. Each Party shall pay
all undisputed amounts due for Services provided hereunder within thirty (30)
days from receipt of an invoice therefor. Late payments shall bear interest
at the lesser of 12% per annum or the maximum rate allowed by

 



-4-   law. Failure to pay undisputed amounts due hereunder pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement is agreed by the parties to be a material breach and the
non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement under _Section 3.2_ hereof.

4.4. _Disputed Amounts_. Except as the parties may expressly agree in
writing, amounts due hereunder shall not be offset by amounts owed under this
Agreement or due under any other agreement. Further, the parties agree that
disputes related to amounts due under this Agreement or any other
agreement shall not serve as grounds to delay undisputed payment obligations
under this Agreement.

5\. TRANSITION SERVICE RESPONSIBILITIES.

5.1. _Responsibilities of Service Provider_. Subject to _Section 2.4_,
each Party shall maintain sufficient resources to perform its obligations
hereunder. Any specific performance criteria for a specific Service will be

assistance and training to Service Recipient personnel to the extent

interfering with the Services; and

(c) each Party requiring its personnel to obey any security regulations and
other published policies of the other Party while on the other Partys

itself out as an agent of the other and neither Party shall have the authority
to bind the other.

10.1. During the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on the date
that is three (3) years from the date of termination of this Agreement, each
Party shall retain in strict confidence, and shall cause such Partys
Representatives to retain in strict confidence, all information and data
relating to the other Party received pursuant to this Agreement, including
but not limited to, information regarding its business, employees, development
plans, programs, documentation, techniques, trade secrets, systems and know-
how (" _Confidential Information_ "), and shall not use such Confidential
Information other than in connection with performance of this Agreement and,
unless otherwise required by law, disclose such information to any third party
without the others prior written consent, except for
Confidential Information that:

(a) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of
a breach of this Agreement by a Party or any of its Affiliates;

 



-6-  (b) is or becomes available to a Party or any of its Affiliates on a non-
confidential basis from a source other than the other Party and its
Affiliates; provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality
agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of,
confidentiality to the other Party or any of its Affiliates; or

(c) is independently developed by a Party or any of its Affiliates
without use of any Shared Confidential Information or violation of any
obligation hereunder, as evidenced by such Partys or its Affiliates (as
applicable) contemporaneous written records.

 

10.2. In the event that either Party (the " _Receiving Party_ ") receives a
request to disclose all or any part of any Confidential Information under the
terms of a subpoena, Order, civil investigative demand or similar process
issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by another Governmental Entity
or the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the Receiving Party agrees to (i)
immediately notify the other Party (the " _Disclosing Party_ ") of the
existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such request; (ii) consult with
the Disclosing Party on the advisability of taking legally available steps to
resist or narrow such request, at Disclosing Partys expense; and (iii) if
disclosure of such information is required, furnish only that portion of the
Confidential Information that, in the advice of counsel to Receiving Party,
such Receiving Party is legally required to disclose and advise the Disclosing
Party as far in advance of such disclosure as reasonably possible so that the
Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order or other
reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such
Confidential Information. In any event, Disclosing Party shall not oppose
actions by Receiving Party to obtain an appropriate protective order or other
reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such
Confidential Information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, each Party
and its Representatives will be permitted to disclose Confidential Information
or any portion thereof, without notice to the other Party, upon the routine
request of any Governmental Entity or the Hong Kong Stock Exchange having
authority to regulate or oversee any aspect of such Party or its
Representatives business or that of such Partys Affiliates, _provided_
that each Party or its Representatives shall advise the Governmental Entity
or the Hong Kong Stock Exchange of the confidential nature of such
information.

10.3. Each Party hereby acknowledges that the Confidential Information of the
other Party may still be under development, or may be incomplete, and that
such information may relate to products that are under development or are
planned for development. NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE

for any expenses, losses or actions incurred or undertaken by the other Party
as a result of the other Partys receipt or use of Confidential Information.

10.4. It is understood and agreed that money damages may not be a sufficient
remedy for any breach of this _Section 10_, and that the Disclosing Party may
be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief
as a remedy for any such breach. Such remedy shall not be deemed to be the
exclusive remedy for breach of this _Section 10_, but shall be in addition to
all other remedies available at law or equity to the Disclosing Party.

 



-7-  11\. INDEMNIFICATION.

 

11.1. Each Party hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
other Party and its officers, directors, agents, employees and Affiliates,
from and against any and all Damages, including reasonable attorneys fees
(collectively, " _Losses_ ") arising out of, relating to or resulting from (i)
such Partys gross negligence or willful misconduct related to this Agreement
or (ii) such Partys execution of an instruction of the other Party in its
capacity as Service Recipient regarding an action to be taken under this
Agreement.

 

11.2. An indemnifying partys indemnification obligations hereunder shall be
conditioned upon (A) the indemnified party providing the indemnifying party
with written notice describing such indemnification claim (" _Claim_ ") in
reasonable detail in light of the circumstances then known and then providing
the indemnifying party with further notices to keep it reasonably informed
with respect thereto; _provided, however_ , that failure of the indemnified
party to provide such notice or to keep the indemnifying party reasonably
informed as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its
obligations hereunder except to the extent, if any, that the indemnified party
is materially prejudiced thereby; (B) the indemnifying party being entitled to
participate in such Claim and assume the defense thereof with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, at the indemnifying partys
sole expense; and (C) the indemnified party reasonably cooperating with the
indemnifying party, at the indemnifying partys sole cost and expense, in the
defense of any Claim. The indemnifying party will not accept any settlement
unless the settlement includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by
the claimant or the plaintiff of a full and unconditional release of
the indemnified party, from all liability with respect to the matters that
are subject to such Claim, without the indemnified partys prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. The indemnified party may participate in the defense of any
Claim with counsel reasonably acceptable to the indemnifying party, at the
indemnified partys own expense.

11.3. With the exception of any claims of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation which are proven and upon which a judgment entered in the
involved proceeding shall be expressly based, each Party expressly agrees
that the provisions of _Section 11_ shall be the exclusive remedy for all
claims of breach or indemnification pursuant to this Agreement.

 

11.4. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY
WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
OR AGAINST INFRINGEMENT.

FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF USE, COST OF COVER, BUSINESS
INTERRUPTION OR OTHER SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED, UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING
FROM THE

 



-8-   PERFORMANCE OF, OR RELATING TO, THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH
PARTY HAS BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF, OR THE FORESEEABILITY OF, SUCH
DAMAGES EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT A PARTY IS LIABLE TO AN UNAFFILIATED THIRD PARTY
WITH RESPECT THERETO; AND (B) EACH PARTYS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES HEREUNDER
SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF THE FEES PAID (OR PAYABLE) BY SERVICE RECIPIENT
TO SERVICE PROVIDER UNDER THE APPLICABLE TRANSITION SERVICES SCHEDULE FROM
WHICH SUCH CLAIM ARISES.

13\. FORCE MAJEURE. Each Party will be excused for any failure or delay in
performing any of its obligations under this Agreement, other than the
obligations of Service Recipient to make payments to Service Provider for
Services already rendered, if such failure or delay is caused by any act of
God, any accident, explosion, fire, act of terrorism, storm, earthquake,
flood or any similar circumstance or event.

14\. MISCELLANEOUS.

the other documents and agreements specifically referenced to herein, (a)

subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all other prior and

substance of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as

FORM OF EQUITY TRANSFER AGREEMENT EQUITY TRANSFER AGREEMENT

 

[ ], 2013

 

Reference is made to that certain Asset Purchase Agreement (the Agreement)
dated as of the date hereof between Warlock (as Seller), Raider Parent and
Raider (as Purchaser). Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined
shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement.

At the Closing and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
agreement, Seller will transfer to Purchaser all of Sellers rights, title and
interest in and to the Equity Interests, free and clear of all Encumbrances
and shall deliver all share certificates representing the Equity Interests to
Purchaser. Seller shall retain all rights with respect to, and be entitled to,
any refund of Taxes allocable to any Pre-Closing Period Taxes of the
Transferred Company, and Purchaser will promptly deliver to Seller any such
refund it may receive. Purchaser will consider any reasonable request of
Seller to file (or cause to be filed), at the sole cost and expense of Seller,
a Tax Return (including an amended Tax Return) or any other document claiming
any refund of Taxes to which Seller is entitled pursuant to the foregoing
sentence. It is expressly understood and agreed that any decision of whether
to file any such Tax Return or document following the Closing shall be within
the sole discretion of Purchaser.

Immediately following the Closing, the Transferred Company will promptly
register the transfer of the ownership of the Equity Interests to Purchaser
(or one of Raider Parents subsidiaries, as designated by Purchaser) in the
shareholders registry of the Transferred Company.  Seller and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that the consideration for the sale
of the Equity Interests is to be paid at Closing pursuant to the terms of the
Agreement. Seller and Purchaser further acknowledge that, as disclosed on
Schedule 2.18(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the Transferred Company is
the subject of certain Tax audits in Japan that will require the Transferred
Company to become liable for and to pay additional Taxes with respect to Tax
periods ending on or before the Closing Date, and that the total amount of
this additional liability may not be known until after the Closing Date. As a
result, Seller and Purchaser agree that Seller will reimburse Purchaser
promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days after the applicable
payment obligation arises) for the full amount of any Liability that the
Transferred Company or Purchaser (or any Affiliate thereof) may have for Taxes
of the Transferred Company that relate to any Pre-Closing Period (including
any Pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period) in connection with any audit,
including such audit disclosed in Schedule 2.18(b) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule. Seller expressly acknowledges that the reimbursement obligation
pursuant to this agreement shall be made without taking into account the
limitations on indemnification provided in Sections 8.2(c)(i) of the
Agreement. Seller shall pay to Purchaser the reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by Purchaser (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with the enforcement of its rights hereunder, together with
interest on the reimbursement amounts due under this agreement from the latest
date such payment is required to be paid at the prime lending rate prevailing
during such period as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , New York
edition. ---|---|---

This certificate is delivered pursuant to Section 7.2(xvii) of the Asset
Purchase Agreement dated as of June 18, 2013 by and among [Raider Parent], a

[corporation] formed under the laws of [ ] (the "Purchaser"), and

Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
provides that a transferee of a U.S. real property interest must withhold tax
if the transferor is a foreign person. For U.S. tax purposes (including
Section 1445), the owner of a disregarded entity (which has legal title to a
U.S. real property interest under local law) will be the transferor of the
property and not the disregarded entity. To inform [ ] (the
"Transferee") that withholding of tax is not required upon the disposition of
a U.S. real property interest by [ ] (the "Transferor") the
undersigned hereby certifies the following on behalf of Transferor:



     | 1. | Transferor is not a foreign corporation, foreign partnership,
foreign trust, or foreign estate (as those terms are defined in the Code and
income tax regulations);  
---|---|--- 



     | 2. | Transferor is not a disregarded entity as defined in Section
1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii) of the income tax regulations; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 3. | Transferors U.S. employer identification number is 
; and 
---|---|--- 



     | 4. | Transferors office address is __ .  
---|---|--- 

Transferor understands that this certificate may be disclosed to the Internal
Revenue Service by Transferee and that any false statement contained herein
could be punished by fine, imprisonment, or both.

_[Signature page follows] _ Under penalties of perjury I declare that I have examined this certificate and
to the best of my knowledge and belief it is true, correct, and complete, and
I further declare that I have authority to sign this document on behalf of
Transferor

14 EXHIBIT M

FORM OF LITIGATION SUPPORT AGREEMENT SIDE AGREEMENT

AMONG

[SELLER]

 

AND [PURCHASER]

This Side Agreement (the " _Side Agreement_ ") by and among [SELLER] ("
_Seller_ "), and [PURCHASER] (" _Purchaser_ ") (collectively, the " _Parties_
") is entered into on [DATE]. Capitalized terms used in this Side Agreement
that are not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the APA (as
such term is defined below).

 

WHEREAS, an Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of [DATE] (the " _APA_ ") was
entered into by and among Seller and Purchaser;

WHEREAS, under the APA, the Parties agreed to provide each other all records
and documentation (the " _Books and Records_ ");

WHEREAS, such Books and Records include electronically stored information
on one Partys computer network environment, which will be transferred to the
other Partys computer network environment;

WHEREAS, the APA did not specifically address whether such Books and Records
included materials protected by the attorney-client privilege and/or work
product doctrine;

 

WHEREAS, the APA did not specifically address whether any item contained in
books, records, documents, materials or communications that is protected from
disclosure, under either state or federal law, by the attorney-client
privilege or attorney work product doctrine (such items, collectively "
_Privileged Materials_ ") are included within the provisions addressing Books
and Records in the APA; and

WHEREAS, the Parties also wish to make clear that they will cooperate with
each other with respect to the above issues and with respect to litigation-
related issues generally.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants and agreements contained
herein and in the APA, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree to
the following:

 



   1. | _The Terms Contained in This Side Agreement Control Over the APA_ 
---|--- 

To the extent anything in the APA, the Disclosure Schedules thereto, or any
other prior written or oral agreement among the Parties is inconsistent with
any of the provisions set forth in this Side Agreement, the Parties agree
that the provisions set forth in this Side Agreement control. of "Books and Records"_ 
---|--- 
 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the APA, the Disclosures Schedules
thereto, or any other prior written or oral communication among the Parties,
neither Party nor any of such Partys Affiliates is obligated to provide,
disclose, or convey to the other Party or any of its Affiliates, any
Privileged Materials prepared in connection with or in anticipation of any
concluded, pending, or future civil or criminal investigation or lawsuit with
respect to which the Party possessing the Privileged Materials retains or
assumes, as the case may be, liability under the APA. Neither Party nor any of
such Partys affiliates will intentionally provide, disclose, or convey any
such Privileged Materials to the other Party or any of its Affiliates.



   3. | _Inadvertent Disclosure of Privileged Materials_ 
---|--- 

In their efforts to comply with the APA, the Parties agree that both Parties
have had and will continue to have the right to take reasonable steps to
prevent the inadvertent provision, disclosure, or conveyance of any
Privileged Materials.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the APA, the Disclosures Schedules
thereto, or any other prior written or oral communication among the Parties,
to the extent one Party or any of such Partys Affiliates provides, discloses,
or conveys any Privileged Materials to the other Party or any of its
Affiliates, the Parties acknowledge that such provision, disclosure, or
conveyance is inadvertent, and if either Seller or any of its Affiliates, or
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, discover the existence of such inadvertent
provision, disclosure, or conveyance of Privileged Materials, the discovering
Party shall immediately notify the other Party, and the Parties shall
thereafter arrange for the immediate return to the disclosing Party, at the
disclosing Partys expense, any such inadvertently provided, disclosed,
or conveyed Privileged Materials, and the discovering Party and its
Affiliates will take reasonable steps, at the disclosing Partys expense, to
ensure the timely destruction and deletion from any electronic systems of any
remaining copies of any such inadvertently provided, disclosed, or conveyed
Privileged Materials.



   4. | _Restrictions on Parties  Rights to Restore Back-Up Tapes_ 
---|--- 

Certain of the Books and Records are contained on back-up tapes of the
Parties servers made prior to Closing, copies of which will be transferred to
Purchaser in accordance with the APA (the " _Back-Up Tapes_ "). Such Back-Up
Tapes contain disparate bits of electronic data from which readable material
may only be obtained upon restoration of the data on such Back-Up Tapes to a
readable format (" _Inadvertent Data_ "). Because of the nature and amount of
data stored on such Back-Up Tapes, it is not reasonably possible for either
Party to search for and redact the Privileged Materials contained on such
Back-Up Tapes, if any, prior to transferring such Back-Up Tapes to the other
Party. Each Party shall, prior to restoring any of the Back-Up Tapes in a
manner that would create Inadvertent Data, notify the other Party of its
intent to restore such Back-Up Tapes. If such intended restoration is other
than in connection with the production of data in response to a subpoena, then
the disclosing Party shall permit the other Party, for a maximum of one week,
to both review the data restored from such Back-Up Tapes and to arrange for
the deletion of any Privileged Materials from such restored data before the
requesting Party accesses the restored data. If, however, such intended
restoration is in connection with the production of data in response to a
subpoena, then (a) the preceding sentence will not apply, and (b) the Party
intending to restore the Back-Up Tapes will (i) promptly inform  the other Party of its intention to restore the Back-Up Tapes, (ii) prior to
any restoration of the Back-Up Tapes, provide the other Party a reasonable
amount of time, but no longer than 20 days, to seek a protective order or any
other legal remedy (each, an " _Objection_ ") sufficient to ensure that
Privileged Materials retain their privileged nature, and (iii) cooperate fully
in any judicial proceeding related to the Objection. The Parties further
agree that, because readable material may be obtained from the Back-Up Tapes
only upon restoration, the mere provision of the Back-Up Tapes to the primary
custody and control of the other Party does not constitute an intent to waive
or a waiver of any attorney-client privilege or attorney work product doctrine
protections.



   5. | _Common Interest Among Seller and Purchaser_ 
---|--- 

Counsel for Seller and Purchaser have reason to believe that lawsuits brought
against, or investigative demands served upon, Seller or any of its Affiliates
that relate to the OrthoRecon Business could potentially have adverse
consequences on Purchaser and its Affiliates with respect to the OrthoRecon
Business. Seller and Purchaser therefore have a common interest with respect
to any concluded, pending, or future civil or criminal investigation
or lawsuit that relates to the OrthoRecon Business, regardless of whether
Seller and its Affiliates retain direct financial liability with respect to
such investigation or suit under the APA. Pursuant to that common interest,
if, in connection with the transfer of Books and Records pursuant to the APA,
Seller or any of its Affiliates provide, disclose, or convey to Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates either inadvertently or intentionally, any books,
records, documents, or any other communications that (i) are otherwise
protected by the attorney-client privilege or attorney work product doctrine;
(ii) relate to the OrthoRecon Business; and (iii) relate to the subject matter
of any concluded, pending, or future civil or criminal investigation or
lawsuit with respect to which any such party may have liability under the APA,
such provision, disclosure, or conveyance shall not, consistent with
applicable law regarding common interest privilege, vitiate the attorney-
client privilege or attorney work product protections that otherwise apply to
such materials.



   6. | _Common Interest with Respect to Preservation of Books and
Records_ 
---|--- 

Pursuant to Seller and Purchasers common interest with respect to any
concluded, pending, or future civil or criminal investigation or lawsuit that
relates to the OrthoRecon Business, Seller and Purchaser also have a common
interest in ensuring that Seller complies with all existing duties to preserve
or maintain Books and Records (including, but not limited to, electronically
stored information) related to any such investigation or lawsuit. Purchaser
and its Affiliates agree to maintain data with respect to any concluded,
pending, or future civil or criminal investigation or lawsuit that relates to
the OrthoRecon Business for a period of up to [ten/five] years after
Closing, and will not suspend or discontinue any such data preservation
measures within such [ten/five]-year period unless notified in writing by
Seller that the obligation to preserve or maintain Books and Records has
concluded.

 



   7. | _Third-Party Access to Privileged Documents_ 
---|--- 

Neither Party nor any of such Partys Affiliates shall, unless required by
applicable law or court order, knowingly disclose or cause to be disclosed to
any outside third party any Privileged Material unless they obtain the
express prior written consent of the other Party. Both Parties and  their Affiliates shall take reasonable steps to ensure that any such
materials are not inadvertently disclosed to any outside third party and that,
if required by applicable law or court order to disclose such materials to
any third-party, they provide the Other Party with notice of their intention
to so disclose such materials. For purposes of this provision, the term
"outside third party" shall not include legal counsel engaged by either
Party.



   8. | _Employee Access With Respect to the Defense of Seller_ 
---|--- 

Purchaser agrees that it will provide Seller reasonable access to the
Transferring Employees and will not unreasonably restrict the Transferring
Employees from reasonably cooperating with Seller and any of its Affiliates,
including counsel thereto, in the investigation and defense of any lawsuit
against Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to which Seller retains
liability under the APA, including but not limited to the
federal investigation currently being conducted by the United States
Attorneys Office for the Western District of Tennessee and the United States
Department of Justice.



   9. | _Employee Access with Respect to Litigation Involving Purchaser_ 
---|--- 

Seller agrees that it will provide Purchaser reasonable access to Sellers
employees after the Closing and will not unreasonably restrict its employees
from reasonably cooperating with Purchaser and any of its Affiliates,
including counsel thereto, in support of any litigation-related efforts of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates related to the OrthoRecon Business.

 



   10. | _Access to Electronic Materials With Respect to the Defense of
Seller_ 
---|--- 

Purchaser agrees that it will provide Seller reasonable access to (including,
but not limited to, allowing Seller to image, copy, or search) all
electronically stored Books and Records in Purchasers IT environment and
will reasonably cooperate with Seller and any of its Affiliates, including
counsel thereto, at Sellers expense, in the investigation and defense of any
lawsuit against Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to which Seller
retains liability under the APA, including but not limited to the federal
investigation currently being conducted by the United States Attorneys Office
for the Western District of Tennessee and the United States Department of
Justice. 



   11. | _Access to Electronic Materials with Respect to Litigation
Involving Purchaser_ 
---|--- 

Seller agrees that it will provide Purchaser reasonable access to (including,
but not limited to allowing Purchaser to image, copy or search) all
electronically stored records in Sellers IT environment and will reasonably
cooperate with Purchaser and any of its Affiliates, including counsel thereto,
at Purchasers expense, in support of any litigation-related efforts of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates related to the OrthoRecon Business.



   12. | _No Other Changes_ 
---|--- 

Except to the extent amended, modified or clarified hereby, the provisions of
the APA shall be unchanged, and shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with the terms thereof. ---|--- 

If any provision or provisions of this Side Agreement shall be held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (a) the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Side Agreement
(including without limitation, each portion of any Section of this Side
Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not
in any way be affected or impaired thereby; (b) such provision or provisions
shall be deemed reformed to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law
and to give the maximum effect to the intent of the Parties hereto; and (c) to
the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Side Agreement
(including, without limitation, each portion of any Section of this Side
Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be
construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested thereby.



   14. | _Miscellaneous_ 
---|--- 

This Side Agreement shall be governed by, construed and enforced in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements as
if made and to be wholly performed within such state, without regard to any
choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the application
of the laws of any other jurisdiction. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Parties has caused this Side Agreement to be
executed on its behalf by its respective officer thereunto duly authorized as
of the date first written above.
