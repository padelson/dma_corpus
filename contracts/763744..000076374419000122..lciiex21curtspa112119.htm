STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

This STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made as of November 21,
2019, by and among Curt Acquisition Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company ("Seller"), Curt Acquisition Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), and Lippert Components, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Buyer"). Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein
have the meanings set forth in Article XI below.

WHEREAS, Seller owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock
(collectively, the "Shares") of the Company;

WHEREAS, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Buyer desires to purchase from Seller, and Seller desires to sell
to Buyer, all of the Shares; and

WHEREAS, the respective boards of managers or directors or other governing
bodies, as applicable, of Seller, the Company and Buyer have approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties, conditions and agreements contained herein and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:



Article I

PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES



1.01 Purchase and Sale of Shares. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller will sell, assign,
transfer and convey to Buyer, and Buyer will purchase and acquire from Seller,
free and clear of all Liens, all of the Shares owned by Seller in exchange for
the payment of the Estimated Purchase Price in cash to Seller. Payment for the
Shares will be made by wire transfer on the Closing Date of immediately
available funds to the Escrow and Paying Agent, and the Escrow and Paying
Agent will pay such cash to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated by Seller to the Escrow and Paying
Agent.



1.02 Calculation of Closing and Final Consideration.

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the "Purchase Price" means an amount equal
to:

(i) $340,000,000,

(ii) plus the total amount of Cash,

(iii) minus the outstanding amount of Indebtedness as of the Closing,

(iv) minus the unpaid Seller Transaction Expenses, (v) plus the amount, if any, by which the Net Working Capital exceeds the Net
Working Capital Target,

(vi) minus the amount, if any, by which the Net Working Capital is less than
the Net Working Capital Target, and

(vii) minus the Escrow Amounts.

(b) At least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company will
deliver to Buyer a statement (the "Estimated Closing Statement"), setting
forth in reasonable detail its good faith estimate of (i) Cash, (ii) the
outstanding amount of Indebtedness as of the Closing, (iii) unpaid Seller
Transaction Expenses, (iv) Net Working Capital, (v) the resulting calculation
of the Purchase Price (the "Estimated Purchase Price") and (vi) the name,
address and wire transfer information of each Person entitled to receive
payments with respect to Indebtedness or Seller Transaction Expenses. The
Estimated Closing Statement will be prepared in a manner that is consistent
with the definitions of the terms Cash, Indebtedness, Seller Transaction
Expenses, Net Working Capital and the Agreed Accounting Principles. The
Company will provide a reasonable level of supporting documentation for the
Estimated Purchase Price and any additional information in the Company\'s
possession that is reasonably requested by Buyer to verify the information set
forth in the Estimated Closing Statement prior to the Closing Date. If, prior
to the Closing Date, Buyer objects in writing to any item or the amount of an
estimate set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement, and, if the Company in
its sole discretion agrees with the objection, the Company will change the
applicable estimate and notify Buyer thereof on or prior to the Closing Date,
in which event the Estimated Closing Statement will be deemed amended to
reflect such change.

(c) Within 75 days after the Closing Date, Buyer will deliver to Seller (i) an
unaudited, consolidated balance sheet of the Acquired Companies as of the
Closing (which will have been prepared with the assistance of Buyer\'s or the
Company\'s accountants) (the "Closing Balance Sheet") and (ii) Buyer\'s
calculation of (A) Cash, (B) the outstanding amount of Indebtedness as of the
Closing, (C) unpaid Seller Transaction Expenses, (D) Net Working Capital and
(E) the resulting calculation of the Purchase Price (together, the "Closing
Statement"). The Closing Statement will be prepared in a manner consistent
with the definitions of the terms Cash, Indebtedness, Seller Transaction
Expenses, Net Working Capital and the Agreed Accounting Principles. The
Closing Statement will entirely disregard (x) any and all effects on the
assets or liabilities of the Acquired Companies as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby or of any financing or refinancing
arrangements entered into at any time by Buyer or any other transaction
entered into by Buyer in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (y) any of the plans, transactions, or changes which
Buyer intends to initiate or make or cause to be initiated or made after the
Closing with respect to the Acquired Companies or their business or assets or
any facts or circumstances that are unique or particular to Buyer or any of
its assets or liabilities. The Closing Statement will be based solely on facts
and circumstances as they exist as of the Closing and will exclude the effect
of any fact, event, change, circumstance, act, development or decision
occurring after the Closing. (d) Buyer will, and will cause the Acquired Companies to, (i) assist Seller
and its representatives in the review of the Closing Statement and provide
Seller and its representatives with reasonable access, upon reasonable advance
notice and during normal business hours, to the books, records (including work
papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents), supporting data and senior
employees of the Acquired Companies who were responsible for the preparation
of the Closing Statement for purposes of their review of the Closing
Statement, and (ii) reasonably cooperate with Seller and its representatives
in connection with such review, including providing on a timely basis all
other information necessary or useful in connection with the review of the
Closing Statement as is requested by Seller or its representatives. If Seller
has any objections to the Closing Statement, Seller will deliver to Buyer a
statement setting forth its objections thereto (an "Objections Statement"),
which statement will identify in reasonable detail those items and amounts to
which Seller objects (the "Disputed Items"). If an Objections Statement is not
delivered to Buyer within 45 days after delivery of the Closing Statement, the
Closing Statement as prepared by Buyer will be final, binding and non-
appealable by the parties hereto. Seller and Buyer will negotiate in good
faith to resolve the Disputed Items and all such discussions related thereto
will (unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and Seller) be governed by Rule 408 of
the Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar state rule, but if
they do not reach a final resolution within 30 days after the delivery of the
Objections Statement to Buyer, Seller and Buyer will jointly engage and submit
any unresolved Disputed Items to Duff and Phelps, or if such firm is unwilling
or unable to serve, such other independent national accounting, consulting or
valuation firm mutually agreeable to Buyer and Seller (the "Arbiter"). In the
event the parties submit any unresolved Disputed Items to the Arbiter, each
party will submit a Closing Statement (which in the case of each party may be
a Closing Statement that, with respect to the unresolved Disputed Items (but
not, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any other items), is
different than (but not more favorable to the submitting party than) the
Closing Statement initially submitted to Seller or the Objections Statement
delivered to Buyer, as applicable) together with such supporting documentation
as it deems appropriate, to the Arbiter within 10 days after the date on which
such unresolved Disputed Items were submitted to the Arbiter for resolution.
Seller and Buyer will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Arbiter to resolve such dispute as soon as practicable, but in any
event within 30 days after the date on which the Arbiter receives the Closing
Statements prepared by Seller and Buyer. Seller and Buyer will not engage in
any ex-parte communication with the Arbiter. In resolving any Disputed Item,
the Arbiter may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value
for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such
item claimed by either party. The determination of the Arbiter will be final,
binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto. Each party will bear its own
costs and expenses in connection with the resolution of such dispute by the
Arbiter. The costs and expenses of the Arbiter will be paid by Seller and
Buyer in proportion to the amount by which each party\'s position with respect
to all Disputed Items (as reflected in the Closing Statements delivered by the
parties to the Arbiter, as applicable) differed from the determination of the
Arbiter with respect to all Disputed Items.

(e) If the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to Section 1.02(d)
(the "Final Purchase Price") is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price,
then, within five Business Days after the determination of Final Purchase
Price, (i) Buyer will pay an amount equal to such excess to the Escrow and
Paying Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds, and the Escrow and Paying Agent will pay to Seller such excess by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by Seller to
the Escrow and Paying Agent, and (ii) Buyer and Seller will jointly instruct
the Escrow and Paying Agent to pay to Seller the Adjustment Escrow Funds, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, to an account or accounts
designated by Seller to the Escrow and Paying Agent. If the Final Purchase
Price equals the Estimated Purchase Price, then, within five Business Days
after determination of the Final Purchase Price, Buyer and Seller will jointly
instruct the Escrow and Paying Agent to pay to Seller, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the Adjustment Escrow Funds to an account or
accounts designated by Seller to the Escrow and Paying Agent.

(f) If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price,
then, within five Business Days after the determination of Final Purchase
Price, Buyer and Seller will jointly instruct the Escrow and Paying Agent to
pay (i) to Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount
equal to such shortfall from (and up to the amount of) the Adjustment Escrow
Funds, and (ii) to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
the remainder, if any, of the Adjustment Escrow Funds, to an account or
accounts designated by Seller to the Escrow and Paying Agent. If such
shortfall exceeds the amount of the Adjustment Escrow Funds, then, within five
Business Days after the determination of Final Purchase Price, Seller will pay
an amount equal to such excess to Buyer by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated by Buyer to Seller.

(g) All payments required pursuant to Section 1.02(e) and Section 1.02(f) will
be deemed to be adjustments for Tax purposes to the Purchase Price.

(h) This Section 1.02 is not intended to be used to adjust for errors or
omissions that may be found with respect to the Latest Balance Sheet, the
Closing Balance Sheet or any other balance sheet referenced in Section 4.05 or
any inconsistencies between the Latest Balance Sheet, the Closing Balance
Sheet or any other balance sheet referenced in Section 4.05 and GAAP.



1.03 The Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Closing") will take place remotely via the exchange of
documents and signatures on the second Business Day following satisfaction of
the conditions to the Closing set forth in Article II (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) or such
other date as Buyer and Seller may mutually agree. The date of the Closing is
herein referred to as the "Closing Date." The Closing will be deemed to occur
at 11:59 P.M. Eastern time on the Closing Date.



1.04 Withholding. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, any amounts payable in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby may be reduced by any Tax withholding that is required by Law, and any
amount so withheld and paid to the applicable Governmental Body will be
treated for all purposes hereof as having been paid to the Person with respect
to which the withholding was made. Except with respect to withholding pursuant
to Section 1445 of the Code and withholding with respect to any payment
treated as compensation, as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event
at least five Business Days prior to deducting or withholding from any consideration otherwise payable to Seller pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer
will notify Seller in writing of such intent to deduct and withhold and will
provide Seller with a reasonable opportunity to provide forms or other
evidence that would reduce such deduction or withholding. In the case of any
such payment treated as compensation, the parties will cooperate to pay such
amounts through the Acquired Companies\' payroll to facilitate applicable
withholding.

described on Schedule 4.09(a) (the "Real Property Leases") constitutes all of
the real property leased by the Acquired Companies. Schedule 4.09(a) sets

Acquired Company leases real property, including the applicable parties and
all amendments related thereto.

or other instrument granting to any other Person any right to the possession,
lease, occupancy or enjoyment of any portion of the Leased Real Property.
Except as set forth on Schedule 4.09(b), the Subleases are in full force and
effect, constitute the entire agreement between the parties thereto, and there
are no other agreements, whether oral or written, between such parties, and
each Acquired Company thereunder holds a valid and existing subleasehold
interest under each such Sublease. No Acquired Company is in default in any
material respect under any of the Subleases, has received any written notice
of any default from any counterparty thereto, or to the Company\'s knowledge,
is aware of an event that with notice or lapse of time, or both, would
constitute a material default by an Acquired Company under any of the
Subleases. No other party to any Sublease is in default under any of the
Subleases. No party to any Sublease has exercised any termination right with
respect thereto or repudiated any provision thereof and there is no dispute,
oral agreement or forbearance program in effect with respect to any Sublease.
The Company has delivered or made available to Buyer true, correct and
complete copies of each of the Subleases, and none of the Subleases has been
modified in any material respect, except to the extent that such modifications
are described on Schedule 4.09(b) and disclosed by the copies delivered or

such parties, and each Acquired Company holds a valid and existing leasehold
interest under each such Real Property Lease, subject to proper authorization
and execution of such lease by the other party and the application of any or creditor\'s rights laws. The Real Property Leases are not subject to any
Liens other than Permitted Liens. No Acquired Company is in default in any
material respect under any of the Real Property Leases, has received any
notice of any default from any counterparty thereto, or to the Company\'s
knowledge, is aware of an event that with notice or lapse of time, or both,
would constitute a material default by an Acquired Company under any of the
Real Property Leases. No other party to any Real Property Lease is in default
in any material respect under any of the Real Property Leases. No party to any
Real Property Lease has exercised any termination right with respect thereto
or repudiated any provision thereof and there is no dispute, oral agreement or
forbearance program in effect with respect to any Real Property Lease. The

Lease, none of the Leased Real Property has suffered any material damage by
fire or other casualty that has not been repaired and restored in all material
respects. Except as listed in Schedule 4.09(d): (i) no Acquired Company has
given any mortgagee or other Person any estoppel certificate or similar
instrument that would preclude assertion of any claim under any Real Property
Lease or Sublease, affect any right or obligation under any Real Property
Lease or Sublease or otherwise be binding upon any successor to the applicable
Acquired Company\'s position under any Real Property Lease or Sublease; (ii)

refusal, first option or other right held by any Acquired Company with respect
to, or any real estate or building affected by, any Real Property Lease or
Sublease that is not contained within such Real Property Lease or Sublease;

renew or extend or otherwise affect any right or obligation of the tenant
under any Real Property Lease or to purchase any Leased Real Property.

(e) The Company has delivered or made available to Buyer a true, correct and
complete copy of the Juarez Lease as described on Schedule 4.09(e), and to the
Company\'s knowledge, the Juarez Lease has not been modified in any material
respect. An Acquired Company is the guarantor of Tecma Mexico\'s leasehold
obligations under the Juarez Lease, subject to and upon the terms and
conditions of the Juarez Lease. Subject to proper authorization and execution
of the Juarez Lease by the other parties, to the Company\'s knowledge, (1) the
Juarez Lease is in full force and effect, and constitutes the entire agreement
between the parties thereto as it relates to the use and occupancy of the
Juarez Facility, and (2) there are no other agreements, whether oral or
written, between the Company, Vesta Baja California, S. de R.L. de C.V. and
Tecma Mexico. Tecma Mexico is not in default in any material respect under the
Juarez Lease. The Company has not received any notice of any written default
from any counterparty thereto, or to the Company\'s knowledge, is not aware of
an event that with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
material default by Tecma Mexico thereunder. The landlord under the Juarez Lease has not made or threatened in writing any claims against the
guaranty given by an Acquired Company under the Juarez Lease and, to the
Company\'s knowledge, the landlord is not in default in any material respect
under the Juarez Lease. The landlord under the Juarez Lease has not exercised
any termination right with respect thereto or repudiated any material
provision thereof and there is no material dispute, oral agreement or

and other improvements that are material to the conduct of the Acquired
Companies\' respective businesses in Mexico are included in the Juarez Lease.

enforceability or ownership of any Owned Intellectual Property. No written
claim has been received and, to the Company\'s knowledge, no proceeding has
been instituted or threatened in writing against any Acquired Company in which
such Acquired Company is alleged to infringe or misappropriate any
Intellectual Property of any third party. No unsolicited offer of license has
been received by the Acquired Companies with respect to any Intellectual
Property of a third party that would reasonably be interpreted as an assertion
of Intellectual Property rights.

(c) Each Acquired Company has taken commercially reasonable actions to protect
its Owned Intellectual Property, including to protect the secrecy of any trade
secrets, and to secure ownership of any Intellectual Property developed by
contractors for the Acquired Companies or developed by employees of the
Company in the scope of their employment, including causing each director,
officer, employee and independent contractor of each Acquired Company who has
contributed to the creation or development of any material Owned Intellectual
Property to execute and deliver to the Acquired Company an agreement assigning
all of their rights to such Owned Intellectual Property to the Acquired Company (other than non-assignable moral
rights and subject to statutory reversionary rights).

(d) The computers, computer networks, software and computer hardware and
communication and storage systems and services, databases, websites, content,
social media accounts, e-commerce platforms and associated documentation of
the Acquired Companies (the "Company Systems") are reasonably sufficient for
the needs of the business of the Acquired Companies as currently conducted.
The Company Systems have not suffered any material malfunction within the
prior two years, except such malfunctions that have been remediated in all
material respects. The Acquired Companies take commercially reasonable
precautions to protect the confidentiality, integrity, operation and security
of the Company Systems against any unauthorized use, access, interruption,
modification or corruption. In the past four (4) years, there have been no
material security breaches of the Company Systems that (1) required any notice
to any third party (including any Governmental Body) pursuant to any
applicable Laws or (2) caused a material loss or disruption to the Company or
its business operations.

(e) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.12(e), a privacy statement (the "Privacy
Statement") is posted on each website of the Acquired Companies. The Acquired
Companies comply in all material respects with (i) any Privacy Statement
applicable to any given set of personally identifiable information collected
by any Acquired Company; and (ii) all applicable Laws regarding the
collection, retention, use and disclosure of personally identifiable
information. The Acquired Companies have taken reasonable measures to protect
and maintain the confidential nature of the personally identifiable
information provided to the Acquired Companies by individuals and the personal
information collected from individuals by the Acquired Companies against loss,
theft and unauthorized access or disclosure, which measures are, as a whole,
not less protective and comprehensive than those that would be taken by
reasonably prudent business persons operating in the Acquired Companies\'
industry. The Acquired Companies have not received any written claims, notices
or complaints regarding their information practices or the disclosure,
retention, or misuse of any personally identifiable information by the Federal
Trade Commission or any other Governmental Body.



4.13 Litigation. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.13, there are no, and in
the past three years there have been no, material actions or proceedings
pending or, to the Company\'s knowledge, threatened against any Acquired
Company, at Law or in equity, or before or by any Governmental Body. No
Acquired Company is subject to or has, in the past three years, been subject
to any judgment, order or decree of any Governmental Body. To the Company\'s
knowledge, there are no, and in the past three years there have been no,
audits or investigations by a Governmental Body pending or threatened against
any Acquired Company.

jurisdiction outside the United States, or sponsored or maintained by a
Governmental Body.

(b) Each of the Pension Plans that is intended to be qualified under Section

Internal Revenue Service or is entitled to rely upon the favorable opinion or

Service, and no event has occurred since the date of the most recent letter to
any such Pension Plan that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect
the qualification of such Pension Plan.

the applicable requirements of the Code and ERISA (including all reporting and
disclosure requirements) and other applicable Laws.

examination by the IRS or the Department of Labor. There are no pending or, to

no Acquired Company has been in breach or default in any material respect with
respect to its obligations under any such insurance policies and no event has
occurred which, with notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such a
breach or default in any material respect, or permit termination, modification
or acceleration under such policies. Neither Seller nor any Affiliate of
Seller (including the Acquired Companies) has made any claim under any such
insurance policy with respect to which an insurer has, in a written notice to
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (including the Acquired Companies), denied
or disputed or otherwise reserved its rights with respect to such coverage
other than those claims noted in Schedule 4.15. Within the past three years no

7.01 Access to Books and Records. From and throughout the seven-year period
after the Closing, subject to reasonable confidentiality precautions, Buyer
will cause the Acquired Companies to provide Seller and its authorized
representatives with reasonable access (for the purpose of examining and
copying), upon reasonable advance notice, during normal business hours and at
Seller\'s expense, to the personnel, books and records of the Acquired
Companies with respect to periods or occurrences prior to or on the Closing
Date, as reasonably requested to (a) defend or pursue any legal proceeding,
(b) prepare or audit financial statements or to comply with other financial or
tax reporting obligations, (c) prepare, file or audit Tax Returns, (d) address
Tax, accounting or financial matters or respond to any investigation or other
inquiry by or under the control of any Governmental Body or (e) comply with
applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not be required to
disclose (or cause any of its Affiliates to disclose) any such information to
Seller or its representatives if such disclosure would be reasonably likely to
jeopardize any attorney client or other legal privilege or contravene any
applicable legal requirements, fiduciary duties or binding agreements;
provided that, to the extent Buyer withholds such information in accordance
with this sentence, it shall provide Seller with a detailed written
description of such information to the extent it can and shall use reasonable
best efforts to find a way to allow disclosure of such information. Buyer
shall cause the Acquired Companies to preserve and keep the records relating
to the Acquired Companies in accordance with Buyer\'s bona fide document
retention policies.



7.02 Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification.

(a) For a period of six years after the Closing, Buyer will not, and will not
permit any Acquired Company to, amend, repeal or modify any provision in any
Acquired Company\'s certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent
governing documents relating to the exculpation, indemnification or
advancement of expenses of any current and former officers, directors or
direct or indirect equityholders (each, a "DandO Indemnified Person") in a
manner that would be adverse to such former officers, directors or direct or
indirect equityholders (unless required by Law), it being the intent of the
parties that the DandO Indemnified Persons will continue to be entitled to such
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses to the full extent
required by the governing documents of the Acquired Companies in effect as of
the date hereof.

(b) At the Closing, Seller will, or will cause the Acquired Companies to,
obtain irrevocable "tail" insurance policies naming the DandO Indemnified
Persons as direct beneficiaries with a claims period of at least six years
from the Closing Date from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Acquired Companies\' current insurance carrier with respect to
directors\' liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable
as the Acquired Companies\' existing policies with respect to matters existing
or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date. The aggregate cost of such
"tail" insurance policies will be paid 50% by Buyer and 50% by Seller. Buyer
will, and will cause the Acquired Companies to, maintain such insurance
policies in effect without any lapse in coverage.

(c) Buyer hereby acknowledges (on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries) that
the DandO Indemnified Persons may have certain rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses or insurance provided by current equityholders or other Affiliates of Seller
or their respective equityholders ("Indemnitee Affiliates") separate from the
indemnification obligations of Buyer hereunder. The parties hereto agree that
(i) Buyer and the Company are the indemnitors of first resort (i.e., their
obligations to the DandO Indemnified Persons are primary and any obligation of
any Indemnitee Affiliate to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for
the same expenses or liabilities incurred by the DandO Indemnified Persons are
secondary), (ii) Buyer and the Company will be required to advance the full
amount of expenses incurred by the DandO Indemnified Persons to the extent
required under the Acquired Companies\' certificate of incorporation, bylaws
or other equivalent governing documents, and will be liable for the full
amount of all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in
settlement to the extent required by the Acquired Companies\' certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent governing documents, without regard
to any rights the DandO Indemnified Persons may have against any Indemnitee
Affiliate, and (iii) Buyer and the Company (on behalf of themselves and their
respective Subsidiaries) irrevocably waive, relinquish and release the
Indemnitee Affiliates from any and all claims against the Indemnitee
Affiliates for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in
respect thereof.



7.03 Regulatory Filings.

(a) Buyer will, within five Business Days after the date hereof, make or cause
to be made all filings and submissions under any Laws or regulations
applicable to Buyer and its Affiliates for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein and, in each case, include in each filing or
submission a request for early termination or acceleration of any applicable
waiting or review periods, to the extent available under the applicable Laws.
Buyer will pay all fees associated with all filings and submissions referred
to in this Section 7.03(a).

(b) Buyer will comply with any additional requests for information, including
requests for production of documents and production of witnesses for
interviews or depositions by any Governmental Body. Buyer agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to take any and all steps necessary to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Body or any other Person so as to enable the parties to
expeditiously close the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case, to the
minimum extent necessary to so close such transactions; provided, however,
that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in no event shall Buyer be obligated to (i) propose, negotiate,
effect or agree to or enter into consent decrees or submit orders providing
for (A) the sale, divestiture, license, disposition or holding separate
(through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any assets, categories
of assets, or businesses of Buyer or any of its Affiliates, (B) the imposition
of any limitation or regulation on the ability of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates to freely conduct their business or own such assets, or (C) the
holding separate of the Shares of the Acquired Companies or any limitation or
regulation on the ability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates to exercise full
rights of ownership of the Shares of the Acquired Companies, other than, in
the case of clauses (A), (B) or (C) above, for any such sale, divestiture,
license, disposition, holding separate, limitation or regulation that would be
immaterial to the Buyer and its Affiliates, taken as a whole, and/or the
Acquired Companies, taken as a whole or (ii) initiate or defend against any suit, proceeding, claim, decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary, or permanent, with respect to or against any
Governmental Body or other Person in connection with its efforts to obtain any
required consent.

(c) Except as specifically required by this Agreement, Buyer will not take any
action, or refrain from taking any action, the effect of which would
reasonably be expected to delay or impede the ability of the parties hereto to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Buyer will not, and will not permit any of its
Affiliates to, acquire or agree to acquire (by merging or consolidating with,
or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by
any other manner), any Person or portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or
agree to acquire any assets, if the entering into a definitive agreement
relating to, or the consummation of, such acquisition, merger or consolidation
would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any material delay in the obtaining
of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any permits, orders or
other approvals of any Governmental Body necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period, (ii) materially increase the risk of any
Governmental Body entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) materially increase the risk of not
being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise, or (iv) materially
delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) Buyer will keep the Company apprised of the status of all filings and
submissions referred to in Section 7.03(a) above, including promptly
furnishing the Company with copies of notices or other communications received
by Buyer in connection therewith, redacted as necessary to protect legal
privilege and confidential information. Buyer will not permit any of its
officers, employees or other representatives or agents to participate in any
substantive meeting with any Governmental Body in respect of such filings and
submissions unless it consults with the Company in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Body, gives the Company the opportunity to
attend and participate in any such meetings.



7.04 Conditions. Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
conditions set forth in Section 2.03 to be satisfied and to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein as soon as reasonably possible after the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article II (other than those to be
satisfied at the Closing).



7.05 Contact with Customers, Suppliers and Other Business Relations. Prior to
the Closing, Buyer and Buyer\'s Representatives will not contact or
communicate with the employees, customers, suppliers and other business
relations of the Acquired Companies in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby without prior consultation with and written approval of
the Company and Seller (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). The foregoing shall not be deemed to restrict
communications in the ordinary course of business unrelated to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 7.06 Payment of Indebtedness and Seller Transaction Expenses. Buyer will
repay, or cause to be repaid, all amounts necessary to discharge fully the
then outstanding balance of all Indebtedness identified on Schedule
2.02(e)(iii) and Seller Transaction Expenses identified on the Estimated
Closing Statement, in each case, (a) to the account(s) designated by each
Person to whom such amounts are to be paid, and (b) to the extent taken into
account in connection with the calculation of the Final Purchase Price.



ARTICLE VIII

TERMINATION



8.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:

(a) by the mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller;

(b) by Buyer, if there has been a violation or breach by the Company or Seller
of any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement which would prevent the satisfaction of any condition to the
obligations of Buyer at the Closing and such violation or breach has not been
waived by Buyer or, in the case of a covenant or agreement breach, cured by
the Company or Seller, as applicable, within 10 days after written notice
thereof from Buyer;

(c) by Seller, if there has been a violation or breach by Buyer of any
covenant, agreement, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement
which would prevent the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of
the Company and Seller at the Closing and such violation or breach has not
been waived by Seller or, in the case of a covenant or agreement breach, cured
by Buyer within 10 days after written notice thereof by Seller (provided that
neither a breach by Buyer of Section 5.08 nor the failure to deliver the full
consideration payable pursuant to Article I under this Agreement at the
Closing as required hereunder will be subject to cure hereunder unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by Seller);

(d) by either Buyer or Seller if the transactions contemplated hereby have not
been consummated by 5:00 P.M. Eastern time on the date that is 90 days after
the date hereof; provided that neither Buyer nor Seller will be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(d) if such Person\'s
breach of this Agreement has prevented the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; or

(e) by either Buyer or Seller if any Governmental Body shall have issued an
order, decree or ruling or taken any other action enjoining, restraining or
otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such
order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and
nonappealable.



8.02 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
by either Buyer or Seller as provided above, the provisions of this Agreement
will immediately become void and of no further force or effect (other than this Section 8.02 and Article XII hereof
which will survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with their
terms; provided, however, that the Confidentiality Agreement, dated May 1,
2018, between Buyer and Curt Manufacturing, LLC (the "Confidentiality
Agreement") will survive the termination of this Agreement for a period of
three years following the date of such termination (and, notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement to the
contrary, the Confidentiality Agreement term will be automatically amended to
be extended for such additional three year period)), and there will be no
liability on the part of any of the parties to one another, except for Fraud
or Willful Breaches of the covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement prior to the time of such termination. Without limiting the
foregoing, a breach by Buyer of Section 5.08 will be considered a Willful
Breach by Buyer of this Agreement. Nothing in this Article VIII will be deemed
to impair the right of any party to compel specific performance by another
party of its obligations under this Agreement. Any claim which the Company or
Seller may have in connection with a termination of this Agreement will be
enforceable by the Company or Seller for the benefit of all such Persons.



ARTICLE IX

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS



9.01 [Tax Matters.

(a) Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns.

(i) Buyer will, at its own cost, prepare or cause to be prepared, and timely
file or cause to be timely filed, all Tax Returns for the Acquired Companies
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period the due date of which
(taking into account extensions of time to file) is after the Closing Date but
only if not filed prior to the Closing. Buyer will timely pay, or cause to be
timely paid, any amount shown as due on such Tax Returns, provided that such
payment will not void any of Seller\'s indemnification obligations pursuant to
Article X. All such Tax Returns that are with respect to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods will be prepared in a manner consistent with the past custom and
practice of the Acquired Companies, unless otherwise required by applicable
Law; provided that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, all
Transaction Tax Deductions will be deducted on the income Tax Returns of the
Company for the taxable period that ends on the Closing Date and the Company
will make the safe harbor election under Revenue Procedure 2011-29. At least
30 days prior to the date on which each Tax Return is due, Buyer will submit a
copy of such Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period Tax Return to Seller
for Seller to review and comment, and shall consider in good faith any
comments made by Seller.

(ii) For the portion of the day of the Closing after the time of Closing,
other than the transactions expressly contemplated hereby, Buyer will cause
the Acquired Companies to carry on their business only in the ordinary course
in the same manner as heretofore conducted and will not convert or otherwise
change the form of any of the Acquired Companies under applicable state, local
or foreign Law. The Acquired Companies will elect with the relevant taxing authority to treat for all
purposes the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period of the Acquired
Companies to the extent such election is permissible under applicable Law. The
parties agree that the Buyer and its Affiliates and the Acquired Companies
will not make an election under Treasury Regulation §1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(D) to
ratably allocate items (or make any similar election or ratably allocate items
under any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign Law). If
applicable Law does not permit any Acquired Company to close its Tax period at
the Closing Date, (A) the amount of Taxes or Tax refunds that are based on or
measured by income, receipts, sales or payroll allocable to the portion of
such period ending at the Closing Date shall be deemed equal to the amount
that would be payable or received if the relevant taxable period ended at the
end of the day on the Closing Date, determined on a closing of the books
methodology at the Closing Date (and for such purpose the tax year of any
Subsidiary of the Company that is a partnership or is organized outside of the
United States shall also be deemed to end at the end of the day on the Closing
Date) and (B) the amount of any other Taxes allocable to the portion of such
period ending at the end of the day on the Closing Date shall be the amount of
such Taxes or Tax refunds for the entire period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the period ending on and including
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
entire period. Any allocation of income or deductions required to determine
any Income Taxes relating to such period shall be taken into account as though
the relevant taxable period ended at the end of the day on the Closing Date
and by means of a closing of the books and records of the Acquired Company at
the Closing date; provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization
deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending at the Closing Date
and the period after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in
each such period.

(iii) Any refunds paid or credited to the Acquired Companies with respect to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be the property of Buyer.

(b) Books and Records; Cooperation. Without limiting Section 9.02, each party
will, and will cause its representatives to, provide each other party and its
representatives with such assistance as may be reasonably requested in
connection with the review of any Tax Return, including the filing of any
claim for refund to which Seller is entitled hereunder, or any audit or other
examination by any taxing authority or judicial or administrative proceeding
relating to Taxes with respect to any Acquired Company.

(c) Transfer Taxes. Buyer and Seller will each pay one-half of any real
property transfer or gains tax, stamp tax, stock transfer tax, or other
similar Tax imposed on any Acquired Company or Seller as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, "Transfer Taxes"),
and any penalties, interest or additions to Tax with respect to the Transfer
Taxes. Seller agrees to cooperate with Buyer in the filing of any returns with
respect to the Transfer Taxes, including promptly supplying any information in
its possession that is reasonably necessary to complete such returns. Within
five (5) Business Days of notice thereof, Seller will pay to Buyer its
allocable share of any Transfer Taxes. (d) Tax Elections. Buyer will not make any election under Code Section 338 or
Section 336 (or any similar provisions under state, local, or foreign Law)
with respect to the acquisition of the Acquired Companies.

(e) Amended Tax Returns; Tax Elections. Unless otherwise required by
applicable Law, Buyer will not cause or permit the Acquired Companies or any
of their Affiliates to (i) file, amend or otherwise modify any Tax Return that
relates in whole or in part to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than to file
Tax Returns in accordance with Section 9.01(a), (ii) make or change any
election for, or that has retroactive effect to, any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
(iii) voluntarily approach any Tax authority with respect to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period or Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or (iv) extent or
waive the statute of limitations with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
in each case without the written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(f) Tax Contests. Buyer will promptly notify Seller, and in any event within
ten (10) days after receipt by Buyer, any Acquired Company or any Affiliate,
of written notice of any pending federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax audit
or examination or notice of deficiency or other adjustment, assessment or
redetermination relating to Taxes that could give rise to an indemnification
obligation by Seller under this Agreement ("Tax Contest"); provided, however,
that no delay or failure of Buyer to give timely notice under this Section
9.01(f) will affect Buyer\'s rights to indemnification under this Agreement,
except to the extent Seller is actually prejudiced by such delay or failure.
Subject to the rights of the insurer pursuant to the RandW Policy and the
limitations set forth in Sections 10.07(b)(1), (2) and (3), mutatis mutandis,
Seller will have the right to elect to control the contest or resolution of
any Tax Contest with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns for any Pre-Closing Tax
Periods; provided, that (i) Seller provides written notice of its election
within ten (10) days after becoming aware of the commencement of such Tax
Contest, (ii) Buyer will have the right to employ advisors or its choice (at
Buyer\'s expense), directly or through designated representatives, to review
in advance and reasonably comment upon material submissions made in the course
of such Tax Contest and to attend any material in-person or telephonic
meetings and (iii) Buyer\'s consent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) will be required for any settlement of such Tax
Contest. With respect to all Tax Contests that Seller does not elect to
control pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, Buyer will have the
sole responsibility for, and will control, such Tax Contest, including the
disposition thereof; provided, that (x) Seller will have the right to employ
advisors or its choice (at Seller\'s expense), directly or through designated
representatives, to review in advance and reasonably comment upon material
submissions made in the course of such Tax Contest and to attend any material
in-person or telephonic meetings, (y) Buyer will diligently pursue such Tax
Contest in good faith as if it were the sole party in interest and (z)
Seller\'s consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
will be required for any settlement of such Tax Contest to the extent such
settlement relates to Taxes that will give rise to an indemnification
obligation by Seller under this Agreement (after taking into account the
Deductible or any other limitation hereunder and proceeds reasonable expected
to be received under the RandW Policy). To the extent there is a conflict
between the provisions of this Section 9.01(f) and Section 10.07 with respect
to any Third Party Claim related to Taxes or Tax Returns, this Section 9.01(f)
will govern. 9.02 Further Assurances. From time to time, as and when requested by any party
hereto and at such requesting party\'s expense, any other party will execute
and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and
instruments and will take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other
actions as such requesting party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to
evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



9.03 Access to Books and Records. From and throughout the seven-year period
after the Closing, subject to reasonable confidentiality precautions, Seller
will provide Buyer and its authorized representatives with reasonable access
(for the purpose of examining and copying), upon reasonable advance notice,
during normal business hours and at Buyer\'s expense, to books and records of
Seller and its Affiliates concerning the Acquired Companies with respect to
periods or occurrences prior to or on the Closing Date, as reasonably
necessary to (a) defend or pursue any legal proceeding, (b) prepare or audit
financial statements, (c) prepare or file Tax Returns or (d) address Tax,
accounting or financial matters or respond to any investigation or other
inquiry by or under the control of any Governmental Body. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller shall not be required to disclose (or cause any of its
Affiliates to disclose) any information to Buyer or its representatives if
such disclosure would be reasonably likely to jeopardize any attorney client
or other legal privilege or contravene any applicable legal requirements,
fiduciary duties or binding agreements.



9.04 Data Room Documentation. As promptly as practicable, and in any event
within five Business Days after the Closing Date, Seller will, at its expense,
authorize and instruct IntraLinks to copy to a suitable electronic medium all
documents posted to the data room hosted by it as of the Closing Date in the
same order and manner as such documents are set forth in such data room and
deliver one such copy to Buyer.

matter is finally terminated or otherwise resolved under this Agreement or by
a court of competent jurisdiction, and any amounts payable under this
Agreement are finally determined and paid. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, claims for Fraud on the part of any party to this Agreement

indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates and their respective
representatives, stockholders, members, controlling persons, directors,

or complied with after the Closing) or Buyer.



10.04 Limitations.

(a) No claim for indemnification may be made under Section 10.02(a) until the
cumulative total of all Damages claimed by the Buyer Indemnified Parties under
Section 10.02(a) exceeds $1,275,000 (the "Deductible"), in which case the
Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover only Damages in excess
of the Deductible; provided, however, that the Deductible shall not apply to
any claim (i) based on Fraud or (ii) for breach of any Fundamental
Representation or the representations and warranties set forth in Section (b) The aggregate liability of Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the
other hand, under this Article X will not exceed an amount equal to the

(c) All indemnification payments payable hereunder shall be reduced by the
amount of insurance proceeds (after deducting related costs and expenses,
including any deductible amount and any resultant increase in insurance
premiums) actually received by the Indemnified Party as a result of the
Damages for which the Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification, including
under the RandW Policy, and any other indemnity, reimbursement arrangement or
contract pursuant to or under which such Indemnified Party or such Indemnified
Party\'s Affiliates is a party or has rights (collectively, "Alternative

representatives to, use commercially reasonable efforts to seek full recovery
under any Alternative Arrangement. In the event that an insurance or other
recovery is made by Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, with
respect to any Damages for which any such Person has been indemnified
hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery (if and
to the extent such amount of recovery would have reduced the amount to which
such Person would have been entitled to pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 10.04(c)) shall be made promptly to the applicable Indemnifying Party.

(d) For purposes of this Article X, Damages shall not include punitive or
special damages, except to the extent awarded in a Third-Party Claim. In
addition, in no event will the Buyer Indemnified Parties be entitled to
recover for any Damages that represent general and administrative time or

rule-making decision.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this
Article X for (i) (A) any amount of Indebtedness, (B) any amount of Seller

any matter to the extent, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, that the Buyer
Indemnified Party has been otherwise specifically compensated for such matter
pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) Damages attributable to Taxes of Buyer, the
Acquired Companies or any Affiliate thereof (x) for any taxable period (or
portion thereof) that is not a Pre-Closing Tax Period (except to the extent
such Damages relate to a breach by the Company of any representation or
warranty set forth in Section 4.10(i), (j) or (l)), (y) resulting from any
event or transaction undertaken on the Closing Date or after the Closing
outside of the ordinary course of business or (z) as a result of Buyer\'s
financing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (iv) Damages attributable to a
breach by Buyer of any covenant in this Agreement.

(f) For purposes of Section 10.02(a), other than with respect to the
representations and warranties contained in the first sentence of Section
4.06, in determining (i) whether a breach of a representation or warranty has
occurred and (ii) the amount of Damages arising out of or resulting from a
breach of a representation or warranty, all qualifications as to materiality,
Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifications will be ignored and each
such representation and warranty will be read and interpreted without regard
to any such qualifications.



10.05 Sources of Recovery; Exclusive Remedy.

(a) The recourse for claims by a Buyer Indemnified Party under Section 10.02
shall be solely, (i) first, to the extent coverage is available thereunder, to
the RandW Policy, (ii) second, to the Indemnity Escrow Funds (solely in the case
of claims under Sections 10.02(a) through (d)) or the Special Escrow Funds
(solely in the case of claims under Section 10.02(e)) and (iii) thereafter,
solely with respect to claims (A) based on Fraud, or (B) for breach of any
Fundamental Representation, to Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuing
coverage under the RandW Policy is not a condition to a Buyer Indemnified Party
submitting a Notice of Claim and tolling the survival period with respect to
such claims.

(b) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing, excluding
(i) any claim for Fraud, (ii) claims for equitable relief as expressly set
forth in this Agreement, or (iii) any post-Closing adjustment to the Purchase
Price pursuant to Section 1.02, the Buyer Indemnified Parties\' sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, regardless of the legal theory under
which such liability or obligation may be sought to be imposed, whether
sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity, or otherwise,
will be for breach of contract only (as such contractual remedies have been
further limited or excluded pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement)
as provided in this Article X.

(a) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Buyer Indemnified Parties may not
avoid such limitation on liability by (i) seeking damages for breach of
contract, tort or pursuant to any other theory of liability, all of which are
hereby waived or (ii) asserting or threatening any claim against any Person
that is not a party hereto (or a successor to a party hereto) for breaches of
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement.

(b) Each of the Buyer Indemnified Parties expressly waives all rights afforded
by any statute which limits the effect of a release with respect to unknown
claims, including Section 1542 and any comparable statutes. Each Buyer
Indemnified Party has read Section 1542, which provides as follows:

A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH
THE DEBTOR.

(c) Each Buyer Indemnified Party understands that Section 1542, or a
comparable statute, rule, regulation or order of another jurisdiction, gives
him, her or it the right not to release existing claims of which he, she or it
is not aware, unless he, she or it voluntarily chooses to waive this right.
Having been so apprised, each Buyer Indemnified Party nevertheless hereby
voluntarily elects to and does waive the rights described in Section 1542, or
such other comparable statute, rule, regulation or order, and elects to assume
all risks for claims that exist, existed or may hereafter exist in his, her or
its favor, known or unknown, arising out of or related to liabilities arising
from any claims or other matters purported to be released pursuant to this
release. Each of the Buyer Indemnified Parties understands the significance of
this release of unknown claims and waiver of statutory protection against a
release of unknown claims and acknowledges and agrees that this waiver is an
essential and material term of this Agreement.

(c) The parties hereto agree that the provisions in this Agreement relating to
indemnification, and the limits imposed on Buyer's remedies with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including Section
10.02) were specifically bargained for between sophisticated parties and were
specifically taken into account in the determination of the amounts to be paid
to Seller hereunder.



10.06 Procedure for Making Claims. This Section 10.06 is subject to Section
10.07. If and when an Indemnified Party desires to assert a claim for
indemnifiable Damages against an Indemnifying Party pursuant to the provisions
of this Article X, the Indemnified Party shall deliver a notice (a "Notice of
Claim") to the Indemnifying Party reasonably promptly after the Indemnified
Party\'s receipt of a claim or awareness of a potential claim; provided,
however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying any
Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation
hereunder, except to the extent the applicable Indemnifying Parties are
actually prejudiced by such delay or failure. Each Notice of Claim shall
describe in reasonable detail the nature of the claim and provide an estimate
of the amount of Damages claimed in connection with such claim (to the extent
then reasonably estimable).



10.07 Procedure for Indemnification - Third-Party Claims.

(a) If any third party shall notify any Indemnified Party of a Third-Party
Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver the Notice of Claim
described in Section 10.06, including (i) a description of such Third-Party
Claim describing in reasonable detail, to the extent known by the Indemnified
Party, the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such
Third-Party Claim; and (ii) an estimate of the amount of Damages claimed in
connection with such claim (to the extent then reasonably estimable);
provided, however, that no delay or failure of any Indemnified Party to give
timely notice hereunder will affect such Indemnified Party\'s rights to indemnification hereunder, except to the extent such delay
or failure actually prejudices the Indemnifying Party\'s ability to defend
such Third-Party Claim.

(b) The Indemnifying Party may, subject to the rights of the insurer pursuant
to the RandW Policy, elect to assume, conduct and have sole control over the
defense of the Third-Party Claim at its sole cost and expense and with counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party to defend such Third-Party
Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party of its
election to defend such Third-Party Claim within 20 days after the Indemnified
Party\'s delivery of the Notice of Claim. The Indemnified Party shall promptly
make available to the Indemnifying Party or its authorized representatives all
personnel and all records and other materials in the Indemnified Party\'s
possession reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party for its use in
defending any Third-Party Claim. Once the Indemnifying Party has duly assumed
the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to participate in any such defense and to
employ separate counsel of its choosing. The Indemnified Party shall
participate in any such defense at its expense. The Indemnifying Party may
negotiate a settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of an order
with respect to, such Third-Party Claim; provided, that the Indemnifying Party
shall not settle or compromise any such Third-Party Claim without the prior
written approval of the Indemnified Party, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, if (A) such settlement,
compromise or consent in respect of such Third-Party Claim does not include a
full, complete and unconditional waiver and release by such third party of all
applicable Indemnified Parties for any and all Damages with respect to such
Third-Party Claim, (B) such settlement, compromise or consent imposes a Lien
on any of the assets of any such Indemnified Party or (C) such settlement,
compromise or consent provides for relief other than money damages that will
be indemnified pursuant to this Article X by the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party fails to assume the primary defense of any such Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party may defend, settle or compromise such Third-Party
Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Third-Party Claim (1) seeks relief
other than primarily the payment of monetary damages that would reasonably be
expected to result in the imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree
that would restrict in any material respect the future activity or conduct of
the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (2) seeks a finding or
admission that the Indemnified Party committed a criminal act or (3) involves
Damages related to or arising out of such Third-Party Claim that would
reasonably be expected to be paid by the Indemnified Party that exceed the
portion of the Damages that are indemnifiable by the Indemnifying Party as of
such date (after taking into account the Deductible or any other limitations
hereunder and proceeds reasonably expected to be received under the RandW
Policy), then, in each such case, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
contest, defend, compromise, settle (subject, with respect to any settlement,
to obtaining the consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) such Third-Party Claim in the
first instance (with the Indemnifying Party having the right, but not the
obligation, to participate in any such defense and to employ separate counsel
of its choosing and at its own expense) and, if the Indemnified Party does not
contest, defend, compromise or settle such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall then have the right to contest, defend and settle (but subject,
with respect to any settlement, to obtaining the consent of the Indemnified
Party\'s, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) such Third-Party Claim. (c) The parties shall cooperate with each other fully and in good faith with
respect to the defense, settlement, negotiation or compromise of any Third-
Party Claims.



10.08 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification payments
under this Article X shall be deemed adjustments to the Purchase Price to the
extent permitted by applicable Law. No party shall (nor shall they permit
their Affiliates to) take any position on any Tax Return that is inconsistent
with such treatment.



10.09 Mitigation. Each Indemnified Party will use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate all Damages after becoming aware of any event which could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any Damages that are indemnifiable or
recoverable hereunder or in connection herewith.

other forms and media for the sole purpose of describing the prior ownership
of, or Audax\' and any of its Affiliates\' current or former interest in, the
Acquired Companies and the associated businesses. For the avoidance of doubt,

binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned or delegated by any party hereto without the prior written consent of
the other parties hereto; provided that, (a) after the Closing, Seller may

written notice thereof to Seller; provided, further, that no assignment will
relieve any party of its obligations hereunder.



12.06 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable Law, such provision will be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement, and the
parties will amend or otherwise modify this Agreement to replace any
prohibited or invalid provision with an effective and valid provision that
gives effect to the intent of the parties to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Law.



12.07 No Strict Construction. The language used in this Agreement will be
deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual
intent, and no rule of strict construction will be applied against any Person.
The Disclosure Schedules have been arranged for purposes of convenience in
separately numbered sections corresponding to sections of this Agreement;
provided however, each section of the Disclosure Schedules will be deemed to
incorporate by reference all information disclosed in any other section of the
Disclosure Schedules to the extent reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure. Capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedules and not
otherwise defined therein have the meanings given to them in this Agreement.
The specification of any dollar amount or the inclusion of any item in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the Disclosure
Schedules or Exhibits is not intended to imply that the amounts, or higher or
lower amounts, or the items so included, or other items, are or are not
required to be disclosed (including whether such amounts or items are required
to be disclosed as material or threatened) or are within or outside of the
ordinary course of business, and no party will use the fact of the setting of
the amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any item in this Agreement or the
Disclosure Schedules or Exhibits in any dispute or controversy between the
parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described or included
in this Agreement or in any Disclosure Schedule or Exhibit is or is not
required to be disclosed (including whether the amount or items are required
to be disclosed as material or threatened) or is within or outside of the
ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement. The information
contained in this Agreement and in the Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of
this Agreement, and no information contained herein or therein will be deemed
to be an admission by any party hereto to any third party of any matter
whatsoever (including any violation of Law or breach of contract).



12.08 Amendment and Waiver. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or
waived only in a writing signed by Buyer, the Company and Seller; provided
that (a) Section 7.02 will not be amended or waived without the consent of a
majority of the DandO Indemnified Persons and (b) Section 12.01 will not be

(including the Confidentiality Agreement) contain the complete agreement by,
between and among the parties and supersede any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by, between or among the parties, written or
oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way. The
parties agree that prior drafts of this Agreement and of any provision herein
will be deemed to not provide any evidence as to the meaning of any provision
hereof or the intent of the parties with respect hereto and that such drafts
will be deemed joint work product of the parties. The parties hereto have
voluntarily agreed to define their rights, liabilities and obligations
respecting the sale and purchase of the Company exclusively in contract
pursuant to the express terms and provisions of this Agreement; and the
parties hereto expressly disclaim that they are owed any duties or are
entitled to any remedies not expressly set forth in this Agreement.
Furthermore, the parties each hereby acknowledge that this Agreement embodies
the justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties derived from
arm\'s-length negotiations; all parties to this Agreement specifically
acknowledge that no party has any special relationship with another party that
would justify any expectation beyond that of an ordinary buyer and an ordinary
seller in an arm\'s-length transaction.



12.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts
(including by means of telecopied signature pages or electronic transmission
in portable document format (pdf)), any one of which need not contain the
signatures of more than one party, but all such counterparts taken together
will constitute one and the same instrument.

(whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of
or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with
this Agreement) will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements executed and

SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN

(a) Except for disputes, controversies or claims arising under Section 1.02
(which will be resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions
set forth therein) or other claims seeking injunctive relief (for which the
provisions of Section 12.12, Section 12.13 and Section 12.19 will be
applicable), all disputes, controversies or claims arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (whether in
contract, tort, equity or otherwise), including the arbitrability of any
dispute or controversy that cannot be settled by mutual agreement will be
finally settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the JAMS
Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("JAMS"), subject to the
provisions in this Section 12.14. (b) Any party hereto aggrieved will deliver a notice to the other party
setting forth the specific points in dispute. Any points remaining in dispute
20 days after the giving of such notice may, upon 10 days\' notice to the
other party, be submitted to JAMS arbitration conducted before a panel of
three arbitrators in Chicago, Illinois. Buyer and the Seller will each appoint
one arbitrator (the "Party-Appointed Arbitrators") and the Party-Appointed
Arbitrators will appoint the third and presiding arbitrator within 14 days of
the appointment of the second arbitrator; provided, that, any arbitrator not
timely appointed herein will be appointed by JAMS upon the written demand of
any party to the dispute. The arbitrators may enter a default decision against
any party who fails to participate in the arbitration proceedings.

(c) The parties to any arbitration proceedings under this Section 12.14 will
be entitled to depose any witness identified as testifying at such
proceedings.

(d) The parties hereby agree to the JAMS Optional Arbitration Appeal
Procedures. Subject to the foregoing, the decision of the arbitrators on the
points in dispute will be final, unappealable and binding, and judgment on the
award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The parties
will instruct the arbitrators to provide a full, reasoned opinion in rendering
their decisions. The arbitrators will only be authorized to interpret the
provisions of this Agreement, and will not amend, change or add to any such
provisions. The parties hereto agree that this provision has been adopted by
the parties to rapidly and inexpensively resolve any disputes between them and
that this provision will be grounds for dismissal of any court action
commenced by any party with respect to this Agreement (other than disputes,
controversies or claims arising under Section 1.02 (which will be resolved in
accordance with the dispute resolution provisions set forth therein) or other
claims seeking injunctive relief (for which the provisions of Section 12.12,
Section 12.13 and Section 12.19 will be applicable)). In the event that any
court determines that this arbitration procedure is not binding, or otherwise
allows any litigation regarding a dispute, claim, or controversy covered by
this Agreement to proceed, the parties hereto hereby waive any and all right
to a trial by jury in or with respect to such litigation.

(e) The arbitrators will be authorized to apportion their fees and expenses as
the arbitrators deem appropriate but the arbitrators will not be authorized to
award the prevailing party its fees and expenses (including attorneys\' fees),
and each party will otherwise bear its own fees and expenses, including the
fees of its own attorney.

(f) The parties hereto and the arbitrators will keep confidential, and will
not disclose to any person, except the parties\' advisors and legal
representatives, or as may be required by law, the existence of any
controversy under this Section 12.14, the referral of any such controversy to
arbitration or the status or resolution thereof.

(g) The parties hereto may seek any interim or conservatory relief, including
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; provided, however, that if such
court does not have jurisdiction over any such action or proceeding, such
action or proceeding will be heard and determined exclusively in any Delaware
state or federal court sitting in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in
equity. The application of a party to an above-mentioned judicial authority for such measures or for the
implementation of any such measures ordered by an arbitral tribunal will not
be deemed to be an infringement or a waiver of Section 12.14 and will not
affect the relevant powers reserved to the arbitral tribunal.



12.15 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Section 12.01 and Section 7.02 (and
Section 12.08 as it relates to each such Section) of this Agreement are
intended for the benefit of Audax and the DandO Indemnified Persons,
respectively. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, nothing expressed
or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other
than the parties to this Agreement and Audax and the DandO Indemnified Persons
any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or with respect to this
Agreement or any provision of this Agreement.



12.16 Representation of Seller and its Affiliates. Buyer agrees, on its own
behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Related Parties, that (a) one or more of the
Acquired Companies and Seller (and its controlling Affiliate) have retained
Kirkland and Ellis LLP and Fredrikson and Byron, P.A. to act as their counsel in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as well as
other past matters, (b) Kirkland and Ellis LLP and Fredrikson and Byron, P.A. have
not acted as counsel for any other Person in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and no Person other than the Acquired Companies
and Seller (and its controlling Affiliate) has the status of a Kirkland and
Ellis LLP or Fredrikson and Byron, P.A. client for conflict of interest or any
other purpose as a result thereof, and (c) following the Closing, Kirkland and
Ellis LLP or Fredrikson and Byron, P.A. may serve as counsel to Seller and its
Affiliates in connection with any matters related to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including any litigation, claim or
obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding any representation by Kirkland
and Ellis LLP or Fredrikson and Byron, P.A. prior to the Closing Date of any
Acquired Company. Buyer and the Company (on behalf of itself and its
Subsidiaries) hereby (i) waive any claim they have or may have that Kirkland and
Ellis LLP or Fredrikson and Byron, P.A. has a conflict of interest or is
otherwise prohibited from engaging in such representation and (ii) agree that,
in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing between Buyer or any
Acquired Company and Seller or any of its Affiliates, Kirkland and Ellis LLP or
Fredrikson and Byron, P.A. may represent Seller or any of its Affiliates in such
dispute even though the interests of such Person(s) may be directly adverse to
Buyer or any Acquired Company and even though Kirkland and Ellis LLP or
Fredrikson and Byron, P.A. may have represented an Acquired Company or other
Persons in a matter substantially related to such dispute and may be handling
other ongoing matters for a Buyer Related Party, the Company, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries. Buyer represents that Buyer\'s own attorney has
explained and helped Buyer evaluate the implications and risks of waiving the
right to assert a future conflict against Kirkland and Ellis LLP or Fredrikson and
Byron, P.A., and Buyer\'s consent with respect to this waiver is fully
informed. Buyer and the Company (on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries)
also further agree that, as to all communications among Kirkland and Ellis LLP
or Fredrikson and Byron, P.A., on the one hand, and the Acquired Companies, and
Seller or Seller\'s Affiliates and representatives, on the other hand, to the
extent that they relate to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the attorney‑client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs
to Seller and may be controlled by Seller and will not pass to or be claimed
by Buyer or any Acquired Company. In addition, if the Closing occurs, all of
the client files and records in the possession of Kirkland and Ellis LLP or
Fredrikson and Byron, P.A. related to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby will continue to be property of (and be controlled by) Seller and no Acquired
Company will retain any copies of such records or have any access to them.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Buyer or any Acquired Company and a third party other than a party to this
Agreement (or an Affiliate thereof) after the Closing, the Acquired Companies
may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential
communications by Kirkland and Ellis LLP or Fredrikson and Byron, P.A. to such
third party; provided, however, that no Acquired Company may waive such
privilege without the prior written consent of Seller.



12.17 No Additional Representations; Disclaimer; Non-Recourse.

(a) Buyer acknowledges that Buyer has relied solely on the results of its own
independent investigation and the representations and warranties of Seller and
the Company expressly and specifically set forth in Article III and Article
IV, respectively, as qualified by the Disclosure Schedules. The
representations and warranties of Seller and the Company expressly and
specifically set forth in Article III and Article IV or any certificate
expressly required to be delivered in connection with this Agreement,
respectively, as qualified by the Disclosure Schedules, constitute the sole
and exclusive representations, warranties, and statements of any kind of any
of Seller and the Company to Buyer in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, and Buyer understands, acknowledges and agrees that all
other representations, warranties, and statements of any kind or nature
expressed or implied (including any relating to the future or historical
financial condition, results of operations, prospects, assets or liabilities
of the Acquired Companies, or the quality, quantity or condition of the
Acquired Companies assets) are specifically disclaimed by the Company and
Seller. All representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement are
contractual in nature only. No Person is asserting the truth of any
representation and warranty set forth in this Agreement; rather the parties
have agreed that should any representations and warranties of any party prove
untrue, the other party will have the specific rights and remedies herein
specified as the exclusive remedy therefor, but that no other rights, remedies
or causes of action (whether in Law or in equity or whether in contract or in
tort) are permitted to any party hereto as a result of the untruth of any such
representation and warranty. NEITHER SELLER NOR THE COMPANY MAKES OR PROVIDES,
AND BUYER HEREBY WAIVES, ANY WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
AS TO THE QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
CONFORMITY TO SAMPLES, OR CONDITION OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES\' ASSETS OR ANY
PART THEREOF. BUYER SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER AND THE COMPANY EXPRESSLY AND
SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE III AND ARTICLE IV, RESPECTIVELY, AS
QUALIFIED BY THE DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES, AND ANY CERTIFICATE EXPRESSLY REQUIRED
TO BE DELIVERED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS AGREEMENT, (X) BUYER IS ACQUIRING THE
COMPANY ON AN "AS IS, WHERE IS" BASIS AND (Y) NEITHER SELLER NOR THE COMPANY
OR ANY OTHER PERSON (INCLUDING, ANY STOCKHOLDER, MEMBER, OFFICER, DIRECTOR,
EMPLOYEE OR AGENT OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING, WHETHER IN ANY INDIVIDUAL,
CORPORATE OR ANY OTHER CAPACITY) IS MAKING, AND BUYER IS NOT RELYING ON, ANY
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR OTHER STATEMENTS OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AS TO ANY MATTER CONCERNING THE ACQUIRED
COMPANIES, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OR THE
ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED TO (OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRED
BY) BUYER OR ANY OF BUYER\'S REPRESENTATIVES.

(b) This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim or suit based
upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement, or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement, may only be brought against the
named parties to this Agreement and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein with respect to the named parties to this
Agreement. No Person who is not a named party to this Agreement, including any
past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of the
Company, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates, will have or be subject
to any liability or indemnification obligation (whether in contract or in
tort) to Buyer or any other Person resulting from (nor will Buyer have any
claim with respect to) (i) the distribution to Buyer, or Buyer\'s use of, or
reliance on, any information, documents, projections, forecasts or other
material made available to Buyer in certain "data rooms," confidential
information memoranda or management presentations in expectation of, or in
connection with, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (ii) any
claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the sale and purchase of the
Company, including any alleged non-disclosure or misrepresentations made by
any such Persons, in each case, regardless of the legal theory under which
such liability or obligation may be sought to be imposed, whether sounding in
contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity, or otherwise; and each party
hereto waives and releases all such liabilities and obligations against any
such Persons. Nothing in this Section 12.17(b) shall limit, impair or
otherwise adversely affect the rights of Buyer or any other Person arising
under any contract or agreement (other than this Agreement or any certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement) executed and delivered in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) In connection with the investigation by Buyer of the Acquired Companies,
Buyer has received or may receive from the Acquired Companies certain
projections, forward-looking statements and other forecasts and certain
business plan information. Buyer acknowledges that there are uncertainties
inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections and other forecasts
and plans, that Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties, that Buyer is
taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and
accuracy of all estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans so
furnished to it (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans), and that Buyer will have no
claim against anyone with respect thereto. Accordingly, Buyer acknowledges
that neither the Company, Seller, nor any member, officer, director, employee
or agent of any of the foregoing, whether in an individual, corporate or any
other capacity, make any representation, warranty, or other statement with
respect to, and Buyer is not relying on, such estimates, projections,
forecasts or plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans), and Buyer agrees that it has
not relied thereon. 12.18 Conflict Between Transaction Documents. The parties hereto agree and
acknowledge that to the extent any terms and provisions of this Agreement are
in any way inconsistent with or in conflict with any term, condition or
provision of any other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby,
this Agreement will govern and control.



12.19 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that each party may
suffer irreparable damage prior to a termination in the event that the Closing
is not consummated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and that
money damages or other legal remedies may not be an adequate remedy for any
such damages. Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree
that in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any party hereto of
its covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, each other party
will be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by such breaching party, and
to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of the other parties under this Agreement, in
addition to any other remedy to which Seller, the Company or Buyer is entitled
at Law or in equity, including the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Article VIII and to seek money damages. Each party hereby agrees not to
raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement by the other parties. Each party hereby waives (i) any defenses in
any action for specific performance, including the defense that a remedy at
Law would be adequate and (ii) any requirement under any Law to post a bond or
other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.



12.20 Consents. Buyer acknowledges that certain consents to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be required from parties to contracts,
leases, licenses or other agreements to which any Acquired Company is a party
(including the contracts set forth on Schedule 4.11(a)) and such consents have
not been obtained. Except to the extent arising out of a breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement herein, Buyer agrees and
acknowledges that Seller will have no liability whatsoever to Buyer (and Buyer
will not be entitled to assert any claims) arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain any consents that may have been or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or because of
the default, acceleration or termination of any such contract, lease, license
or other agreement as a result thereof.



12.21 Electronic Delivery. This Agreement and any signed agreement or
instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments
hereto or thereto, to the extent delivered by means of a facsimile machine or
electronic mail (any such delivery, an "Electronic Delivery"), will be treated
in all manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and will be
considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original
signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any party hereto
or to any such agreement or instrument, each other party hereto or thereto
will re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all other parties.
No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument will raise the use of
Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or
agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of Delivery as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each such party
forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense related to
lack of authenticity.



12.22 Buyer Deliveries. Any document or item will be deemed "delivered",
"provided" or "made available" within the meaning of this Agreement if such
document or item (i) is included in the electronic data room at least two
Business Days prior to the date hereof, or (ii) actually delivered or provided
to Buyer or any of Buyer\'s Representatives.
