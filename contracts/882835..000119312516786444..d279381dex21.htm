the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance
with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ")
and (ii) approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

 

WHEREAS, Parent has approved this Agreement and the Merger in its capacity as

approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
and (ii) a support agreement in the form attached as _Exhibit C_ hereto (the
" _Support Agreement_ ") that has been executed and delivered by the

right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein; WHEREAS, each of the Company and Parent previously filed a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act (the " _HSR Filing_ ") with respect to

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, premises and
representations contained herein and other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

1.01 _The Merger_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, at the Effective Time, Merger
Sub will merge with and into the Company in accordance with the DGCL,
whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and the Company
will continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ")
following the Merger, as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent.

(b) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub will cause a certificate of
merger substantially in the form of  _Exhibit D_ attached hereto to be
executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") and make all other filings or recordings required
by the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger will become effective
at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware or at such other time as Parent and the Company
will agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger
becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will succeed
to all the assets, rights, privileges, powers and franchises and be subject to
all of the liabilities, restrictions and duties of the Company and Merger Sub,
all as provided under the DGCL.

 

1.02 _Conversion of Common Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof:

(a) As set forth on the Consideration Schedule, each Class A Common Share
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
(x) any Class A Common Shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section 1.02(h)_
and (y) any Dissenting Shares) will

 



2  be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the
Liquidation Value (as such term is defined in the Certificate of
Incorporation) of such Class A Common Share, together with the accrued and
unpaid dividends thereon through the Closing Date (determined in accordance
with the Certificate of Incorporation), payable to the holder thereof in
accordance with _Section 1.03_ and _Section 1.09_ below;  _provided_ that
no holder of Class A Common Shares shall be entitled to receive any portion of
the Class A Merger Consideration unless and until such holder has executed and
delivered to Parent a Letter of Transmittal and otherwise complied with the
requirements of _Section 1.03_ hereof. The aggregate consideration to which
holders of Class A Common Shares become entitled pursuant to this _Section
1.02(a)_ is referred to herein as the " _Class A Merger Consideration_."

(b) As set forth on the Consideration Schedule, each Class B Common Share
issued and outstanding and, if subject to vesting, vested immediately prior
to the Effective Time, regardless of whether vesting occurs pursuant to the
terms of the associated equity purchase agreement or at the election of the
Companys board of directors (other than (x) any Class B Common Shares to be
canceled pursuant to _Section 1.02(h)_ and (y) any Dissenting Shares) (each
such share, a " _Class B Common Share_ ") will be converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Portion of the Final
Residual Cash Consideration; _provided_ that (i) at the Closing, the amount to
be paid with respect to each Class B Common Share will be based upon the
Closing Residual Cash Consideration, payable to the holder thereof in
accordance with _Section 1.03_ and _Section 1.09_ below and (ii) no holder
of Class B Common Shares shall be entitled to receive any portion of the Class
B Merger Consideration unless and until such holder has executed and
delivered to Parent a Letter of Transmittal and otherwise complied with the
requirements of _Section 1.03_ hereof. The aggregate consideration to which
holders of Class B Common Shares become entitled pursuant to this  _Section
1.02(b)_ is referred to herein as the " _Class B Merger Consideration_."

(c) As set forth on the Consideration Schedule, each Class C Common Share
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (x)
any Class C Common Shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section 1.02(h)_ and
(y) any Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to the Per Share Portion of the Final Residual Cash
Consideration; _provided_ that (i) at the Closing, the amount to be paid with
respect to each Class C Common Share will be based upon the Closing Residual
Cash Consideration, payable to the holder thereof in accordance with _Section
1.03_ and _Section 1.09_ below and (ii) no holder of Class C Common Shares
shall be entitled to receive any portion of the Class C Merger Consideration
unless and until such holder has executed and delivered to Parent a Letter of
Transmittal and otherwise complied with the requirements of _Section 1.03_
hereof. The aggregate consideration to which holders of Class C Common Shares
become entitled pursuant to this _Section 1.02(c)_ is referred to herein as
the " _Class C Merger Consideration_ ").

 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Closing Residual Cash
Consideration_ " means (i) $2,800,140,000.00 (the " _Base Consideration_ "),
_minus_ (ii) the Class A Merger Consideration, _minus_ (iii) the amount of
Indebtedness of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries outstanding as of the
_Reference Time,_ such Indebtedness being the " _Closing Debt_ "); _provided_
that, for the sake of clarity and notwithstanding the Reference Time
definition, the aggregate amount of such Closing Debt shall be calculated
including any premium or other fee,

 



3  penalty or cost of any kind, character or description to be paid in respect
of such Closing Debt by virtue of the Closing if any), _plus_ (iv) the amount
of Cash as of the Reference Time (the " _Closing Cash_ "), _minus_ (v) the
aggregate amount of the Transaction Expenses as of the Reference Time, _plus_
(vi) the aggregate exercise price of the Options (excluding Options canceled
for no consideration pursuant to _Section 1.04_), _plus_ (vii) if Company
Working Capital as of the Reference Time is greater than the Upper Target, an
amount equal to the result of (A) the Company Working Capital as of
the Reference Time _minus_ (B) the Upper Target, _minus_ (viii) if Company
Working Capital as of the Reference Time is less than the Lower Target, an
amount equal to the result of (A) the Lower Target _minus_ (B) the Company
Working Capital as of the Reference Time, (ix) to the extent the Company
Working Capital as of the Reference Time is less than the Upper Target and
greater than the Lower Target, no adjustment shall be made to the Closing
Residual Cash Consideration, _minus_ (x) the Adjustment Escrow Amount,
_minus_ (xi) the Specified Matters Escrow Amount, and _plus_ (xii) the
Interest Component, if applicable, in each case of the foregoing clauses (i)
through (xii), as determined by the Company in good faith and set forth in
the Closing Residual Cash Consideration Calculation.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Final Residual Cash
Consideration_ " means the Closing Residual Cash Consideration as finally
determined pursuant to _Section 1.10_.

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Per Share Portion_ " means a
fraction, the numerator of which is one, and the denominator of which is the
sum of (i) the aggregate number of Class B Common Shares and Class C Common
Shares (other than Class B Common Shares and Class C Common Shares to be
canceled pursuant to _Section 1.02(h)_), _plus_  (ii) the aggregate number
of Class B Common Shares issuable upon exercise of all Options (excluding
Options canceled for no consideration pursuant to _Section 1.04_), in each
case as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

(g) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Options_ " means all options
to acquire Class B Common Shares which are vested and exercisable (or which
will become vested and exercisable as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby (whether pursuant to the terms of such options or at the
election of the Companys board of directors)), as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

(h) Each Common Share held immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Company as treasury shares, by any of the Companys Subsidiaries, or by
Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates will be
canceled and no payment will be made with respect thereto.

 

(i) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



4 1.03 _Payment; Exchange of Certificates; Lost Certificates_.

 

(a) The Paying Agent will act as paying agent in effecting the exchange of
cash for certificates which, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
represented Common Shares entitled to payment pursuant to _Section 1.02_. On
or promptly following the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will pay (from the
funds deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 2.01(b)_ ) each
holder of Common Shares (each, a " _Stockholder_ ") who has surrendered his,
her or its certificates representing such Stockholders Common Shares (if such
Common Shares are certificated) and delivered a duly executed and completed
letter of transmittal substantially in the form of _Exhibit E_ attached
hereto (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), representing the number of Common
Shares held by such Stockholder, the amount of cash to which such Stockholder
is entitled under _Section 1.02_. Surrendered certificates will forthwith be
canceled. Until so surrendered and exchanged, each such certificate will
represent from and after the Effective Time solely the right to receive the
Merger Consideration into which the shares it theretofore represented will
have been converted pursuant to _Section 1.02_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any such certificate will have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
then, upon the making of an affidavit of such fact by the Person claiming
such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and delivery of an otherwise
duly completed and executed Letter of Transmittal, the Paying Agent will
issue, subject to the conditions set forth in, and otherwise in accordance
with, this Agreement and the Letter of Transmittal, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the Common Shares represented by such certificate, as contemplated
by this _Section 1.03_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment
of any Merger Consideration to such Stockholder, require such Stockholder to
provide a customary indemnity for the benefit of the Surviving Corporation and
its Affiliates against any claim that may be made against the Surviving
Corporation or its Affiliates with respect to such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate. After the Closing Date, there will be no transfers on
the share transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of Common Shares. If,
after the Closing Date, certificates representing such Common Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, they will be canceled and exchanged
as provided in this _Section 1.03_. No interest will be paid or will accrue
on the Merger Consideration payable upon delivery of a Letter of Transmittal
and, if applicable, the surrender of any certificate. All cash paid upon the
surrender of certificates in accordance with the terms of this _Section 1.03_
will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining
to the Common Shares previously represented by such certificates. None of the
Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Representative will be
liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(b) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to this  _Section 1.03_ (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains unclaimed by the Stockholders 12 months after the
Effective Time, shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such
Stockholder who has not exchanged such Common Shares for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this _Section 1.03_ prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation for payment of
the Merger Consideration in respect of such Common Shares without any
interest thereon.

1.04 _Options_. The Company will cause all outstanding Options to be canceled
effective as of the Effective Time, at which time each holder of an Option
(an " _Optionholder_ ") will be entitled, in accordance with _Section 1.09_
and as set forth on the Consideration Schedule, 

 



5  to receive from Parent an amount in cash equal to the product of (a) the
excess of the Per Share Portion of the Final Residual Cash Consideration over
the applicable exercise price per share of such Option, _multiplied by_ (b)
the number of Class B Common Shares such holder could have purchased if such
holder had exercised such Option in full immediately prior to such time, less
applicable Taxes withheld; _provided_ that at the Closing, the amount to be
paid with respect to each Option will be based upon the Closing Residual Cash
Consideration, payable to the holder thereof in accordance with this _Section
1.04_. For any Options for which the exercise price of such Option is greater
than or equal to the Per Share Portion of the Closing Residual Cash
Consideration allocable to such Option, such Option will be terminated for no
consideration. The aggregate consideration to which Optionholders become
entitled pursuant to this _Section 1.04_ is collectively referred to herein
as the " _Option Merger Consideration_." Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to pay the Option Merger Consideration
to the Optionholders promptly following the Closing Date through the Surviving
Corporations or the applicable Subsidiarys payroll; _provided_ that no
Optionholder will be paid, and is not entitled to, his or her portion of the
Option Merger Consideration until he or she has executed and delivered to the
Company an option cancellation agreement substantially in the form of _Exhibit
F_ attached hereto (an " _Option Cancellation Agreement_ "). Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation or the applicable Subsidiary to make timely
payment to the appropriate taxing authority or authorities of any amounts
withheld from payment to the Optionholders under this  _Section 1.04_.

1.05 _Certificate of Incorporation_. The certificate of incorporation of
Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended in
accordance with applicable Law.

 

1.06 _Bylaws_. The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, will be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended
in accordance with applicable Law.

1.07 _Directors and Officers_. From and after the Effective Time,
until successors are duly elected or appointed in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and
applicable Law, (a) the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time will be
the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (b) the officers of Merger Sub
at the Effective Time will be the officers of the Surviving Corporation.

 

1.08 _Calculation of Closing Residual Cash Consideration_. At least three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company will deliver to Parent
its good faith calculation of the Closing Residual Cash Consideration (the "
_Closing Residual Cash Consideration Calculation_ "), setting forth (a) an
estimate of the Class A Merger Consideration, (b) an estimate of the Closing
Debt and instructions for repayment of any Closing Debt for borrowed money,
(c) an estimate of the Closing Cash, (d) an estimate of the aggregate amount
of the Transaction Expenses as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and instructions for payment thereof, (e) an estimate of the aggregate
exercise price of the Options (excluding Options canceled for no consideration
pursuant to _Section 1.04_) and (f) in substantially the same form
(including the same line items) as the Sample Working Capital Statement, an
estimate of Company Working Capital, together with reasonable supporting
documentation and calculations, in each case of subsections (a)-(f) above
determined in accordance with this Agreement, including the defined terms
herein, and the Accounting Principles.

 



6 1.09 _Consideration Schedule_. At least two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a statement (the "
_Consideration Schedule_ ") setting forth, each Stockholders aggregate Per
Share Portion with respect to such Stockholders Common Shares, and
each Optionholders aggregate Per Share Portion with respect to such
Optionholders Options, in each case, of (a) the Closing Residual Cash
Consideration, (b) the Representative Reserve Fund, (c) the Adjustment Escrow
Account and (d) the Specified Matters Escrow Account. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any knowledge possessed or
acquired by or on behalf of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Affiliates, it is expressly acknowledged and agreed that
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Affiliates
shall be entitled to rely on the allocation of the Merger Consideration among
the Stockholders and the Optionholders set forth in the Consideration
Schedule, without any obligation to investigate or verify the accuracy or
correctness thereof, and to make payments in accordance therewith, and in no
event shall Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Affiliates have any liability to any Person (including the
Representative and any of the Stockholders and Optionholders) in connection
with any claims relating to any misallocation of the Merger Consideration
among the Stockholders and the Optionholders set forth in the Consideration
Schedule, any determination by the Representative in connection therewith, or
payments made by any Person (including Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, the Escrow Agent, the Paying Agent and their respective
Affiliates) in accordance therewith.

1.10 _Final Residual Cash Consideration_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable, but in any event within 75 days after the
Closing Date, Parent will deliver to the Representative (i) an unaudited,
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
Closing (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and (ii) its good faith calculation
of the Final Residual Cash Consideration (together, the " _Closing Statement_
"), setting forth Parents calculation of (A) the Class A Merger
Consideration, (B) the Closing Debt, (C) Closing Cash, (D) the aggregate
amount of the Transaction Expenses as of the Reference Time, (E) the
aggregate exercise price of the Options (excluding Options canceled for no
consideration pursuant to _Section 1.04_) and (F) in substantially the same
form (including the same line items) as the Sample Working Capital Statement
attached hereto as _Exhibit G_, an estimate of Company Working Capital. The
Closing Balance Sheet will be prepared on a consolidated basis for the Company
and its Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent
with the methodologies, practices, estimation techniques, assumptions and
principles used in the preparation of the Latest Balance Sheet. The Closing
Statement will be derived from the Closing Balance Sheet and will, with
respect to all of the amounts taken into account in calculating the Final
Residual Cash Consideration (as well as the Final Residual Cash Consideration
resulting therefrom), be prepared in accordance with the applicable
definitions in this Agreement. The Closing Statement will entirely disregard
(x) any and all effects on the assets or liabilities of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby or of any
financing or refinancing arrangements entered into at any time by Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or any other transaction entered into by Parent or
the Surviving Corporation in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated

 



7  hereby and (y) any of the plans, transactions or changes which Parent
intends to initiate or make or cause to be initiated or made after the Closing
with respect to the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries or their
business or assets, or any facts or circumstances that are unique or
particular to Parent or any of its assets or liabilities.

 

(b) Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to, (i) reasonably assist the Representative and its representatives in the
review of the Closing Statement and provide the Representative and its
representatives with reasonable access during normal business hours to the
books, records (including work papers, schedules, memoranda and
other documents), supporting data, facilities and employees of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries involved in the preparation of the Closing
Statement for purposes of their review of the Closing Statement, and (ii)
reasonably cooperate with the Representative and its representatives in
connection with such review, including providing on a timely basis all other
information the Representative reasonably considers necessary or useful in
connection with its review of the Closing Statement. The calculations
contained in the Closing Statement delivered by Parent to Representative shall
be final and binding, and deemed accepted by, the Representative unless the
Representative delivers to Parent a written statement setting forth its
objections to the Closing Statement (an " _Objections Statement_ "), which
statement will identify in reasonable detail those items to which the
Representative objects (the " _Disputed Items_ " and the Representatives
good faith calculation of the Disputed Items) within 30 days after delivery of
the Closing Statement to the Representative. If an Objections Statement is
delivered to Parent, the Representative and Parent will negotiate in
good faith to resolve in writing the Disputed Items and all such discussions
related thereto will (unless otherwise agreed by Parent and the Representative
in writing) be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any
applicable similar state rule, but if they do not reach a final resolution
within 30 days (or such longer period as Parent and the Representative may
agree in writing) after the delivery of the Objections Statement to Parent,
the Representative and Parent will submit any unresolved Disputed Items (and
only such matters) to the Atlanta office of Ernst and Young LLP (the "
_Accounting Firm_ ") for review and resolution. The Representative and Parent
will instruct the Accounting Firm to make a final determination of the
Disputed Items in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in
this Agreement. Parent and the Representative will cooperate with the
Accounting Firm during the term of its engagement and will instruct
the Accounting Firm not to, and the Accounting Firm will not, assign a value
to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value for such item assigned
by Parent, on the one hand, or the Representative, on the other hand, or less
than the smallest value for such item assigned by Parent, on the one hand, or
the Representative, on the other hand. Parent and the Representative will also
instruct the Accounting Firm to, and the Accounting Firm will, make its
determination based solely on the terms, guidelines and procedures set forth
in this Agreement ( _i.e._ , not on the basis of an independent review). The
Closing Statement and the Final Residual Cash Consideration resulting
therefrom will become final and binding on the parties hereto on the date
that the Accounting Firm delivers its final resolution in writing to Parent
and the Representative (which final resolution will be requested by the
parties to be delivered not more than 30 days following submission of the
Disputed Items), and such resolution by the Accounting Firm will not be
subject to court review or otherwise be appealable. The fees, costs and
expenses of the Accounting Firm will be allocated between Parent, on the one
hand, and the Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders and
Optionholders), on the other hand, based upon the percentage which the portion
of the contested amount not awarded to Parent, on the one hand, and the

 



8  Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders and Optionholders), on the
other hand, bears to the amount actually contested by such Person, as
determined by the Accounting Firm. For example, if the Representative claims
that the Final Residual Cash Consideration is one thousand dollars ($1,000)
greater than the amount determined by Parent, and Parent contests only five
hundred dollars ($500) of the amount claimed by the Representative, and if
the Accounting Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the
Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders and Optionholders) three hundred
dollars ($300) of the five hundred dollars ($500) contested, then the costs
and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be allocated sixty percent (60%) (
_i.e._ , 300 ÷ 500) to Parent and forty percent (40%) ( _i.e._ , 200 ÷ 500) to
the Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders and Optionholders).

 

(c) If the Final Residual Cash Consideration as finally determined pursuant to
_Section 1.10(b)_ is greater than the Closing Residual Cash Consideration
(such amount, the " _Excess Consideration_ "), then, within five (5) Business
Days after the determination of the Final Residual Cash Consideration, (x)
Parent will pay an amount equal to the lesser of (A) the Excess Consideration
and (B) $8,000,000.00, and (y) Parent and the Representative shall deliver a
joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
release from the Adjustment Escrow Account all of the funds then deposited in
such account, in each case, as directed by the Representative, (i) to the
Paying Agent (for the benefit of the Stockholders), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an amount equal to the portion of such amounts
described in the foregoing clauses (x) and (y) allocable to the Stockholders,
and the Paying Agent will pay to the Stockholders such amount as directed by
the Representative (according to each such Stockholders aggregate Per Share
Portion with respect to such Stockholders Common Shares) pursuant to the
payment instructions set forth in each such Stockholders Letter of
Transmittal, and (ii) to the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries
(for the benefit of the Optionholders), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, an amount equal to the portion of such amounts described in
the foregoing clauses (x) and (y) allocable to the Optionholders (less
applicable Taxes withheld), and the Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary
will pay to the Optionholders such amount (according to each such
Optionholders aggregate Per Share Portion with respect to such Optionholders
Options) through the Surviving Corporations or the applicable Subsidiarys
payroll.

(d) If the Final Residual Cash Consideration as finally determined pursuant
to _Section 1.10(b)_ is less than the Closing Residual Cash Consideration
(such amount the " _Shortfall Consideration_ "), then, within five Business
Days after the determination of the Final Residual Cash Consideration, Parent
and the Representative shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to (i) release from the Adjustment Escrow
Account an amount equal to the lesser of (A) the Shortfall Consideration and
(B) all of the funds then deposited in the Adjustment Escrow Account, and (ii)
if any amount remains in the Adjustment Escrow Account following such payment
described in the foregoing clause (i), release such remaining amount out of
the Adjustment Escrow Account as follows (x) to the Paying Agent (for the
benefit of the Stockholders), by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
an amount equal to the portion of such remaining amounts allocable to
the Stockholders, and the Paying Agent will pay to the Stockholders such
amount as directed by the Representative (according to each such Stockholders
aggregate Per Share Portion with respect to such Stockholders Common Shares)
pursuant to the payment instructions set forth in each such Stockholders
Letter of Transmittal, and (y) to the Surviving Corporation or one of its
Subsidiaries (for the benefit of the

 



9  Optionholders), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount
equal to the portion of such remaining amount allocable to the Optionholders
(less applicable Taxes withheld), and the Surviving Corporation or such
Subsidiary will pay to the Optionholders such amount (according to each such
Optionholders aggregate Per Share Portion with respect to such Optionholders
Options) through the Surviving Corporations or the applicable Subsidiarys
payroll.

(e) All payments required pursuant to _Section 1.10(c)_ and  _Section
1.10(d)_ will be deemed to be adjustments for Tax purposes to the Closing
Residual Cash Consideration.

(f) Parent, the Company and, effective upon the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any amount otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of federal, state, local, or non-U.S. law; _provided_ that
if Parent determines that an amount is required to be deducted or withheld
(other than payments with respect to any Optionholder and other payments
treated as compensation), Parent shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts
to, at least five Business Days prior to the payment of such amount, provide
the Representative with written notice of its intent to deduct and withhold
and (ii) cooperate in good faith with the Representative to reduce or
eliminate the deduction or withholding of such amount, and (iii) shall, to the
extent reasonably possible, provide each affected Company Stockholder or the
Representative, as applicable, a reasonable opportunity to provide forms or
other documentation that would exempt such amounts from withholding. If any
amount is so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such payment is
otherwise required to be made.

1.11 _The Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at the offices of Kirkland and
Ellis LLP, located at 300 North LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois 60654, at
10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on a date to be specified by Parent and the Company,
which shall be no later than the third Business Day following satisfaction or
waiver (by the Person entitled to the benefit thereof) of the conditions set
forth in _Section 3.01_ and  _Section 3.02_ (other than those conditions
which by their terms or nature are to be performed or satisfied at the
Closing; _provided_ that such conditions are satisfied (or waived by the
Person entitled to the benefit thereof) at the Closing); _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, to the extent Parent has not received the proceeds from its
debt financing described in _Section 6.06_ on or prior to such date, Parent
will be under no obligation to consummate the Closing prior to the earlier to
occur of (i) three (3) Business Days following receipt of such proceeds and
(ii) December 27, 2016. The date of the Closing is herein referred to as the "
_Closing Date_."

 

1.12 _Appraisal Rights_. Each Common Share that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that is held by a Stockholder who has
not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing or executed
an enforceable waiver of appraisal rights to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and, in the case of any Person required to have exercised
appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL as of the Effective Time of
the Merger in order to preserve such rights, with respect to which appraisal
rights under the DGCL have been duly and validly demanded, will not be
converted into the right to receive any portion of the applicable Merger
Consideration and will be converted into the right to receive payment from the

 



10  Surviving Corporation with respect thereto as provided by the DGCL, unless
and until the holder of any such Common Share will have failed to perfect or
will have effectively withdrawn or lost his, her or its right to appraisal
and payment under the DGCL, in which case such Common Share will thereupon be
deemed, as of the Effective Time, to have been canceled and retired and to
have ceased to exist and been converted into the right to receive, upon
surrender of such certificate, if applicable, and the delivery of a duly
executed and completed Letter of Transmittal in accordance with _Section
1.03_, a portion, without interest, of the Merger Consideration payable
with respect to such Common Share. From and after the Effective Time, a
holder of Dissenting Shares shall no longer be entitled to vote his, her or
its Common Shares for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other
distributions on his, her or its Common Shares (except dividends or other
distributions payable to Stockholders of record at a date prior to the
Effective Time, or dividends that accrued thereon prior to the Effective
Time). Common Shares for which appraisal rights have been properly exercised,
and not subsequently withdrawn, lost or failed to be perfected, are referred
to herein as " _Dissenting Shares_." Parent shall be entitled to retain (or
receive from the Paying Agent) any Merger Consideration that otherwise would
have been paid in respect of the Dissenting Shares pending resolution of the
claims of such holders, and, subject to this _Section 1.12_, no Stockholder
shall be entitled to any portion of such retained Merger Consideration.

1.13 _Representative Reserve Fund_. An amount in cash equal to $500,000.00
(the " _Representative Reserve Fund_ ") will be withheld from the Closing
Residual Cash Consideration at Closing and will be paid by Parent to the
Representative, or its designee, pursuant to payment instructions delivered by
the Representative to Parent. The Representative Reserve Fund will be
retained by the Representative, or its designee, and will be used by the
Representative solely to satisfy any potential payments to be made by
Stockholders and Optionholders (including pursuant to  _Section 1.10(d)_) or
the Representative hereunder (including with respect to any costs or expenses
incurred in connection with the adjustment provisions contained in _Section
1.10_) and to pay any expenses of the Representative in connection with its
acting as the Representative pursuant to this Agreement. The Representative
Reserve Fund will be retained by the Representative until such time as the
Representative determines in its sole discretion, _provided_ that
the Representative Reserve Fund will be retained until at least the Final
Residual Cash Consideration has been determined pursuant to _Section 1.10_.
At such time as the Representative determines to release the Representative
Reserve Fund to the Stockholders and Optionholders of the Company, the
Representative will pay the remaining balance (if any) of the Representative
Reserve Fund as follows: (i) to the Paying Agent (for the benefit of the
Stockholders), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount
equal to the portion allocable to the Stockholders, and the Paying Agent will
pay to the Stockholders such amount as directed by the Representative
(according to each such Stockholders aggregate Per Share Portion with
respect to such Stockholders Common Shares) pursuant to the payment
instructions set forth in each such Stockholders Letter of Transmittal, and
(ii) to the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries (for the benefit
of the Optionholders), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an
amount equal to the portion allocable to the Optionholders, and the Surviving
Corporation or such Subsidiary will pay to the Optionholders such amount
(according to each such Optionholders aggregate Per Share Portion with
respect to such Optionholders Options) through the Surviving Corporations or
the applicable Subsidiarys payroll. For tax purposes, the Representative
Reserve Fund will be treated as having been received and voluntarily set
aside by the Stockholders and Optionholders at the time of Closing. The
parties agree that the Representative is not acting as a withholding agent or
in any similar capacity in connection with the Representative Reserve Fund.

 



11 1.14 _Adjustment Escrow Account_. At the Closing, Parent shall pay an amount
equal to $8,000,000.00 (the " _Adjustment Escrow Amount_ ") to SunTrust Bank
(the " _Escrow Agent_ ") to be held and delivered by the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the terms and provisions of an escrow agreement to be entered
into among Parent, the Representative and the Escrow Agent in form and
substance mutually acceptable to Parent, the Representative and the Escrow
Agent (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). The Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be
placed in a single escrow account (the " _Adjustment Escrow Account_ ") for
disbursement pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The
Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be established for purposes of any Shortfall
Consideration, as set forth in  _Section 1.10(d)_.

1.15 _Specified Matters Escrow Account_. At the Closing, Parent shall pay an
amount equal to $5,500,000.00 (the " _Specified Matters Escrow Amount_ ") to
the Escrow Agent to be held and delivered by the Escrow Agent in accordance
with the terms and provisions of the Escrow Agreement. The Specified Matters
Escrow Amount shall be placed in a single escrow account (the " _Specified
Matters Escrow Account_ ") for disbursement pursuant to this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement. The Specified Matters Escrow Amount shall be established
solely as security for the indemnification obligations of the Stockholders
and Optionholders for Specified Matters set forth in _Section 1.02(a)(B)_ of
_Schedule 10.01_.

advisors of the Company and Company Subsidiaries to, at the reasonable request

Parent shall not be required to request access from the Designated Contacts to
the extent any such Designated Contact has previously consented to Parents
access with respect to a particular matter and Parents access is
substantially consistent with such prior consent. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries will
be required to disclose any information to Parent or Parents Representatives

solicit, encourage, initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or
provide any information to, and (y) will terminate, and will cause its agents
and representatives to terminate, all existing discussions or negotiations

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Stockholders and the
Optionholders) concerning any purchase of the Common Shares or any merger,
sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or similar transactions involving the Company (other than assets
sold in the ordinary course of business).

 

6.06 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) From the date hereof until Closing, in order to assist Parent in obtaining
its debt financing, the Company shall, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its Subsidiaries to, use and provide reasonable best efforts
to cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub as reasonably requested by Parent that
are customary in connection with the arrangement and implementation
of Parents debt financing, including Parents expectation of a public
offering of

 



37  Parents debt securities. Such reasonable best efforts by the Company shall
include, at the reasonable request of Parent and Merger Sub, (i) cooperation
in the preparation of any offering memorandum, prospectus, bank book, ratings

promptly as reasonably practicable after Parents request with the Required
Financial Statements, (iii) causing the Companys senior management teams to

prospective lenders, in each case, upon reasonable advance notice, during
normal business hours, and at mutually agreed times, (iv) at least two (2)
Business Days prior to Closing (to the extent requested from the Company at
least five (5) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing), providing all

requested by the Parent which Parents debt financing sources reasonably
determine is required with respect to applicable "know your customer" and

financing or otherwise reasonably required or requested by the underwriters
in connection with a public offering of Parents debt securities, (v) solely
to the extent constituting a condition to any of Parents debt financing
sources obligations under the debt commitment letter (if any) associated

reasonable best efforts to facilitate the pledging of collateral and the
granting of security interests in connection with Parents debt financing; 
_provided_ that no such action shall be effective until the Closing, (vi)
assisting Parent in obtaining the cooperation of the independent accountants

customary accountants consents and comfort letters (or an agreed upon
procedures letter in lieu of a comfort letter) in connection with a public
offering of Parents debt securities and (vii) assisting Parent in obtaining
customary legal opinions, to the extent reasonably requested by Parent, to be
delivered in connection with Parents debt financing or in connection with a
public offering of Parents debt securities.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall "reasonable best efforts" of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys, accountants and advisors be deemed to construe to require such
Persons to and such Persons shall not be required to, (i) take any action to
the extent it would unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) pay any commitment or other
similar fee in connection with Parents debt financing unless and until the
Closing occurs, (iii) pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize
Parents debt financing or the execution and delivery of the definitive
documentation related thereto or require the board of directors (or any
similar governing body) to take any action or cause any of its

any commitment, financing or other fees or reimburse any expenses or to
approve the execution or delivery of any document or certificate
in connection with Parents debt financing, (iv) deliver any financial
statements or other information for any period that is not otherwise
specifically required hereunder or prepare any pro forma financial statements,
adjustments, or projections, (v) take any action that will conflict with or
violate their formation or organizational documents or any legal requirements
or result in the contravention of, or would reasonably be expected to result
in a violation or breach of, or default under, any Law or material

 



38  agreement (in each case prior to the Closing) (it being understood that the
foregoing shall not prevent such Persons from seeking any consents reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with Parents debt financing), (vi) take
any action that could reasonably be expected to result in any officer,
director, employee, agent, attorney, accountant or advisor of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries incurring personal liability (as opposed to liability
in his or her capacity as an officer of such Person) with respect to any
matters related to Parents debt financing, (vii) take any action that could
reasonably be expected to cause any condition to Closing set forth in this
Agreement to fail to be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this
Agreement that would provide Parent the right to terminate this Agreement
(unless, in each case, waived in advance by Parent), (viii) incur any
liability (or cause its directors, officers or employees to incur any
liability) under Parents debt financing prior to the Closing Date, (ix) cause
the delivery of any legal opinions, any authorization letters or any
certificate as to solvency by the Company or its Subsidiaries, (x) prepare a
description of any portion of Parents debt financing (including any
"description of notes") or other information customarily prepared by Parent or
its counsel or Parents debt financing sources or underwriters or their
counsel, or (xi) prepare any "risk factors" relating to any component of the
financing included in any offering memorandum, prospectus or other offering
document.

 

(c) Parent acknowledges and agrees that none of the Company, its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, representatives
and advisors (including legal, financial and accounting advisors) shall have
any responsibility for, and shall not be required to incur any liability
(personal or otherwise) to any Person under or in connection with, the
arrangement of Parents debt financing that Parent may raise in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that Parent shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, representatives and advisors
(including legal, financial and accounting advisors) from and against any and
all losses, liabilities, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the arrangement of Parents debt financing, any cooperation
efforts set forth herein and any information utilized in connection therewith.
If this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with its terms for any
reason, Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company for all out-of-pocket
costs or expenses incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection
with cooperation provided for in this _Section 6.06_.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no breach or
other failure to comply with this _Section 6.06_ by the Company, its
Subsidiaries, the Representative or their respective representatives shall be
taken into account for purposes of determining the accuracy of the
representation and warranty contained in _Section 5.08_. The Company,
its Subsidiaries, the Representative and their respective representatives
will be deemed to be in compliance with this _Section 6.06_ , and Parent shall
not allege that the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Representative or their
respective representatives is or has not been in compliance with this
_Section 6.06_ , unless and until Parent provides written notice of the
alleged failure to comply specifying in reasonable detail specific steps to
cure such alleged failure in a commercially reasonable and practical manner
(to the extent such breach may be so cured), which failure to comply has not
been cured within five Business Days from receipt of such written notice.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
condition set forth in _Section 3.01(b)_, as it applies to the Companys and
the Representatives obligations under this _Section 6.06_ , shall be deemed
satisfied if the Companys and/or its Subsidiaries breach(es), if any, of
its obligations under this _Section 6.06_ did not cause (or was not a material
factor in causing) the failure of Parent to obtain its debt financing.

 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that
its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein are not
conditioned upon the availability or consummation of any debt financing, the
availability of any alternate debt financing, the availability of any equity
financing or receipt of the proceeds therefrom.

 



39 6.07 _Support Agreements and Stockholder Consent_. From the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.07_ , the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to (i) obtain, and deliver to Parent, a duly executed Support
Agreement by each of the Stockholders of the Company and (ii) obtain, and
deliver to Parent, a duly executed counterpart signature page to the
Stockholder Consent executed by each of the Stockholders of the Company. In
addition, the Representative shall comply with the obligations set forth in
_Schedule 6.07_.

ARTICLE VII

 

COVENANTS OF PARENT

7.01  _Access to Books and Records_. From and after the Closing, Parent will,
and will cause the Surviving Corporation to provide the Representative and its
authorized representatives with reasonable access (for the purpose of
examining, copying and inspecting), during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice, to the books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to periods or occurrences prior to or on the Closing
Date in connection with any matter relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that (a) such
access does not unreasonably interfere with the normal business operations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation and (b) such access occurs in such a
manner as Parent reasonably determines to be appropriate to protect the
confidentiality of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither the Parent
or the Surviving Corporation will be required to disclose any information to
Representative or Representatives representatives if such disclosure would
(x) result in the loss of any attorney-client or other legal privilege or (y)
contravene any applicable Law. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any information (if
any) provided pursuant to this _Section 7.01_ , and Representative may not
rely on the accuracy of any such information, in each case other than as
expressly set forth in Parents representations and warranties contained in
_Article V_. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by the Representative,
Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts not to, and not to permit the
Surviving Corporation to, until the expiration of the later of (i) the seventh
(7th) anniversary of the Closing Date or (ii) the date on which Taxes may no
longer be assessed under the applicable statutes of limitation, including any
waivers or extensions thereof, destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any of
the books and records of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries for any
period prior to the Closing Date without first giving reasonable prior notice
to the Representative and offering to surrender to the Representative (on
behalf of the Stockholders and Optionholders) such books and records or any
portion thereof which Parent or the Surviving Corporation may intend to
destroy, alter or dispose of.

 



40 7.02 _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

 

(a) In addition to the other rights provided for in this _Section 7.02(a)_
and not in limitation thereof, from and after the Closing, Parent will cause
the Surviving Corporation (the " _D andO Indemnifying Party_") to, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) indemnify and hold harmless,
current and former officers and directors of the Company or its Subsidiaries
(each, a " _D andO Indemnitee_") against all DandO Expenses, losses, claims,
damages, judgments or amounts paid in settlement (collectively, " _D andO
Costs_") in respect of any threatened, pending or completed claim, action,
suit or proceeding, whether criminal, civil, administrative or investigative,
based on or arising from or relating to the fact that such Person is or was a
director or officer of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries arising out of
acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing (including in respect
of acts or omissions in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby) (a " _D andO Indemnifiable Claim_") and (ii) advance to
such DandO Indemnitees all DandO Expenses incurred in connection with any DandO
Indemnifiable Claim (including in circumstances where the DandO Indemnifying
Party has assumed the defense of such claim) promptly after receipt of
reasonably detailed statements therefor; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Person to whom DandO Expenses are to be advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not
entitled to indemnification. Any DandO Indemnifiable Claims will continue until
such DandO Indemnifiable Claim is disposed of or all Orders in connection with
such DandO Indemnifiable Claim are fully satisfied. For the purposes of this
_Section 7.02(a)_, " _D andO Expenses_" will include attorneys fees and all
other costs, charges and expenses paid or incurred in connection with
investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including
on appeal), or preparing to defend, to be a witness in or participate in any
DandO Indemnifiable Claim, but will exclude losses, judgments and amounts paid
in settlement (which items are included in the definition of DandO Costs).

(b) Parent agrees to maintain, for a period of six (6) years after the Closing
Date, (i) all rights of the DandO Indemnitees to indemnification for DandO
Indemnifiable Claims provided in the Companys Organizational Documents or
comparable Organizational Documents of any Company Subsidiary as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) any indemnification agreements of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to any DandO Indemnitee in
relation to DandO Indemnifiable Claims. Parent shall ensure that such rights are
not amended or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect
the rights of any DandO Indemnitee, unless such modification is required by Law
or approved in writing by such DandO Indemnitee.

 

(c) At the Closing, Parent will cause the Company to obtain and maintain
irrevocable "tail" insurance policies (the " _D andO Tail Policies_") naming
the DandO Indemnitees as direct beneficiaries with a claims period of at least
six years from the Closing Date from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect
to directors liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable
as the Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Closing Date. The Company will bear 100% of the
fees and expenses of purchasing and maintaining the DandO Tail Policies. Parent
will not, and will cause the Surviving Corporation not to, cancel or change
such insurance policies in any respect.

 



41 (d) In the event that all or substantially all of the assets of the Surviving
Corporation are sold, whether in one transaction or a series of transactions,
then Parent and the Surviving Corporation will, in each such case, ensure that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations
set forth in this  _Section 7.02_. The provisions of this _Section 7.02(d)_
will apply to all of the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(e) The obligations of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their
Subsidiaries under this _Section 7.02_ shall not be terminated or modified
in such a manner as to adversely affect any Person to whom this _Section
7.02_ applies without the consent of such affected Person.

 

7.03 _Employee Matters_. Parent will or will cause the Surviving Corporation
to provide employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (" _Company
Employees_ ") as of the Closing Date with (i) salary and target bonus
opportunities no less favorable than those in effect immediately prior to the
Closing Date and (ii) other employee benefits that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided by Parent to its similarly
situated employees for a period of 12 months following the Closing Date.
Parent further agrees that, from and after the Closing Date, Parent will, or
will cause the Surviving Corporation to, grant all Company Employees credit
for any service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries earned prior to
the Closing Date for eligibility and vesting purposes and for determining the
amount of benefits under any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement
or arrangement that may be established or maintained by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates on or after the Closing Date (the "
_New Plans_ "), other than with respect to benefit accrual under any defined
benefit plans or as would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition,
Parent will or will cause the Surviving Corporation to (a) waive all pre-
existing condition exclusion and actively-at-work requirements and similar
limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any New Plans to the extent waived or satisfied by an
employee under any Plan as of the Closing Date, and (b) take into account any
covered expenses incurred on or before the Closing Date by any Company
Employee (or covered dependent thereof) for purposes of satisfying applicable
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions after the Closing
Date under any applicable New Plan. Parent and the Surviving Corporation will
be solely responsible for any obligations arising under Section 4980B of the
Code with respect to all "MandA qualified beneficiaries" as defined in Treasury
Regulations Section 54.4980B-9. No provision of this _Section 7.03_ shall
create any third party beneficiary rights in any Company Employee or any other
current or former employee, director or consultant of the Company or its
Subsidiaries (other than a Party) in respect of continued employment (or
resumed employment) or any other matter or shall be deemed an amendment of any
Plan, any New Plan or any other employee benefit plan or agreement.

 

7.04 _Regulatory Filings_.

 

(a) Parent will, within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, make or
cause to be made all filings and submissions under any antitrust, competition
and similar legislation or regulations, including the HSR Act (to the extent
required filings or submissions

 



42  have not been made prior to the date hereof), applicable to Parent and its
Affiliates for the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein.
Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, the
Company will have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable will consult with Parent on, all the information that appears in
any such filings. In exercising the foregoing right, the Company will
act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Promptly, but in any event
within two (2) Business Days after the date hereof, Parent shall amend its
portion of the HSR Filing in order to cause such filing to be considered for
"early termination."

(b) Parent will comply with any additional requests for information, including
requests for production of documents and production of witnesses for
interviews or depositions by any Governmental Bodies, in connection with the
filings under _Section 7.04(a)_.

 

(c) Parent will keep the Company reasonably apprised of the status of all
filings and submissions referred to in _Section 7.04(a)_, including
furnishing the Company with copies of notices or other communications received
by Parent in connection therewith. Parent will not permit any of Parents
Representatives to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Body
in respect of such filings and submissions unless it consults with the
Company in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Body,
gives the Company the opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

 

(d) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best
efforts to promptly take any and all steps necessary to obtain
all authorizations, clearances, consents, orders, waivers and other approvals
of, and file all notices with, all Governmental Bodies and officials that may
be or become necessary for the execution, delivery or performance of, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement and will
cooperate fully with the other Parties hereto in promptly seeking to obtain
all such authorizations, clearances, consents, orders, waivers and other
approvals and filing such notices;  _provided_ that neither Parent nor any of
its Affiliates shall be obligated to (and, without Parents prior written
consent, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall) (x) enter into
any settlement, undertaking, consent decree, stipulation or agreement with
any Governmental Body in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
to divest, license, dispose of, transfer or otherwise hold separate (including
by establishing a trust or otherwise), with respect to, any of its, the
Companys or any Company Subsidiarys or any of their respective Affiliates
businesses, assets or properties (or any portion thereof), or (y) accept any
condition, limitation, obligation, commitment or requirement or take any
other action imposed or proposed by any Governmental Body that materially
restricts or limits its, the Companys, any Company Subsidiarys or any of
their Affiliates freedom of action or operation of their
respective businesses at such time or in the future.

7.05 _Conditions_. Subject to _Section 7.04(d)_ , Parent will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions set forth in _Section 3.02_
to be satisfied and to consummate the transactions contemplated herein as soon
as reasonably possible after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in  _Article III_ (other than those to be satisfied at the Closing).

7.06 _Acknowledgment of Parent and Merger Sub_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges
that it has

 



43  conducted to its satisfaction, an independent investigation of the financial
condition, results of operations, assets, liabilities, properties and
projected operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries in making its
determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and Parent and Merger Sub have relied and will rely solely on the results of
their own independent investigation and the representations and warranties of
the Company expressly and specifically set forth in _Article IV_, as
qualified by the Disclosure Schedules, and of the Stockholders in the Letters
of Transmittal, Support Agreements and Restrictive Covenant Agreements and
the Optionholders in the Option Cancellation Agreements and Restrictive
Covenant Agreements. In connection with Parents and Merger Subs
investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, each of Parent and Merger
Sub has received or may receive from the Company and its Subsidiaries certain
projections, forward looking statements, other forecasts, including projected
statements of operating revenues and income from operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, and certain business plan information. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to
make such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, that each of
Parent and Merger Sub is familiar with such uncertainties and that each of
Parent and Merger Sub is taking full responsibility for making its own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and
other forecasts and plans so furnished to it (including, without limitation,
the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts and plans). Accordingly, each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby
represents, warrants, covenants, acknowledges and agrees that (a) none of
the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Stockholders or the Optionholders, nor any
member, partner, officer, director, employee or agent of any of the foregoing,
whether in an individual, corporate or any other capacity, is making any
representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections and
other forecasts and plans (including, without limitation, the reasonableness
of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts and
plans) and (b) each of Parent and Merger Sub expressly and irrevocably
acknowledges that it is not relying on, such estimates, projections, forecasts
or plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
estimates, projections, forecasts or plans) or any representations,
warranties or statements (including by omission) of the Company, its
Subsidiaries, the Stockholders or the Optionholders or any member, partner,
officer, director, employee or agent of any of the foregoing.

applicable Law, treat the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable period
of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Tax purposes. Parent shall cause
the Company and its Subsidiaries to join Parents "group" (as defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(h)) effective on the day after the
Closing Date. The parties agree that the Parent and its Affiliates and the
Company and its Subsidiaries (A) shall not make an election under

make any similar election or ratably allocate items under any corresponding
provision of state, local or foreign law) and (B) shall not apply the "next
day" rule of Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) with respect to any

9.03 _280G_. The Company shall, prior to the Closing Date, seek to obtain the

or Parent or its Affiliates with respect to arrangements in place at the
Closing that would, absent Stockholder approval, be excess parachute payments
as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that to the extent that any contract, agreement, or plan is entered into by
Parent, the Company or any of their Affiliates and a "disqualified individual"
(as defined in Section 280G of the Code) in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on or before the Closing Date, Parent shall
provide a copy of such contract, agreement or plan to the Company and the
Representative at least 15 days before the Closing Date and shall cooperate
with the Company in good faith in order to calculate or determine the value
(for the purposes of Section 280G of the Code) of any payments or benefits
granted or contemplated therein, which may be paid or granted in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that could constitute a
"parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code. Prior to such Stockholder
approval, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
waivers from such individuals, such that unless such payments are approved by
the Stockholders to the extent and in the manner required under Sections
280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) and 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, no such waived

 



48  payments shall be made. For the avoidance of doubt, the Closing shall not be
conditioned on such vote described in this _Section 9.03_ occurring or
receiving Stockholder approval for any such payments.

9.04 _401(k) Plan Termination_. If directed by Parent in writing at least ten
(10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, effective no later than the day

Closing, the Company and any Company Subsidiary, as applicable, shall cause to
be adopted resolutions terminating each plan intended to include a Code
Section 401(k) arrangement (each, a " _401(k) Plan_ ") and shall provide
Parent with copies of such adopted resolutions. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Closing (and after all required testing has been
performed and corrective contributions and distributions, if any, have been
made), but in no event later than the one-year anniversary of the Closing
Date, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and the
applicable Company Subsidiaries, to take all actions necessary to wind up
each 401(k) Plan that is so terminated. If any amounts accrued under any
401(k) Plan are withheld from such 401(k) Plan participants paychecks three
(3) Business Days or less prior to the Closing Date, and if such amounts are
not remitted to such 401(k) Plan by the Company or the applicable Company
Subsidiary prior to the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
or the applicable Company Subsidiary to remit such amounts to such 401(k)
Plan. Parent shall (i) permit each Company Employee who was a participant in
or eligible to participate in any 401(k) Plan prior to the Closing to
immediately following the Closing be eligible to participate in a tax-
qualified defined contribution retirement plan established or designated by
Parent (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ "); _provided_ , that such Company Employee
meets the eligibility criteria of the Parent 401(k) Plan, and (ii) take any
and all actions as may be required to permit each Company Employee to make
rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, and including plan loans) to the
Parent 401(k) Plan in an amount equal to the eligible rollover distribution
portion of the account balance distributed to such Company Employee from any
401(k) Plan (including plan loans).

 

9.05 _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested by any
party hereto and at such partys expense, any other party will execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and
instruments and will take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other
actions as such requesting party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable
to evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

9.06 _Disclosure Generally_. All Disclosure Schedules attached hereto are
incorporated herein and expressly made a part of this Agreement as though
completely set forth herein. The parties hereto agree that any reference in a
particular Section of the Disclosure Schedules shall only be deemed to be
an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (i) the
representations and warranties of the Company that are contained in the
corresponding Section of this Agreement and (ii) if any other representations

the face of such disclosure. Subject to the prior sentence, all references to
this Agreement herein or in any of the Disclosure Schedules will be deemed to
refer to this entire Agreement, including all Disclosure Schedules.

Subsidiaries and (B) each and any Stockholder, Optionholder and their
respective Affiliates (individually and collectively, the Persons described
in this clause (B), the " _Stockholder Group_ ") have retained Kirkland and
Ellis LLP (" _Law Firm_ ") to act as their counsel in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, and delivery of this Agreement and
related agreements, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby (the " _Transaction_ "), (ii) Law Firm has not acted as
counsel for any other Person in connection with the Transaction, and (iii) no
Person other than the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Stockholder Group has
the status of a Law Firm client for conflict of interest or any other purpose
as a result thereof. Parent, its own behalf and on behalf of its
directors, members, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, (1) waives
and will not assert, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries (including, after
Closing, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries) to waive and not assert,
any conflict of interest relating to Law Firms representation after the
Closing of any member of the Stockholder Group in any matter involving the
Transaction (including any litigation, arbitration, mediation, or other
proceeding), and (2) consents to, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries
(including, after Closing, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries) to
consent to, any such representation, even though in each case (x) the
interests of such member of the Stockholder Group may be directly adverse to
Parent, the Surviving Company, or any of their Subsidiaries, (y) Law Firm may
have represented the Company or its Subsidiaries in a substantially related
matter, or (z) Law Firm may be handling other ongoing matters for Parent, the
Surviving Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

nor any of their Subsidiaries will have any right to access or control any of

the property of (and be controlled by) Representative. In addition, Parent
agrees that it would be impractical to remove all Attorney-Client
Communications from the records (including e-mails and other electronic files)
of Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries. Accordingly, Parent will not, and
will cause each of its Subsidiaries (including, after Closing, the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries) not to, use any Attorney-Client Communication
remaining in the records of Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries
after Closing in a manner that may be adverse to any member of the Stockholder
Group.

(c) _Retention of Attorney-Client Privilege with Respect to Sell-Side
Acquisition Legal Representation_. Parent agrees, on its own behalf and on
behalf of its Subsidiaries (including, after Closing, the Surviving Company
and its Subsidiaries), that from and after Closing (a) the attorney-client
privilege, all other evidentiary privileges, and the expectation of client
confidence as to all Attorney-Client Communications belong to the Stockholder
Group and will not pass to or be claimed by Parent, the Surviving Company, or
any of their Subsidiaries, and (b) the Representative will have the exclusive
right to control, assert, or waive the attorney-client privilege, any other
evidentiary privilege, and the expectation of client confidence with respect
to such Attorney-Client Communications. Accordingly, Parent will not, and will
cause each of its Subsidiaries (including, after Closing, the Surviving
Company and its

 



50  Subsidiaries) not to, (x) assert any attorney-client privilege, other
evidentiary privilege, or expectation of client confidence with respect to any
Attorney-Client Communication, except in the event of a post-Closing dispute
with a Person that is not a member of the Stockholder Group; or (y) take any
action which could cause any Attorney-Client Communication to cease being a
confidential communication or to otherwise lose protection under the
attorney-client privilege or any other evidentiary privilege, including
waiving such protection in any dispute with a Person that is not a member of
the Stockholder Group. Furthermore, Parent agrees, on its own behalf and
on behalf of each of its Subsidiaries (including, after Closing, the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries), that in the event of a dispute
between any member of the Stockholder Group on the one hand and Surviving
Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the other arising out of or relating to
any matter in which Law Firm jointly represented both parties, neither the
attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client confidence, nor any right
to any other evidentiary privilege will protect from disclosure to such
member of the Stockholder Group any information or documents developed or
shared during the course of Law Firms joint representation.

 

9.08 _Advisory Agreements_. The Representative, on its own behalf in respect
of the TB Advisory Agreement, and on behalf of Thoma Bravo Partners X, L.P.

included in the calculation of Company Working Capital or Transaction

instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments
hereto or thereto, to the extent delivered by means of a facsimile machine or
electronic mail (any such delivery, an " _Electronic Delivery_ "), will be

will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the
original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any
party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument, each other party hereto
or thereto will re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all
other parties. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument will
raise the use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that
any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated
through the use of Electronic Delivery as a defense to the formation of a
contract, and each such party forever waives any such defense, except to the
extent such defense related to lack of authenticity. 

 



68 12.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts
(including by means of telecopied signature pages or electronic transmission
in portable document format (pdf)), any one of which need not contain the
signatures of more than one party, but all such counterparts taken together

12.16 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action
(whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of
or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with
this Agreement) will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements executed and
performed entirely within such State.

 

12.17 _Specific Performance_. The Parties to agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached, and that money damages or legal remedies would not be an adequate
remedy for any such damages. Therefore, it is accordingly agreed that each
Party shall be entitled to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations
of any other Party, in any court of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate
injunctive relief shall be granted in connection therewith. Any Party seeking

to be paid hereunder will be paid in United States currency and, except as
otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, without discount, rebate or
reduction and subject to no counterclaim or offset, on the dates specified
herein (with time being of the essence). In the event any Legal Proceeding is
commenced or threatened by any Person (the " _Claiming Party_ ") to enforce
its rights under this Agreement against any other Person (the " _Defending
Party_ "), if the Defending Party is the prevailing party in such Legal
Proceeding, all fees, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees
and court costs, incurred by the Defending Party in such Legal Proceeding
will be reimbursed by the Claiming Party; _provided_ that if the Defending
Party prevails in part, and loses in part, in such Legal Proceeding, the
court, arbitrator or other adjudicator presiding over such Legal Proceeding
will award a reimbursement of the fees, costs and expenses incurred by the
Defending Party on an equitable basis. For purposes hereof, and without
limitation, the Defending Party will be deemed to have prevailed in any Legal
Proceeding described in the immediately preceding sentence if the Claiming
Party commences or threatens any such Legal Proceeding and (i) such underlying
claim(s) are subsequently dropped, voluntarily dismissed or voluntarily
reduced and/or (ii) the Defending Party defeats any such claim(s).

funds in payment for such expenses;

 

(v) to do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of the
Stockholders and the Optionholders that the Representative deems necessary or
appropriate in its sole discretion relating to the subject matter of this

(vi) to receive service of process in connection with any claims under this
Agreement.

 

(c) In the event that the Representative becomes unable to perform its
responsibilities hereunder or resigns from such position, the Stockholders
and the Optionholders (or, if applicable, their respective heirs, legal
representatives, successors and assigns) who held a majority of the voting
power represented by the Common Shares issued and outstanding 

 



70  immediately prior to the Effective Time, will select another representative
to fill such vacancy and such substituted representative will be deemed to be
the Representative for all purposes of this Agreement.

settlement of any claim or liability in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, will be binding upon all of the Stockholders
and Optionholders, and no Stockholder or Optionholder will have the right to
object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

Indemnified Parties will be able to rely conclusively on the instructions and
decisions of the Representative and treat the Representative as the duty
appointed representative of the Stockholders and Optionholders and any
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Representative as being the
decision, act, consent or instruction of each Stockholder or Optionholder, as
applicable. Parent, the Company and the other Parent Indemnified Parties may,
and the Escrow Agent and the Paying Agent shall, disregard any notice or
instruction received directly from any Stockholder or Optionholder, other

hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by them in
accordance with any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Representative. Each Stockholder and Optionholder hereby agrees that for any
Legal Proceeding arising under this Agreement or any other agreements
ancillary hereto, such Stockholder or Optionholder, as applicable, may be
served legal process by registered mail to the address set forth in _Section
12.04_ for the Representative (or any alternative address designated to the
parties in writing by the Representative), and that service in such manner
shall be adequate and such Stockholder or Optionholder shall not assert any
defense of claim that service in such manner was not adequate or sufficient in
any court in any jurisdiction.

 

(f) All actions, decisions and instructions of the Representative will be
conclusive and binding upon all of the Stockholders and Optionholders, and no
Stockholder or Optionholder will have any cause of action against the
Representative for any action taken or not taken, decision made or instruction
given by the Representative under this Agreement, except for fraud or
willful misconduct by the Representative;

(g) The provisions of this _Section 12.19_ are independent and severable, are
irrevocable and coupled with an interest and will be enforceable
notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Stockholder or Optionholder
may have in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
and

 

(h) The provisions of this _Section 12.19_ will be binding upon the heirs,
legal representatives, successors and assigns of each Stockholder and
Optionholder, and any references in this Agreement to a Stockholder or an
Optionholder or the Stockholders or Optionholders will mean and include the
successors to the rights of the Stockholders and Optionholders hereunder,
whether pursuant to testamentary disposition, the Laws of descent and
distribution or otherwise.

liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by
statute) for any claims, causes of action, obligations, or liabilities arising
under, out of, in connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby or based on, in respect of, or by
reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance, or breach

against any such Nonparty Persons. Without limiting the foregoing, to the
maximum extent permitted by Law, except to the extent otherwise set forth in

beneficiaries of this _Section 12.20(a)_.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing and subject to the last sentence hereof,
effective as of Closing, except for any rights or obligations under this
Agreement (in particular claims pursuant to _Article X_ or with respect to any
Shortfall Consideration or any Specified Matters) or the ancillary agreements
hereto or any other contractual rights that survive the Closing in accordance
with the terms hereof, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation (each a "
_Releasor_ "), on behalf of itself and its respective officers, directors,
equityholders, Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and each of their respective
successors and assigns, hereby releases, acquits and forever discharges, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, each of the Stockholders
and Optionholders, the Representative, and each of their respective past,
present and future officers, managers, directors, equityholders, partners,

damages, judgments, debts, dues and suits of every kind, nature and
description whatsoever arising out of (i) this Agreement, (ii) the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Releasees
relationship with the Company or any Company Subsidiary prior to the Closing
or (d) the operation of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their
respective businesses prior to the Closing; _provided_ that nothing in this

the employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, limit any claims
against any such employee of the Company or any Company

 



72  Subsidiary for willful misconduct, embezzlement or other damages caused in
the performance of his or her duties in his or her capacity as such. Each
Releasor agrees not to, and agrees to cause its respective officers,
directors, equityholders, Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and each of their
respective successors and assigns, not to, assert any claim against the
Releasees.
