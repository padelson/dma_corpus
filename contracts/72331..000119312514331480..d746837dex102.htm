2.1 _The Merger; Closing_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company.
Following the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving entity in the
Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Entity_ ") and
shall succeed to and assume all of the rights and obligations of Merger Sub
and the Company in accordance with the DGCL. The Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are collectively referred
to herein as the " _Transactions_ ," and this Agreement and each other
agreement entered into in connection with the Transactions, including the
Escrow Agreement, the Non-Solicitation Agreement, the Written Consent and the
Letter of Transmittal are collectively referred to herein as the "
_Transaction Documents_."

(b) The closing for the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the
offices of Arnold and Porter LLP, 555 12th Street, NW, Washington, DC 20004, at
10:00 A.M. (Eastern Time) on the second Business Day (the " _Closing Date_ ")
following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions of the parties to
consummate the Transactions (other than the conditions with respect to actions
the respective parties will take at the Closing itself, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) or at such other place or on such
other date or time as is mutually agreed to by Parent and the Company;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Closing will not in any event occur prior
to August 8, 2014 (and the Parties current intent is that the Closing will
occur on August 8, 2014).

 



15 (c) On the Closing Date, the Company and Parent shall cause a Certificate of
Merger in the form of _Exhibit A_ attached hereto (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective at the time when the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as may
be agreed by the Parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the "
_Effective Time_ ").

(d) The certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended at the
Effective Time to read substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_ attached
hereto and, as so amended, such certificate shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Entity until thereafter changed or amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law.

 

(e) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the directors of the Surviving Entity, effective as of the Effective Time,
until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

 

(f) The individuals set forth on _Schedule 2.1(f)_ shall be the officers of

of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

 

(g) The bylaws of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the bylaws of the Surviving Entity, effective as of the Effective Time, until
the change or amendment thereof as provided therein or under applicable Law.

2.2 _Effect on Capital Stock of Merger Sub and Parent_. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Securityholders or
the holders of equity interests of Merger Sub:

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, all of the issued
and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and
become one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding capital stock
of the Company.

(b)  _Cancellation of Company Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, each
share of Company Capital Stock issued by the Company and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (i) held in the treasury of the
Company or (ii) owned by a Subsidiary of the Company (the shares referenced
in clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ "), shall cease
to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and retired without any
conversion thereof and without payment of any consideration therefor and
shall cease to exist.

(c) _Company Capital Stock_. Subject to  _Section 2.4_ and _Section 2.5_,
at the Effective Time, each share of Company Capital Stock issued by the
Company and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
any Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted (with such
number of shares of Preferred Stock calculated, for this purpose, by treating
the shares of Preferred Stock as having been converted into outstanding shares
of Class A Common Stock without the need for actual conversion (and without
having been

 



16  actually converted) pursuant to the Charter) into the right to receive cash
in an amount equal to (x) (i) the Merger Consideration plus (ii) the Aggregate
Option Exercise Amount,  _divided_ by (y) the Fully Diluted Common Shares.

(d) _No Further Rights_. All Company Capital Stock issued by the Company,
when cancelled and/or converted pursuant to this _Section 2.2_, shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired, and
each Securityholder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the amount of cash consideration with respect to
such Company Capital Stock set forth in this Agreement.

(e)  _Dissenting Shares_. The Dissenting Shares shall cease to exist and
shall be automatically retired, and each holder of a certificate that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented Dissenting Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect to Company Capital Stock other than as
described in _Section 2.5_.

(f) _No Further Transfers_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of Company Capital Stock shall
thereafter be made.

 

2.3 _Payments and Distributions on the Closing Date_.

 

(a) _Stockholder and Certain Other Payments_. At the Closing, Parent shall pay
by wire transfer in immediately available funds:

 

(i) to each holder of Common Stock, an amount equal to the Estimated Price Per
Share multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock (other than
Dissenting Shares) owned by such holder;

(ii) to each holder of Preferred Stock, an amount equal to the Estimated
Price Per Share multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock (other than
Dissenting Shares) into which the shares of Preferred Stock owned by such
holder are convertible as of immediately prior to the Effective Time;

 

(iii) to PNC Bank, N.A. (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), an amount equal to the
Escrow Amount for deposit into an escrow account (the " _Escrow Fund_ "), to
be held for the Survival Period (subject to any then-pending claims made in
accordance with this Agreement) and distributed as provided in an escrow
agreement substantially in the form of _Exhibit C_ attached hereto, to be
entered into at Closing by Parent, the Escrow Agent and the Securityholders
Representative (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ");

 

(iv) to the Securityholders Representative, cash in an amount equal to the
Securityholders Representative Amount to be applied in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement;

(v) the Estimated Transaction Expenses other than the SAR Payments (which are
payable pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_), to the extent not paid by the Company
and/or its Affiliates prior to the Closing;

 



17 (vi) on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to the appropriate Persons
in accordance with the wire instructions set forth on the applicable schedule
indicated below and the payoff letter delivered at or prior to Closing, all
Indebtedness and other obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries set
forth on _Schedule 7.1(d)_ , which shall be delivered to Parent no later than
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (the " _Estimated
Indebtedness Payment_ "); and

 

(vii) the payments set forth in _Sections 2.3(b)_ and _2.3(c)_.

 

(b) _SAR Payments_. At Closing, Parent will pay to the Company an amount (the
" _Initial SAR Payment Amount_ ") equal to (x) the aggregate amount of the
SAR Payments _minus_ (y) the sum of (A) the SAR Recipients Pro Rata Shares of
the Securityholders Representative Amount _plus_ (B) the SAR Recipients Pro
Rata Share of the Escrow Amount, and following such payment, the Company will
pay promptly (but in no event later than seven (7) Business Days) by wire
transfer or direct deposit to each SAR Recipient his or her respective portion
of the Initial SAR Payment Amount (subject to any applicable employee Taxes
and withholdings), and the Company shall remit the portion of the Initial SAR
Payment Amount that is withheld for Taxes to the appropriate Governmental
Bodies. For the avoidance of doubt, the SAR Recipients will not be entitled
to participate in the distribution (if any) of the "Adjustment Amount" to the
Securityholders in accordance with _Section 2.6(d)_. The Company shall
terminate the SAR Plan as of the Closing such that no new award may be made
thereunder.

(c) _Option Cancellation Payments_. The Company shall cause each Eligible
Option to be cancelled, as of the Closing, in exchange for the Eligible
Optionholder being entitled to receive an amount in cash (subject to any
applicable employee Taxes and withholdings) equal to the product of (i) the
total number of Option Shares subject to such cancelled Eligible Option and
(ii) the Estimated Price Per Share less the applicable exercise price per
share of such Eligible Option (the aggregate of such amounts for all Eligible
Options, the " _Option Cancellation Amount_ "). The Company shall cause each
Option that is not an Eligible Option, if any, to be cancelled without
consideration as of the Closing, and shall terminate the Option Plan as of the
Closing such that no new award may be made thereunder. At Closing, Parent
will pay to the Company an amount equal to the Option Cancellation Amount, and
following such payment the Company will pay promptly (but in no event later
than seven (7) Business Days) by wire transfer or direct deposit to each
Eligible Optionholder his or her respective portion of the Option Cancellation
Amount (subject to any applicable employee Taxes and withholdings), and the
Company shall remit the portion of the Option Cancellation Amount that
is withheld for Taxes to the appropriate Governmental Bodies. From and after
the Effective Time, no Option shall be exercisable, and each Option shall only
entitle the holder thereof to receive the amount of cash consideration with
respect to such Option set forth in this Agreement.

2.4 _Mechanism of Payment and Delivery of Certificates_.

 

(a) Upon delivery to Parent of a Certificate, together with a Letter of
Transmittal covering such Certificate and duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive at the Closing (or, such Certificate and Letter of
Transmittal are delivered after the Closing, no later than three (3) Business
Days after the delivery to Parent of such Certificate and Letter of
Transmittal), in

 



18  exchange therefor, cash in the amount calculated pursuant to _Section
2.3(a)(i)_ and/or _(ii)_ for the Company Capital Stock evidenced by such
Certificate, which amount shall be paid by wire transfer in accordance with
the instructions provided by such holder. No interest or dividends will be
paid or accrued on the consideration payable upon the delivery or transfer of
any Certificate. If the consideration provided for herein is to be delivered
in the name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate
was delivered, it shall be a condition of such delivery that the Certificate
so delivered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer. Until delivered in accordance with the provisions of this _Section
2.4(a)_, each Certificate (other than for Dissenting Shares and Excluded
Shares) shall represent, for all purposes, only the right to receive cash in
the amount set forth in this Agreement in respect of the Company Capital
Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate, without any interest thereon.

 

(b) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making and delivery to Parent of an affidavit of loss and indemnity
(in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent) of that fact by the
Person (who shall be the record owner of such Certificate) claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the making by such Person of a
customary indemnity, Parent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Securityholders amount payable for shares of
Company Capital Stock represented by such Certificate pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement.

 

2.5 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Capital Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and that are held by the holders of Company Capital Stock who shall have
not voted in favor of the Merger and who shall have demanded properly in
writing appraisal for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into,
or represent the right to receive, any portion of the amount payable for
shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
Such holders of Company Capital Stock shall be entitled to receive payment of
the appraised value of such shares of Company Capital Stock held by them in
accordance with the provisions of such Section 262, except that all Dissenting
Shares held by the holders of Company Capital Stock who shall have failed to
perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to
appraisal of such shares under such Section 262 shall thereupon be deemed to
have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive any portion of the amount payable for
shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided herein,
of the Certificate or Certificates that formerly evidenced such shares,
together with such Letter of Transmittal duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto.

 

(b) The Company shall (i) give Parent and the Securityholders Representative
prompt written notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company, and (ii) at the Closing, deliver to Parent a
certificate listing the names and addresses of each holder of Company Capital
Stock who has demanded appraisal rights, and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company. Parent shall have the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands
for 

 



19  appraisal under the DGCL. Parent may, without the prior written consent of
the Securityholders Representative, make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands. Prior to
the Closing, except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company will
not make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such
demands.

 

2.6 _Post-Closing Adjustments_.

 

(a) _Estimated Statement_. No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent (i) a statement
(the " _Estimated Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail the
Companys good faith estimate of (A) Closing Date Working Capital (such
estimate, " _Estimated Closing Working Capital_ ") and resulting calculation
of the Working Capital Initial Adjustment Amount, (B) the Actual Closing Cash
(such estimate, " _Estimated Closing Cash_ "), (C) the Indebtedness Amount
(such estimate, the " _Estimated Indebtedness Amount_ "), and (D) the Actual
Transaction Expenses (such estimate, " _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ "),
which such Estimated Statement shall be prepared on a consolidated basis in
accordance with the Accounting Standards, and (ii) the Companys estimated
calculation of the Merger Consideration as a result of the estimates described
in the foregoing clause (i) (such estimate, " _Estimated Merger
Consideration_ ").

(b) _Draft Computation; Merger Consideration Calculation_. As soon as
reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any event within
sixty (60) calendar days thereof, Parent shall cause to be prepared and
delivered to the Securityholders Representative the following (collectively,
the " _Draft Computation_ "): (i) a statement of its calculation of the
Working Capital Adjustment Amount, the Actual Closing Cash, the Indebtedness
Amount, and the Actual Transaction Expenses and (ii) its calculation of the
Merger Consideration as a result of the calculations described in the
foregoing clauses. The Draft Computation shall be prepared on a consolidated
basis in accordance with the Accounting Standards. The parties agree that the
purposes of preparing the Draft Computation and determining the related
purchase price adjustment contemplated by this _Section 2.6_ are to measure
the amount of Actual Closing Cash, the Indebtedness Amount, the Actual
Transaction Expenses and any changes in Net Working Capital, and such
processes are not intended to permit the introduction of (and no party shall
be permitted to introduce) different judgments, accounting methods, policies,
principles, practices, procedures, classifications or
estimation methodologies than those reflected in the Accounting Standards,
but instead to require that each calculation be done in a manner consistent
with the Accounting Standards. From and after the Closing Date until the
Determination Date (as defined below), Parent will make available to the
Securityholders Representative and its auditors, promptly upon the request of
the Securityholders Representative, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice, all employees and advisors relevant to the preparation of
the calculations reflected in the Draft Computation and all records and work
papers reflected in the Draft Computation.

 

(c) _Determination Procedures_. Within sixty (60) calendar days after its
receipt of the Draft Computation, the Securityholders Representative shall
provide Parent with a written notice of any disagreement with the Draft
Computation setting forth in reasonable detail those items and amounts that
the Securityholders Representative disputes (the " _Dispute Notice_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that any Dispute Notice may only include objections
based on the

 



20  Securityholders Representatives belief that (x) the Draft Computation
included assumptions or applied principles that conflict with the Accounting
Standards, this  _Section 2.6(c)_ and/or the applicable definitions in this
Agreement or otherwise was not determined in accordance with the Accounting
Standards, _Section 2.6(c)_ and/or the applicable definitions in this
Agreement and/or (y) the Draft Computation contained mathematical errors. If
the Securityholders Representative delivers a Dispute Notice with respect to
some, but not all, of the items or amounts included in the Draft Computation
within such 60-day period, then the Securityholders Representative shall be
deemed to have agreed with Parents calculations of all items and amounts set
forth in the Draft Computation that were not disputed in such duly and timely
delivered Dispute Notice. If no such Dispute Notice is received by Parent on
or prior to the close of business on the last day of such sixty (60) calendar
day period, the Draft Computation and the calculation of Working Capital
Adjustment Amount, Actual Closing Cash, the Indebtedness Amount, the Actual
Transaction Expenses and the Merger Consideration set forth therein shall be
deemed accepted by the Securityholders Representative. If any such Dispute
Notice is timely provided, Parent and the Securityholders Representative
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts for a period of thirty (30)
days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree in writing) to resolve
any disagreements with respect to the Draft Computation or the calculation of
the Working Capital Adjustment Amount, Actual Closing Cash, the Indebtedness
Amount, the Actual Transaction Expenses or the Merger Consideration. If, at
the end of such period, they are unable to resolve such disagreements, then
the Independent Accounting Firm shall resolve any remaining disagreements.
Parent and the Securityholders Representative shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accounting Firm to review those
items or amounts remaining in dispute as promptly as practicable, but in any
event within thirty (30) days of the date on which such Dispute Notice is
referred to the Independent Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm
will review only those items and amounts specifically set forth and objected
to in the Dispute Notice and resolve the dispute with respect to each such
specific item and amount in accordance with the Accounting Standards. The
scope of the disputes to be arbitrated by the Independent Accounting Firm is
limited to whether the Draft Computation or the calculation of Working Capital
Adjustment Amount, Actual Closing Cash, the Indebtedness Amount, the Actual
Transaction Expenses and the Merger Consideration were done in a manner
consistent with the Accounting Standards, the principles set forth in this
_Section 2.6(c)_ and the applicable definitions in this Agreement, and
whether there were mathematical errors in determining the Working Capital
Adjustment Amount, Actual Closing Cash, the Indebtedness Amount, the Actual
Transaction Expenses or the Merger Consideration, and the Independent
Accounting Firm is not to make any other determination, including any
determination as to whether the Target Working Capital is correct. The fees,
costs and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be allocated to
Parent based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not
awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested by such party,
as determined by the Independent Accounting Firm (the " _Accounting Firm
Allocation_ "). Solely by way of illustration, if Parent claims before the
Independent Accounting Firm that the determination of Net Working Capital as
of the Closing Date is $1,000,000, and the Securityholders Representative
claims before the Independent Accounting Firm that the determination of Net
Working Capital as of the Closing Date is $1,500,000, and if the Independent
Accounting Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding Parent $300,000 of
the $500,000 difference, then the costs and expenses of the Independent
Accounting Firm will be allocated 60% ( _i.e_., 300,000 ÷ 500,000) to the
Securityholders Representative (on behalf of

 



21  the Securityholders) and 40% ( _i.e_., 200,000 ÷ 500,000) to Parent. Parent
and the Securityholders Representative, on behalf of the Securityholders,
will retain the Independent Accounting Firm and each pay 50% of any retainer.
During the engagement, the Independent Accounting Firm will bill 50% of the
total charges to Parent and 50% of the total charges to the Securityholders
Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders), and Parent and the
Securityholders Representative shall each timely pay or cause to be paid such
amounts. The Accounting Firm Allocation will be settled by Parent and the
Securityholders Representative in a manner consistent with such allocation
within ten (10) days after the Determination Date. The determination of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be set forth in a written statement
delivered to the Securityholders Representative and Parent and shall be
final, conclusive and binding on the parties, absent fraud or manifest error.
The date on which the Draft Computation and the Working Capital Adjustment
Amount, Actual Closing Cash, the Indebtedness Amount, Actual Transaction
Expenses and the Merger Consideration are finally determined in accordance
with this _Section 2.6(c)_ or _Section 2.6(e)_ is hereinafter referred to as
the " _Determination Date_."

 

(d) _Adjustment Amount_. The " _Adjustment Amount_ " means the difference
between (i) the Merger Consideration (taking into consideration the final
agreements or determinations as to the Draft Computation, Working Capital
Adjustment Amount, Actual Closing Cash, the Indebtedness Amount, and the
Actual Transaction Expenses pursuant to this  _Section 2.6_) and (ii) the
Estimated Merger Consideration.

(i) If the Merger Consideration as finally determined under this _Section
2.6_ exceeds the Estimated Merger Consideration, then promptly, and in any
event within five (5) Business Days following the Determination Date, Parent
shall pay to the Securityholders Representative (or to the Securityholders,
as directed by the Securityholders Representative), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the
Securityholders Representative, the amount equal to the Adjustment Amount
(with amounts being distributed to each Securityholder, net of any withholding
Taxes, in accordance with instructions from the Securityholders
Representative).

 

(ii) If the Estimated Merger Consideration exceeds the Merger Consideration as
finally determined under this  _Section 2.6_, then promptly, and in any
event within five (5) Business Days following the Determination Date, Parent
and the Securityholders Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent to pay to
Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by Parent, from the Escrow Fund an amount equal to the
absolute value of the Adjustment Amount (such amount, the " _Parent Adjustment
Amount_ ").

 

(e) _Non-Delivery of Draft Computation_. If, for any reason, Parent fails to
deliver the Draft Computation within the time period required by _Section
2.6(b)_, the amounts of the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount,
Estimated Indebtedness Amount, Estimated Transaction Expenses, Estimated
Closing Cash and Estimated Merger Consideration delivered by the Company to
Parent provided in the Estimated Statement shall be considered for all
purposes of this Agreement as being Parents "Draft Computation" and the
Securityholders Representative shall have all of its rights under this 
_Section 2.6_ with respect to such computation (including the rights to seek
information relating to and/or to challenge such computation).

 



22 2.7 _Securityholders  Representative_.

 

(a) _Appointment_. The Securityholders Representative has been (or will be
pursuant to the Letter of Transmittal) appointed, authorized and empowered to

on behalf of the Securityholders, any and all consents, waivers, amendments or

respect to such dispute or remedy; and (ix) engaging attorneys, accountants,
agents or consultants on behalf of the Securityholders in connection with this

(b) _Authorization_. Notwithstanding _Section 2.7(a)_, in the event that the
Securityholders Representative, with the advice of counsel, is of the opinion
that it requires further authorization or advice from the Securityholders with
respect to any matters concerning this Agreement, the Securityholders
Representative shall be entitled to seek such further authorization from, and
to confer with, the Securityholders prior to acting on their behalf. The
Securityholders Representative may obtain such further authorization (i) at
a meeting of the Securityholders, called by the Securityholders
Representative with at least five days advance notice in writing, at which the
holders of a majority of votes referred to in the next sentence are present
and approve such authorization or (ii) in the form of a writing executed by a
majority of the number of votes referred to in the next sentence, which
writing shall thereafter be sent to each Securityholder that did not execute
such writing promptly after its execution, _provided_ that the failure to
send such writing to such Securityholder shall not render invalid or void any
such authorization. In such event, each Securityholder shall have a number of
votes equal to his, her or its Pro Rata Share multiplied by 100, and the
authorization of a majority of such number of votes shall be binding on the
Securityholders and shall constitute the authorization of the Securityholders.

 



23 (c) _Reliance_. Parent shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the
Securityholders Representative on all matters relating to this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement and any agreement with the Securityholders
Representative deemed, pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_ to be necessary or
appropriate herewith or therewith. Parent shall be fully protected in dealing
with the Securityholders Representative under this Agreement and may rely
upon the authority of the Securityholders Representative to act on behalf of
the Securityholders. Any payment by Parent to the Securityholders
Representative to the extent authorized under this Agreement shall be
considered a payment by Parent to the Securityholders. The appointment of the
Securityholders Representative is coupled with an interest and shall not be
revocable by any Securityholder in any manner or for any reason. This power of
attorney shall not be affected by the death, illness, dissolution, disability,
incapacity or other inability to act of the principal pursuant to
any applicable law.

(d) _Acts of the Securityholders  Representative_. The Securityholders
Representative may resign from its capacity as the Securityholders
Representative at any time by written notice delivered to Parent and each
Securityholder. If there is a vacancy at any time in the position of the
Securityholders Representative for any reason, such vacancy shall be filled
by the Securityholders vote in the manner contemplated by _Section 2.7(b)_.

(e) _No Liability_. The Securityholders Representative shall not be liable
to Parent or any Securityholder in its capacity as the Securityholders
Representative for any Liability of any Securityholder or for any error of

may do or refrain from doing in connection with this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement except in the case of fraud or willful misconduct by it. The
Securityholders Representative may seek the advice of reputable legal counsel
in the event of any dispute or question as to the construction of any of the
provisions of this Agreement or its duties hereunder, and it shall incur no
Liability in its capacity as the Securityholders Representative to Parent or
any Securityholder and shall be fully protected with respect to any action
taken, omitted or suffered by it in good faith in accordance with the opinion
of such counsel.

(f) _Expenses and Liabilities_. Any expenses or liabilities incurred by the
Securityholders Representative in connection with the performance of its
duties under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement shall not be the personal
obligation of the Securityholders Representative but shall be payable by the
Securityholders based on each Securityholders Pro Rata Share. The
Securityholders Representative may from time to time submit invoices to the
Securityholders covering such expenses and/or liabilities and, upon the
request of any Securityholder, the Securityholders Representative shall
provide such Securityholder with an accounting of all expenses paid. In
addition to any other rights or remedies, the Securityholders Representative
may, upon notice, offset any amounts determined by it to be owed to the
Securityholders Representative against the Securityholders Representative

liabilities incurred by the Securityholders Representative in its capacity as
the Securityholders Representative against 

 



24  such funds otherwise distributable to the Securityholders or (y) retain a
portion of such funds as additional funds to be used in the same manner as the
Securityholders Representative Amount if the Securityholders Representative
believes in good faith that such retention of funds may be necessary to
satisfy the expenses or liabilities of the Securityholders Representative
under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement;  _provided_ that the
Securityholders Representative may not retain funds from any such
distribution to the extent that the amount retained from such distribution
plus any remaining and unused portion of the Securityholders Representative
Amount would exceed the original amount of the Securityholders Representative
Amount; and _provided_ _further_ that, in the case of the foregoing clauses
(x) and (y), any amount set off or retained in accordance with such clauses
shall be set off against and/or retained from such funds otherwise

a violation or breach of the organizational documents of

 



41  Parent or Merger Sub; (b) require any Consent from any Person under any of

any of their respective properties or assets are bound; or (v) violate any
Law or Judgment.

4.5 _Judgments and Proceedings_. There are no (i) pending or
unsatisfied material Judgments binding upon or applicable to Parent or Merger
Sub or by which Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective businesses,

subsidiaries.

4.7 _Investment_. Parent is acquiring the Company Capital Stock for its own
account, for investment only, and not with a view to any resale or public
distribution thereof. Parent shall not offer to sell or otherwise dispose of
such shares in violation of any Laws applicable to any such offer, sale or
other disposition. Parent acknowledges that (a) such Company Capital Stock

respective debts as they become due and shall own property which has a fair
saleable value greater than the amounts required to pay their respective debts
(including a reasonable estimate of the amount of all contingent liabilities),
and (b) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries shall have adequate capital to
carry on their respective businesses. No transfer of property is being made
and no obligation is being incurred in connection with the Transactions with
the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud either present or future creditors of
Parent and its Subsidiaries.

with Parents and Merger Subs investigation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, Parent, Merger Sub and their Representatives have received from
the Company and its Subsidiaries (individually or through its Representatives)
certain projections, estimates and other forecasts and certain business plan
information (collectively, " _Projections_ "). Each of Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make
such Projections, that it is familiar with such uncertainties, that it is
making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all Projections so
furnished to it and any use of, or reliance by it on, such Projections shall
be at its sole risk, and without limiting any other provisions herein, that
it shall have no claim against anyone with respect thereto subject to the
limitations herein. Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that none of
the Company, the Securityholders, the Securityholders Representative or any
other Person has made any representation or warranty, expressed or implied, as

information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries furnished or
made available to Parent, Merger Sub and their Representatives or otherwise
with respect to the Securityholders or the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
their operations, business, financial condition, assets, liabilities or
prospects, except as expressly set forth in _Article 3_ of this Agreement,
and, none of the Company, the Securityholders Representative or any other
Person shall have or be subject to any Liability to Parent, Merger Sub or any

respective Representatives and Affiliates, or Parents, Merger Subs or any of
their Representatives or Affiliates use of, any such Projections, written
or oral information, and any information, documents or material made
available to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Representatives and
Affiliates in any form. Parent and Merger Sub shall acquire the Company and
its Subsidiaries without any representation or warranty as to merchantability
or fitness for any particular purpose, in an "as is" condition and on a "where
is" basis, except as otherwise expressly represented or warranted in this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this _Section 4.10_ or this Agreement shall be interpreted to

breaches of representations and warranties made by the Company in _Article 3_
of this Agreement.

4.11 _Sufficient Funds_. Parent has (and will have and cause Merger Sub to
have as of the Closing) the funds necessary to consummate the transactions

5.3 _Antitrust Filings_.

 

(a) Within five (5) Business Days following the date hereof, the Company and
Parent shall each make such premerger filings and any other filing or
notification with the Antitrust Authorities, if any, as may be required under
the Antitrust Laws, concerning the Transaction. From the date of such filing
until the Closing Date, the Company and Parent shall file all reports or
other documents required or requested by the Antitrust Authorities under the
Antitrust Laws, or otherwise and will comply promptly with any requests by the
Antitrust Authorities for additional information concerning the Transaction,
so that the waiting period specified in the Antitrust Laws will expire or
terminate as soon as reasonably possible after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement. Parent shall pay all fees required in connection with any
filing required under the Antitrust Laws, and Parent shall (and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to) use best efforts to insure that any
applicable waiting periods imposed under the Antitrust Laws terminate or
expire as early as practicable. Parents obligations under this  _Section
5.3(a)_ to use best efforts shall include, if necessary, (i) proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order, or otherwise, the sale transfer, license, divestiture or
other disposition of any entities, assets, product lines, interests, or
facilities of Parent or its Affiliates; (ii) terminating, amending or
assigning existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations; or
(iii) amending, assigning or terminating existing licenses or other

, _however_ , that any such action shall be conditioned upon the consummation
of the Merger, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, Parent (and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates) shall not be required
to take, or agree or commit to take, any such action or agree or commit to, or
effect, any such other matter described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above
that, in the reasonable judgment of Parent, would reasonably be expected to be
materially adverse to the business of Parent or the Company. Subject to the
foregoing limitations, each party agrees to use (and cause its Subsidiaries
and Affiliates to use) best efforts to cooperate and oppose any temporary
restraining order, rescission order, preliminary injunction, or hold separate
order sought by any Governmental Body to unwind, prevent, or delay the
Transactions.

(b) The Company and Parent shall furnish, or cause their respective counsel to
furnish, to each other such necessary information and reasonable assistance
as the other may reasonably request in connection with both its determination
of what filings are necessary under the Antitrust Laws and the preparation of
necessary filings or submissions under the provisions of the Antitrust Laws.
The Company and Parent will cause their respective counsel to supply to each
other copies of all correspondence, filings or written communications by or to
such party or

 



46  its Affiliates with or from any Governmental Body or staff members thereof,
with respect to the Transactions and any related or contemplated transactions,
except for information submitted in response to any request for additional
information or documents pursuant to the Antitrust Laws which reveal the
Companys or Parents negotiating objectives or strategies or purchase price
expectations.

 

5.4 _Directors  and Officers Exculpation; Indemnification_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree, for and on behalf of themselves and the
Surviving Entity, that all rights of the individuals who, on or prior to the
Closing Date, were directors, officers or managers (to the extent the entity
is a limited liability company) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _D andO Indemnitees_") to indemnification and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing
Date, as provided in the respective certificate of incorporation or bylaws or
comparable organizational documents of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries
as now in effect, and any indemnification agreements or arrangements of the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries set forth on Section 5.4 of the Disclosure
Schedule shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect
in accordance with their terms for a period of six (6) years following the
Effective Time. Such rights shall not be amended or otherwise modified for a
period of six (6) years following the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights of the DandO Indemnitees, unless such modification
is required by Law.

(b) Parent and Merger Sub, for a period of six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, shall cause (i) the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
the Surviving Entity to contain provisions no less favorable to the applicable
DandO Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of DandO Indemnitees
and indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and (ii) the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws or comparable organizational
documents of each Subsidiary of the Surviving Entity to contain provisions no
less favorable to the applicable DandO Indemnitees than the current provisions
regarding indemnification of DandO Indemnitees, which provisions in each case
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the DandO Indemnitees.

 

(c) No later than thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall
purchase for any Person who is on the date of this Agreement or who becomes
prior to the Closing Date a DandO Indemnitee a directors and officers
liability insurance "tail" or "runoff" insurance program (a " _Tail Policy_ ")
to be in effect until the end of the six (6)-year period following the
Closing Date (and for so long thereafter as any Claim is being adjudicated)
with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date (such
coverage to be on terms and conditions and for an amount no less favorable to
the Companys directors, officers and managers currently covered by such
insurance than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof). The cost of
the Tail Policy shall be borne by the Parent (for the avoidance of
doubt, such cost shall not constitute a Transaction Expense).

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.4_: (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnitee, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives; and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such DandO Indemnitee may have by Contract or otherwise.

 



47 (e) In the event that Parent or Merger Sub or the Surviving Entity or any of
their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
Merger Sub or the Surviving Entity (as the case may be) shall assume all of
the obligations thereof set forth in this  _Section 5.4_.

(f) After the Closing Date, the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Entity
under this  _Section 5.4_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a
manner as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnitee to whom this _Section 5.4_
applies without the consent of the affected DandO Indemnitee (it being expressly
agreed that the DandO Indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.4_ applies shall be
third party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.4_).

 

(g) The Parties hereby acknowledge that the DandO Indemnitees may have certain
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided
by American Capital or its Affiliates (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) (collectively, the " _AC Indemnitors_ "). Parent and Merger Sub
hereby agree that from and after the Closing Date (i) the Company, its
Subsidiaries and any of their successors or assigns are the indemnitors of
first resort ( _i.e_., its obligations to DandO Indemnitees are primary and any
obligations of the AC Indemnitors to advance expenses or to
provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by any
DandO Indemnitee are secondary), (ii) the Company, its Subsidiaries and any of
their successors or assigns shall be required to advance the full amount of
expenses incurred by any DandO Indemnitee and shall be liable for the full
amount of all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in
settlement to the extent permitted by applicable Law and by the terms of this
Agreement and the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (or any other agreement between the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any DandO Indemnitee, on the other hand),
without regard to any rights a DandO Indemnitee may have against the AC
Indemnitors and (iii) it irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases the AC
Indemnitors from any and all claims against the AC Indemnitors for
contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect
thereof. Parent and Merger Sub further agree that no advancement or payment by
the AC Indemnitors on behalf of a DandO Indemnitee with respect to any claim for
which a DandO Indemnitee seeks indemnification from the Company after
the Effective Time shall affect the foregoing and the AC Indemnitors shall
have a right of contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such
advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery of a DandO Indemnitee
against the Company. Parent and Merger Sub agree that the AC Indemnitors are
express third party beneficiaries of the terms of this _Section 5.4(g)_.

 

5.5 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, following the Closing, each
party hereto shall, from time to time, execute such further instruments and
take such other actions as any other party hereto shall reasonably request in
order to fulfill its obligations under any of the Transaction Documents, to
effectuate the purposes of the Transaction Documents and to provide for the
orderly and efficient

 



48  transition of the ownership of the Company to Parent; _provided_ , _however_
, that any actions not specifically required by other provisions of this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents shall be at the expense of the party
requesting.

5.6 _Public Announcements; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Unless required by Law (in which case each of Parent, the Company and the
Securityholders Representative shall consult with the other party prior to
any such disclosure as to the form and content of such disclosure), the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree that no public release or announcement
concerning the consummation of the Transactions and the
transactions contemplated by the other Transaction Documents shall be issued
by any such Party without the prior consent of the other Parties hereto (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, each current or former holder of Company
Capital Stock (or other Securityholder) and its Affiliates that has one or
more classes of securities listed on a national stock exchange or NASDAQ may
issue such press releases or public statements after the Closing as it issues
in the ordinary course of business.

(b) For a period of three (3) years following the date hereof, the holders of
Company Capital Stock shall not, directly or indirectly, disclose, reveal,
divulge or communicate to any Person other than its authorized officers,
directors, employees and attorneys or use or otherwise exploit for its
own benefit or for the benefit of anyone other than such holder of Company
Capital Stock, any Confidential Information (as defined below). Such holder of
Company Capital Stock shall not have any obligation to keep confidential (or
cause their officers, directors or Affiliates to keep confidential) any
Confidential Information if and to the extent disclosure thereof is
specifically required by applicable Law or in connection with a Proceeding;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event disclosure is required by
applicable Law or a Proceeding, such holder of Company Capital Stock shall, to
the extent reasonably possible, provide Parent with prompt notice of such
requirement prior to making any disclosure so that the Parent may seek an
appropriate protective order. For purposes of this _Section 5.6(b)_, "
_Confidential Information_ " means any proprietary information with respect to
the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, including methods of operation,
customer lists, products, prices, fees, costs, technology, inventions, trade
secrets, know how, software, marketing methods, plans, personnel, suppliers,
competitors, markets or other specialized information or proprietary
matters. "Confidential Information" does not include, and there shall be no
obligation hereunder with respect to, information that (i) is generally
available to the public on the date of this Agreement or (ii) becomes
generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure not
otherwise permissible hereunder. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, each current or former holder
of Company Capital Stock (or other Securityholder) and its Affiliates (i) is
authorized to disclose confidential information with respect to the Company or
its business to such Persons representatives or advisors or to a Governmental
Body, in each case, in connection with a Proceeding and/or (ii) if such
holder is a private equity fund or similar investment firm, is authorized to
disclose the following confidential financial information with respect to the
Company or the Transactions to such Persons current or prospective limited
partners or similar investors, co-investors and/or lenders: (A) purchase price
paid by parent for the Company; (B) the contemplated Merger Consideration; and
(C) such other information regarding such funds internal rate of return and
similar investment metrics with respect to its investment in the Company.

 



49 5.7 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Filing of Tax Returns_. The Securityholders Representative shall prepare
or cause to be prepared (i) all Tax Returns for the Surviving Entity and the
Subsidiaries for all taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date
and (ii) the final U.S. federal consolidated income Tax Return which includes
the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to the taxable year ending at
the end of the day on the Closing Date (such consolidated income Tax return
the " _Consolidated Tax Return_ "). All such Tax Returns shall be prepared and
filed in a manner consistent with the past practice of the Company and its
Subsidiaries unless otherwise required by applicable Law. At least thirty (30)
days prior to the date on which each such Tax Return is filed, the
Securityholders Representative shall submit such Tax Return to Parent for
its review and comment. Parent shall provide any written comments to the
Securityholders Representative not later than ten (10) days after receiving
any such Tax Return or the Consolidated Tax Return and, if written comments
are not provided within ten (10) days, Parent shall be deemed to have
accepted such Tax Return or the Consolidated Tax Return. The parties shall
attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute with respect to such Tax Return
or the Consolidated Tax Return. If the parties are unable to resolve any such
dispute at least ten (10) days prior to the date on which such Tax Return or
the Consolidated Tax Return must be filed, the dispute shall be referred to
the Independent Accounting Firm for resolution and the fees shall be shared
one-half by the Securityholders Representative and one-half by Parent. If the
Independent Accounting Firm is unable to resolve any such dispute prior to the
date on which any such Tax Return or the Consolidated Tax Return must be
filed, such Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by Parent (or, in the case
of the Consolidated Tax Return, the Securityholders Representative) subject
to amendment, if necessary, to reflect the resolution of the dispute by the
Independent Accounting Firm. Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Surviving Entity and the
Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period. At least thirty (30) days prior to the
date on which each such Tax Return is filed, Parent shall submit such Tax
Return to the Securityholders Representative for its review and comment. The
Securityholders Representative shall provide any written comments to Parent
not later than ten (10) days after receiving any such Tax Return and, if
written comments are not provided within ten (10) days, the Securityholders
Representative shall be deemed to have accepted such Tax Return. The parties
shall attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute with respect to such Tax
Return. If the parties are unable to resolve any such dispute at least ten
(10) days prior to the date on which such Tax Return must be filed, the
dispute shall be referred to the Independent Accounting Firm for resolution
and the fees shall be shared one-half by the Securityholders Representative
and one-half by Parent. If the Independent Accounting Firm is unable to
resolve any such dispute prior to the date on which any such Tax Return must
be filed, such Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by Parent subject to
amendment, if necessary, to reflect the resolution of the dispute by the
Independent Accounting Firm. No Party shall file any Tax Return for
the Surviving Entity or the Subsidiaries for any period ending prior to or
including the Closing Date (including the Consolidated Tax Return) except
pursuant to the procedures set forth in this _Section 5.7(a)_. The
Securityholders Representative (and, to the extent the Securityholders
Representative Amount has been exhausted, the Securityholders) shall pay and
shall be responsible for payment of all Taxes allocable to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period shown as due on any Tax Returns prepared pursuant to this _Section
5.7(a)_ to Parent no later than five (5) days prior to the date on which such
Tax Return must be filed. The payments due under the preceding sentence shall
be paid by the Securityholders Representative from the Securityholders
Representative Amount; _provided_

 



50  that if the Securityholders Representative Amount has been exhausted and a
balance remains for Tax payments due under the preceding sentence, the
Securityholders will have a several, and not joint, liability for payment of
such balance to the extent of its Pro Rata Share; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that (i) with respect to holders of Company Capital Stock, Parent may recover
such amounts directly from the holders of Company Capital Stock or through
the Escrow Fund at Parents sole discretion and (ii) with respect to any other
Securityholders, Parents sole recovery will be through the Escrow Fund. For
the avoidance of doubt, in no event will any Securityholder be liable under
the preceding sentence for an amount in excess of its Pro Rata Share.

(b) _Proration of Straddle Period Taxes_. In the case of Taxes that are
payable with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of any such Taxes
that is attributable to the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date
shall be:

 

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (A) based upon or related to income
or receipts, or (B) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), deemed
equal to the amount that would be payable if the Tax period of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (and each partnership in which the Company and its
Subsidiaries is a partner) ended with (and included) the Closing Date;
provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an
annual basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall
be allocated between the period ending on and including the Closing Date and
the period beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of
days in each period;

 

(ii) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to
the assets or capital of the Company or any Subsidiary, deemed to be the
amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such
Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator
of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the period ending
on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number
of calendar days in the entire period; and

 

(iii) in the case of a Tax that is (A) paid for the privilege of doing
business during a period (a " _Privilege Period_ ") and (B) computed based on
business activity occurring during an accounting period ending prior to such
Privilege Period, any reference to a "Tax period," a "tax period," or a
"taxable period" shall mean such accounting period and not such Privilege
Period.

(c) _Amended Tax Returns_. Without the prior written consent of
the Securityholders Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed, or unless otherwise required by Law, Parent
will not (i) except for Tax Returns that are filed pursuant to  _Section
5.7(a)_, file or amend or permit any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to file or amend any Tax Return relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (ii)
with respect to Tax Returns filed pursuant to  _Section 5.7(a)_, after the
date such Tax Returns are filed pursuant to _Section 5.7(a)_, amend or permit
any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to amend any such Tax Return.

 



51 (d) _Cooperation of Tax Claims and Tax Returns_. This _Section 5.7(d)_, and
not  _Section 8.5_, shall control any Tax Claim. From and after the Closing,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to notify the Securityholders
Representative in writing within five (5) Business Days of the receipt of
any correspondence regarding a potential Tax Claim, demand or claim on the
Surviving Entity with respect to Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Period that, if determined adversely to the Surviving Entity would
give rise to a Liability of any Securityholder to make a payment to Parent,
the Surviving Entity or their respective successors or assigns pursuant to
this Agreement or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to give
such notice shall not affect the indemnification provided in _Section 8.1_
or any other obligation of the Securityholders other than to the extent that
the Securityholders have been materially and actually prejudiced as a result
of such failure or the indemnification obligations or other obligations are
materially increased as a result of such failure. The Securityholders
Representative shall control any defense or settlement, compromise, admission,
or acknowledgment of any Tax Claim that relates solely to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period (including any that relates to the Consolidated Tax Return but does not
relate to any taxable period or portion thereof that ends after the Closing
Date); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Parent shall have the right (but not
the duty) to participate in the defense of such Tax Claim and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate from counsel employed by the
Securityholders Representative, and (ii) the Securityholders Representative
shall not enter into any settlement of or otherwise compromise any such Tax
Claim without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed. The Surviving Entity and
Parent shall control any defense or settlement, compromise, admission, or
acknowledgment of any Tax Claim that does not relate solely to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period, _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Securityholders
Representative shall have the right (but not the duty) to participate in the
defense of such Tax Claim and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate
from counsel employed by the Surviving Entity and Parent, and (ii) the
Surviving Entity and Parent shall not enter into any settlement of or
otherwise compromise any such Tax Claim that could result in any Liability of
any Securityholder to make a payment of Taxes pursuant to this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the Securityholders Representative,
which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed. The
Securityholders Representative, the Securityholders, the Surviving Entity,
and Parent shall reasonably cooperate, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
consultants, agents, auditors and other representatives to reasonably
cooperate in preparing and filing all Tax Returns and in resolving all
disputes and audits with respect to all taxable periods relating to Taxes
(including by maintaining and making available to each other all records
necessary in connection with Taxes and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis during normal business hours to provide additional
information or explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify at
proceedings relating to such Tax Claim). For the purposes hereof, a " _Tax
Claim_ " is any audit, claim for refund or administrative or judicial
proceeding involving any asserted Liability for Taxes of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that could give rise to a Liability of any Securityholder to
make a payment pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(e) _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added and other such Taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be
borne and paid by Parent when due, and Parent will, at its own expense, file
all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such 

 



52  Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable Law or regulation, the
Company and the Securityholders Representative, will execute and deliver, and
will cause their respective Affiliates to join in the execution and delivery
of, any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

(f) _Tax Refunds_. The amount of any refunds of Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and any amount payable to the
Company with respect to the Pre-Closing Tax Period under any tax sharing
agreement (but excluding any refund resulting from any Tax
attribute generated after the Closing Date, which refund shall be for the
account of Parent) (collectively, " _Tax Refunds_ ") shall be for the account
of the holders of Company Capital Stock. The amount of any Tax Refund of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for any Tax period beginning after the Closing
Date shall be for the account of Parent. The amount of any Tax Refund of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period shall be equitably
apportioned between Parent and the holders of Company Capital Stock in
accordance with the principles set forth in _Section 5.7(b)_. Each party
shall forward, and shall cause its Affiliates to forward, to the party
entitled to receive a Tax refund pursuant to this  _Section 5.7(f)_ the
amount of such Tax Refund within thirty (30) days after such Tax Refund is
received, net any costs, Taxes or expenses incurred by such party and its
Affiliates in procuring such refund. The counterparties to the tax sharing
agreement will, as of the Closing pursuant to a direction letter to be sent by
the Company to its counterparty in the tax sharing agreement and effective as
of the Closing (the " _Tax Sharing Direction Letter_ "), be irrevocably
authorized and directed to pay any Tax Refund payable thereunder to the
Securityholders Representative for further payment to the holders of Company
Capital Stock or for inclusion in the Securityholders Representative
Amount, as may be elected by the Securityholders Representative. For the
avoidance of doubt, any payments of any refunds of Taxes of the Company and
its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period to be made by Parent will be
net of any Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries due with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period.

(g) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing or allocation agreements,
arrangements or similar Contracts with respect to or involving the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the
Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries will not be bound thereby or
have any liability thereunder.

5.8 _Disclosure Supplements_. From time to time prior to the Closing,
the Securityholders Representative, the Company and, with respect to
disclosures given by them, any Securityholder, may disclose to Parent in
writing promptly upon the discovery thereof any matter arising after the date
hereof which, if existing on the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to be set forth or described in the Disclosure Schedule. Such
disclosures may take the form of amendments or supplements to the attached
Disclosure Schedules in the form of " _Updated Schedules_ " delivered to
Parent; _provided_ that if an Updated Schedule is delivered pursuant to this
_Section 5.8_, the Companys representations and warranties shall be deemed
modified, amended and supplemented by such Updated Schedule for purposes of
the Companys indemnification obligations set forth in _Article 8_ , but not
for purposes of satisfying the closing conditions in _Section 6.2_. For the
avoidance of doubt, no Updated Schedule shall contain any matter that existed
as of the date of this Agreement, whether or not known to the Company, the
Securityholders Representative or the Securityholders, as applicable (unless
the representation or warranty with respect to such matter is qualified by
knowledge, such as "to the Knowledge of the Company", and knowledge of such
matter is acquired after the date of this Agreement).

 



53 5.9 _WARN_. For a period of one year following the Closing Date, Parent
agrees to cause the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries to provide any
required notice under the WARN Act, or any similar Law, and to otherwise
comply with any such Law with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff"
(as defined in the WARN Act) or similar event affecting the Continuing
Employees.

5.10 _COBRA_. On and after the Closing, Parent shall cause continuation
coverage under the Section 4980B of the Code and Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title
I of ERISA, and any similar applicable state or local Law, to be provided to
each current and former employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and
each eligible beneficiary thereof, who is or becomes an "MandA qualified
beneficiary" (as defined in Section 54.4980B-9 of the Treasury Regulations) in
connection with the occurrence of the Transactions to the extent elected by
such individual.

5.11 _Employee Matters_. During the period that begins on the Closing Date and
ends on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent agrees to cause the
Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries to provide their respective employees
who remain employed with such entities following the Closing (each, a "
_Continuing Employee_ ") with wages and bonus opportunities that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the wages and bonus opportunities
in effect for such Continuing Employees as a whole as of the date of this
Agreement. As of and after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Entity and its Subsidiaries to provide each Continuing Employee with full
credit for service with the Company and its Subsidiaries earned prior to the
Closing Date (i) for eligibility purposes, except with respect to defined
benefit pension plans, and (ii) for purposes of vacation accrual and severance
benefit determinations under any plans, programs, policies and arrangements
maintained for the benefit of such Continuing Employees, in each case to the
extent recognized by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Closing Date and except as would result in a duplication of benefits. Nothing
in this _Section 5.11_ is intended to (a) represent a guarantee of
employment or otherwise restrict the authority of Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Entity or any of their respective Subsidiaries to terminate the
employment of any of their employees, subject to applicable Law, (b) create
any third-party beneficiary or other rights in any employee or former
employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of Parent, the
Company, the Surviving Entity, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any
other Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns, or (c) constitute or be deemed to constitute an
amendment to any employee benefit plan sponsored or maintained by Parent, the
Company, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective Subsidiaries. The
Securityholders Representative shall take such steps as are necessary to
allow Continuing Employees to participate in the voluntary employees
beneficiary association medical plan in which the Company is currently
participating (the " _Medical Plan_ ") through January 1, 2015 (the "
_Transition Period_ "). During the Transition Period, the Parent shall cause
the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries to collect employee premium
contributions for the Medical Plan from the Continuing Employees and transmit
such employee premium contributions to the Medical Plan. Additionally, the
Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries shall reimburse the Medical Plan for
the incremental difference between the total claims of the Continuing
Employees and their dependents under the Medical Plan and the total employee
premium contributions made by

 



54  Continuing Employees during the Transition Period. The Securityholders
Representative shall calculate such amount as soon as reasonably practicable
following the end of the run out period under the Medical Plan associated
with the Transition Period and communicate such amount to the Parent in
writing. Parent shall pay such amount or shall cause the Surviving Entity or
its Subsidiaries to pay such amount to the Medical Plan within 60 days of
receipt of the amount in writing from the Securityholders Representative.

5.12 _Preservation of Books and Records_. Parent agrees that it shall, and
Parent agrees that it shall cause the Surviving Entity to, preserve and keep
the records held by it, them or their Affiliates relating to the conduct of
the respective businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing Date for a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date and, upon
reasonable prior notice, shall provide reasonable access during normal
business hours to such records and personnel available to the
Securityholders Representative as may be reasonably required by the
Securityholders Representative in connection with, among other things, any
insurance claims by, Proceedings or Tax audits against or governmental
investigations of the Securityholders, Securityholders Representative or any
of their Affiliates. In the event Parent wishes to destroy such records after
such time, Parent shall first give ninety (90) days prior written notice to
Securityholders Representative and Securityholders Representative shall
have the right at its option and expense, upon prior written notice given to
Parent within that ninety (90) day period, to take possession of the records
within ninety (90) days after the date of such notice.

5.13 _Jointly Privileged Information_. Notwithstanding any other provision in
this Agreement, prior to the Closing, American Capital shall be permitted to
remove from the Company and any of its Subsidiaries any email, document and
other records containing attorney-client privileged information where the
attorney-client privilege is held jointly between one or more of the Company
and any of its Subsidiaries on the one hand, and any of the Seller Group on
the other to the extent relating to the Transactions (" _Jointly Privileged
Information_ "). From and after the Closing, Parent shall cause the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries to provide American Capital all copies (including
electronic, digital, or otherwise) of any Jointly Privileged Information that
is inadvertently not removed prior to the Closing. Any email, document and
other record temporarily removed for analysis to determine the presence of
Jointly Privileged Information pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section
5.13_ shall be returned to the Company promptly following completion of such
review if it is determined by American Capital that such email, document or
other record does not contain Jointly Privileged Information.

 

5.14 _Exclusivity_. During the period from the date of this Agreement through
the earlier to occur of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Article 9_ , the Company will not, and will not permit any of its
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, representatives or agents to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, or encourage the submission of
any proposal or offer from any Person relating to the acquisition of all or
substantially all of the capital stock or assets of the Company taken as a
whole (including any acquisition structured as a merger, consolidation, or
share exchange) or (ii) enter into, maintain, or continue discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish or disclose to any Person any information
in connection with any acquisition of all or substantially all of the capital
stock or assets of the Company taken as a whole (including any acquisition
structured as a merger, consolidation, or share exchange), and the Company
shall not enter into any letter of intent or purchase agreement, merger

 



55  agreement or other similar agreement with any Person other than Parent and
Merger Sub with respect to acquisition of all or substantially all of the
capital stock or assets of the Company taken as a whole (including any
acquisition structured as a merger, consolidation, or share exchange).

5.15 _Stockholder Approval_. Immediately following the execution of this
Agreement, the Company shall submit this Agreement to its stockholders for
adoption and shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain, immediately
following execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company Required Vote
pursuant to the Written Consent. Promptly following receipt of the Written
Consent, and no later than one (1) Business Day after the date hereof, the
Company shall deliver a copy of such Written Consent to Parent.

5.16 _280G Stockholder Vote_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
submit to a vote of its stockholders, in a manner that satisfies the
stockholder approval requirements under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and
regulations promulgated thereunder (a " _280G Stockholder Vote_ "), the right
of any "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code)
to receive any and all payments (or other benefits) contingent on the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) to the extent necessary so
that no payment or benefit received by such "disqualified individual" would be
a "parachute payment" under Section 280G(b) of the Code if the
stockholders approve the payment by a vote that complies with Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code. The Company shall (a) at least two (2) Business
Days prior to providing (i) the applicable disqualified individuals with any
required waivers, consents or agreements and (ii) the applicable stockholders
with any materials necessary to comply with the 280G Stockholder Vote, provide
a draft of the applicable materials to Parent and incorporate into such
materials any reasonable comments that are provided by Parent and (b) use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any required waivers, consents or
agreements from each disqualified individual at least one (1) Business Day
prior to conducting the 280G Stockholder Vote. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall provide Parent and its counsel with copies of any and all
documents executed by the stockholders and disqualified individuals in
connection with the 280G Stockholder Vote.

for which a remedy beyond the Escrow Fund is available hereunder, each
Securityholder shall only have a several, and not joint, obligation of
indemnification to the extent of his, her or its Pro Rata Share and, in any
event, shall not have any Liability in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in an amount that exceeds the cash proceeds
actually received by such Securityholder; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, any recovery for the Damages described in
_Section 8.1(d)_ by a Parent Indemnitee may, at Parents option, be recovered
first directly from the Securityholders.

 

(e) The Parent Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover under _Section
8.1_: to the extent the matter in question, taken together with all similar
matters, (A) does not exceed the amount of any reserves with respect to such
matters which are reflected in the Draft Computation as of the Determination
Date or (B) is included in the calculation of the Indebtedness Amount or the
Actual Transaction Expenses and, in either case, is paid pursuant to _Section
2.3(a)_.

(f) On the date which is twelve months following the Closing Date, the Escrow
Agent shall release to the Securityholders Representative the then-remaining
Escrow Fund less the aggregate amount of Damages specified in any then-
unresolved good faith claims for indemnification, in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(g) For purposes of determining whether there has been a breach of any
representation or warranty under this Agreement and for purposes of
determining any Damages, in each case for purposes of indemnification under
this _Article VIII_ , such representations and warranties shall be interpreted
without giving effect to any limitations or qualifications such as
"materiality," "material," "in all material respects," or "Material Adverse
Effect" set forth in any such representation or warranty; _provided_  that,
this _Section 8.3(g)_ shall not apply to the representations and warranties
set forth in _Sections 3.7_ (Financial Statements) or _3.23_ (Customers and
Suppliers).

 

(h) For the avoidance of doubt, no Securityholder shall have any Liability for
actions taken by Parent or the Company following the Effective Time.

 



61 8.4 _Inter-Party Claims_. In order for a Parent Indemnitee or a
Securityholder Indemnitee (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this _Article 8_ from another party to this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall notify the other party or parties from
whom such indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing
promptly after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of the occurrence of an
event giving rise to such Indemnified Partys claim for
indemnification, specifying in reasonable detail the basis of such claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party shall have been materially and actually prejudiced as a
result of such failure or the indemnification obligations are materially
increased as a result of such failure. The Indemnified Party shall thereupon
give the Indemnifying Party reasonable access during normal business hours to
the books, records, personnel and assets of the Indemnified Party which
evidence or support such claim or the act, omission or occurrence giving rise
to such claim. If the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability with respect
to any such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
proceed to negotiate in good faith a resolution of such dispute and, if not
resolved through negotiations within 30 days, such dispute shall, subject to
the terms of this Agreement, be resolved by litigation in an appropriate
court of competent jurisdiction.

8.5 _Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) Promptly following its receipt of written notice of a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party shall (i) notify the Indemnifying Party of its
existence, setting forth with reasonable specificity the facts and
circumstances of such Third Party Claim to the extent known, and (ii)
specifying the basis hereunder upon which the Indemnified Partys claim
for indemnification is asserted; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to
give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder
except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been materially and
actually prejudiced as a result of such failure or the indemnification
obligations are materially increased as a result of such failure.

(b) The Indemnified Party shall tender the defense of any Third Party Claim
to the Indemnifying Party, and if the Indemnifying Party accepts such tender
within thirty (30) days thereafter, then except as herein provided, the
Indemnified Party shall not, and the Indemnifying Party shall, have the right
to contest, defend, litigate or settle such Third Party Claim and shall have
the right, in its discretion exercised in reasonable good faith and upon the
advice of counsel, to settle any such matter, either before or after the
initiation of litigation, at such time and upon such terms as it deems fair
and reasonable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party will only
be required to tender the defense of any Third Party Claim to the extent that
(i) the then-available Escrow Fund is sufficient, in the reasonable judgment
of the Indemnified Party, to satisfy the amount of any adverse monetary
judgment or settlement that is reasonably likely to result; (ii) the Third-
Party Claim seeks (and continues to seek), as its primary remedy, monetary
damages; and (iii) the Indemnifying Party expressly agrees in writing that as
between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying
Party shall be obligated to satisfy and discharge the Third Party Claim in
accordance with the terms set forth in this Agreement (the conditions set
forth in clauses (i) through (ii), the " _Litigation_  

 



62   _Conditions_ "); provided, further, that the Indemnifying Party, if it
shall have assumed the defense of any Third Party Claim, shall not, without
the written consent of the Indemnified Party (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld), consent to a settlement of, or the entry of judgment
arising from, any such Third Party Claim which (A) does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to the
Indemnified Party of a complete release from all Damages in respect of such
Third Party Claim, or (B) grants any injunctive or equitable relief. All
expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by the Indemnifying Party in
connection with the foregoing shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party;
_provided_ that if the Securityholders Representative (on behalf of the
Seller Group) is the Indemnifying Party and defends against,
negotiates, settles or otherwise handles such Third Party Claim in accordance
with this _Article 8_ , the fees and other Damages incurred and paid by the
Indemnifying Party in connection therewith shall count toward the limitations
or indemnifications set forth in this _Article 8_. The Indemnified Party
shall have the right to, at its own expense, be represented by counsel and
participate in any such contest, defense, litigation or settlement conducted
by the Indemnifying Party, and if the Indemnified Party exercises such right,
the parties shall cooperate in the contest, defense, litigation and settlement
of the Third Party Claim. If, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
Indemnified Party, a conflict or potential conflict exists between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make separate
representation advisable, the Indemnified Party may retain separate counsel at
the expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall lose
its right to contest, defend, litigate and settle any Third Party Claim, and
shall be liable for all reasonable costs or expenses paid or incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with assuming the right to contest, defend,
litigate and settle such Third Party Claim, if (A) it shall fail to
diligently contest the Third Party Claim or (B) any of the Litigation
Conditions cease to be met. If an Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification with respect to a Third Party Claim, and the Indemnifying
Party fails to accept a tender of the defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant
to this _Section 8.5_, or if the Indemnifying Party does not have or loses
its right to contest, defend, litigate and settle such a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party shall have the right, without prejudice to its right of
indemnification hereunder, in its discretion exercised in reasonable good
faith and upon the advice of counsel, to contest, defend and litigate such
Third Party Claim; _provided_ , that in no event will an Indemnified Party
admit any Liability with respect to, compromise, consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to any Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If, pursuant to the
preceding sentence, the Indemnified Party so contests, defends, litigates or
settles a Third Party Claim for which it is entitled to indemnification
hereunder, Damages indemnifiable under this Agreement will include the
reasonable attorneys fees and other expenses of contesting, defending,
litigating and settling the Third Party Claim which are incurred from time to
time, promptly following the presentation to the Indemnifying Party of
itemized bills for such attorneys fees and other expenses.

 

8.6 _Mitigation_.

 

(a) Each Indemnified Party shall take commercially reasonable steps to
mitigate all Damages after becoming aware of any event which would reasonably
be expected to give rise to any Damages that are indemnifiable or recoverable
hereunder or in connection herewith.

 



63 (b) The amount of any Damages subject to indemnification hereunder or of any
claim therefor shall be calculated net of (i) any accruals or reserves on the
Interim Balance Sheet that relate to the matter(s) for which indemnification
is claimed, (ii) any amounts actually recovered by an Indemnified Party
pursuant to any indemnification by or indemnification agreement with any non-
affiliated third party (net of all direct collection expenses), (iii) any
insurance proceeds or other cash receipts or sources of reimbursement actually
received as an offset against such Damages (net of all direct collection
expenses) received or receivable by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Entity
or any of their Affiliates on account of such Damages (each such source named
in clauses (ii) and (iii), a " _Collateral Source_ "), and (iv) any
Indemnification Tax Benefit inuring to Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, any
Subsidiary, or any of their Affiliates on account of such Damages. If Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company, any Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates receives
an Indemnification Tax Benefit after an indemnification payment is made,
Parent shall promptly pay to the Securityholders Representative (on behalf of
the Securityholders) the amount of such Indemnification Tax Benefit at such
time or times as and to the extent that such Indemnification Tax Benefit is
realized. For purposes hereof, " _Indemnification Tax Benefit_ " means any
refund of Taxes paid or reduction in the amount of Taxes which otherwise
would have been paid, in each case computed at the effective tax rates.
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries shall seek full
recovery of any Damages from all Collateral Sources covering such Damages to
the same extent as they would if such Damages were not subject to
indemnification hereunder. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity and its
Subsidiaries shall not terminate or cancel any insurance policies in effect
for periods prior to the Closing. In the event that a recovery from a
Collateral Source is made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity, any
Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates with respect to any Damages for which
any such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the
aggregate amount of the recovery (net of all direct collection expenses) shall
be made promptly to the Securityholders Representative (on behalf of the
Securityholders).

 

(c) Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall take all
reasonable steps to mitigate all losses, costs, expenses and damages after
becoming aware of any event which could reasonably be expected to give rise to
any losses, costs, expenses and damages that are indemnifiable or recoverable
hereunder or in connection herewith.

 

8.7 _Adjustment of the Merger Consideration_. Amounts paid for indemnification
under this _Article 8_ shall be deemed to be an adjustment to the Merger
Consideration for all Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

8.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, no party shall be liable
or responsible in any manner whatsoever to the other parties (or the
Indemnified Parties) with respect to any and all monetary claims (other than
claims for actual fraud and claims under _Section 2.6_) in connection with
any breach of this Agreement, except for indemnification provided in this
_Article 8_ , which provides the exclusive remedies and causes of action of
the parties hereto (or the Indemnified Parties) with respect to any and all
monetary claims in connection with any breach of, arising out of, or in
connection with this Agreement, any Disclosure Schedule or other Schedule or
Exhibit hereto, the Transaction Documents or any document or certificate
delivered in connection herewith (other than claims for actual fraud and
claims under _Section 2.6_).

 



64 8.9 _No Circular Recovery_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, no Securityholder or Securityholder Indemnitees
shall make any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 5.4_ hereof, or
pursuant to the constituent documents of the Company, with respect to any
claim brought by any Parent Indemnitee against any Securityholder or relating
to the Transactions or the Transaction Documents.

ARTICLE 9

9.1  _Termination of Agreement_. The Agreement may be terminated only as
provided below:

(a) Parent and the Company may terminate this Agreement by mutual written
consent at any time prior to the Closing;

consummation of any of the Transactions is enjoined, prohibited or otherwise
restrained by the terms of a final, non-appealable order or judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction;

 

(c) By either Parent or the Company, by written notice to the other, if there
shall have been any breach by the other Party (which in the case of the
Company shall also include any breach by Merger Sub) of any representation,
warranty or covenant set forth in this Agreement (or if any representation or
warranty of the other Party shall have become untrue), which breach (i)
would result in the failure of a condition to the Closing set forth in
_Sections 6.1(a)_, _6.1(b)_ , _6.2(a)_ or _6.2(b)_ , as applicable, in favor
of the terminating party and (ii) cannot be cured, or has not been cured
within twenty (20) days following receipt by the breach party of written
notice of such breach;

(d) By either Parent or the Company, by written notice to the other, if the
Closing shall not have occurred at or before 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on August
31, 2014; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this _Section 9.1(d)_ shall not be available to any party whose
failure to fulfill any of its obligations under this Agreement has been the
cause of or resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to the
aforesaid date or who has failed to satisfy any of the conditions set forth
in _Article 6_ hereof that such party was required to satisfy; _provided_
_that_ no party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement during the
twenty (20) day cure period referenced in  _Section 9.1(c)_; or

(e) By Parent or the Company if the Company does not deliver the Written
Consent within six (6) hours following the execution of this Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that neither Parent nor the

performance pursuant to _Section 10.12_.

 

9.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 9.1_ above, all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder
shall terminate without any Liability of any party to any other party (except
for any Liability for any willful breach occurring prior to such termination,
including the failure of either Party to consummate the Transactions where
the

 



65  conditions to such Partys obligations to close hereunder have been
satisfied (or are capable of being satisfied at Closing)); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this  _Section 9.2_, _Section 2.7_ and _Article 10_ shall
survive termination and Parent shall return or destroy all agreements,
documents, contracts, instruments, books, records, materials and other
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with this Agreement or the Transaction Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.

 

ARTICLE 10

The Transaction Expenses shall be paid in the manner specified in this

to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to the provisions of _Section
2.6_ (which shall govern any dispute arising thereunder), in the event any

to enforce its rights under this Agreement against any other Person (the "
_Defending Party_ "), if the Defending Party is the prevailing party in such
Proceeding, all fees, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees
and court costs, incurred by the Defending Party in such Proceeding shall be
reimbursed by the Claiming Party; _provided_ _that_ , if the Defending Party

10.3 _Assignment and Benefit_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned, by operation of Law or
otherwise, by any party hereto to any other Person without the prior written
consent of Parent and the Securityholders Representative, and any such
attempted assignment shall be null and void; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
(a) Parent may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement in whole
or in part to any of its Affiliates, (b) the Securityholders Representative
may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any of its
Affiliates without the prior written consent of Parent, and (c) after the
Closing, any Securityholder may assign this Agreement to any of its beneficial
owners or successors by operation of Law; _provided_ , that, no such
assignment shall in any way affect such Securityholders obligations or
liabilities hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement and the rights
and obligations set forth herein shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding
upon, the parties hereto, and each of their respective permitted successors,
heirs and assigns.

10.4 _Amendment, Modification and Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement
may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in
writing and is signed by Parent, the Company and the Securityholders
Representative or, after the Closing Date, by Parent and the Securityholders
Representative. Any such amendment, modification, extension or waiver shall be
in writing. The waiver by a party hereto of any breach of any provision of
this Agreement shall not constitute or operate as a waiver of any other
breach of such provision or of any other provision hereof, nor shall any
failure to enforce any provision hereof operate as a waiver of such provision
or of any other provision hereof.

 

10.5 _Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any
applicable conflicts of law provisions (except to the extent that mandatory
provisions of federal Law apply). Each of the parties hereby irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Delaware Court of
Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any
court of the State of Delaware or the United States District Court for the
District of the State of Delaware) for the purpose of any Action arising out
of this Agreement, or any of the Transaction Documents, brought by or against
any other party hereto or thereto, and hereby irrevocably agrees (a) that all
claims in respect of any such Action may be heard and determined in any such
court and (b) not to commence any Action relating to this Agreement in any
other court or before any other Governmental Body. Each party irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to assert in any such Action, in each
case to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) any objection to
the laying of venue of any such Action brought in any such court, (ii) any
claim that such party is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of any
such court, or (iii) any claim that any such Action has been brought in an
inconvenient forum (if brought in any such court). Each

 



68  party certifies and acknowledges that (A) no Representative of any other
party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would
not, in the event of litigation under this  _Section 10.5_, seek to enforce
any of the foregoing waivers, (B) it understands and has considered the
implications of such waivers and (C) it makes such waivers voluntarily. Each
party agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 10.2_ shall be effective service
of process for any Action brought against such party in any such court.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party agrees that a final judgment in any
such Action brought in any such court shall be conclusive and binding upon
such party and may be enforced in any other court to whose jurisdiction such
party is or may be subject, by suit upon such judgment.

 

10.6 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT TO ANY PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH
PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF ANY PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.6_.

10.7  _Performance Guaranty; Party Obligations_. Parent hereby guarantees the
due, prompt and faithful performance and discharge by, and compliance with,
all of the obligations, covenants, terms, conditions and undertakings of
Merger Sub at and prior to the Effective Time under this Agreement in
accordance with the terms hereof. Whenever this Agreement or any Transaction
Document requires Merger Sub to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause Merger Sub to
take such action.

10.8 _Section Headings_. The section headings contained herein are for
reference purposes only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

10.9  _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement (or
portion thereof) or the application of any such term or other provision (or
portion thereof) to any Person or circumstance is determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced
pursuant to any applicable Law or public policy, all other terms and
provisions of this Agreement (or remaining portion of such term or other
provision) will nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such
determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that any term or other
provision (or portion thereof) of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto will negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in a legally acceptable manner to the end that
Transactions are fulfilled to the greatest extent possible.

 

10.10 _Counterparts; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement may be
executed in two or more counterparts, including by facsimile transmission,
each of which shall be deemed an

 



69  original, and any Person may become a party hereto by executing a
counterpart hereof, but all of such counterparts together shall be deemed to
be one and the same agreement. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and, except as otherwise set forth
in this Agreement, this Agreement is not intended to nor will confer upon any
other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Sections 9.1(c)_ or
_9.1(d)_ , then (a) the Securityholders, acting through the Securityholders
Representative, shall be beneficiaries of this Agreement and, as provided in
_Section 9.2_ and elsewhere in this Agreement, shall be entitled to pursue
all available remedies and to seek recovery of all losses, liabilities,
damages, costs and expenses of every kind and nature, including reasonable
attorneys fees, (b) the Securityholders, acting through the Securityholders
Representative, shall be beneficiaries of _Section 10.12_ and (c) from and
after the Closing, _Section 5.4_, _Section 5.7(f)_ and the last sentence of
_Section 5.11_ are made for the benefit of the persons referenced therein, as
applicable, and _Article 2_ and  _Article 10_ are made for the benefit of the
Securityholders. All of the Persons identified in the immediately preceding
sentence shall be entitled to enforce such provisions and to avail themselves
of the benefits of any remedy for any breach of such provisions, all to the
same extent as if such Persons were signatories to this Agreement.

10.11 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the other Transaction
Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement
among the parties hereto with respect to the Transactions and supersede all
prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Parties have voluntarily
agreed to define their rights, liabilities and obligations respecting the
subject matter of this Agreement exclusively in contract pursuant to the
terms and provisions of this Agreement and their sole and exclusive remedies
regarding the subject matter of this Agreement shall be remedies available at
law or in equity for breach of contract only (as such remedies may be limited
by the express terms of this Agreement).

10.12 _Specific Performance_. The Parties hereto agree that if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no
adequate remedy at law would exist and Damages would be difficult
to determine, and the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance, or other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy at law or in
equity. The Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of injunctive
relief, specific performance or other equitable relief is unenforceable,
invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason (in each case, other
than contesting the existence of a breach or threatened breach of this
Agreement), nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy. Each of the Parties hereby waives (a) any defenses in
any action for specific performance, including the defense that a remedy at
law would be adequate, and (b) any requirement under any Law to post a bond or
other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. The election
of the Company to pursue an injunction or specific performance shall not
restrict, impair or otherwise limit the Company from subsequently seeking to
terminate this Agreement.

 



70 10.13 _Representation of the Company_. Each of the parties to this
Agreement hereby acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of
each of its Affiliates and its and their directors, members, partners,
officers, employees and Affiliates (and in the case of Parent on behalf of the
Parent Indemnitees), that (i) Arnold and Porter LLP represents and/or has
represented the Securityholders and their Affiliates (including American
Capital) and/or the Company in other matters, (ii) Arnold and Porter LLP may
serve as counsel to any and all of the current or former Securityholders, the
Securityholders Representative and their respective Affiliates (individually
and collectively, the " _Seller Group_ "), in connection with any matters
related to this Agreement and the Transactions (or the transactions
contemplated by the other Transaction Documents), including the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and consummation of the
Transactions (or the transactions contemplated by the other Transaction
Documents) and any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the Transactions (or the transactions contemplated by the
other Transaction Documents), and each of the parties hereto, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, consents to the foregoing and irrevocably waives any
conflict of interest arising therefrom, on behalf of such party and each of
its Affiliates and its and their directors, members, partners,
officers, employees and Affiliates (and in the case of Parent on behalf of
the Parent Indemnitees). Parent, Securityholders and the Company (on behalf of
itself and its Subsidiaries) also further agree that, as to all communications
among Arnold and Porter LLP, the Company, its Subsidiaries, and the Seller
Group that relate in any way to the Transactions (or the transactions
contemplated by the other Transaction Documents), the attorney-client
privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to the Company and
may be controlled by American Capital and shall not pass to or be claimed by
Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Parent, the Surviving
Entity or a Subsidiary and a third party other than a party to this Agreement
after the Closing, the Surviving Entity and the Subsidiaries may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications
by Arnold and Porter LLP to such third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither the Surviving Entity nor any Subsidiary may waive such privilege
without the prior written consent of American Capital. The Company, Parent and
the Surviving Entity further agree that Arnold and Porter LLP and its partners
and employees are third party beneficiaries of this _Section 10.13_.

 

10.14 _Guarantee_. Guarantor hereby unconditionally and absolutely guarantees
the prompt performance and observation of Parent and Merger Sub for each and
every obligation, covenant and agreement of Parent or Merger Sub to be
performed prior to, at or in connection with the Closing, including the full
and timely payment by Parent of its payment obligations under  _Section 2.3_
or upon delivery of a Letter of Transmittal following the Closing pursuant to
_Section 2.4_ (the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "). The obligations of
Guarantor under this Section 10.14 are continuing and will remain in full
force and effect until the Guaranteed Obligations have been performed or paid
in full. This is a guarantee of payment, and not of collection, and the
Guarantor acknowledges that this guarantee is full and unconditional, and no
release or extinguishment of Parents obligations or liabilities (other than
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), whether by decree in any
bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, shall affect the continuing validity and
enforceability of this guarantee, as well as any provision requiring or
contemplating performance by the Guarantor. The Guarantor waives, for the
benefit of the Company and the Securityholders Representative, (a) any right
to require the Company or Securityholders Representative, as a condition of
payment by the Guarantor, to proceed against

 



71  Parent or Merger Sub or pursue any other remedy whatsoever, and (b) to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, any defenses or benefits that may be derived
from or afforded by Law which limit the liability of or exonerate guarantors
or sureties, except to the extent that any such defense is available to
Parent. Guarantor hereby makes the representations and warranties set forth in
Sections 4.1 and 4.4, substituting Guarantor for Parent and Merger Sub, and
such representations are hereby incorporated herein, _mutatis mutandis_.
