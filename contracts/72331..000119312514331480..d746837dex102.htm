review only those items and amounts specifically set forth and objected to in the Dispute Notice and resolve the dispute with respect to each such specific item and amount in accordance with the Accounting Standards. The scope of the disputes to be
arbitrated by the Independent Accounting Firm is limited to whether the Draft Computation or the calculation of Working Capital Adjustment Amount, Actual Closing Cash, the Indebtedness Amount, the Actual Transaction Expenses and the Merger

under or by reason of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to <U>Sections 9.1(c)</U> or <U>9.1(d)</U>, then (a)&nbsp;the Securityholders, acting through the
Securityholders&#146; Representative, shall be beneficiaries of this Agreement and, as provided in <U>Section&nbsp;9.2</U> and elsewhere in this Agreement, shall be entitled to pursue all available remedies and to seek recovery of all losses,

contemporaneous agreements and understandings, both written and oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Parties have voluntarily agreed to define their rights, liabilities and obligations respecting the subject matter of this Agreement
exclusively in contract pursuant to the terms and provisions of this Agreement and their sole and exclusive remedies regarding the subject matter of this Agreement shall be remedies available at law or in equity for breach of contract only (as such
remedies may be limited by the express terms of this Agreement). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">10.12 <U><B>Specific Performance</B></U><B>.</B> The Parties hereto
agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at law would exist and Damages would be difficult to
determine, and the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in
addition to any other remedy at law or in equity. The Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of injunctive relief, specific performance or other equitable relief is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason (in
each case, other than contesting the existence of a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement), nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. Each of the Parties hereby waives (a)&nbsp;any defenses in any
action for specific performance, including the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate, and (b)&nbsp;any requirement under any Law to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. The election of the Company
to pursue an injunction or specific performance shall not restrict, impair or otherwise limit the Company from subsequently seeking to terminate this Agreement. </P>
