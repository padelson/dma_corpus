Purchase Price minus (ii) the Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment minus (iii)
any Indebtedness of the Company and the Company Subsidiary other than
outstanding Indebtedness that falls within the definition of Closing Working
Capital, the "Closing Date Payment".





(c) The "Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment" shall be Â£0, being a good faith
estimate agreed between the parties of any adjustment to the Purchase Price
which would be required under Section 1.04.

SECTION 1.04 Purchase Price Adjustment. (a) Within 90 calendar days after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement (the
"Statement") in the form set forth in Schedule 1.04 setting forth Working
Capital as of the Effective Time ("Closing Working Capital") and the Statement
will contain a certification from Purchaser that it has prepared the Statement
in compliance with the requirements of this Section 1.04 and Schedule 1.04.

(b) During the 90 calendar day period following Purchaser\'s delivery of the
Statement, Seller and its independent auditors shall be permitted to review
the working papers of Purchaser and the Company relating to the Statement. The
Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties on the 90th calendar
day following delivery thereof, unless Seller gives written notice of its
disagreement with the Statement (a "Notice of Disagreement") to Purchaser
prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall (i) specify in reasonable
detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted and (ii) only include
disagreements based on mathematical errors or based on Closing Working Capital
not being calculated in accordance with this Section 1.04. If a Notice of
Disagreement is received by Purchaser within the 90 calendar day period
referred to above, then the Statement (as revised in accordance with this
sentence) shall become final and binding upon the parties on the earlier of
(A) the date Purchaser and Seller resolve in writing any differences they have
with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement and (B)
the date all such disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the
Independent Expert pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Section 1.04.
During the 90 calendar day period following the delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement, Purchaser and Seller shall seek in good faith to resolve in
writing any differences that they may have with respect to the matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such 90 calendar day
period, Purchaser and Seller shall submit to an independent accounting firm
(the "Independent Expert") for arbitration any and all matters that remain in
dispute and (i) were included in the Notice of Disagreement and (ii) if
applicable, any matters which Seller or Purchaser believe should be reflected
in Closing Working Capital as a consequence of the adjustments proposed in the
Notice of Disagreement (any such matters to be notified by Seller or Purchaser
(as applicable) to the other party no later than 7 calendar days before being
submitted to the Independent Expert). The Independent Expert shall be an
internationally recognized independent public accounting firm as agreed upon
by Purchaser and Seller in writing. Purchaser and Seller shall each instruct
the Independent Expert and use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts (at their own expense) to cause the Independent Expert to render a
decision resolving the matters submitted to it pursuant to this Section
1.04(b) as soon as practicable, and in any event within 90 calendar days
following submission.





(c) The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Independent Expert shall
be limited to (i) whether the Statement was prepared in accordance with the
Balance Sheet Principles with respect to the matters that were submitted for
resolution to the Independent Expert, (ii) whether there were mathematical
errors in the Statement and (iii) the interest calculation in accordance with
Section 1.04(g). The Independent Expert is not authorized to, and shall not,
make any other determination, including (A) any determination with respect to
any matter included in the Statement or the Notice of Disagreement that was
not submitted for resolution to the Independent Expert, (B) any determination
as to whether United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("U.S.
GAAP") followed for the Financial Statements or the Statement, (C) any
determination as to the accuracy of Section 3.05 or any other representation
or warranty in this Agreement, (D) any determination as to compliance by the
Company, Purchaser or Seller with any of their respective covenants in this
Agreement or (E) any determination that an issue was not properly included by
Seller in the Notice of Disagreement. Any disputes not within the scope of
disputes to be resolved by the Independent Expert pursuant to this Section
1.04(c) shall be resolved as otherwise provided in this Agreement. Any
determination by the Independent Expert, and any work or analyses performed by
the Independent Expert, may not be offered as evidence in any suit, action or
proceeding as evidence of a breach of Section 3.05, a breach of any other
representation or warranty in this Agreement or a breach of any covenant in
this Agreement (other than a breach of this Section 1.04).

(d) Purchaser and Seller will furnish to each other and to the Independent
Expert such work papers and other documents and information relating to the
disputed items as the Independent Expert may request and are available to that
party (or its independent public accountants) and will be afforded the
opportunity to present to the Independent Expert any material related to the
disputed items and to discuss the items with the Independent Expert. All
matters or items delivered to the Independent Expert by a party shall be
concurrently delivered to the other parties. None of the parties or any of
their respective affiliates will meet or discuss any substantive matters with
the Independent Expert without the other party or its representatives present
or having the opportunity following at least three business days\' notice to
be present, either in person or by telephone.

(e) The final determination by the Independent Expert of the matters submitted
to it pursuant to Section 1.04(b) shall: (i) be in writing, (ii) include the
Independent Expert\'s calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price, (iii)
include the Independent Expert\'s determination of each matter submitted to it
pursuant to Section 1.04(b), (iv) include the Independent Expert\'s
calculation of interest in accordance with Section 1.04(g) from and including
the Closing Date to but excluding the date of determination and (v) include a
brief summary of the Independent Expert\'s reasons for its determination of
each issue.





(f) The resolution of disputed items by the Independent Expert shall be final
and binding upon the parties (in the absence of manifest error, in which case
the determination will be remitted to the Independent Expert for correction),
and the determination of the Independent Expert shall constitute an arbitral
award that is final, binding and non-appealable and upon which a judgment may
be entered by a court having jurisdiction over the party against which such
determination is to be enforced. The fees and expenses of the Independent
Expert incurred pursuant to this Section 1.04 shall be borne equally by
Purchaser and Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, but subject to the last
sentence of Section 6.01(c), any dispute as to whether the Statement and the
calculation of Closing Working Capital were prepared in accordance with the
Balance Sheet Principles shall be resolved pursuant to this Section 1.04,
irrespective of whether such dispute may give rise to a claim for
indemnification under Article VI.

(g) The Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount by which Closing
Working Capital exceeds Â£2,555,187 (the "Target WC Amount") or decreased by
the amount by which Closing Working Capital is less than the Target WC Amount
(the Purchase Price, as so increased or decreased, the "Adjusted Purchase
Price"). If the Closing Date Payment is less than the Adjusted Purchase Price,
Purchaser shall, and if the Closing Date Payment is more than the Adjusted
Purchase Price, Seller shall, within five business days after the Statement
becomes final and binding on the parties, make payment to the other party by
wire transfer in immediately available funds in pounds sterling of the amount
of such difference, together with interest thereon at the Bank of England\'s
base rate from time to time plus 1 per cent per annum, to be calculated on the
basis of the actual number of calendar days elapsed from the Closing Date to
but not including the date of payment, divided by 365; provided that if at any
time the Bank of England\'s base rate is less than zero, it shall be deemed to
be zero. Whenever conversion of values between pounds sterling and any
currency other than pounds sterling for a particular date or period shall be
required for purposes of this Section 1.04(g), such conversion shall be made
using the mid-market closing rate on the day before Closing as published in
the London edition of the Financial Times on the Closing Date.

(h) The term "Working Capital" shall have the meaning set forth on Schedule
1.04 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. For the avoidance of doubt but subject
to Schedule 1.04, Closing Working Capital is to be calculated in the same way,
using the same methods, as the line items comprising Working Capital on the
Balance Sheet referenced in the definition thereof, whether or not doing so is
in accordance with U.S. GAAP or UK GAAP. The foregoing principles are referred
to in this Agreement as the "Balance Sheet Principles".

(i) Following the Closing until such time as the Statement shall become final
and binding upon the parties in accordance with this Section 1.04, Purchaser
shall not take any action with respect to the accounting books and records of
the Company on which the Statement is to be based that would increase the
difficulty to Seller or its independent auditors of verifying the Statement
(including that the preparation thereof complies with this Section 1.04).
During the period of time from and after the Closing Date through the
resolution of any adjustment to the Purchase Price contemplated by this
Section 1.04, Purchaser and the Company shall afford to Seller and any
accountants, counsel or financial advisers retained by Seller in connection
with any adjustment to the Purchase Price contemplated by this Section 1.04
reasonable access during normal business hours to all the properties, books,
contracts, personnel and records of the Company, and the work papers of
Purchaser and the Company , relevant to the adjustment contemplated by this
Section 1.04 and shall provide, upon Seller\'s reasonable request, copies of
any such books, contracts, records and work papers.

(the "Confidentiality Agreement"), the terms of which are incorporated herein
by reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate with respect to information relating solely to the
Company and the Company Subsidiary; provided, however, that Purchaser agrees
that any and all other information provided to it or any of its affiliates by
Seller or any of its affiliates, or any of their respective representatives,
shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement after the Closing Date.

SECTION 5.02 Reasonable Efforts to Obtain Third Party Consents for the
Transactions. (a) Purchaser shall (at its discretion), or pursuant to any
review or investigation by any Government Entity, file with the appropriate



Governmental Entities any notices and applications, if any, necessary to
obtain approval under any applicable Competition Laws for the Transactions and
any additional information requested in connection therewith pursuant to such
Competition Laws. Any such filings and additional information shall be in
substantial compliance with the requirements of such Competition Laws. Each of
Seller and Purchaser shall furnish to the other such reasonably necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection
with its preparation of any filing or submission under such Competition Laws.
Seller and Purchaser shall keep each other apprised of the status of any
communications with, and any inquiries or requests for supplemental
information from, any such Governmental Entities and shall comply promptly
with any such inquiry or request and shall promptly provide any supplemental
information requested in connection with any filings made hereunder pursuant
to such Competition Laws. Any such supplemental information shall be in
substantial compliance with the requirements of such Competition Laws.
Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 5.02(a), Purchaser acknowledges
and agrees that (i) Seller shall only be required by this Section 5.02(a) to
provide reasonable access upon reasonable notice during normal business hours,
to those personnel of it and its affiliates that have had direct involvement
in the negotiation and consummation of the Transactions and (ii) Seller shall
have no obligations under this Section 5.02(a) with respect to a filing or
submission under Competition Laws except (A) if Purchaser makes such filing or
submission as may be required by a Governmental Entity or under Competitions
Laws or (B) a Governmental Entity commences any review or investigation of the
Transaction, in each case during the period from Closing until November 10,
2015. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Section 5.02 or any other provision of this Agreement, neither Seller
nor any of its affiliates (other than the Company and the Company Subsidiary
effective upon the Closing) shall be required to take any Remedy Action with
respect to their businesses, product lines, assets or operations, or acquire,
purchase or assume, voluntarily or involuntarily, the businesses, product
lines, assets or operations of Purchaser or any of its affiliates (including
the Company and the Company Subsidiary effective upon the Closing), pursuant
to this Section 5.02 or any other provision of this Agreement.

(b) Each party shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, use its reasonable
efforts (at its own expense) for the 90 days following Closing to obtain, and
to cooperate in obtaining, consents from the third Persons specified in Annex
A as necessary or appropriate to permit Seller and its affiliates to disclose
to the Company or any affiliate thereof the confidential information of such
Persons held by Seller or any of its affiliates that relates to the product
formulations of the Company's products; provided, however, that the parties
shall not be required to pay or commit to pay any amount to (or incur any
obligation in favor of) any such third Person (other than the reimbursement of
such Person\'s reasonable expenses in connection with obtaining such consent).
Purchaser acknowledges that certain consents and waivers with respect to the
Transactions may be required from parties to the Company Contracts and that
such consents and waivers have not been obtained as of the date of this
Agreement. Seller and the Company shall not have any liability whatsoever to
Purchaser arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any such consent
or waiver or because of the termination of any Company Contract as a result
thereof. Purchaser acknowledges that no representation, warranty or covenant
of Seller or the Company contained herein shall be breached or deemed
breached, and no condition shall be deemed not satisfied, as a result of (i)
the failure to obtain any such consent or waiver, (ii) any such termination,
or (iii) any lawsuit, action, proceeding or investigation commenced or
threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain any such consent or waiver or any such termination.





(c) Subject to the preceding provisions of this Section 5.02, from time to
time, as and when requested by any party hereto, each other party hereto shall
execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents
and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further
actions, as such other party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to
consummate the Transactions, including, in the case of Seller, executing and
delivering to Purchaser such assignments, deeds, bills of sale and other
instruments as Purchaser or its counsel may reasonably request as necessary or
desirable for such purpose.

SECTION 5.03 Expenses. Except as expressly set forth in any other provision of
this Agreement, (i) all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the Transactions shall be paid by
the party incurring such costs and expenses, and (ii) where costs or expenses
incurred by a Person are expressly provided to be at the cost or expense of
another Person, that other Person shall only be required to pay the reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the first-mentioned Person.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall pay all filing fees required in
connection with any applicable Competition Laws.

SECTION 5.04 Brokers or Finders. Each of Purchaser and Seller represents, as
to itself and its affiliates, that no agent, broker, investment banker or
other firm or Person is or will be entitled to any broker\'s or finder\'s fee
or any other commission or similar fee in connection with any of the
Transactions, except, as to Seller and the Company, Goldman, Sachs and Co.,
whose fees and expenses will be paid by Seller.

SECTION 5.05 Employee Matters. (a) Seller, the Company and Purchaser intend
that the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
not constitute or give rise to a severance of employment of any Participant
prior to or upon such consummation of such transactions and that such
Participant shall have continuous and uninterrupted employment immediately
before and immediately after the Closing. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, Seller and its affiliates shall not have any responsibility for,
and Purchaser and its affiliates shall hold harmless and indemnify Seller and
its affiliates (excluding the Company and the Company Subsidiary) with respect
to, any and all liabilities arising as a result of the actual or constructive
termination of (i) a Participant\'s employment as a result of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) a Participant\'s
employment with Purchaser and its affiliates (including the Company and the
Company Subsidiary) on or after the Closing.

(b) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the
Company and the Company Subsidiary or Purchaser\'s other affiliates to, (i)
honor all obligations under the Benefit Plans and Benefit Agreements in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Closing (and
subject to any changes that may be made to those terms from time to time, in
each case, in accordance with the terms of



the applicable Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement) including, without
limitation, the agreements set forth on Annex B, (ii) recognize each
Participant\'s accrued and unused vacation and other paid time-off benefits
consistent with the terms of the vacation or similar policies of the Company
and the Company Subsidiary applicable to such Participant as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing and (iii) pay, no later than March 15, 2016,
all annual bonuses that are payable to Participants with respect to the 2015
fiscal year of the Company and the Company Subsidiary, including, to the
extent earned, bonuses accrued before the Closing Date under the annual bonus
plans of the Company and the Company Subsidiary.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contemplated by this Agreement
shall be construed as (i) requiring Purchaser or any of its affiliates to be
obligated to continue the employment of any Participant for any period of time
after the Closing Date or (ii) altering or limiting the rights of the Company
or the Company Subsidiary to (A) terminate the employment of any Participant,
(B) amend, modify or terminate any compensation or employee benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, subject to the terms of such plan, program,
agreement or arrangement or as necessary to comply with applicable Laws or (C)
except as expressly provided herein, change the terms or conditions of
employment of any Participant.

SECTION 5.06 Tax Matters. (a) Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes. Purchaser, Seller
and the Company agree that:

(i) Seller shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiary to timely
prepare and file with the Taxing Authorities all Tax Returns for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period that are required to be filed by the Company or the Company
Subsidiary on or before the Closing Date (taking into account any extensions),
and shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiary to pay (without
duplication) all Taxes shown thereon.

(ii) Purchaser shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiary to timely
prepare and file with the Taxing Authorities all Tax Returns that are required
to be filed by the Company or the Company Subsidiary after the Closing Date
relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and shall cause the Company and the
Company Subsidiary to pay all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns.
Except as required by Applicable Law, each such Tax Return shall be prepared
on a basis consistent with the past practice of the Company and the Company
Subsidiary. At least:

(A) 30 calendar days prior to the due date for filing any corporation tax Tax
Returns; and

(B) 10 calendar days prior to the due date for filing any other Tax Returns,





(taking into account any extensions), Purchaser shall furnish Seller with a
complete copy of any such Tax Return for Seller\'s review and comment and no
such Tax Return shall be filed with any Taxing Authority without Seller\'s
prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

(iii) Purchaser shall not, and shall not cause or permit the Company or the
Company Subsidiary to, (A) amend, re-file or otherwise modify any Tax Returns
filed on or before the Closing Date with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
or (B) make or change any Tax election that has retroactive effect to any such
Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case without Seller\'s prior written consent,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(iv) Purchaser shall timely prepare and file with the Taxing Authorities all
other Tax Returns required to be filed and shall pay all Taxes due with
respect to such Tax Returns.

(b) Cooperation. Seller, the Company and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate,
and shall cause their respective affiliates, officers, employees, agents,
auditors and representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing
all Tax Returns, including maintaining and making available to each other all
records necessary in connection with Taxes and in resolving all disputes and
audits with respect to all taxable periods relating to Taxes. Seller and its
affiliates will need access, from time to time, after the Closing Date, to
certain accounting and Tax records and information held by the Company and the
Company Subsidiary to the extent such records and information pertain to
events occurring on or prior to the Closing Date; therefore, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in Section 5.13, Purchaser and the Company shall, and
shall cause the Company Subsidiary to, (i) use its reasonable efforts (at its
own expense) to properly retain and maintain such records until such time as
Seller agrees that such retention and maintenance is no longer necessary and
(ii) allow Seller and its agents and representatives (and agents or
representatives of any of its affiliates), at times and dates mutually
acceptable to the parties, to inspect, review and make copies of such records
as Seller may reasonably deem necessary or appropriate from time to time, such
activities to be conducted during normal business hours and at Seller\'s
expense.

(c) Refunds and Credits. Purchaser, Seller and the Company agree that:

(i) Any refund or credit of Taxes of the Company or the Company Subsidiary for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of Seller. Any refund or
credit of Taxes of the Company or the Company Subsidiary for any Post-Closing
Tax Period shall be for the account of Purchaser. Any refund or credit of
Taxes of the Company or the Company Subsidiary for any Straddle Period shall
be equitably apportioned between Seller and Purchaser.





(ii) Purchaser shall, if Seller so requests, at Seller\'s cost (but only to
the extent of Purchaser\'s reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses) cause
the Company or the Company Subsidiary to file for and obtain any refunds or
credits of Taxes to which Seller is entitled under this Section 5.06(c).
Purchaser and the Company shall permit Seller (at its own cost) to control the
prosecution of any such refund claim and, where deemed appropriate by Seller,
shall authorize by appropriate powers of attorney such Persons as Seller shall
designate to represent the Company or the Company Subsidiary with respect to
such refund claim.

(iii) Each party shall, or shall cause its affiliates to, forward to any other
party entitled under this Section 5.06(c) to any refund or credit of Taxes any
such refund within 10 calendar days after such refund is received or reimburse
such other party for any such credit within 10 calendar days after the credit
is allowed or applied against other Tax liability. The parties shall treat any
payments under the preceding sentence as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the control of the prosecution of a claim
for refund of Taxes paid pursuant to a deficiency assessed subsequent to the
Closing Date as a result of an audit shall be governed by the provisions of
Section 6.08.

(d) Tax Sharing Agreements. Seller shall cause the provisions of any Tax
sharing agreement among Seller or any of its affiliates (other than the
Company and the Company Subsidiary) on the one hand and the Company or the
Company Subsidiary on the other hand to be terminated on or before the Closing
Date.

SECTION 5.07 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such similar Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording
charges and other fees and charges (including any penalties, interest and
additions thereto) ("Transfer Tax") incurred in connection with the transfer
of the Shares or otherwise in respect of the Transactions shall be paid by the
Purchaser but, for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any Transfer Taxes
arising as a result of the withdrawal of a relief or exemption from Transfer
Taxes claimed on or before the Closing Date by the Company or the Company
Subsidiary and which become payable as a result of Closing.

SECTION 5.08 Publicity. For a period of 30 calendar days following the Closing
Date, no public release or announcement concerning the Transactions shall be
issued by a party or such party\'s affiliates without the prior consent of the
other parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), except as
such release or announcement may be required by law (including applicable
securities laws) or the rules or regulations of any United States or other
securities exchange, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance; provided, however, that
(a) notwithstanding such right of the non-disclosing party to comment thereon,
any such release or announcement that is required by law or the rules or
regulations of any securities exchange may contain any information that
counsel to the disclosing party, in its sole discretion, advises is required
to be included therein; and (b) each of Seller, the Company and Purchaser may
make internal announcements to their respective employees that are consistent
with the parties\' prior public disclosures regarding the Transactions. Seller
and Purchaser agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect
to the Transactions shall be in the form, of substance and with timing agreed
upon by Seller and Purchaser.





SECTION 5.09 Records. Purchaser recognizes that certain records of the Company
and the Company Subsidiary may contain information relating to subsidiaries,
divisions and businesses of Seller and its affiliates other than the Company
and the Company Subsidiary, and that Seller may retain copies thereof.

SECTION 5.10 Avon Names Following Closing. (a) From and after the Closing,
except as expressly provided in this Section 5.10, any and all rights of the
Company and the Company Subsidiary to use the Avon Names shall terminate as of
the Closing and shall immediately revert to Seller and its affiliates (other
than the Company and the Company Subsidiary), along with any and all goodwill
associated therewith. Purchaser acknowledges that it has no rights or
interests, and is not acquiring any rights or interests, directly or
indirectly, through the Company and Company Subsidiary or otherwise, to use
the Avon Names, except as expressly provided herein. The Company and the
Company Subsidiary shall, for a period of 90 calendar days after the Closing
(the "Transition Period"), be entitled to use the Company\'s existing
letterheads, policies and procedures and other internal documents and
materials in existence and used in the operation of the business of the
Company and Company Subsidiary as of the Closing, in each case, containing the
Avon Names; provided that all such uses of the Avon Names shall be in the same
form and manner as used in the business of the Company and Company Subsidiary
as of the Closing. No later than the end of the Transition Period, Purchaser
shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries (including the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries) to revise all letterheads, policies and procedures and other
internal documents and materials to delete all references to the Avon Names.
Except as expressly provided in this Section 5.10, no other right to use the
Avon Names is granted by Seller or any of its affiliates to Purchaser, its
affiliates or, after the Closing, the Company or the Company Subsidiary,
whether by implication or otherwise, and nothing hereunder permits Purchaser,
its affiliates or, after the Closing, the Company or the Company Subsidiary,
to use the Avon Names in any manner, or to register or seek to register, or to
permit, cause or assist any third party to register or to seek to register,
any of the Avon Names in any jurisdiction. After the Transition Period,
Purchaser shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries (including the Company and
the Company Subsidiary) to cease to, and not at any time thereafter, hold
themselves out as having any affiliation or association with Seller or any of
its affiliates. Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 5.10(a),
Purchaser , the Company and the Company Subsidiary may at all times after the
Closing retain and refer to, for its internal business purposes or as
otherwise permitted under applicable Law, records and other historical or
archived documents containing or referencing the Avon Names.

of source or goodwill containing, incorporating, based on, associated with,
confusingly similar to, or dilutive of any of the foregoing, whether
registered or unregistered, in any jurisdiction in the world.





SECTION 5.11 Liz Earle Names Following Closing. (a) Seller acknowledges that,
except as expressly provided in this Section 5.11, neither it nor its
affiliates will have any rights or interests to continue to use the Liz Earle
Names effective from the Closing Date. Effective on the Closing Date, Seller
shall cause any affiliate (including Liz Earle, Inc.) to change its corporate
or registered name to the extent it contains the Liz Earle Names. No right to
use the Liz Earle Names is granted by Purchaser or any of its affiliates to
Seller or its affiliates, whether by implication or otherwise, and neither
Seller nor its affiliates are permitted to use the Liz Earle Names in any
manner, or to register or seek to register, or to permit, cause or assist any
third party to register or to seek to register, any Liz Earle Names in any
jurisdiction. Seller shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, cease to, and
not at any time from and after the Closing, hold themselves out as having any
affiliation or association with the Company or Purchaser or any of their
affiliates. Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 5.11(a), (i) Seller
and its affiliates may at all times after the Closing retain and refer to, for
its internal business purposes or as otherwise permitted under applicable Law,
records and other historical or archived documents containing or referencing
the Liz Earle Names and (ii) the relevant affiliates of Seller are permitted
to remain as record owner of the Trademarks assigned to the Company pursuant
to the Trademark Assignment Agreement until such assignment is recorded with
the appropriate Governmental Entities in accordance with the Trademark
Assignment Agreement.

(b) "Liz Earle Names" means "LIZ EARLE", any Liz Earle logo, any other names,
phrases or logos including "LIZ EARLE" or the Liz Earle logo that are
associated with the Liz Earle brand, and any trademarks, service marks,

incorporating, based on, associated with, confusingly similar to, or dilutive
of any of the foregoing, whether registered or unregistered, in any
jurisdiction in the world.

SECTION 5.12 Post-Closing Record Retention. Purchaser and the Company shall
retain, for at least seven years after the Closing Date, all books, records
and other documents pertaining to the Company\'s and the Company Subsidiary\'s
businesses that relate to the period prior to the Closing Date, except for Tax
Returns and supporting documentation which shall be retained until 60 calendar
days after the date required by applicable Law, and to make the same available
after the Closing Date for inspection and copying by Seller, during regular
business hours and upon reasonable request and advance notice. At and after
the expiration of such period, if Seller or any of its affiliates has
previously requested that such books and records be preserved, Purchaser, the
Company or the Company Subsidiary (as applicable) shall either preserve such
books and records for such reasonable period as may be requested or transfer
such books and records to Seller or its designated affiliates, in each case at
Seller\'s expense.

SECTION 5.13 Post-Closing Cooperation. (a) Seller and Purchaser shall
cooperate with each other, and shall cause their affiliates and their
respective and such affiliates\' officers, employees, agents, auditors and
representatives to cooperate with each other, for a period of 90 calendar days

the Company Subsidiary from Seller to Purchaser and to minimize any disruption
to the Company and the Company Subsidiary and the other respective businesses
of Seller and Purchaser that might result from the Transactions. Subject to
Section 5.13(b), each party shall reimburse the other for reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses incurred in assisting the other pursuant to this
Section 5.13. Neither party shall be required by this Section 5.13 to take any
action that would unreasonably disrupt its normal operations.

(b) During the period of 90 calendar days following the termination of
employment with the Company of the individual listed on Annex C, the Company
may request that such individual provide such reasonable assistance as the
Company may reasonably request upon reasonable notice during normal business
hours. Seller agrees to procure that such individual provides such assistance
during such period should such request be made by the Company. The parties
agree that no fees shall be payable by Purchaser, the Company or any of their
affiliates in relation to any such assistance, other than the reasonable out-
of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller or any of its affiliates in
procuring the provision of assistance to the Company pursuant to this Section
5.13(b) (which shall be paid by the Company).

regarding products sold by the Company and the Company Subsidiary and sales
services. Purchaser acknowledges that these and all other such services will

ARTICLE VI


Indemnification



SECTION 6.01 General Indemnification by Seller. (a) From and after the
Closing, Seller shall (without duplication with any other payment made
pursuant to this Agreement) indemnify Purchaser, its affiliates (including the
Company and the Company Subsidiary) and each of their respective officers,
directors, employees, stockholders, agents and representatives (the "Purchaser
Indemnitees") against and hold them harmless from, and will pay to Purchaser
Indemnitee the monetary value of, any loss, liability, claim, damage or
expense, including reasonable third party legal fees and expenses
(collectively, "Losses") suffered or incurred by such Purchaser Indemnitee
(other than any Loss relating to Taxes, for which indemnification shall solely
be governed by Section 6.03) to the extent arising or resulting from:

(i) any inaccuracy in or any breach of any representation or warranty made by
Seller in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; and

(ii) any nonfulfillment, nonperformance or other breach of any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement made or to be
performed by Seller or any of its affiliates (including the Company or the
Company Subsidiary solely with respect to periods prior to the Closing);





(b) Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnitee and
shall not have any liability:

(i) under paragraph (a)(i) above unless the aggregate of all Losses for which
Seller would, but for this clause (i), be liable thereunder exceeds on a
cumulative basis Â£750,000, and then only to the extent of any such excess;

(ii) under paragraph (a)(i) above for any individual items where the Loss
relating thereto is less than Â£75,000 and such items shall not be aggregated
for purposes of clause (i) of this paragraph unless any Losses arise out of
one or more claims involving or arising out of the same or substantially
similar facts, events or circumstances in which case all such Losses shall be
aggregated as one claim for purposes of determining whether the basket set
forth in this clause (ii) applies;

(iii) under paragraph (a)(i) above in excess of Â£28,000,000; provided,
however, that clauses (i) to (iii) (inclusive) shall not limit Seller\'s
obligations with respect to any claim for indemnification arising out of a
breach or alleged breach of a Seller Fundamental Representation;

(iv) under paragraph (a)(i) and (a)(ii) above, including with respect to any
claim for indemnification arising out of a breach or alleged breach of a
Seller Fundamental Representation or any covenant or agreement, in excess of
Â£140,000,000; and

(v) under paragraph (a)(i) and (a)(ii) above to the extent the Loss arose in
connection with (A) any breach of a representation and warranty or covenant
made or to be performed by Purchaser in this Agreement or (B) any Boots
Effects, in each case, only to the extent such breach or Boots Effect (as
applicable) contributed to such Loss.

(c) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, Purchaser
agrees that it and its affiliates\' sole and exclusive remedy after the
Closing with respect to any and all claims relating to this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements, the Transactions, Seller, any affiliate of Seller, the
Company, the Company Subsidiary and any of their respective assets and
liabilities (other than pursuant to Section 7.05 and other than claims of, or
causes of action arising from, fraud) shall be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Article VI. In furtherance of the foregoing, each
of Purchaser and the Company hereby waives, from and after the Closing, any
and all rights, claims and causes of action (other than pursuant to Section
7.05 and other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) it or
any of its affiliates may have against Seller or any of Seller\'s affiliates
arising under or based upon this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement, any
document or certificate delivered in connection herewith, any applicable Law
(including any Environmental Law), or otherwise (except pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VI), including any claims
for indirect, incidental, punitive, special or consequential



damages, however arising. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in
this Section 6.01(c) shall in any way impair the rights and obligations of
Purchaser and Seller to resolve disputes with respect to the Statement and the
calculation of Closing Working Capital pursuant to Section 1.04, and the fact
that Purchaser may have the right to pursue a claim for indemnification under
Article VI with respect to any facts or circumstances shall not operate to
impair the application of Section 1.04 in accordance with its terms; provided,
however, that in no event shall Purchaser be entitled to receive
indemnification for Losses to the extent that any item is reflected in the
calculation of Closing Working Capital and therefore reflected in the
calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price.

SECTION 6.02 General Indemnification by Purchaser. (a) From and after the
Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify Seller and its affiliates and each of their
respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents and
representatives (the "Seller Indemnitees") and hold them harmless from, and
will pay to Seller Indemnitee the monetary value of, any and all Loss suffered
or incurred by such Seller Indemnitee (other than any Loss relating to Taxes,
for which indemnification shall solely be governed by Section 6.03) to the
extent arising or resulting from:

(i) any inaccuracy in or any breach of any representation or warranty made by
Purchaser in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; and

(ii) any nonfulfillment, nonperformance or other breach of any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement made or to be
performed by Purchaser or any of its affiliates (including the Company or the
Company Subsidiary solely with respect to periods following the Closing).

(b) Purchaser shall not be required to indemnify any Seller Indemnitee and
shall not have any liability:

(i) under paragraph (a)(i) above unless the aggregate of all Losses for which
Purchaser would, but for this clause (i), be liable thereunder exceeds on a
cumulative basis Â£750,000, and then only to the extent of any such excess;

(ii) under paragraph (a)(i) above for any individual items where the Loss
relating thereto is less than Â£75,000, and such items shall not be aggregated
for purposes of clause (i) of this paragraph unless any Losses arise out of
one or more claims involving or arising out of the same or substantially
similar facts, events or circumstances in which case all such Losses shall be
aggregated as one claim for purposes of determining whether the basket set
forth in this clause (ii) applies;

(iii) under paragraph (a)(i) above in excess of Â£28,000,000; provided,
however, that clauses (i) to (iii) (inclusive) shall not limit Purchaser\'s
obligations with respect to any claim for indemnification arising out of a
breach or alleged breach of a Purchaser Fundamental Representation;





(iv) under paragraphs (a)(i) and (a)(ii) above, including with respect to any
claim for indemnification arising out of a breach or alleged breach of a
Purchaser Fundamental Representation or any covenant or agreement, in excess
of Â£140,000,000; and

(v) under paragraphs (a) (i) and (a)(ii) above to the extent the Loss arose in
connection with any breach of a representation and warranty or covenant made
or to be performed by Seller in this Agreement but only to the extent such
breach has contributed to such Loss.

(c) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, Seller agrees
that it and its affiliates' sole and exclusive remedy after the Closing with
respect to any and all claims relating to this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements, the Transactions, Purchaser, any affiliate of Purchaser and any of
their respective assets and liabilities (other than pursuant to Section 7.05
and other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud ) shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VI.

SECTION 6.03 Tax Indemnification. (a) From and after the Closing, Seller shall
(without duplication with any other payment made pursuant to this Agreement)
be liable for, and shall indemnify each Purchaser Indemnitee (without
duplication) against and hold it harmless from any Losses to the extent
arising or resulting from any Taxes (i) of the Company or the Company
Subsidiary attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period and (ii) for which the
Company and/or the Company Subsidiary are secondarily liable as a result of
having been a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or
aggregate group of Seller or any affiliate of Seller; provided that any such
Taxes have not been treated as a liability in the calculation of the Closing
Working Capital; provided, further, that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall not be liable under this Section 6.03
to the extent any such Taxes are attributable to a change in applicable Law or
a change in any published practice of any Taxing Authority that becomes
effective after the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, any Taxes
arising to the Company or the Company Subsidiary under section 179 TCGA 1992
(company ceasing to be member of group), sections 344 and 345 of the
Corporation Tax Act 2009 ("CTA 2009") (transferee leaving the group after
replacing transferor as party to loan relationship), section 631 CTA 2009
(transferee leaving the group after replacing transferor as party to
derivative contract), section 780 CTA 2009 (company ceasing to be a member of
group), paragraph 3 of Schedule 10 of the Finance Act 2003 ("FA 2003")
(withdrawal of group relief) and paragraph 9 of Schedule 10 FA 2003
(withdrawal of reconstruction or acquisition relief) as a result of the
transfer of the Shares by the Seller shall be treated as being attributable to
a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

(b) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall be liable for, and shall
indemnify each Seller Indemnitee (without duplication) against and hold it
harmless



from any Losses to the extent arising or resulting from Taxes of the Company
or the Company Subsidiary attributable to:

(i) any Post-Closing Tax Period;

(ii) any transactions occurring on or after the Closing outside the ordinary
course of business on the Closing Date; and

(iii) any breach by Purchaser of its obligations under this Agreement.

(c) In the case of any Straddle Period:

(i) real, personal and intangible property Taxes ("Property Taxes") of the
Company or the Company Subsidiary for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
equal to the amount of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the
denominator of which is the number of all calendar days in the Straddle
Period; and

(ii) Taxes of the Company or the Company Subsidiary (other than Property
Taxes) for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed as if such taxable
period ended as of the close of business on the day preceding the Closing
Date.

(d) Any indemnity obligation for Taxes to be made pursuant to this Section
6.03 shall be paid within 30 business days after any Purchaser Indemnitee or
Seller Indemnitee claiming it is entitled to indemnification under this
Section 6.03 makes written demand upon the other party, but in no case earlier
than five business days prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes are
required to be paid to the relevant Taxing Authority.

SECTION 6.04 Calculation of Losses; Mitigation. (a) The amount of any Loss for
which indemnification is provided under this Article VI shall be net of any
amounts recovered or recoverable by the indemnified party under insurance
policies or otherwise with respect to such Loss and shall be (a) increased to
take account of any net Tax cost incurred by the indemnified party arising
from the receipt of indemnity payments hereunder (grossed up for such
increase) and (b) reduced to take account of any net Tax benefit realized by
the indemnified party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Loss.
In computing the amount of any such Tax cost or Tax benefit, the indemnified
party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss
deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of
any indemnity payment hereunder or the incurrence or payment of any
indemnified Loss. The amount of the Loss arising out of any item included as a
liability in calculating Closing Working Capital, if any, shall be calculated
net of the amount so included.

(b) Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with each other with respect to
resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one party is obligated
to



indemnify the other party hereunder, including by using reasonable efforts (at
its own expense) to mitigate or resolve any such claim or liability. In the
event that Purchaser or Seller shall fail to use such reasonable efforts (at
its own expense) to mitigate or resolve any claim or liability, then
notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained herein, the other
party shall not be required to indemnify any Person for any Loss that would
reasonably be expected to have been avoided if Purchaser or Seller, as the
case may be, had made such efforts.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall
not be liable for any Loss under Section 6.03 to the extent such Loss is
reduced or eliminated by the surrender for nil payment of Group Relief to the
Company or the Company Subsidiary by Seller or any company other than a member
of Purchaser\'s Tax group or a company otherwise connected with Purchaser
(including by way of electing that any gain on the disposal or notional
disposal of an asset be treated as accruing not to the Company or the Company
Subsidiary but to a member of Seller\'s group). Seller may make or procure the
making of such surrender or election and Purchaser shall and shall cause the
Company or the Company Subsidiary to cooperate with Seller in relation to such
surrender or election and make all necessary returns, claims, consents and
notifications required to be made in respect of such surrender or election.

SECTION 6.05 Tax Treatment of Indemnification. Any indemnity payment under
this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

SECTION 6.06 Termination of Indemnification. The obligations to indemnify and
hold harmless any party (i) pursuant to Section 6.01(a)(i) or 6.02(a)(i) shall
terminate when the applicable representation or warranty terminates pursuant
to Section 6.09, (ii) pursuant to Section 6.01(a)(ii) or 6.02(a) (ii) shall
terminate when the applicable covenant terminates pursuant to Section 6.09 and
(iii) pursuant to Section 6.03 shall not terminate; provided, however, that
such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with
respect to any item as to which the Person to be indemnified shall have,
before the expiration of the applicable period, previously made a claim by
delivering a notice of such claim in writing (stating in reasonable detail the
basis of such claim) pursuant to Section 6.07 or 6.08 to the party to be
providing the indemnification.

SECTION 6.07 Indemnification Procedures for Other Than Tax Claims. (a) Third
Party Claims. In order for a Person (the "indemnified party") to be entitled
to any indemnification provided for under Section 6.01 or 6.02 in respect of,
arising out of or involving a claim made by any third Person against the
indemnified party (a "Third Party Claim"), such indemnified party must notify
the party required to provide indemnification therefor (the "indemnifying
party") in writing (and describing such claim in reasonable detail to the
extent known to the indemnified party) of the Third Party Claim within 30
calendar days after receipt by such indemnified party of notice of the Third
Party Claim; provided, however, that failure to give such notification shall
not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
indemnifying party shall have been prejudiced as a result of such failure, but
for the avoidance of doubt then only to the extent of such prejudice.
Thereafter, the indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying party, as
soon as reasonably practicable but in any event within five business days\'
after the indemnified party\'s receipt thereof, copies of all notices and
documents (including court papers) received by the indemnified party relating
to the Third Party Claim.





(b) Assumption. If a Third Party Claim is made against an indemnified party,
the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by
the indemnifying party; provided, however, that such counsel is not reasonably
objected to by the indemnified party. Should the indemnifying party so elect
to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall not
be liable to the indemnified party for any legal expenses subsequently
incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof. If
the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the indemnified party shall have
the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel (not
reasonably objected to by the indemnifying party), at its own expense,
separate from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it being
understood that the indemnifying party shall control such defense. The
indemnifying party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel
employed by the indemnified party for any period during which the indemnifying
party has not assumed the defense thereof (other than during any period in
which the indemnified party shall have failed to give notice of the Third
Party Claim as provided above). If the indemnifying party chooses to defend or
prosecute a Third Party Claim, all the indemnified parties shall cooperate in
the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the indemnifying party\'s request) the provision to the
indemnifying party of records and information that are reasonably relevant to
such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to testify and provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder. Whether or not the indemnifying party
assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnified party shall not
admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such
Third Party Claim without the indemnifying party\'s prior written consent. If
the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
indemnified party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a
Third Party Claim that the indemnifying party may recommend and that by its
terms obligates the indemnifying party to pay the full amount of the liability
in connection with such Third Party Claim and which releases the indemnified
party completely in connection with such Third Party Claim.

(c) Other Claims. In the event any indemnified party should have a claim
against any indemnifying party under Section 6.01 or 6.02 that does not
involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected
from such indemnified party, the indemnified party shall promptly deliver
written notice of such claim (describing such claim in reasonable detail to
the extent known to the indemnified party) to the indemnifying party. Subject
to Sections 6.06 and 6.09, the failure by any indemnified party so to notify
the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any
liability that it may have to such indemnified party under Section 6.01 or
6.02, except to the extent that the indemnifying party shall have been
prejudiced as a result of such failure, but for the avoidance of doubt then
only to the extent of such prejudice. If the indemnifying party does not
notify in writing the indemnified party within 45 calendar days following its
receipt of such notice that the indemnifying party



disputes its liability to the indemnified party under Section 6.01 or 6.02,
such claim specified by the indemnified party in such notice shall be
conclusively deemed a liability of the indemnifying party under Section 6.01
or 6.02 and the indemnifying party shall irrevocably accept such claim and pay
the amount of such liability to the indemnified party on demand or, in the
case of any notice in which the amount of the claim (or any portion thereof)
is estimated, on such later date when the amount of such claim (or such
portion thereof) becomes finally determined.

(d) Tax Claims shall be governed by Section 6.08 and not by this Section 6.07.

SECTION 6.08 Indemnification Procedures for Tax Claims.

(a) If a claim shall be made by any Taxing Authority, which, if successful,
might result in an indemnity payment to any indemnified party pursuant to
Section 6.03, the indemnified party shall promptly notify the indemnifying
party in writing of such claim (a "Tax Claim"). If the indemnified party fails
to provide the indemnifying party with notice of a Tax Claim for which the
indemnifying party may be liable under Section 6.03 within a sufficient period
of time to allow the indemnifying party to effectively contest such Tax Claim,
or in reasonable detail to apprise the indemnifying party of the nature of the
Tax Claim, in each case taking into account the facts and circumstances with
respect to such Tax Claim, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to any
indemnified party to the extent that the indemnifying party\'s position is
prejudiced as a result thereof, but for the avoidance of doubt then only to
the extent of such prejudice.

(b) Purchaser shall control all proceedings taken in connection with any Tax
Claim (including selection of counsel).

(c) All written communications pertaining to any Tax Claim relating to Taxes
of the Company or the Company Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a
Straddle Period which are transmitted to or received from the relevant Tax
Authority by Purchaser shall be copied to Seller as soon as reasonably
practicable and in no event later than 10 business days after such
communications have been so transmitted to or received by Purchaser.

(d) Notwithstanding Section 6.08(b) above, for any Tax Claim relating to Taxes
of the Company or the Company Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a
Straddle Period, Seller shall have the right to control all proceedings taken
in connection with any such Tax Claim (including in respect of the selection
of counsel) and, in furtherance thereto, Purchaser shall take such action and
procure that the Company and/or the Company Subsidiary shall, at Seller\'s
reasonable cost and expense (such cost and expense to only include reasonable
third party costs and expenses properly incurred by the Company and/or the
Company Subsidiary) take such action as Seller may promptly by written notice
to Purchaser request to dispute, resist or compromise such liabilities, costs,
damages, Taxes, Losses or expenses; provided, however, that (x) Purchaser (and
counsel of its own choosing) shall have the right to



participate fully in all aspects of the prosecution or defense of any Tax
Claim relating to a Straddle Period, at Purchaser\'s sole expense and (y)
Seller shall not be entitled to settle, either administratively or after the
commencement of litigation, any Tax Claim which would adversely affect the
liability for Taxes of Purchaser or the Company or any Company Subsidiary for
any period after the Closing Date to any extent (including, but not limited
to, the imposition of income tax deficiencies, the reduction of asset basis or
cost adjustments, the lengthening of any amortization or depreciation periods,
the denial of amortization or depreciation, or the reduction of loss or credit
carryforwards) without the prior consent of Purchaser; provided, however, that
if Seller proposes any such settlement to which the Purchaser withholds its
consent, Seller's liability for such Tax Claim shall not exceed the amount
that would have been payable by Seller pursuant to such settlement. Such
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld and shall not be necessary to the
extent that Seller has indemnified Purchaser against the effects of any such
settlement.



(e) Purchaser shall (and will be entitled to procure that the Company and/or
the Company Subsidiary shall) be at liberty without reference to Seller to
admit, compromise or otherwise deal with any Tax Claim after the service of a
notice in writing on Purchaser by Seller stating that Seller considers that
the Tax Claim should no longer be resisted.

(f) Purchaser shall and shall procure that the Company and/or the Company
Subsidiary shall cooperate with Seller in contesting any Tax Claim, which
cooperation shall include the retention (and upon Seller\'s request the
provision to Seller) of records and information which are reasonably relevant
to such Tax Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information or explanation of any material
provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such Tax Claim.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.08, Purchaser
shall not be obliged to: (i) appeal or procure that the Company and/or the
Company Subsidiary appeals against any Tax Claim in any forum beyond the first
relevant appellate body unless leading tax counsel of at least ten years\'
practice in the relevant area and in the relevant jurisdiction advises in
writing that, in that counsel\'s opinion, the chances of success in such a
further appeal would be greater than the chances of failure; or (ii) take or
procure that the Company and/or the Company Subsidiary takes any action the
effect of which is likely to affect the future conduct of the business of
Purchaser, the Company, the Company Subsidiary and/or any member of
Purchaser\'s group or affect the rights or reputations of any of them, in
which case Seller shall not and Purchaser agrees that Seller shall not be
liable under Section 6.03 to the extent that Seller\'s position in respect of
any Tax Claim is prejudiced as a result thereof.

SECTION 6.09 Survival of Representations and Covenants. The representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing solely
for purposes of Sections 6.01 and 6.02, and the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained



in this Agreement shall survive the Closing as follows: (a) the
representations and warranties made by Seller in Sections 2.01, 2.02, 2.04,
3.01(a), 3.02(a) and 3.03 (the "Seller Fundamental Representations") and the
representations and warranties made by Purchaser in Sections 4.01 and 4.02
(the "Purchaser Fundamental Representations") shall survive indefinitely; (b)
the representations and warranties in Articles II, III and IV, other than the
Seller Fundamental Representations and the Purchaser Fundamental
Representations, shall survive for 12 months following the Closing; (c) the
representations and warranties of Seller in Section 3.11 shall not survive the
Closing; and (d) all other provisions of this Agreement shall survive
indefinitely; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, Section 6.09(c) shall
not preclude any claim of, or cause of action arising from, fraud.

ARTICLE VII


General Provisions



SECTION 7.01 Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement may not be amended except
by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties. By an
instrument in writing, Purchaser, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other
hand, may waive compliance by the other with any term or provision of this
Agreement that such other party was or is obligated to comply with or perform.
No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right or remedy under this
Agreement (or any of the documents delivered pursuant to it), and no course of
dealing between the parties, operates as a waiver of such right or remedy, and
no single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy precludes any other
or further exercise of such right or remedy or the exercise of any other right
or remedy.

SECTION 7.02 Assignment. This Agreement and the rights and obligations
hereunder shall not be assignable or transferable by any party (including by
operation of law in connection with a merger or consolidation of such party)
without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that at or
following the Closing, Purchaser may assign this Agreement and any of its
rights and obligations hereunder to any of its affiliates (such affiliate
being referred to in this Agreement upon such assignment as the "Purchaser");
provided that (i) if such assignee ceases to be an affiliate of the Purchaser,
such rights and obligations are assigned or transferred to another affiliate
of the Purchaser, and (ii) such assignment shall not relieve Purchaser of any
of its obligations hereunder. Any attempted assignment in violation of this
Section 7.02 shall be void.

SECTION 7.03 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Article VI,
this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties and their permitted
assigns and nothing herein expressed or implied shall give or be construed to
give to any Person, other than the parties and such assigns, any legal or
equitable rights hereunder.

SECTION 7.04 Notices. All notices or other communications required or
permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered by
hand, sent by facsimile, sent by email or sent, postage prepaid, by

SECTION 7.05 Right to Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were



otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to equitable relief, including in the form of an injunction or
injunctions, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in an appropriate court of
competent jurisdiction as set forth in Section 7.10, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which any party is entitled at law or in equity. The right
to specific enforcement shall include the right of a party to cause the other
party to cause the Transactions to be consummated on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement. The parties hereto further agree
(a) to cooperate fully in any attempt by the other party to obtain any such
equitable remedy, (b) to waive any requirement for the security or posting of
any bond in connection with any such equitable remedy and (c) not to assert
that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to
applicable Law or inequitable for any reason, or to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. The parties acknowledge and
agree that the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, the
parties hereto would not have entered into this Agreement.

SECTION 7.06 Interpretation; Schedules; Certain Definitions. (a) The headings

applicable Law, U.S. GAAP, UK GAAP or any applicable accounting standards or

effect is not otherwise excluded from this definition of Company Material
Adverse Effect)), (xii) any action or omission by or on behalf of, or
publicity relating to, Elizabeth Drummond, whether in an individual capacity
or in connection with her relationship to the Company, including the impact
thereof on the Company and its business, products and brands, in each case

foregoing, "Indebtedness" shall not include any obligations under operating
leases, capitalized leases or undrawn letters of credit.

"Knowledge" means, with respect to Seller, the actual and constructive
knowledge of each of Arnaud Meysselle, Sandeep Verma, Natalija Jovasevic and
