 **ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT**

  



  

ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of August 9, 2008
(the " _Execution Date_ "), by and among Atlantis Plastics, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), Atlantis Plastics Films, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _AP Films_ "), and Linear Films, Inc., an Ontario, Canada
corporation (" _Linear Films_ "), ("Linear Films", and jointly and severally
with Parent, and AP Films, the " _Seller_ "), and AEP Industries Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Purchaser_ ").

  



  

WHEREAS, Parent is engaged in the business of manufacturing specialty plastic
films and custom molded and extruded plastic products used for storage and
transportation, food service, appliance, automotive, commercial and consumer
applications at various locations in the United States (the " _Parent Â’s
Business_"); and

  



  

WHEREAS, Seller is engaged in the business of manufacturing specialty plastic
films used for storage and transportation, food service, commercial and
consumer applications through three business divisions: stretch films, custom
films and institutional products, which business divisions operate at
facilities in Tulsa, Oklahoma; Nicholasville, Kentucky; Fontana, California;
Mankato, Minnesota; and Cartersville, Georgia and receive certain services
from ParentÂ’s headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia (such business activity which
is conducted at such locations is referred to herein as the " _Business_ "),
which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any of the businesses
commonly referred to as injection molding, building products, profile
extrusion or Elkhart businesses; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the Seller wishes to sell to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser wishes
to purchase from the Seller, the Purchased Assets comprising the Business,
and in connection therewith the Purchaser is willing to assume from the
Seller all of the Assumed Liabilities, all upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein; and

  



  

WHEREAS, because the Purchase Price for the Purchased Assets, together with
the purchase price for the remaining assets of ParentÂ’s Business, are
insufficient to satisfy the obligations of Parent and its Subsidiaries to all
of their creditors, Parent and its Subsidiaries have concluded that, promptly
after the Execution Date, Parent and its Subsidiaries will file cases (the "
_Bankruptcy Cases_ ") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern
District of Georgia, Atlanta Division (the " _Bankruptcy Court_ ") pursuant
to Chapter 11 of the Title 11 of the United States Code (the " _Bankruptcy
Code_ "); and

  



  

WHEREAS, Seller and Purchaser desire to effect the purchase and sale
transaction hereunder in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement, the Sale Order and in accordance with sections
105, 363, 365 and 1146 and other applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy
Code; and

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements
and covenants hereinafter set forth, and intending to be legally bound, the
Seller and the Purchaser hereby agree as follows:

whether relating to or arising out of the Business or the Purchased Assets or
otherwise, whether direct or indirect, known or unknown, fixed or contingent
or otherwise, liquidated, due or to become due (the " _Excluded Liabilities_
"). In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation thereof, except for

(i) all Taxes, except Taxes taken into account in the Net Working Capital

cure such monetary defaults at or prior to the Closing to the extent such
cure is required by Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code (any such amounts paid
to cure any such defaults, being referred to the " _Cure Costs_ "). _Section
2.02(c) of the Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth the Cure Costs that Seller
reasonably believes due and payable. If, following the Execution Date,
Purchaser determines to assume any contract or agreement that is specified

required to cure all monetary defaults, solely with respect to such newly
assumed contracts or agreements, at or prior to the Closing to the extent

 **SECTION 2.03 _Purchase Price._**

  



  

(a) Deposit. Upon the earlier of (i) the entry of an order by the Bankruptcy
Court approving the Deposit Escrow Agreement or (ii) the entry of the Bidding
Procedures Order, the Purchaser shall deliver to the escrow agent, who is
party to that certain Deposit Escrow Agreement, an amount equal to the
Deposit to be held in an interest bearing account (collectively, the "
_Deposit Escrow Funds_ "). The Seller shall have no right, title or interest
in and to the Deposit unless and until such time as the Bankruptcy Court
enters the Bidding Procedures Order.  The parties hereby agree, and the
Deposit Escrow Agreement shall provide, that the escrow agent will
immediately disburse the Deposit to the Purchaser if the Purchaser notifies
such escrow agent in writing that either (i) any Person (including, but not
limited, to any creditor, creditorsÂ’ committee, or representative of the
Office of the United States Trustee) has moved any court for reconsideration
or rehearing of the deposit escrow order, or (ii) any Person has filed a
notice of appeal with respect to the deposit escrow order. If the Deposit
Escrow Funds are disbursed to the Purchaser pursuant to the preceding
sentence, upon entry of the Bidding Procedures Order and written notice of
such event by Seller to Purchaser, the Purchaser shall redeposit the Deposit
Escrow Funds with the escrow agent within one Business Day of such written
notice. Upon the earlier of (i) the entry of an order by the Bankruptcy Court
approving the Deposit Escrow Agreement or (ii) the

  

  



  



  



        
   

  



  



  

Bankruptcy CourtÂ’s entry of the Bidding Procedures Order, the parties
irrevocably elect, as the sole judicial forum for the adjudication of any
matters arising under or in connection with the Deposit Escrow Agreement and
the Deposit Escrow Funds, and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of, the
Bankruptcy Court. The Deposit will be (i) payable to Seller at the Closing
and applied to the Base Purchase Price, or (ii) disbursed subject to the
Bidding Procedures Order and the Deposit Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(b) _Closing Purchase Price_. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Base
Purchase Price_ " shall mean Eighty-Seven Million Dollars ($87,000,000.00).
At Closing, the Purchaser shall deliver to Seller, by wire transfer in
immediately available funds, an amount equal to (i) the Base Purchase Price
(as adjusted pursuant to Sections 2.07, 5.11 and 5.12); less (ii)
all principal, interest and assignment costs attributable to the Bonds (to
the extent the obligations under the Bonds are assumed by Purchaser), and
(iii) the Escrow Funds (" _Closing Purchase Price_ ").  If one or more of
the Bonds are not assigned to Purchaser at Closing, then there shall be no
reduction in the Base Purchase Price paid in cash at Closing with respect to
the non-assigned Bond for purposes of this Section 2.03(b). The Closing
Purchase Price shall be subject to further adjustment as set forth in Section
2.08 below (as so adjusted, plus the Escrow Funds to the extent payable or
paid to Seller, the " _Purchase Price_ ").

  



  

(c) _Allocation_. The sum of the Purchase Price and any other relevant items,
including the Assumed Liabilities, shall be allocated among the Purchased
Assets as the Purchaser shall reasonably determine and communicate to Seller
within ninety (90) days following the Closing (the "Allocation"), provided
however, the Purchaser and the Seller agree that the amount allocated to the
tangible personal property located in California and Georgia other
than Inventories, ("FA") shall be as close to the adjusted basis (for federal
income tax purposes) of the FA on the Closing Date, as PurchaserÂ’s auditors
determine to be consistent with the requirements of GAAP.  If the Purchase
Price is adjusted after Closing, the Allocation shall also be adjusted by the
Purchaser within ten (10) Business Days of such Purchase Price adjustment. To
the extent permitted by the Code or other applicable tax law, any adjustments
to the Purchase Price shall be allocated, to the extent possible, to the
classes of assets that were the subject of the adjustments to the Purchase
Price, subject to the agreement herein with respect to FA. The parties agree
to abide by such allocation for all Tax purposes, and shall take no position
on any Tax return inconsistent with such allocation. Without limiting the
foregoing, each of the Seller and Purchaser shall file IRS Form 8594 in
manner consistent with such allocation.

  



  

(d) _Escrow Agent_. The fees, costs and expenses of the escrow agent under
the Deposit Escrow Agreement and the Working Capital Escrow Agreement, and
all other fees, costs and expenses related thereto, shall be borne by Seller
and Purchaser in equal proportion.

  



  

 **SECTION 2.04 _Closing_.**  Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the sale and purchase of the Purchased Assets and the assumption
of the Assumed Liabilities contemplated by this Agreement shall take place at
a closing (the " _Closing_ ") to be held at the

  



  



  



  



         
 

  



  



  

offices of Greenberg Traurig, LLP, 3290 Northside Parkway, Suite 400,
Atlanta, Georgia 30327 at 10:00 A.M. Atlanta time on the third Business Day
following the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions specified in
Article VII or at such other place or at such other time or on such other
date as the Seller and the Purchaser may mutually agree upon in writing (the
" _Closing Date_ "). All acts and deliveries pursuant to Sections 2.05 and
2.06 shall be deemed to occur contemporaneously on the occurrence of the last
act or delivery and none of such acts or deliveries shall be effective until
the last of the same has occurred.

  



  

 **SECTION 2.05 _Closing Deliveries by the Seller_** _._ At the Closing, the
Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Purchaser:

  



  

(a) the Bill of Sale, the Deeds with all required Conveyance Tax stamps
affixed (in the form acceptable to the Title Company), each Assignment of
Lease, and the Assignment of Transferred Intellectual Property;

(c) executed counterparts of each Ancillary Agreement to which the Seller is
a party other than the Ancillary Agreements delivered pursuant to Section

 **SECTION 2.07 ****_Pre-Closing Adjustment of Purchase Price._**

  



  

(a) Within five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller, shall cause
to be prepared and delivered to the Purchaser a certificate (the "
_Estimated Closing Certificate_ ") reasonably acceptable to Purchaser. The
Estimated Closing Certificate shall be executed by a senior officer of the
Seller, dated as of the date of delivery, stating that there has been
conducted under the supervision of such senior officer, with the
participation of Purchaser as Purchaser deems appropriate (including, without
limitation, having a representative at each inventory count and a review of
all books and records utilized in preparing the Estimated Closing
Certificate), a review of all relevant information and data then available
and setting forth the SellerÂ’s estimate of the Net Working Capital (as
defined below) of the Seller as of the Closing Date (the " _Estimated
Net Working Capita_ l"). The Estimated Net Working Capital shall be
determined in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the
past practices of Seller.  The Base Purchase Price shall be increased by the
positive amount by which the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds
$44,562,000 (the " _Target Net Working Capital_ "), or the Base Purchase
Price shall be decreased by the positive amount by which the Target Net
Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital.

  



  

(b) For the purposes of this Agreement, including the determination of the
Estimated Net Working Capital, the Target Net Working Capital, the Closing
Net Working Capital, and the Final Net Working Capital, the term " _Net
Working Capital_ " shall have the meaning and will be calculated as set forth
on _Exhibit 2.07(b)_ attached hereto.

  



  



  



  



        
   

  



  



  

(c) At Closing, Purchaser shall tender Two Million Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($2,500,000.00) (the " _Working Capital Escrow Amoun_ t") to be held
in escrow in an interest bearing account (collectively with interest, the "
_Working Capital Escrow Funds_ ") pursuant to the Working Capital Escrow
Agreement.

  



  

 **SECTION 2.08 _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment._**

  



  

(a) As promptly as practicable, but no later than forty-five (45) days after
the Closing Date, the Purchaser will cause to be prepared and delivered to
the Seller a certificate (the " _Closing Certificate_ ") signed by a
senior officer of the Purchaser setting forth a calculation of the Net
Working Capital of the Seller as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Net
Working Capital_ "), which shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied
on a basis consistent with the past practices of Seller and the principles
utilized in preparing the Estimated Net Working Capital. The Seller will
assist the Purchaser in the preparation of the Closing Certificate and will
provide the Purchaser and its independent auditors access at all reasonable
times to the SellerÂ’s personnel and properties, books, and records for such
purpose. Purchaser and Seller shall be entitled to have a representative
present at each respective inventory count. The Closing Certificate
shall present fairly, in all material respects, the Net Working Capital of
the Seller as of the close of business on the Closing Date. The Seller shall
have 25 days to review the certificate and accompanying report (the " _Review
Period_ "). The Seller and its accountants shall be provided with customary
access to the work papers of the PurchaserÂ’s independent accountants in
connection with such review, subject to the execution of customary
confidentiality and other undertakings. If the Seller disagrees in any respect
with any item or amount shown or reflected in the Closing Certificate or with
the calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital, the Seller may, on or
prior to the last day of the Review Period, deliver a notice to the Purchaser
setting forth, in reasonable detail, the disputed item or amount and the
basis for the SellerÂ’s disagreement therewith (the " _Dispute Notice_ "). The
Dispute Notice shall set forth the SellerÂ’s position as to the proper Closing
Net Working Capital. If no Dispute Notice is received by the Purchaser on or
prior to the last day of the Review Period, the Closing Certificate shall be
deemed accepted by the Seller, whereupon the Closing Net Working Capital
reflected on the Closing Certificate shall be deemed to be the " _Final Net
Working Capital_ ," and the Purchaser or the Seller, as the case may be, will
pay to the other Party the amount owing in accordance with Section 2.08(d)
hereof. In the event that the Seller timely delivers a Dispute Notice to the
Purchaser, the Purchaser or the Seller, as the case may be, will pay to the
other Party any undisputed portion of the amount determined under Section
2.08(d) hereof which would be payable regardless of how the matters set forth
in the Dispute Notice are resolved (the " _Undisputed Amount_ "), with
interest on such amount accruing as of the Closing Date as determined in
Section 2.08(f) hereof.

  



  

(b) For fourteen (14) days after the PurchaserÂ’s receipt of a Dispute Notice,
if any, the Parties shall endeavor in good faith to resolve by mutual
agreement all matters in the Dispute Notice. In the event that the Parties
are unable to resolve by mutual agreement any matter in the Dispute Notice
within such 14-day period, the

  

  



  



  



        
   

  



  



  

Purchaser and the Seller hereby agree that they shall engage Dixon Hughes,
PLLC (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ ") in respect of this Section 2.08,
provided that in the event Dixon Hughes, PLLC is unable or unwilling to serve
as the Independent Accounting Firm the parties shall agree upon an accounting
firm of national reputation as the Independent Accounting Firm.  The Seller
and the Purchaser shall submit the disputed matters, as described in the
Dispute Notice, together with such arguments as either of them choose to make
in connection therewith, in writing to the Independent Accounting Firm within
twenty (20) days after the Independent Accounting FirmÂ’s engagement.

  



  

(c) The Seller and the Purchaser shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Independent Accounting Firm to resolve the disputed
matters based upon the materials submitted to it pursuant to the last
sentence of Section 2.08(b) hereof within thirty (30) days following the
submission of such materials. The Independent Accounting Firm
shall determine, based solely on presentations by the Seller and the
Purchaser, and not by independent review, only those issues in dispute
specifically set forth in the Dispute Notice and shall render a written
report to the Seller and the Purchaser (the " _Adjustment Report_ ") in which
the Independent Accounting Firm shall, after considering all matters set
forth in the Dispute Notice, determine what adjustments, if any, should be
made to the Closing Certificate solely as to the disputed items and shall
determine the appropriate Final Net Working Capital on that basis.
The Adjustment Report shall set forth, in reasonable detail, the
Independent Accounting FirmÂ’s determination with respect to each of the
disputed items or amounts specified in the Dispute Notice, and the revisions,
if any, to be made to the Closing Certificate and the Closing Net Working
Capital, together with supporting calculations. In resolving any disputed
item, the Independent Accounting Firm (i) shall be bound to the principles of
this Section 2.08, (ii) shall limit its review to matters specifically set
forth in the Dispute Notice; and (iii) shall not assign a value to any item
higher than the highest value for such item claimed by either Party or less
than the lowest value for such item claimed by either Party. All fees and
expenses relating to the work of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
borne by the Seller, on the one hand, and by the Purchaser, on the other
hand, in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved by
the Independent Accounting Firm (such inverse proportion for each Party shall
be the positive value obtained by each Party by dividing (1) the difference
of (A) the amount of the Closing Net Working Capital proposed by such Party
and (B) the amount of the Final Net Working Capital established by the
Independent Accounting Firm by (2) the difference between (A) the amount of
the Closing Net Working Capital proposed by the Seller and (B) the amount of
Closing Net Working Capital proposed by the Purchaser), which proportionate
allocation will also be determined by the Independent Accounting Firm and be
included in the Adjustment Report. The Adjustment Report, absent fraud or
willful misconduct, shall be final and binding upon the Purchaser and the
Seller, shall be deemed a final arbitration award that is binding on each of
the Purchaser and the Seller, and no Party shall seek further recourse
to courts, other tribunals or otherwise, other than to enforce to the
Adjustment Report. Judgment may be entered to enforce the Adjustment Report
in any court having proper jurisdiction.

  



  



  



  



        
   

  



  



  

(d) Effective upon the end of the Review Period (if a timely Dispute Notice
is not delivered), or upon resolution of an Undisputed Amount, upon the
resolution of all matters set forth in the Dispute Notice by mutual agreement
of the Parties or by the issuance of the Adjustment Report (if a timely
Dispute Notice is delivered), the Closing Purchase Price shall be (i)
_increased_  dollar-for-dollar by the amount by which the Final Net Working
Capital exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital, or (ii) _decreased_
 dollar-for-dollar by the amount by which the Final Net Working Capital is
less than the Estimated Net Working Capital. The aggregate net adjustment
paid by Purchaser, or Seller on its behalf by the escrow agent, under this
Section 2.08 shall not be more than $2.5 million plus any interest determined
in accordance with Section 2.08(e), and in no event shall the amount payable
under this Section 2.08 be subject to any offset, defense or counterclaim by
the paying Party. Any adjustment to the Closing Purchase Price pursuant to
this Section 2.08 shall be paid by the Purchaser or the Seller, as the case
may be, together with interest accruing as of the Closing Date as determined
pursuant to Section 2.08(e) below, (1) if a timely Dispute Notice is not
delivered, on the fifth (5th) Business Day following the end of the Review
Period, or (2) if a timely Dispute Notice is delivered, (A) with respect to
Undisputed Amounts paid pursuant to the last sentence of Section 2.08(a), on
the fifth (5th) Business Day following the delivery of a Dispute Notice to
the Seller, and (B) adjusted for any payment made by the Purchaser or the
Seller, as the case may be, as described in the foregoing clause (A), on the
fifth (5th) Business Day following the resolution of all matters set forth in
the Dispute Notice by mutual agreement of the Parties or on the fifth (5th)
Business Day following the date on which the Adjustment Report has been
received by the Seller and the Purchaser, whichever is earlier. Any such
payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated by the Purchaser or the Seller, as the case
may be, at least two (2) Business Days prior to the applicable payment date.
 In accordance with the Working Capital Escrow Agreement, any funds payable
by Seller to Purchaser in this Section 2.08 shall be made by the escrow agent
to Purchaser. Any Working Capital Escrow Amount remaining in the related
escrow account after any payments are made to Purchaser pursuant to this
Section 2.08(d) shall be automatically released by the escrow agent and paid
to Seller within three (3) Business Days after the Closing Purchase Price
becomes final and binding on the parties.

  



  

(e) Any interest payable pursuant to this Section 2.08 shall be paid at an
annual rate equal to the prime rate per annum as quoted in _The Wall Street
Journal_ on the Closing Date and shall be calculated on the basis of the
actual days elapsed between the Closing Date and the date of payment over
three hundred and sixty (360) days.  Any interest payable pursuant to the
prior sentence shall first be paid from the accrued interest portion of the
Working Capital Escrow Funds.

consent, order or approval will be paid by Seller and Purchaser in equal
proportion (other than normal filing fees that are imposed by Law, which will
be paid by Purchaser).

  



  

(c) Each party to this Agreement shall promptly notify the other party of any
communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental
Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and
permit the other party to review in advance any proposed communication by
such party to any Governmental Authority. Neither party to this Agreement
shall agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults
with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate at such meeting. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement,
the parties to this Agreement will coordinate and cooperate fully with each
other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the
other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and in
seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods including under
the HSR Act. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties to this
Agreement will provide each other with copies of all correspondence, filings
or communications between them or any of their representatives, on the one
hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of its

  

  



  



  



        
   

  



  



  

staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(d) Without limiting the generality of the partyÂ’s undertaking pursuant to
Section 5.04, each party agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts
and to take commercially reasonable steps necessary to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade
regulation Law that may be asserted by any United States or non-United States
governmental antitrust authority so as to enable the parties hereto to
expeditiously close the transactions contemplated hereby no later than
November 3, 2008, provided, however, in no event shall the Purchaser be
required to take any actions requiring the sale, divesture or disposition of
such of its assets, properties or businesses or of the assets, properties or
businesses to be acquired by it pursuant hereto even if such actions would be
required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of materially delaying or
preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

 **SECTION 5.05 ****_Retained Names and Marks._**

  



  

(a) Purchaser hereby acknowledges that all right, title and interest in and
to the names "Atlantis," Atlantis Plastics," and "Cedarway", "Ply-J",
"Kwikcut", and "The Look and Feel of Real Split Cedar" together with all
variations thereof and all trademarks, service marks, domain names, trade
names, trade dress, corporate names and other identifiers of source
containing, incorporating or associated with any of the foregoing (the "
_Retained Names and Marks_ ") are owned exclusively by the Seller, and that,
except as expressly provided below, any and all right of the Business to use
the Retained Names and Marks shall terminate as of the Closing and shall
immediately revert to the Seller. Purchaser further acknowledges that it has
no rights, and is not acquiring any rights, to use the Retained Names and
Marks, except as provided herein.

  



  

(b) The Purchaser shall, for a period of 90 days after the date of the
Closing except with respect the collection of Receivables or sale of
Inventory, which right shall continue until 180 days after Closing, have a
non-exclusive license to use all of the existing stocks of signs,
letterheads, advertisements and promotional materials, Internet web sites and
Internet domain names, inventory and other documents and materials included
in the Purchased Assets (" _Existing Stock_ ") containing the Retained Names
and Marks, after which date the Purchaser shall remove or obliterate all
Retained Names and Marks from such Existing Stock or cease using such
Existing Stock, and transfer to the Seller any rights with respect to
Internet domain names incorporating any Retained Names or Marks.

  



  

(c) Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, no other right to use the
Retained Names and Marks is granted by the Seller to the Purchaser, and
nothing hereunder shall permit the Purchaser to use the Retained Names and
Marks on any

  

  



  



  



        
   

  



  



  

documents, materials, products or services other than in connection with the
Existing Stock.

  



  

(d) The Purchaser acknowledges that in connection with the SellerÂ’s sale of
its molded plastics business, the Seller will be granting the purchaser
thereof rights to use the names "Atlantis" and "Atlantis Plastics" for an
agreed upon period of time for purposes of transitioning the sale of that
line of business. The Purchaser further acknowledges that such names will be
used in the administration of the SellerÂ’s bankruptcy Estate under the
Bankruptcy Code.

  



  

 **SECTION 5.06 _Notifications of Breaches; Update of Disclosure
Schedule._**

  



  

(a) Until the Closing, each party hereto shall promptly notify the other
party in writing of any fact, change, condition, circumstance or occurrence
or nonoccurrence of any event or agreement of which it is aware that will or
is reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions set forth in Article
VII of this Agreement becoming incapable of being satisfied.

  



  

(b) The Seller may, from time to time, on or prior to October 15, 2008, by
notice given in accordance with this Agreement, supplement or amend the
Disclosure Schedule to correct any matter that would otherwise give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.02(a)(i). If SellerÂ’s
breach is incurable or has not been cured by the earlier of (A) October 30,
2008 and (B) within 10 Business Days after delivery of such supplement or
amendment, the Purchaser shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at
any time on or prior to the date which is 5 Business Days from (i) the date
of such notice, if such notice explicitly states that such breach is
incurable and that Seller must be notified of PurchaserÂ’s termination within
5 Business Days of the receipt of such notice, or (ii) if not subject to
Section 5.06(b)(i), the end of such 10-Business Day cure period. If the
Purchaser fails to so terminate this Agreement, the Purchaser shall be deemed
to have waived the breach or breaches set forth in the applicable supplement
or amendment to the Disclosure Schedule for purposes of the closing condition
in Section 7.02(a)(i);  _provided_ , _however_ , that such waiver shall not
be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of
the same term or condition as a result of subsequent supplements and
amendments to the Disclosure Schedule, or a waiver of any other term or
condition of this Agreement.

  



  

(c) The Seller may, from time to time, on or prior to October 30, 2008, by
notice given in accordance with this Agreement, inform the Purchaser that
there has been a breach by the Seller of any of its covenants or
other agreements that would otherwise give rise to the failure of a condition
set forth in Section 7.02. The Purchaser shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement at any time on or prior to the date which is 5 Business Days
from the date of delivery of such notice of breach. If the Purchaser
fails to so terminate this Agreement, the Purchaser shall be deemed to have
waived the breach or breaches set forth in such notice for purposes of the
closing conditions in Section 7.02; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such waiver shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or
a subsequent waiver of the same term or condition or a waiver of any other
term or condition of this Agreement.

  



  



  



  



        
   

  



  



  

 **SECTION 5.07 _Bulk Transfer Laws._**  The Purchaser hereby waives
compliance by the Seller with any applicable bulk sale or bulk transfer laws
of any jurisdiction in connection with the sale of the Purchased Assets to
the Purchaser.

  



  

 **SECTION 5.08 _Transition Services._**  Following the Closing, the Seller
shall provide, or cause to be provided, at PurchaserÂ’s cost, certain services
to the Business that are currently provided by the Seller and its Affiliates
to the Business, all as more fully set forth in a transition services
agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit 5.08_ (the "
_Transition Services Agreement_ ") to be entered into by the Seller and the
Purchaser as of the Closing.

  



  

 **SECTION 5.09 ****_Further Action; Cooperation._**

  



  

(a) Subject to Section 5.15, the parties hereto shall use all reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, to do or cause
to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law,
and to execute and deliver such documents and other papers, as may be
required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements. Subject to Section 5.15, from time to time, Seller and
Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, to execute,
acknowledge and deliver all such further conveyances, notices, assumptions,
releases and such other instruments, and shall take such further actions, as
may be necessary or convenient to fully assure Purchaser the parties hereto,
and its respective successors and permitted assigns, the effectiveness of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

  



  

(b) With respect to the Settlement Agreement between Parent and Pliant
Corporation dated October 3, 2007 (the "Pliant Agreement") pursuant to which
Pliant granted to Parent a license to certain patent materials, if such
Pliant Agreement cannot be assigned to Purchaser pursuant to the Bankruptcy
Code or due to the failure to obtain the consent of Pliant, Seller shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts and shall cooperate with Purchaser to
obtain a substantially similar license of the Licensed Products (as defined
in the Pliant Agreement) if requested by Purchaser. If the Pliant Agreement
cannot be assigned or if a license of the Licensed Products to Purchaser
cannot be obtained, there shall be no deduction to the Purchase Price except
that the inventory relating to the Licensed Products shall not be included as
an asset of Seller for purposes of the calculation of Net Working Capital and
Purchaser shall be permitted to sell all such inventory.

  



  

 **SECTION 5.10 _Tax Cooperation, Exchange of Information and Access to
Business Records._**

  



  

(a) The Seller and the Purchaser will provide each other with such
cooperation and information as either of them reasonably may request of the
other (and the Purchaser shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to
provide such cooperation and information, at SellerÂ’s expense) in filing any
Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, determining any liability
for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes or 


  



  



  



        
   

  



  



  

participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of
Taxes relating to the Purchased Assets or the Business.  Subject to Section
2.03(c), Purchaser shall cooperate with and take commercially reasonable
actions at SellerÂ’s request to minimize Conveyance Taxes arising out of this
transaction (for which Seller shall be liable under Section 5.11), including
but not limited to, PurchaserÂ’s registration as a "dealer" for state sales
and use taxes with regard to conveyance of the Inventory. Such cooperation and
information shall also include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or
portions thereof, together with accompanying schedules and related work
papers and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by taxing
authorities. The Seller and the Purchaser will make themselves (and their
respective employees) available, on a mutually convenient basis, to provide
explanations of any documents or information provided under this Section
5.10. Each of the Seller and the Purchaser will retain all Tax Returns,
schedules and work papers and all material records or other documents in its
possession (or in the possession of its Affiliates) relating to Tax matters
relevant to the Purchased Assets or the Business for the taxable period first
ending after the Closing and for all prior taxable periods until the later of
(i) the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to
which such Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard to
extensions, or (ii) six years following the due date (without extension) for
such Tax Returns. After such time, before the Seller or the Purchaser shall
dispose of any such documents in its possession (or in the possession of its
Affiliates), the other party shall be given the opportunity, after 90 daysÂ’
prior written notice, to remove and retain all or any part of such documents
as such other party may select (at such other partyÂ’s expense).

  



  

(b) From and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall provide access to
the Seller and Parent (at all times during normal business hours and without
charge), to the Business Records and other information relating to the
Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, and to make paper and electronic
copies of such Business Records, at SellerÂ’s expense, as Seller may solely
deem necessary to (i) administer or complete any cases under chapter 11 of
the Bankruptcy Code of Seller; and (ii) commence the wind-down of the Estate
and to address all matters in connection with the wind-down of the Estate.
Such access shall include, without limitation, access to any computerized
information retrieval systems relating to the Business Records, the Purchased
Assets or the Assumed Liabilities.

  



  

 **SECTION 5.11 ****_Conveyance Taxes_** **.** The Seller agrees to assume
liability for and to pay any Conveyance Taxes incurred as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Seller shall make any and all
filings (including applications for tax clearance certificates) required (i)
to be relieved of (and to relieve Purchaser from) any Conveyance Taxes
otherwise applicable to the contemplated transactions and (ii) to relieve
Purchaser of any liability for any Taxes of Seller (other than any such Taxes
which are included in Closing Net Working Capital and which, accordingly,
reduce the Purchase Price). The Seller shall, prior to Closing, provide
Purchaser with a copy of all such filings and certificates. In the event that
any applicable jurisdiction lacks a procedure for certifying, or is unable
or unwilling to certify, that Purchaser will not succeed to any liability
of Seller for Taxes in such jurisdiction, then the Seller shall (i)
provide to Purchaser other evidence satisfactory to Purchaser that Purchaser
will not, by reason of the purchase of the Acquired Assets pursuant to this
Agreement, succeed to any liability of the

  

  



  



  



        
   

  



  



  

Seller for any such Taxes, or (ii) agree to escrow from the Purchase Price at
Closing a reasonable estimate of such Taxes for payment of such Taxes as they
become due (following which the balance of such escrow may be released to
Seller).

  



  

 **SECTION 5.12 _Proration of Taxes and Certain Charges._**

  



  

(a) Except as provided for in Section 5.11 and except to the extent taken
into account in Net Working Capital, all Property Taxes levied with respect
to the Purchased Assets for any taxable period that includes the day before
the date of the Closing and ends after the date of the Closing, whether
imposed or assessed before or after the date of the Closing, shall be
prorated between the Seller and the Purchaser as of 12:01 A.M. on the date of
the Closing (which proportionate share of Seller shall be based on the number
of days in such Tax period prior to the Closing Date, and which proportionate
share of Purchaser shall be the remaining number of days in such Tax period).
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, (i) if any such Property Taxes that
are due and payable in the Tax period that includes the Closing Date have
been determined but have not been paid by Seller before Closing, Seller shall
be charged at Closing an amount equal to that portion of such Property Taxes
that relates to the portion of the Tax period before the Closing Date (which
portion shall be determined in accordance with the proration method described
in the preceding sentence) and Purchaser shall timely pay the Property Taxes
and (ii) if any such Property Taxes that are due and payable in, or relate
to, a Tax period that includes the Closing Date have not been determined
before Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall mutually agree in good faith to an
estimate of the amount of such Property Taxes, Seller shall be charged at
Closing an amount equal to that portion of such Taxes that relates to the
portion of the Tax period before the Closing Date (which portion shall be
determined in accordance with the proration method described in the preceding
sentence) and Purchaser shall timely pay the Property Taxes. To the extent
that the actual Property Taxes described in the preceding sentence that are
payable in, or relate to, a Tax period that includes the Closing Date differ
from the amount apportioned at Closing, the parties shall make all necessary
adjustments by appropriate payments between themselves within thirty (30)
days of the issuance of final Tax bills. All Property Taxes that are levied
with respect to the Purchased Assets and that relate to Tax periods beginning
on or after the Closing Date shall be the responsibility of Purchaser.

  



  

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all installments of
special assessments or other charges on or with respect to the Purchased
Assets payable by the Seller for any period in which the date of the Closing
shall occur, including base rent, common area maintenance, royalties, all
municipal, utility or authority charges for water, sewer, electric or gas
charges, garbage or waste removal, and cost of fuel, shall be apportioned as
of the Closing if practicable, and each party shall pay its proportionate
share promptly upon the receipt of any bill, statement or other charge with
respect thereto. If such charges or rates are assessed either based upon time
or for a specified period, such charges or rates shall be prorated as of
12:01 A.M. on the date of the Closing. If such charges or rates are assessed
based upon usage of utility or similar services, such charges shall be
prorated based upon meter readings taken on the

  

  



  



  



        
   

  



  



  

date of the Closing. If any of the foregoing proration amounts cannot be
determined as of Closing due to final bills or readings not being issued as
of Closing, the parties will prorate such items as and when the actual bills
therefor are issued to the appropriate party based on the proportion of time
that each party owned the assets during the respective period. The party
owing amounts to the other by means of such prorations shall pay the
same within thirty (30) days following such proration.

  



  

(c) All refunds, reimbursements, installments of base rent, additional rent,
license fees or other use related revenue receivable by any party to the
extent attributable to the operation of the Business for any period in which
the Closing shall occur shall be prorated so that the Seller shall be
entitled to that portion of any such installment applicable to the period up
to but not including the date of the Closing and the Purchaser shall be
entitled to that portion of any such installment applicable to any period
from and after the date of the Closing, and if the Purchaser or the Seller,
as the case may be, shall receive any such payments after the date of the
Closing, they shall promptly remit to such other parties their share of such
payments.

  



  

(d) The prorations pursuant to this Section 5.12 may be calculated after the
date of the Closing, as each item to be prorated (including any such Tax,
obligation, assessment, charge, refund, reimbursement, rent installment, fee
or revenue) accrues or comes due, provided that, in any event, any such
proration shall be calculated not later than 30 days after the party
requesting proration of any item obtains the information required
to calculate such proration of such item.

  



  

 **SECTION 5.13 _Adequate Assurances Regarding Acquired Contracts and
Required Orders._** With respect to each Acquired Contract, Purchaser shall
provide adequate assurance of the future performance of such
Acquired Contract by Purchaser. Purchaser shall take such actions as may be
reasonably requested by Seller to assist Seller in obtaining the Bankruptcy
CourtÂ’s entry of the Sale Order and any other order of the Bankruptcy Court
reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

 **SECTION 5.14 _Sale Solicitations; Bidding Procedures; and Break-Up
Fee._**

  



  

(a) Seller shall work with the Purchaser and, with respect to the Business,
shall not solicit inquiries, proposals, offers or bids from, and negotiate
with any Person other than Purchaser with respect to any Alternative
Transaction (as defined below) until the entry of the Bidding Procedures
Order. From the date on which the Bankruptcy Court enters the Bidding
Procedures Order until the entry of the Sale Order, Seller and its Affiliates
and representatives shall be permitted to market and solicit inquiries,
proposals, offers or bids from, and negotiate with, any Person other than
Purchaser regarding any (i) merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
Seller and its Affiliates, (ii) purchase or acquisition directly or
indirectly by merger, consolidation, business combination, share exchange,
joint venture or otherwise 35% or more of the assets of the Business or (iii)
any combination of the foregoing (an " _Alternative Transaction_ "), and may
take any other affirmative action in connection therewith

  

  



  



  



  



  



        
   

  



  



  

(including, but not limited to) (A) entering into any definitive agreement or
letter-of-intent with respect thereto, (B) issuing press releases, placing
advertisements or making other releases or disclosures in connection
therewith), or (C) seeking approval of the Bankruptcy Court for any
Alternative Transaction, and nothing in this Agreement will, or is intended
to, in any way be deemed to restrict such actions or efforts). Neither
Seller nor any of its respective Affiliates or representatives shall have
any liability to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or representatives,
either under or relating to this Agreement or any Law, by virtue of entering
into or seeking Bankruptcy Court approval of such a definitive agreement for
an Alternative Transaction; provided, that Purchaser is paid any Break-up Fee
or Expense Reimbursement that may be required to be paid pursuant
to Sections 5.14(d) and (e) at the time provided for in this Agreement.

  



  

(b) As soon as practicable (but in no event later than five (5) Business
Days) after the Execution Date, Seller must file with the Bankruptcy Court
an application or motion seeking approval of the Bidding Procedures Order
that provides for the conduct of the Sale in accordance with the bidding
procedures that will contain such provisions described more fully on _Exhibit
5.14(b)_ and shall be in a form and substance agreed upon by Purchaser and
Seller (the " _Bidding Procedures_ "). Seller will seek Bankruptcy Court
approval for the Bidding Procedures Order as a matter preliminary to the
Bankruptcy CourtÂ’s subsequent approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated herein by entry of the Sale Order. If this Agreement represents
the highest and best bid for the Purchased Assets as determined in accordance
with the procedures set forth in the Bidding Procedures Order, Seller shall
present the Sale Order at the hearing to approve a sale of the Purchased
Assets.

  



  

(c) Following entry of the Sale Order by the Bankruptcy Court, Seller shall
not seek, solicit, encourage or negotiate any offer to purchase or acquire
all or any portion of the Purchased Assets, whether pursuant to a potential
sale, plan or otherwise.

  



  

(d) Solely to the extent provided in Section 8.02, at any time following
the Bankruptcy CourtÂ’s entry of the Bidding Procedures Order, if
Seller consummates an Alternative Transaction with a purchaser other than
the Purchaser, whether pursuant to a sale, plan of reorganization or
otherwise, the Seller shall pay to Purchaser concurrently with the closing of
such transaction, a break-up fee in the amount equal to three percent (3%) of
the Base Purchase Price (the "Break-Up Fee") from the cash proceeds realized
at the closing of the Alternative Transaction.  Any Break-Up Fee payable to
the Purchaser pursuant to this Section 5.14(d) shall be paid as an
administrative expense claim of the Seller under Section 507(a)(2) of the
Bankruptcy Code against SellerÂ’s Bankruptcy Estate as granted in the Bidding
Procedures Order as entered by the Bankruptcy Court.

  



  

(e) If Purchaser terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c) or
Section 8.01(e)(i), Purchaser shall be entitled to the reimbursement of its
actual, reasonable fees and expenses (the " _Expenses_ ") in the maximum
amount of Four Hundred Thousand Dollars ($400,000) (the " _Expense
Reimbursement_ "). This Expense Reimbursement is to reimburse the Purchaser
for fees and expenses incurred in

  

  



  



  



  



        
   

  



  



  

connection with the preparation, execution and performance of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, filing and
notification fees, and fees and expenses of Purchaser and its representatives
in reaching this Agreement, complying with its terms and otherwise
effectuating the transaction. In furtherance of receipt of the Expense
Reimbursement, Purchaser must prepare a summary of Expenses incurred and for
which it seeks payment. Purchaser will use its commercial best efforts to
provide such summary within five (5) Business Days after Purchaser becomes
eligible to receive the Expense Reimbursement and, upon SellerÂ’s request,
provide such documentation as is reasonably requested, for those Expenses for
which it is seeks reimbursement. Any dispute regarding the reasonableness
of an expense for which the Purchaser seeks reimbursement under this Section
shall be determined by the Bankruptcy Court. The Expense Reimbursement,
to the extent earned under this Agreement, shall be allowed as
an administrative expense claim under Section 507(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy
Code against SellerÂ’s Bankruptcy Estate as granted in the Bidding
Procedures Order as entered by the Bankruptcy Court.

  



  

 **SECTION 5.15 _Non-Assignment of Certain Contracts and Permits._** __
Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Acquired Contract or any
Permit, if, notwithstanding the provisions of sections 363 and 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code, an attempted assignment thereof, without the consent of any
other Person party thereto, would constitute a breach thereof or in any way
negatively affect the rights of either of the Seller or Purchaser (unless the
restrictions on assignment would be rendered ineffective pursuant to sections
9-406 through 9-409, inclusive, of the Uniform Commercial Code, as amended),
as the assignee of such Acquired Contract or Permit, as the case may be,
thereunder. If, notwithstanding the provisions of sections 363 and 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code, such consent or approval is required but not obtained,
Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser without the payment by Seller of
further consideration, in any commercially reasonable arrangement designed to
provide Purchaser with the benefits of or under any such Acquired Contract or
Permit, including, without limitation, enforcement for the benefit of
Purchaser of any and all rights of Seller against any Person party to the
Acquired Contract or Permit arising out of the breach or cancellation thereof
by such Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that after Closing, Purchaser shall
be responsible for all payment and other obligations under, and for all costs
of enforcing rights under, such Acquired Contract or Permit. Any assignment
to Purchaser of any Acquired Contract or Permit that shall, notwithstanding
the provisions of sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, require the
consent or approval of any Person for such assignment as aforesaid shall be
made subject to such consent or approval being obtained.

  



  

 **SECTION 5.16 _Receivables_. ** From time to time after the Closing, to
the extent Seller receives proceeds of Receivables, Seller shall remit
promptly to Purchaser any such proceeds no less frequently than on a weekly
basis, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account or
accounts as are specified in writing by Purchaser.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller shall have no liability with respect to pursuing the
collection of, or the collectibility of, the Receivables, but agrees to use
reasonable commercial efforts to assist Purchaser in pursuing the collection
of the Receivables.

  



  



  



  



  



         
 

  



  

 **SECTION 5.17 _Non-Compete; Non-Disparagement._**

  



  

(a) In consideration of the payment of the Purchase Price by Purchaser and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Seller covenants and agrees
that for a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the second
anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent and its Affiliates shall not,
directly or indirectly, manufacture any specialty plastic films currently
manufactured by or being developed by the Business. The foregoing shall not
be construed to prohibit Seller from manufacturing specialty plastic films
not currently manufactured by the Business, nor shall it prohibit or
restrict Seller or its Affiliates from (a) owning less than five (5%) percent
of any class of securities listed on a national exchange or registered under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 of a Person that is engaged in business
or operations that compete with the Business, or (b) conducting or
operating any and all of ParentÂ’s Business, other than the activities
conducted by the Business.

  



  

(b) Parent and its Affiliates shall not disparage Purchaser or its
Affiliates, any of their respective products or practices, or any their
respective directors, officers, agents, or representatives, either orally or
in writing.

  



  

 **Article VI**

  

 ** **

  

 **employee matters**

  



  

 **Section 6.01** ** _Offer of Employment._**

  



  

(a) _Exhibit 6.01_ contains the name, position, wage rate or salary, tenure,
vacation and primary job location of all Active Business Employees of the
Seller.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall permit and allow reasonable
access by Purchaser to discuss and make offers of post-Closing employment
with the Current Employees. As of the Closing, the Purchaser shall
offer employment, on substantially the same terms and conditions as in effect
prior to the Closing, to all of the Active Business Employees (excluding any
such individual whose employment with the Seller shall have terminated prior
to Closing). As used herein, "T _ransferred Employee_ " means each employee
who accepts such offer. Purchaser agrees that it will continue to offer
employment to the Transferred Employees as shall be necessary to avoid any
potential liability by Seller with respect to the Business for a violation of
the WARN Act attendant to a failure to notice such employees of a so-called
"mass layoff" or "plant closing" as defined in the WARN Act. For the purposes
of determining PurchaserÂ’s compliance with the foregoing provision, SellerÂ’sÂ’
Employees terminated, if any, by Seller during the sixty (60) day period
prior to the Closing Date (and with respect to which Seller has provided
Purchaser with written notice as of the Closing) and PurchaserÂ’s termination,
if any, of any Transferred Employees within ninety (90) days subsequent to
the Closing, shall be taken into consideration and PurchaserÂ’s obligations
hereunder shall extend to any WARN Act violations resulting from the
aggregation of such terminations. Nothing contained herein shall be
deemed either to affect or to limit in any way the management prerogatives
of Purchaser with respect to

  



        
   

  



  

Transferred Employees, or to create or to grant to such employees any third-
party beneficiary rights or claims or causes of action of any kind or nature.

  



  

 **Section 6.02** ** _Employee Benefits._**  As of the Closing, each
Transferred Employee shall cease to be covered under the Plans. As of the
Closing Date, the Transferred Employees shall be covered by the employee
benefit plans of the Purchaser to the extent comparable employees of
Purchaser are so covered. Each Transferred Employee shall receive credit for
his or her pre-Closing service with the Seller and its Affiliates and
predecessors under the PurchaserÂ’s employee benefit plans for purposes
of eligibility, benefit plan entry date, vesting and benefit accrual, and
there shall not be any waiting periods or, for purposes of any group health
plan, any limitations based upon pre-existing conditions; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall such credit result in the duplication of
benefits or the funding thereof. To the extent taken into account in the Net
Working Capital calculation, Purchaser shall assume responsibility for the
vacation time due to the Transferred Employees as of the Closing Date.

  



  

 **Section 6.03** ** _Health Insurance Coverage._**

  



  

(a) The Purchaser and Seller each acknowledge that in connection with the
transaction contemplated under this Agreement, the Seller shall cease to
maintain any group health plan effective as of the Closing Date (or as soon
as administratively feasible thereafter). Accordingly, the Purchaser and
Seller each agree that the Purchaser shall be solely responsible for
notifying and providing continuation coverage under COBRA, to the following:
(i) those individuals who are MandA qualified beneficiaries (as defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-4(a)) with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("MandA Qualified Beneficiaries"),
whether the qualifying event resulting in such coverage occurred before, on
or after the Closing Date, and (ii) those individuals set forth on _Section
6.03(a) of the Disclosure Schedule_ (who are other former employees of the
Seller (or their spouses or dependents and who are not otherwise MandA
Qualified Beneficiaries) (the "Transition Services Employees").

  



  

(b) The Seller shall provide to the Purchaser records ("COBRA Records") of
each of SellerÂ’s former employees and retirees (and their dependents) who
were previously employed in connection with the Business and who were
receiving COBRA continuation coverage from Seller as of the Closing Date.
Such COBRA Records shall include (i) the name and address of the former
employee or retiree, (ii) the specific qualifying event (listed under Code
section 4980B(f)(3)) that entitled the former employee or retiree and his or
her dependents to elect COBRA continuation coverage, (iii) the date on which
COBRA continuation coverage was elected, (iv) the type of health plan
coverage elected; and (v) the name of the former employee or retireeÂ’s
dependents who elected COBRA continuation coverage.

  



  

(c) The Purchaser shall make available to the SellerÂ’s Transition Services
Employees coverage under PurchaserÂ’s group health medical program and, at the
SellerÂ’s election, coverage under the PurchaserÂ’s dental, life insurance and
short-term disability programs ("Transition Service Employee Coverage").
Transition Service

  



        
   

  



  

Employee Coverage shall be offered at the COBRA premium rates (as to the
programs that are group health plans) or the premium cost (for all other
programs), plus the applicable annual "HRA" (medical savings account)
contribution.  The Purchaser shall bill such costs to the Seller monthly, on
a prospective basis, pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement which
costs the Seller shall pay in full to the Purchaser within 30 days of the
monthly billing issue date. The Seller shall timely provide the Purchaser
with such information as the Purchaser may reasonably request to administer
and audit the Transition Service Employee Coverage. In the event that Seller
does not timely remit all of any monthly billed costs or provide any
requested administration information, the Purchaser shall, upon prior written
notice to the Transition Services Employees and the Seller, have the right to
unilaterally, and in its sole and absolute discretion, terminate its
obligations under this Section 6.03(c) to make available Transition Service
Employee Coverage.

  



  

(d) The Purchaser shall make COBRA continuation coverage available to each
Transition Service Employee (and that individualÂ’s spouse and dependents who
are qualified beneficiaries) upon the post-Closing occurrence of a qualifying
event for COBRA purposes. Such COBRA continuation coverage shall be at the
former Transition Service EmployeeÂ’s, or other qualified
beneficiaryÂ’s, expense, and the COBRA premiums will be billed by the
Purchaser (or its third-party COBRA administrator) to that individual. The
Seller shall timely provide the Purchaser with the necessary liaison
(including, but not limited to, COBRA Records information) necessary for the
PurchaserÂ’s administration of the provisions of this Section 6.03(d).

  



  

 **Section 6.04** ** _Non-Solicitation._**  For a period of two years after
the Closing Date, Seller and its Affiliates shall not, directly or
indirectly, hire, retain or attempt to hire or retain any Transferred
Employee, unless Purchaser terminates such Transferred Employee, or in any
way interfere with the relationship between Purchaser and any of the
Transferred Employees.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and its
Affiliates may engage in a generalized search for employees through media
advertisements, employment firms and other similar means and may hire any
Person who responds to such searches.

  



  

 **Section** ** 6.05 _Assumption of Separation Obligations._**

  



  

(a) If an Active Business Employee does not accept the PurchaserÂ’s offer of
employment made under Section 6.01(b), then, to the extent any severance pay,
salary continuation or similar arrangement ("Severance Benefit") is otherwise
payable to that individual under any Plan, such Severance Benefit shall be
the obligation of Seller and not the Purchaser.

  



  

(b) the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall cover each Transferred Employee
under a Severance Benefit in accordance with the requirements of Section
6.02.  If the Purchaser severs the employment of a Transferred Employee
within six (6) months after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall pay
the Transferred Employee a Severance Benefit equal to the greater of (i)
the Severance Benefit that was payable to the Transferred Employee under
the applicable Plan as of the Closing Date or (ii) the Severance Benefit
that is otherwise payable to the Transferred Employee under the applicable
employee benefit plan or other Purchaser policy providing for a

  



        
   

  



  

Severance Benefit to that Transferred Employee. If the Purchaser severs the
employment of a Transferred Employee after six (6) months after the Closing
Date, the Purchaser shall pay the Transferred Employee only such Severance
Benefit that is payable under the applicable employee benefit plan or other
Purchaser policy providing for a Severance Benefit to that
Transferred Employee at that time.

  



  

(c) Except as provided in Section 6.05(b), the Purchaser does not assume any
liability or other obligation to pay any Severance Benefit to any other
individual who is a current or former employee of or service provider to the
Seller, including without limitation, any current or former employee of
Seller that is deemed to be "severed" or "terminated" as a result of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement as of the Closing.

 **Section** ** 10.03 _Public Announcements._** Neither party to this
Agreement shall make, or cause to be made, any press release or public
announcement in respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or otherwise communicate with any news media without the prior
written consent of the other party, not to be unreasonably withheld, unless

parties to this Agreement shall cooperate as to the timing and contents of
any such press release, public announcement or communication.

  



  

 **Section** ** 10.04 _Specific Performance._** The Parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to any
valid termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 8.01 and as except
as set forth in this Agreement, the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to

 **Section** ** 10.05 _Severability._**  If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law
or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect for so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to either party hereto. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties

contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible.

Disclosure Schedules, and the exhibits and other instruments referenced

undertakings, both written and oral, between the Seller and the Purchaser
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

  



  

 **Section** ** 10.07 _Assignment._ ** This Agreement may not be assigned
by operation of law or otherwise without the express written consent of the

sole discretion of the Seller or the Purchaser), as the case may be.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser may, without the consent of Seller,
assign this Agreement and the rights and obligations under it to (a) to its
lenders for collateral security purposes or (b) to one or more of its
subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , Purchaser shall remain liable in full
for the performance of its obligations hereunder.

  



  

 **Section** ** 10.08 _Amendment._ ** This Agreement may not be amended or
modified except (a) by an instrument in writing signed by, or on behalf of,

 **Section** ** 10.09 _Waiver._**  Either party to this Agreement may: (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts

warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document delivered
by the other party pursuant hereto; or (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements of the other party or conditions to such partyÂ’s obligations
contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party to be bound thereby.
Any waiver of any term or condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any
subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a
waiver of any other term or condition of this Agreement. The failure of
either party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall
not constitute a waiver of any of such rights.

  



  

 **Section** ** 10.10 _No Third Party Beneficiaries._** Except as set forth
in Article IX, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever, including any rights of employment for any
specified period, under or by reason of this Agreement.

  



  

 **Section** ** 10.11 _Currency._ ** Unless otherwise specified in this
Agreement, all references to currency, monetary values and dollars set forth

construed, performed and enforced in accordance with, and governed by, the
laws of the State of Georgia (without giving effect to the principles of
conflicts of laws thereof), except to the extent that the laws of such State
are superseded by the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable federal law. For so
long

  



        
   

  



  

as Seller is subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court, the parties
irrevocably elect, as the sole judicial forum for the adjudication of any
matters arising under or in connection with the Agreement, and consent to the
exclusive jurisdiction of, the Bankruptcy Court. During such time that
Seller is not subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court,
the parties irrevocably elect, as the sole judicial forum for the
adjudication of any matters arising under or in connection with this
Agreement, the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Georgia. The parties hereto further: (a) submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such non-Bankruptcy courts referenced above and (b)
irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or
otherwise, in any such action, any claim that it is not subject personally to
the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or
immune from attachment or execution, that any such action is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the action is improper, or that this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may not
be enforced in or by any of the above-named courts.

  



  

 **Section** ** 10.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial._** EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.13.

  



  

 **Section** ** 10.14 _Counterparts._**  This Agreement may be executed and
delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts,
and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which
when executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
