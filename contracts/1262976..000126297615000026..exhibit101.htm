If and to the extent that (a) restitu-   tion in kind is not permitted by the nature of the Breach; (b) restitution in kind has not been ef-   fected by the Sellers within a period of six weeks after receipt of the Breach Notification by the   Sellers; or (c) the Sellers finally refuse (verweigern ernsthaft und endg&#252;ltig) to make restitution   in kind, Purchaser shall be entitled to request from the Sellers compensation in cash by pay-   ment in cash of the amount of all damage, direct losses, reasonably foreseeable indirect dam-   ages (including loss of profit), expenses, or liabilities (including attorneys&#39; fees) (collectively, the   &quot;Losses&quot;) which would not exist if such Sellers&#39; Warranty were true, complete or complied with.

LIMITATIONS TO THE SELLERS&#39; LIABILITY   9.1 Claims against the Sellers under the Sellers&#39; Warranties can only be made if:   (a) each single claim exceeds an amount of EUR 50,000, provided that (i) this amount is   reduced to EUR 25,000 after the Purchaser has suffered six claims against the Sellers   on account of Breaches below EUR 50,000 (such amount, EUR 50,000 or after a reduc-   tion to EUR 25,000 is hereinafter referred to as the &quot;De minimis Amount&quot;) and provid-   ed further that (ii) claims below the De-minimis Amount shall be aggregated to the ex-   tent they arise out of the same set of facts; and    (b) the aggregate amount of all such claims exceeds an amount of EUR 500,000.    If the De minimis Amount (Freigrenze) pursuant to Section 9.1(a) is exceeded, the entire   amount of such claim shall be taken into account for calculating the threshold pursuant to Sec-   tion 9.1(b). If the threshold (Freigrenze) pursuant to Section 9.1(b) is exceeded, the full amount   shall be recoverable, and not only the exceeding amount. Section 9.1 shall not apply to the Pur-   chaser&#39;s claims on account of Breaches of the Fundamental Warranties and Breaches of the   Tax Warranties.    9.2 The aggregate liability of each Seller for Breaches of Sellers&#39; Warranties or otherwise pursuant   to this Agreement shall be limited as follows:   (a) The overall liability of each Seller under or in connection with this Agreement (other than   for breaches of the obligations under Section 18) shall not exceed an aggregate maxi-   mum amount equal to such Seller&#8217;s Individual Seller Allocation of 100% of the sum of   the Final Share Purchase Price and, to the extent paid, the Contingent Purchase Price   (such sum the &quot;Aggregate Purchase Price&quot;).   (b) The aggregate liability of each Seller for Breaches of the IP Warranties and the Tax   Warranties (together with any other liabilities as described in Section 9.2(c)) shall be   limited to an amount equal to such Seller&#8217;s Individual Seller Allocation of 40% of the Ag-   gregate Purchase Price, whereby the Contingent Purchase Price is only considered if it   has actually become payable to the Sellers.     </FONT></DIV>

Therefore, the sale and transfer of the JV Shares to   the Option Holder require that the other shareholders do not exercise their pre-emption right.

Unless otherwise defined   herein, all capitalised terms used in this Agreement have the meaning ascribed to them in   the SPA.   (I) The SPA provides that on the Closing Date the Purchaser shall pay an amount of   EUR 18,000,000 (in words: Euro eighteen million) (&quot;Escrow Amount&quot;) as a cash deposit   to the Escrow Agent.   (J) The Escrow Amount shall be held in escrow by the Escrow Agent on the Escrow Account   (as defined below) and shall serve as collateral for the satisfaction of any claims by the   Purchaser against any, several or all of the Sellers pursuant to the SPA, including but not   limited to claims arising from the Sellers&#39; breaches of Sellers&#39; Warranties or non-   compliance of any covenants.

Any other termination of   this Agreement is excluded.    31.3 In case a Party intends to involve a termination right for cause it shall notify the other   Parties in writing of the intention as well as on the facts supporting such right in reasona-   ble detail and setting a time period of three weeks for the other Parties to comment on   the alleged termination right and/or cure the underlying issue(s).    31.4 In case the Escrow Agent terminates for cause or a termination for cause of another Par-   ty is based on a cause from the sphere of the Escrow Agent, the Sellers, acting through   Sellers&#39; Agent, and the Purchaser are obliged to agree at the latest as per the effective   date of the termination notice on a new escrow agent (&quot;New Escrow Agent&quot;) and to con-   clude with such New Escrow Agent an Agreement that shall correspond to the content of   this Agreement to the greatest extent possible.   31.5 During the interim period until the appointment of the New Escrow Agent the Escrow   Agent is obliged to take all reasonable measures to preserve the status quo and grant the   other Parties adequate time to appoint the New Escrow Agent.    31.6 Upon final release of the Escrow Amount the Escrow Agent shall close the Escrow Ac-   count.         </FONT></DIV>

Each Seller hereby confirms that such Seller   is acquiring the Consideration Shares for investment for the Seller&#8217;s own account, not as a nomi-   nee or agent, and not with a view to the resale or distribution of any part thereof.  By executing   this Agreement, each Seller further represents that the Seller does not presently have any con-   tract, undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any person to sell, transfer or grant participa-   tions to such person or to any third person with respect to any of the Consideration Shares.       (b) Disclosure of Information. The Securities are listed on NASDAQ Global Select   Market (the &quot;NASDAQ&quot;), and the Parent is therefore required to publish or make publicly availa-   ble certain business and financial information in accordance with the rules and practices of the   NASDAQ. The future value of the Consideration Shares is unknown, may increase or decrease,   and cannot be predicted with certainty.       (c) Restricted Securities.  Each Seller understands that the Consideration Shares   have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 and that applica-   ble U.S. federal securities laws impose restrictions on the sale, assignment, transfer, pledge,   encumbrance, and other disposal of the Consideration Shares.  Each Seller acknowledges that   the Parent has no obligation to register the Consideration Shares for resale.  The parties current-   ly expect that, upon the expiration of the six-month period following the date on which the Sellers   receive the Consideration Shares, the Sellers will be able to sell, assign, transfer pledge, encum-   ber, or otherwise dispose of (collectively, &#8220;trade&#8221;) the Consideration Shares pursuant to one or   more exemptions from the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the U.S. Securi-   ties Act of 1933, but the availability of such exemptions will depend on certain circumstances and   conditions applicable to the Sellers and the Parent at the time of such trade. The Sellers   acknowledge that the Consideration Shares are subject to the following restrictive legend, which   the parties expect will be removed at each Seller&#8217;s request after the expiration of the six-month   period following the date on which the Sellers receive the Consideration Shares, provided that   the Sellers are not &#8220;affiliates&#8221; within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws, that each   Seller provides such documentation as the Parent may reasonably request, and that the applica-   ble requirements of Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 have been met, and may not   be traded except in accordance with the restrictions contained in such legend:      THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR   INVESTMENT AND HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURI-   TIES ACT OF 1933. SUCH SECURITIES MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED, OR   TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR A VALID   EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION AND PROSPECTUS DELIVERY   REQUIREMENTS OF SAID ACT.       (d) No General Solicitation.  Neither the Sellers nor any of their agents or partners   have either directly or indirectly, including through a broker or finder, (i) engaged in any general   solicitation, or (ii) published any advertisement in connection with the offer and sale of the Con-   sideration Shares.       (e) Residence.  Each Seller resides or is incorporated and located in Germany, is not   a U.S. person as defined in Rule 902(k) of Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act of   1933, and is not acquiring the Consideration Shares for the account or benefit of a U.S. person.         </FONT></DIV>

(&#8220;Parent&#8221;) are traded on an Exchange in   the United States on the Contingent Payment Date, then Parent shall file with the United States   Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;), as promptly as practicable, and in any event   within five Business Days, after the Contingent Payment Date, a registration statement pursuant   to Rule 415 under the United States Securities Act of 1933 (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;) covering the   resale by the Sellers of the Cimpress Stock issued pursuant to Section 4.4 of the Share Pur-   chase Agreement (together with any Cimpress Stock issued as a dividend or other distribution   with respect to, or in exchange for or in replacement of, such Cimpress Stock, the &#8220;Registrable   Securities&#8221;) (the &#8220;Registration Statement&#8221;), and the Sellers shall have 2 business days to review   and comment on the Registration Statement ahead of filing in so far as it describes the Sellers or   limits sales of the Registrable Securities in any way. Registrable Securities cease to be Registra-   ble Securities upon the earlier of (i) the first anniversary of the Contingent Payment Date and (ii)   the date on which such Registrable Securities are no longer held by a Seller or a Person to which   rights under this Exhibit 4.4(c) have been transferred in accordance with Section 5(c) below.    b) Parent shall notify the Sellers of the effectiveness of the Registration Statement   and shall furnish to each Seller, without charge, such number of copies of the Registration   Statement (including any amendments, supplements and exhibits), the prospectus contained   therein (including each preliminary prospectus and all related amendments and supplements,   other than amendments and supplements effected pursuant to the filing of reports required by   the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;)) and any documents incorporated by   reference in the Registration Statement as the Sellers may reasonably request in order to facili-   tate the sale of the Registrable Securities in the manner described in the Registration Statement.   c) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to   become effective as promptly as practicable after filing it with the SEC and to maintain the effec-   tiveness of the Registration Statement for a period not exceeding the earlier of (i) the first anni-   versary of the Contingent Payment Date, or (ii) the earliest date on which each Seller ceases to   hold any Registrable Securities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Exhibit 4.4(c),   Parent may, by written notice of 24 hours to the Sellers, suspend the Registration Statement   after effectiveness and require that the Sellers immediately cease sales of shares pursuant to the   Registration Statement if Parent in good faith concludes in its sole discretion, after consultation   with its legal counsel, that it is advisable to suspend use of any prospectus as a result of pending   corporate developments or the disclosure requirements of the securities laws. Upon receipt of   any notice described in the preceding sentence, no Seller shall offer, sell, pledge, hypothecate,   transfer, distribute or otherwise dispose of, in reliance on the Registration Statement, any of such   Registrable Securities during the period in which the Registration Statement is suspended. If   Parent suspends the Registration Statement and requires the Sellers to cease sales of shares   pursuant to this Section 1(c), Parent shall, as promptly as practicable following the termination of   the circumstance that entitled Parent to do so, use reasonable best efforts to reinstate the effec-   tiveness of the Registration Statement (including the filing of any necessary amendments or sup-   plements thereto) and give written notice to all Sellers authorizing them to resume sales pursuant   to the Registration Statement. If, as a result thereof, the prospectus included in the Registration   Statement has been amended or supplemented to comply with the requirements of the Securities   Act, Parent shall enclose such revised prospectus with such notice to Sellers, and the Sellers   shall make no offers or sales of shares pursuant to the Registration Statement other than by   means of such revised prospectus.    d) Parent shall as promptly as reasonably practicable notify each Seller of any re-   quest by the SEC for any amendment or supplement to, or additional information in connection   with, the Registration Statement (or prospectus relating thereto); the issuance by the SEC of any   stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement with respect to such Sell-    </FONT></DIV>

Subject to the terms of   this Exhibit 4.4(c), if Parent becomes aware of any information that would cause any of the   statements in the Registration Statement or any prospectus related thereto, as then amended or   supplemented, with respect to Parent to be false or misleading with respect to any material fact,   or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make such statements not false or misleading,   Parent shall promptly amend or supplement the Registration Statement or such prospectus.   b) Parent covenants that, for so long as (i) Parent has a class of securities regis-   tered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and (ii) there are Registrable Securities outstanding,   it will    i) make and keep available adequate current public information, as those terms   are defined in SEC Rule 144, at all times after the effective date of the Regis-   tration Statement;   ii) file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents required   of Parent under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act; and   iii) furnish to any Seller, so long as the Seller owns any Registrable Securities   promptly upon request (A) to the extent accurate, a written statement by Par-   ent that it has complied with the reporting requirements of SEC rule 144, the   Securities Act, and the Exchange Act and (B) such other information as may     </FONT></DIV>

The indemnifying party has the right to assume the de-   fense and settlement thereof. The indemnified party may participate in any such defense or set-   tlement, but the indemnifying party is not liable to such indemnified party for any legal or other   expenses incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof. The failure   to give notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any   such action relieves such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this   Section 4 to the extent that such failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party&#8217;s ability to   defend such action, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve the in-   demnifying party from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than un-   der this Section 4.    e) If the indemnification provided for in Section 4(a) or (b) is unavailable to an in-   demnified party with respect to any Losses referred to herein or is insufficient to hold the indem-   nified party harmless as contemplated herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying   such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party   as a result of such Losses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the   indemnifying party, on the one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection   with the statements, omissions or other actions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other   relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand,   and of the indemnified party, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among oth-   er factors, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or al-   leged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or   by the indemnified party and the parties&#8217; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and   opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. Parent and the Sellers agree that it   would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 4(e) were determined by   pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that fails to take account of the equitable   considerations referred to above.

In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, in   no event will a Seller&#8217;s liability pursuant to this Section 4(e), when combined with the amounts   paid or payable by such Seller pursuant to Section 4(b), exceed the proceeds from the sale of   Registrable Securities received by such Seller, except in the case of fraud by such Seller.    f) This Section 4 will be separate from any indemnity or contribution obligations in-   cluded in any underwriting agreement entered into in connection with the registration of the Reg-   istrable Securities.   5) Termination, Transfer, and Notice   a) Parent&#8217;s obligations under this Exhibit 4.4(c) (other than Section 4) terminate, with   respect to each Seller, six months from the date on which all of such Seller&#8217;s Registrable Securi-   ties may be sold without restriction pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Parent&#8217;s obli-   gations under this Exhibit 4.4(c)may be waived in any instance by the Sellers&#8217; Agent (on behalf of   any or all Sellers).    b) Each Seller&#8217;s rights under this Exhibit 4.4(c) are personal to such Seller and non-   transferable except by will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution in connec-   tion with the transfer of some or all of his, her or its Registrable Securities to a child or spouse, or   trust for their benefit or, in the case of a partnership, limited liability company or corporation, to its   partners, members or stockholders.   c) Any notice sent by Parent to any address included in the Registration Rights   Questionnaire of a Seller constitutes notice to such Seller under this Exhibit 4.4 (c).            </FONT></DIV>
