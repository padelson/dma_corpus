17 ARTICLE IV

 

EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK; PURCHASE PRICE

 

 _Section 4.1_ _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 

(a) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than any Cancelled Shares and Dissenting
Shares) shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any action on the part
of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or the holders of any shares of Company
Common Stock, be automatically converted into and shall thereafter represent
the right to receive, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, (i) such fraction of a validly issued, fully-paid and non-
assessable share of Parent Common Stock (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") equal to
the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the sum of the Aggregate Stock
Consideration and the Incremental Deemed Stock Consideration by (B) the
Aggregate Company Shares Deemed Outstanding (the " _Per Share Stock
Consideration_ ") and (ii) the Per Share Cash Consideration (together with
the Per Share Stock Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, all of the shares of Company Common
Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant
to this _Article IV_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate (each, a " _Certificate_ ") previously representing any
such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights
with respect to such securities, except the right to receive, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, (i) the Merger
Consideration, (ii) any dividends and other distributions in accordance with
_Section 4.2(h)_ and (iii) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional
share of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section 4.3_.

 

(c) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of
Parent shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend thereon with a record date during such period, or any similar event,
the Exchange Ratio, the Per Share Cash Consideration and any number or amount
contained herein which is based on the price of Parent Common Stock or the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock, as the case may be, shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect such reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, stock dividend
thereon or similar event and provide to the holders of Company Common Stock as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event (it being understood that,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, unless any such
event described in this _Section 4.1(c)_ has occurred that would require an
adjustment pursuant to this _Section 4.1(c)_, in no event shall Parent be
obligated to issue any shares of Parent Common Stock in excess of the
Aggregate Stock Consideration in connection with the Merger).

 

(d) At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned
by Parent, Merger Sub, any Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub, or held in
treasury of the Company or owned by the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall be automatically cancelled and
retired without any conversion thereof and shall cease to exist and no
payment shall be made in respect thereof.

(e) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued,
fully-paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



18 _Section 4.2_ _Surrender and Payment_.

 

(a) At or prior to the date that is not less than two (2) months prior to the
anticipated Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of
exchanging Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock for the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Article IV_. As promptly as
reasonably practicable after the appointment of the Exchange Agent (but in any
event within ten (10) Business Days after the date thereof), Parent and the
Company will develop and finalize a letter of transmittal which shall be in
customary form and have such other provisions as to which Parent and the
Company may reasonably agree (which letter of transmittal shall specify that
the delivery of the Merger Consideration shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent) (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") for use in effecting
delivery of shares of Company Common Stock to the Exchange Agent. At or as
promptly as reasonably practicable after finalizing such Letter of
Transmittal (but in any event within ten (10) Business Days after the date
thereof and at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective Time),
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to send to each holder of record of
shares of Company Common Stock on the date thereof, and from time to time
thereafter as requested by Parent or the Company, a Letter of Transmittal,
together with instructions for effecting the surrender of Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration.

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than any Cancelled Shares),
for exchange in accordance with this _Article IV_ , evidence of book-entry
shares (or certificates if requested by any such holder) representing the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock and an amount of cash, in each case,
sufficient to pay to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock the Per
Share Cash Consideration and the Per Share Stock Consideration (such
certificates or book-entry shares for shares of Parent Common Stock and cash
in Dollars, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with
_Section 4.3_ and any dividends or distributions with respect to the shares
of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section 4.2(h)_, being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ") payable pursuant to _Section 4.1_ in
exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. The Exchange Agent
shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration
contemplated to be paid pursuant to _Section 4.1_ out of the Exchange Fund.
Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent from time to time as
needed, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued and paid in consideration therefor pursuant to _Section 4.3_ and any
dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section 4.2(h)_ of this Agreement. Except as specified in this _Section
4.2_, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 

(c) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent on a daily basis in (i) short-term direct obligations of
the United States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days
or (ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith and credit of the
United States of America is pledged to provide for payment of all principal
and interest; _provided_ , that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the
amounts payable to

 



19  the holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to this _Article IV_. If for
any reason (including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be
insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in
cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into
the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount
of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.

(d) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted
into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed and
validly executed Letter of Transmittal in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, will be entitled to receive (i) one or more shares of
Parent Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a
physical certificate is requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to _Section 4.1_ and (ii) a check (or, with respect to the
Principal Stockholder and the holders of shares of Company Common Stock set
forth on  _Section 4.2(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, by wire
transfer of immediately available Dollar funds) in an amount equal to the cash
portion of the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to  _Section 4.1_ and the other provisions contained in this
_Article IV_ , including cash payable in lieu of fractional shares in
accordance with _Section 4.3_ and dividends and other distributions in
accordance with  _Section 4.2(h)_. No interest shall be paid or accrued on
any Merger Consideration, cash payable in lieu of fractional shares in
accordance with _Section 4.3_ or dividends and other distributions in
accordance with  _Section 4.2(h)_. Until so surrendered, each such
Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares in accordance with  _Section 4.3_ and dividends and other
distributions in accordance with _Section 4.2(h)_.

(e) If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition of such payment that the Person requesting such payment shall pay,
or cause to be paid, any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
making of such cash payment to a Person other than the registered holder of
the surrendered Certificate, or required for any other reason relating to such
holder or requesting Person, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. If any portion
of the Merger Consideration is to be registered in the name of a Person other
than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate
is registered, it shall be a condition to the registration thereof that the
surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery of the Merger
Consideration shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such registration in the name
of a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish
to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is
not payable.

(f) At the Effective Time, the share transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter, there shall be no further registration of Transfers of
shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, the holders
of Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except the right

 



20  to receive the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this _Article IV_ or as otherwise provided herein or
by Applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented
to the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Certificates
shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth, in this _Article IV_.

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be returned
to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged his, her or
its shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance
with this _Section 4.2_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to
Parent for delivery of the Merger Consideration in respect of such holders
shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock for any Merger Consideration or other amounts
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed
by holders of shares of Company Common Stock three (3) years after the
Effective Time (or such earlier date prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall,
to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of Parent free
and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(h) No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in the Merger shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Certificates until such Certificates are surrendered as
provided in this _Section 4.2_. Following such surrender, subject to the
effect of escheat, Tax or other Applicable Law, there shall be paid, without
interest, to the record holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender, all dividends and other
distributions payable in respect of such shares of Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the
date of such surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to
such shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective
Time but with a payment date subsequent to such surrender. For purposes of
dividends or other distributions in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock,
all shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall
be entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if
issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

 

(i) Any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent
pursuant to this _Section 4.2_ to pay for Dissenting Shares for which
appraisal rights shall have been perfected shall be returned to Parent upon
the settlement or final and non-appealable adjudication of any claim for
appraisal rights asserted with respect to such Dissenting Shares.

 

(j) All Merger Consideration issued and paid to a holder of Company Common
Stock upon conversion of the Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to _Section 4.2(h)_ or
_Section 4.3_) shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock.

 



21 _Section 4.3_ _Fractional Shares_.

 

(a) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger,
but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Common Stock otherwise
entitled to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock will be entitled to
receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this
_Section 4.3_, a cash payment equal to the number of such fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the Parent Reference Price. Fractional
share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other
rights (including the right to receive dividends or other distributions of
Parent) of a stockholder of Parent.

(b) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of shares of Company Common Stock in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make
available such amounts to such holders of shares of Company Common Stock
without interest, subject to and in accordance with  _Section 4.2_.

_Section 4.4_ _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of
a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate as
contemplated by this _Article IV_ (including any cash payable in respect of
such shares in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with  _Section 4.3_
and any dividends or distributions payable in accordance with _Section
4.2(h))_.

 

 _Section 4.5_ _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock
as to which the holder thereof shall have properly complied with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL as to appraisal rights (each, a "
_Dissenting Share_ "), if any, such holder shall be entitled to payment,
solely from the Surviving Corporation, of the appraisal value of the
Dissenting Shares to the extent permitted by and in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that (a) if
any holder of Dissenting Shares, under the circumstances permitted by and in
accordance with the DGCL, affirmatively withdraws his, her or its demand for
appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, (b) if any holder of Dissenting
Shares fails to establish his, her or its entitlement to appraisal rights as
provided in the DGCL or (c) if any holder of Dissenting Shares takes or fails
to take any action the consequence of which is that such holder is not
entitled to payment of the appraisal value for his, her or its shares under
the DGCL, such holder or holders (as the case may be) shall forfeit the right
to appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock and such shares of Company
Common Stock shall thereupon cease to constitute Dissenting Shares and such
shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed converted as of the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this
_Article IV_. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, and
Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. The Company shall 

 



22  not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, (i) voluntarily make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal for Dissenting Shares,
(ii) offer to settle any such demands, (iii) waive any failure to timely
deliver a written demand for appraisal in accordance with the DGCL or (iv)
agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

 _Section 4.6_ _Treatment of Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and
take all other actions necessary and appropriate to provide that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock (a " _Company Option_ ") granted under the equity incentive plans of
the Company or under any and all individual consultant, employee, director,
independent contractor, independent sales personnel or distributor agreement
(collectively, the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested,
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled
and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any such cancelled Company
Option shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of
such Company Option and in settlement therefor, a payment (comprised of
Parent Common Stock and cash) equal to the product of (i) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock previously subject to such Company Option and
(ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration Value over the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock previously subject to such Company
Option (such amounts payable hereunder being referred to as the " _Per Option
Consideration_ "). From and after the Effective Time, any such cancelled
Company Option shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof,
but shall only entitle such holder to the payment of an allocable portion of
the Aggregate Option Consideration. At, or as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to deliver in exchange for each Company Option which is
canceled pursuant to this _Section 4.6(a)_ a payment (comprised of Parent
Common Stock and cash) equal to the product of (i) the Aggregate Option
Consideration and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Per Option
Consideration for such Company Option and the denominator of which is the
aggregate of the Per Option Consideration for all Company Options. The
portion of each such payment consisting of cash shall be equal to the ratio
which (i) the value of the Aggregate Adjusted Cash Consideration bears to (ii)
the value of the Aggregate Consideration (based, for such purposes, on the
Parent Reference Price in respect of the value of the Parent Common Stock that
comprised part of the Aggregate Consideration). The portion of each such
payment consisting of Parent Common Stock shall be equal to the ratio which
(i) the value of the Aggregate Stock Consideration bears to (ii) the value of
the Aggregate Consideration (based, for such purposes, on the Parent Reference
Price in respect of the value of the Parent Common Stock that comprised part
of the Aggregate Consideration). The cash and shares payable pursuant to the
preceding sentence shall be subject to any applicable withholding or other
taxes required by Applicable Law to be withheld, with any such amounts being
withheld from the cash payment to the maximum extent possible.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (or,
if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and
take all other actions necessary and appropriate to provide that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued,
to receive shares of Company Common Stock or benefits measured by the value of
a number of shares of Company Common Stock, and each award of

 



23  any kind consisting of shares of Company Common Stock, granted under Company
Stock Plans (including restricted stock units and leveraged share awards),
other than Company Options (each, a " _Company Stock-Based Award_ "), whether
vested or unvested, which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any
such cancelled Company Stock-Based Award shall be entitled to receive, in
consideration of the cancellation of such Company Stock-Based Award and in
settlement therefor, a payment of the Merger Consideration (comprised of
Parent Common Stock and cash) into which the number of shares of Company
Common Stock previously subject to such Company Stock-Based Award would have
been converted into in the Merger if such shares of Company Common Stock had
been outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that in
the case of leveraged share awards, any such payment will be reduced by any
unpaid portion of any loan with respect to such award. Such reduction shall be
comprised of a proportionate reduction in the cash and Parent Common Stock
otherwise required to be paid. From and after the Effective Time, any such
cancelled Company Stock-Based Award shall only entitle such holder to the
payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 4.6(b)_, as so
reduced. At, or as promptly as reasonably practicable after, the Effective
Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide each
holder of Company Stock-Based Awards which are canceled pursuant to this
_Section 4.6(b)_ with a lump sum cash payment and a payment of Parent Common
Stock equal to the Merger Consideration payable to such holder pursuant to
this _Section 4.6(b)_, as so reduced, subject to any applicable withholding
or other taxes required by Applicable Law to be withheld, with any such
amounts withheld from the cash payment to the maximum extent possible.

(c) The Company shall take all steps necessary to provide that the Company
Stock Plans (as well as any outstanding awards under any such plans) are
terminated effective as of the Closing.

 

(d) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued to holders of
Company Options or Company Stock-Based Awards, but in lieu thereof each
holder of Company Options or Company Stock-Based Awards otherwise entitled to
a fractional share of Parent Common Stock will be entitled to receive, from
the Company in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 4.6_, a cash
payment in lieu of such fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in addition
to the cash payment otherwise contemplated by this _Section 4.6_, equal to
the number of such fractional shares of Parent Common Stock multiplied by
the Parent Reference Price. Fractional share interests will not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights (including the right to receive
dividends or other distributions of Parent) of a stockholder of Parent. The
parties acknowledge that payment of cash consideration in lieu of issuing
fractional shares is not separately bargained-for consideration but merely
represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and
inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of
fractional shares.

_Section 4.7_ _Further Action_. If at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is necessary to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company, the directors and officers of the
Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in the name of the Company and
Merger Sub to take all such lawful and necessary action.

 



24 _Section 4.8_ _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the
Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from any of the consideration otherwise
payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to all of the consideration
payable to such Person under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign
Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, or the Exchange Agent, as the case may
be, and paid over to the applicable Governmental Authority, such deducted or
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Options or
Company Stock-Based Awards, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter and except as disclosed
in any form, report, schedule, statement or other document (including all

duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation or other legal entity
and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize such
concept) in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of the business transacted by it
requires it to be so qualified or in good standing, except where the failure
to be so qualified and in good standing would not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

_Section 5.2_ _Authorization_.

 

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and, subject to
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the delivery of the notice

(the " _Section 228 Notice_ ") following receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, and the filing of the Certificate of Merger pursuant to the DGCL, to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Except for the approvals
described in the following sentence, the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the

Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, other than the
adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote in accordance with the DGCL
(the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ "), the filing of the Certificate of
Merger pursuant to the DGCL and the delivery of the Section 228 Notice
following receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval. The only vote of
the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Company necessary
to adopt this Agreement is the Company Stockholder Approval. This Agreement

the due authorization, execution and delivery by each other party hereto,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights or by general equity principles.

 _Section 5.3_ _Company SEC Documents_.

 

(a) Since June 1, 2012, the Company and Biomet have filed with, or furnished
to, as applicable, the Commission all registration statements, prospectuses,
reports, forms, statements, schedules, certifications and other documents
required to be filed by the Company and Biomet with the Commission (together
with all exhibits and schedules thereto and all information

the last such amendment, the Company SEC Documents (i) complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act and the Sarbanes Act (to the extent then applicable) and (ii) did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. For the avoidance of doubt, the Registration Statement is not
a Company SEC Document.

 

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any related notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Documents (the "
_Company Financial Statements_ "), including each Company SEC Document filed
after the date hereof until the Closing, (i) complied, as of their respective

of the Commission with respect thereto, (ii) was prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved and (iii)
fairly presented in all material respects, as applicable, the consolidated

periods indicated (except, in the case of each of sub-clauses (ii) and (iii),
that the unaudited interim financial statements were subject to normal year-
end and quarter-end adjustments which were not material).

 

(c) Each of the Company and Biomet maintains a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Each of the Company and Biomet has
(A) reasonably designed disclosure controls and procedures (within the meaning
of Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information is made known to the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer of the Company and Biomet by others within the Company and
Biomet and (B) disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the
date of this Agreement, to its auditors and the audit committee of its Board
of Directors (1) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect its ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data and (2) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in its internal controls.

 

(d) There are no unresolved comments in comment letters received from the
Commission staff with respect to the Company SEC Documents filed or furnished
on or prior to the date hereof.

on or prior to the date of this Agreement, a true and complete copy of an
executed commitment letter among Parent, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
and Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, including all exhibits, schedules
and annexes thereto, and each fee letter associated therewith (which fee
letter may be redacted with respect to fee amounts, pricing caps and other
economic terms that could not reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
amount or availability of the debt financing contemplated by such commitment
letter) regarding the terms of the debt financing to be provided thereby
(collectively, the " _Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which the parties
thereto (other than Parent) have committed to provide, subject to the terms
and conditions set forth therein, debt financing in the amounts set forth
therein (the " _Debt Financing_ "), which includes debt securities to be
incurred in lieu of the bridge facilities (the " _Bridge Financing_ "), as
contemplated by the Commitment Letter. The Commitment Letter is (A) in full
force and effect and represents a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto and
(B) enforceable in accordance with its terms against Parent and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, in each case except as
such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other Applicable Laws of general application
affecting enforcement of creditors rights or by principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforcement is

 



48  sought in a proceeding at law or in equity). None of the respective
obligations and commitments contained in the Commitment Letter have been
withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect, and no such amendment,
modification, withdrawal, termination or rescission is contemplated by Parent
or, to the Knowledge of Parent, by any other party thereto. No event has
occurred which (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) would
or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach or a
failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Parent or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, any other parties thereto under the Commitment Letter.
There are not, and there are not contemplated to be, any side letters or
other contracts or arrangements related to the Debt Financing other than as
expressly contemplated by the Commitment Letter delivered to the Company at or
prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement. There are no
conditions precedent related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt
Financing other than those expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter
delivered to the Company prior to the execution and delivery of
this Agreement. Parent has no reason to believe that (i) it or any other
party thereto will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term of the
Commitment Letter, (ii) any of the conditions precedent to the Debt Financing
will not be satisfied or (iii) the Debt Financing will not be made available
to Parent on the Closing Date. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment
fees or other fees in connection with the Commitment Letter that are payable
on or prior to the date hereof, and will pay in full any such amounts due on
or before the Closing Date. Subject to the terms and conditions of the
Commitment Letter, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Parent has, or will have at Closing, the aggregate proceeds contemplated by
the Commitment Letter, and together with the available cash of Parent, will
have sufficient funds for Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including to (1) pay the Aggregate Cash Consideration,
(2) pay the Debt Payoff Amount, (3) pay all Breakage Costs, and (4) satisfy
all of the other payment obligations of Parent and Merger Sub contemplated by
this Agreement (such amounts referred to in clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4), in
the aggregate, the " _Required Amount_ ").

_Section 6.15_ _Parent SEC Documents_.

(a) Since June 1, 2012, Parent has filed with, or furnished to, as applicable,
the Commission all registration statements, prospectuses, reports, forms,
statements, schedules, certifications and other documents required to be filed
by Parent with the Commission (together with all exhibits and schedules
thereto and all information incorporated therein by reference, collectively,
the " _Parent SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates, or if amended,
as of the date of the last such amendment, the Parent SEC Documents (i)
complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes Act (to the extent then applicable) and
(ii) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any related notes thereto) contained in the Parent SEC Documents, including
each Parent SEC Document filed after the date hereof until the Closing, (i)

material respects with the published rules and regulations of the Commission
with respect thereto, (ii) was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods involved and (iii) fairly presented
in all material respects, as applicable, the consolidated financial position
of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of the

 



49  respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of Parents and its
Subsidiaries operations and cash flows for the periods indicated (except, in
the case of each of sub-clauses (ii) and (iii), that the unaudited interim
financial statements were subject to normal year-end and quarter-end
adjustments which were not material).

 

(c) Parent maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. Parent has (A) reasonably designed disclosure controls
and procedures (within the meaning of Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of
the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information is made known to the
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Parent and (B)
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date of this
Agreement, to its auditors and the audit committee of its Board of Directors
(1) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect in any material respect its ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data and (2) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in its
internal controls.

(d) There are no unresolved comments in comment letters received from the
Commission staff with respect to the Parent SEC Documents filed or furnished
on or prior to the date hereof.

_Section 6.16_ _Disclosure Documents_. None of the information supplied by
or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in (a) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the
Commission, at each time at which it is amended and at the time it becomes
effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading or (b) the prospectus to be filed with
the Commission as part of the Form S-4, the Consent Solicitation Statement or
the Proxy Statement, as applicable, will, at the date it is first mailed to
the stockholders of the Company, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Form S-4,
including the prospectus contained therein, will comply as to form in all
material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent makes no representation or warranty with respect to
any statements made or incorporated by reference in any of the foregoing
documents which were not supplied by or on behalf of Parent.

 

 _Section 6.17_ _Foreign Corrupt Practices Act_.

 

(a) None of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, any of their respective
officers or employees, or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any
supplier, distributor, licensee or agent or any other Person acting on behalf
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, has, since June

Applicable Law (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K.
Bribery Act 2010). There are no pending internal investigations and, to
the Knowledge of Parent, no pending Proceedings, in each case, regarding any
action or any allegation of any action described above in this _Section
6.17(a)_.

 

(b) The operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries are and have been conducted
at all times in compliance in all material respects with applicable financial
recordkeeping, reporting and internal control requirements of the Money
Laundering Laws and of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. No
Proceeding by or before any Governmental Authority that is material to Parent
and its Subsidiaries with respect to the Money Laundering Laws is pending or,
to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, is
any investigation by or before any Governmental Authority involving Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries with respect to the Money Laundering Laws pending or

administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States
Department of the Treasury, and no Proceeding by or before any Governmental
Authority that is material to Parent and its Subsidiaries with respect to any
such sanctions is pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, nor, to
the Knowledge of Parent, is any investigation by or before any Governmental
Authority involving Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any such
sanctions pending or threatened.

whose fees and expenses are the sole responsibility of Parent, no broker,
investment banker or finder is entitled to any brokerage or finders fee or
other commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement based on any Contract made by or on behalf of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries.

_Section 6.19_ _State Takeover Statutes_. Section 203 of the DGCL is

_Section 7.3_  _Antitrust Matters; Third Party Consents_.

(a) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts
to take or cause to be taken all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement, including using their
reasonable best efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all waivers,
permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and Orders of all
Governmental Authorities and officials and parties to Contracts with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that may be or become necessary for the
performance of obligations pursuant to this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Company Related Party shall have
any obligation to agree to amend or modify any Contract or pay any fees,
costs or expenses to any third party (which does not include filing or other
fees payable to Governmental Authorities, which fees shall be borne
exclusively by Parent) in connection with obtaining any such waivers,
permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications or Orders, all of
which fees, costs and expenses shall be borne exclusively by Parent. The
parties shall cooperate and assist one another in good faith (i) in
connection with all actions to be taken pursuant to this _Section 7.3(a)_,
including the preparation and making of the filings referred to herein and, if

 



58  requested, amending or furnishing additional information hereunder, and (ii)
in seeking, as promptly as reasonably practicable, to obtain all such waivers,
permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and Orders. Upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (including
_Section 7.3(b)_), each party agrees to make any filings required to be made
pursuant to the HSR Act, the EU Merger Regulation or other applicable
foreign, federal, state or supranational antitrust, competition, fair trade or
similar Applicable Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in no event later than
the dates set forth on _Section 7.3(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Company and Parent) and to supply as
promptly as reasonably practicable to the appropriate
Governmental Authorities any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested by such Governmental Authorities pursuant to the HSR
Act, the EU Merger Regulation or such other applicable foreign, federal, state
or supranational antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar Applicable
Laws. All such antitrust filings to be made shall be made in substantial
compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act, the EU Merger Regulation and
such other applicable foreign, federal, state or supranational antitrust,
competition, fair trade or similar Applicable Laws, as applicable.

(b) In furtherance, and without limiting the generality, of the foregoing,
the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate with and
assist each other in good faith to (A) determine, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, which filings are required to be made pursuant to the HSR Act,
the EU Merger Regulation or other applicable foreign, federal, state or
supranational antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar Applicable Laws
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) provide
or cause to be provided as promptly as reasonably practicable to the other
party all necessary information and assistance as any Governmental Authority
may from time to time require of such party in connection with obtaining
the relevant waivers, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations,
qualifications, Orders or expiration of waiting periods in relation to such
filings or in connection with any other review or investigation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by a Governmental Authority
pursuant to the HSR Act, the EU Merger Regulation or other applicable foreign,
federal, state or supranational antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar
Applicable Laws and (C) provide or cause to be provided as promptly as
reasonably practicable all assistance and cooperation to allow the other party
to prepare and submit any such filings or submissions required to be submitted
under the HSR Act, the EU Merger Regulation or other applicable foreign,
federal, state or supranational antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar
Applicable Laws, including providing to the other party any information that
the other party may from time to time require for the purpose of any filing
with, notification to, application with, or request for further information
made by, any Governmental Authority in respect of any such filing and (ii) (A)
cooperate with and assist each other in good faith to devise and implement a
joint strategy for making such filings, including the timing thereof, and for
obtaining any related antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar
clearances, (B) consult in advance with the other party and in good faith take
the other partys views into account regarding the overall strategic
direction of obtaining such antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar
clearances and (C) consult with the other party prior to taking any material
substantive position in any written submissions or, to the extent
practicable, in any discussions with Governmental Authorities with respect to
such antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar clearances, including any
position as to a Divestiture; _provided_ , that, in the event the parties
disagree in good faith with respect to any matter described in the foregoing
clauses (i) or (ii), as may be applicable, despite the good faith cooperation,

 



59  assistance and consultation of the parties as required herein and compliance
with their other obligations under this _Section 7.3_, Parent shall, subject
to and without limiting Parents obligations under _Section 7.3(c)_ and the
other provisions of this _Section 7.3_, be permitted to implement its
strategy and otherwise pursue its position as to which it has (x) previously
discussed and consulted with the Company, (y) taken the Companys views into
account in good faith and (z) developed, implemented and pursued with a view
to obtaining any necessary antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar
clearances as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event by the
Outside Date); _provided_ , _further_ , that, in such instances where Parent
is permitted to implement its strategy and otherwise pursue its position
pursuant to the immediately preceding proviso, the Company shall not take a
position in any filing, meeting or communication with any Governmental
Authority that is contrary to or inconsistent with such strategy and position.
Parent shall be permitted to take the lead in all joint meetings and
communications with any Governmental Authority in connection with obtaining
any necessary antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar clearances;
_provided_ , that Parent shall have complied with its obligations under
the immediately preceding clause (ii) and the other provisions of this
_Section 7.3_. Each party shall permit the other party to review and discuss
in advance, and shall consider in good faith the views of the other party in
connection with, any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, written
arguments, opinions, written proposals or other materials to be submitted to
the Governmental Authorities. Each party shall keep the other apprised of the
material content and status of any material communications with, and material
communications from, any Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including promptly notifying the
other of any material communication it receives from any Governmental
Authority relating to any review or investigation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act, the EU Merger Regulation or
other applicable foreign, federal, state or supranational antitrust,
competition, fair trade or similar Applicable Laws. The parties shall, and
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Affiliates
to use their reasonable best efforts to, provide each other with copies of all
material, substantive correspondence, filings or communications between them
or any of their respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand, with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that materials may be redacted (1) to
remove references concerning the valuation of the Company and its Subsidiaries
or Parent and its Subsidiaries, as applicable; (2) as necessary to comply
with any Contract or Applicable Laws or Orders; and (3) as necessary to
address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality
concerns.

 

(c) Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause each of their respective
Subsidiaries to, take any and all steps necessary to obtain approval of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any
antitrust or competition Governmental Authority, including taking all steps
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every legal impediment under any
applicable state, federal, foreign or supranational antitrust, competition,
fair trade or similar Applicable Law that may be asserted by any antitrust or
competition Governmental Authority or any other Person so as to enable the
parties hereto to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event prior to the Outside
Date, including proposing, negotiating, accepting, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of their Subsidiaries, assets, properties or
businesses, the entrance into, or the

 



60  amendment, modification or termination of, any Contracts or other
arrangements, and other remedies in order to obtain such approvals and to
avoid the entry of, and to avoid the commencement of litigation or other
Proceedings seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other Applicable Law in any suit or
other Proceeding, which could otherwise have the effect of materially
delaying or preventing the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, Parent and the Company shall, and
shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, defend through
litigation on the merits so as to enable the parties hereto to close the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and in any event prior to the Outside Date) any claim asserted in
court or an administrative or other tribunal by any antitrust or competition
Governmental Authority or other Person under applicable antitrust,
competition, fair trade or similar Applicable Laws in order to avoid entry of,
or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) or other Applicable Law that could
prevent or materially delay the Closing from occurring as promptly as
reasonably practicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for the avoidance of
doubt, such litigation shall in no way limit the obligations of the parties
to comply with their obligations under the terms of this _Section 7.3_.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall not
commence any litigation with respect to the matters that are the subject of
this _Section 7.3_ without the prior written consent of the Company (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Parent and
the Company shall jointly direct and control any litigation described in
either of the immediately preceding sentences, with counsel of their own
choosing; _provided_ , _however_ , that, without limiting the generality of
_Section 7.3(b)_, in the event the parties disagree in good faith with
respect to the defense or prosecution of such litigation (or the strategy with
respect thereto) despite the good faith cooperation, assistance and
consultation of the parties as required herein and compliance with their
other obligations under this _Section 7.3_, Parent shall, subject to and
without limiting Parents obligations under the other provisions of this
_Section 7.3_, be permitted to implement its strategy and otherwise pursue
its position in good faith with respect to such litigation as to which it has
(x) consulted in advance with the Company, (y) in good faith taken the
Companys views into account, including with respect to the overall strategic
direction of the defense or prosecution of any such litigation and (z)
consulted with the Company prior to taking any material substantive positions,
making dispositive motions or other material substantive filings or entering
into any negotiations concerning such litigation; _provided_ , that such
strategy is designed to obtain approval of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any antitrust or competition
Governmental Authority as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any
event prior to the Outside Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that, in such
instances where Parent is permitted to implement its strategy and otherwise
pursue its position, the Company shall not take a position that is contrary
to or inconsistent with Parents strategy and position in any filing, meeting
or communication with any Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, (i) none of Parent and any
of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall be required to agree to any sale,
transfer, license, separate holding, divestiture or other disposition of, or
to any prohibition of or any limitation on the acquisition, ownership,
operation, effective control or exercise of full rights of ownership, or
other modification of rights in respect of, any assets or businesses or other
remedy (each, a " _Divestiture_ ") that are not conditioned on the
consummation of the Merger and (ii) the Company, only with the consent of
Parent (in connection with satisfying the foregoing obligations), such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned

 



61  or delayed, shall agree to any Divestiture of any of its assets or the
assets of any of its Subsidiaries so long as such Divestiture is conditioned
on the consummation of the Merger. In the event of any conflict between
subsections (a), (b) or (c) of this _Section 7.3_, the provisions of this
subsection (c) of this _Section 7.3_ shall, which respect to the matters
addressed in this subsection (c) of this _Section 7.3_, supersede the
provisions of subsection (a) and (b) of this _Section 7.3_.

(d) Each party shall and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to respond
as promptly as reasonably practicable to any inquiries or requests for
information and documentary material received from any Governmental Authority
in connection with any antitrust or competition matters related to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not, but Parent may, if in its good faith judgment it
determines (after consulting in advance with the Company and in good faith
taking the Companys views into account) that the taking of such action would
enhance the likelihood of obtaining any necessary antitrust, competition, fair
trade or similar clearance as promptly as reasonably practicable and in
any event by the Outside Date, extend any waiting period or agree to refile
under the HSR Act, the EU Merger Regulation or any other applicable state,
federal, foreign or supranational antitrust, competition, fair trade or
similar Applicable Laws.

 

(e) Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
(i) ensure that no State Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby and
(ii) if any State Takeover Law becomes applicable to this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of
such Applicable Law on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

_Section 7.4_ _Information Pending Closing; Access_. From the date hereof
through the earlier to occur of the Closing and the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ , upon the reasonable advance written
request of Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
its and their respective Representatives to, at Parents sole cost and
expense, (a) afford to Parent and its Representatives reasonable access,
during normal business hours and in such manner as not to
unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of the businesses of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, to the properties, books, Contracts, data,
files, information and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (b)
provide such information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective operations to Parent and its Representatives as Parent may
reasonably request and (c) use commercially reasonable efforts to make
available the appropriate Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and instruct such Representatives to reasonably cooperate with Parent and its
Representatives; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not require the Company
or its Affiliates or any of its or their respective Representatives to (i)
violate any confidentiality obligations of the Company or any of its
Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives to any third party (
_provided_ , that the Company and its Affiliates shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to, at the sole cost and expense of Parent, obtain, or
cause to be obtained, waivers or enter into other arrangements to avoid such
violations so that this clause (i) does not apply), (ii) violate any privacy
or other Applicable Laws, (iii) make any disclosure of information that would
reasonably be expected, as

 



62  a result of such disclosure, and upon the advice of counsel, to have the
effect of causing the waiver of any privilege (including the attorney-client
and work product privileges) ( _provided_ , that if a joint defense agreement
or other commercially reasonable action would maintain such privilege, then
the Company and its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
enter into, at the sole cost and expense of Parent, or cause to be entered
into, a joint defense agreement on customary terms with Parent or take such
other commercially reasonable action if so reasonably requested by Parent, at
the sole cost and expense of Parent, so that this clause (iii) does not
apply), (iv) produce any information that is not generated in the Ordinary
Course of Business or (v) furnish any information that could be harmful to the
Companys competitive position or otherwise detrimental to the Company if the
Closing does not occur ( _provided_ , that the Company shall attempt, in good
faith, to make reasonable alternative arrangements as may be reasonably
necessary to produce the relevant information in a way that would not be
so harmful or detrimental). Subject to _Section 7.5(a)_, Parent shall hold,
and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives to hold, in confidence all
such information on the terms and subject to the conditions contained in
the Non-Disclosure and Exclusivity Agreement, dated as of March 25, 2014, by
and between Parent and the Company (the " _NDA_ ") and the Joint Defense and
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of April 1, 2014, by and among
the Company, Parent and their respective counsel (collectively, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "). All access and investigation pursuant to this
_Section 7.4_ shall be coordinated through the General Counsel of the Company
or the designee thereof. No access or information provided pursuant to this
_Section 7.4_ or information provided or received by any Person pursuant to
this Agreement will affect any of the representations or warranties of the
Company contained in this Agreement or the conditions hereunder to the
obligations of Parent nor, for the avoidance of doubt, shall the provisions of
this _Section 7.4_ in any way be deemed to limit the obligations set forth
in  _Section 7.10(d)_ (it being understood that in complying with its
obligations under _Section 7.10(d)_, the Company shall not be required to
provide Parent or any of its Representatives with access other than as set
forth in this  _Section 7.4_). The Company shall be entitled to have its
Representatives present at all times during any access pursuant to this
_Section 7.4_. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.4_ or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no party nor any of its
Representatives shall (A) contact or have any discussions with any of the
other partys employees below the level of Senior Vice President (or, if no
such position exists with respect to any particular area of such other
partys organization, its equivalent), unless in each case an employee of such
other party above the level of Senior Vice President has (1) made such
employee available or (2) given written consent to such contact or
discussions, (B) contact or have any discussions with any of the customers,
distributors, sales representatives, vendors, suppliers, licensees, sub-
licensees, landlords or sub-landlords or tenants or sub-tenants of any
other party or its Subsidiaries regarding such party or its Subsidiaries or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, without prior written consent
of the other party or (C) perform any onsite procedure or investigation
(including any onsite environmental investigation or study) that involves
physical disturbance or damage to any asset or property or any portions
thereof.

 

 _Section 7.5_ _Confidentiality and Announcements_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges that the information being
provided in connection with this Agreement is subject to the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement. The terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms; _provided_ , that, from and after the Effective Time, 

 



63  any Confidential Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement)
to the extent relating exclusively to the businesses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (other than any Confidential Information of the holders of the
shares of Company Common Stock) shall be deemed to be Confidential Information
of Parent for all purposes under the Confidentiality Agreement. If this
Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Effective Time, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms. If Paragraph 7 of the NDA would expire at any time
prior to the Effective Time, the term of Paragraph 7 of the NDA shall not
expire but shall instead be automatically extended without any further action
by the Company or Parent until the earlier of (x) the Effective Time and (y)
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ (but subject to 
_Section 9.3_).

(b) None of the parties shall, and shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to cause their respective Affiliates not to, issue or make, or permit
to be issued or made, any press release or other public announcement,
statement or disclosure relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, other than (i) with the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)
or (ii) as required by any Applicable Law, any Governmental Authority or the
rules and regulations of any applicable securities exchange upon prior notice
to the other parties hereto (or requested by any Governmental Authority or
applicable securities exchange); _provided_ , that the disclosing party
required to issue or make, or permitted to be issued or made, any such press
release or other public announcement, statement or disclosure shall promptly
notify the other party and allow such other party a reasonable opportunity to
comment on such press release or other public announcement, statement or
disclosure (or, in the case of any of the foregoing required to be made by an
Affiliate of such party, such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause such Affiliate to promptly notify the other party and allow such party a
reasonable opportunity to comment). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and
the Company hereby acknowledge and agree that the final form and content of
any such required press release or other public announcement, statement or
disclosure shall be at the reasonable discretion of the disclosing party.

furnishing to any Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates and its and
their respective Representatives) any information with respect to a Competing

after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall file a Registration
Withdrawal Request on Form RW with the Commission with respect to the
Registration Statement and, if deemed advisable by the Company, make a filing

_Section 7.7_ _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time (including in respect of any matters arising in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby),
existing as of the date of this Agreement in favor of the current, former or
future directors, officers, or employees, as the case may be (each, a " _D andO
Indemnified Person_") of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their
respective Organizational Documents shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect. For a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time, (i) Parent shall not, and shall not permit the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or modify any
provision in the Surviving Corporations or any of its Subsidiaries
Organizational Documents relating to the exculpation, indemnification or
advancement of expenses of any DandO Indemnified Person with respect to acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including in respect of any
matters arising in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby), unless and only to the extent required by Applicable
Law, it being the intent of the parties that all such DandO Indemnified Persons
shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation, indemnification
and advancement of expenses to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law
and that no change, modification or amendment of such documents or
arrangements may be made that will adversely affect any such Persons right
thereto without the prior written consent of that Person and (ii) Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to,
maintain any indemnification agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries
with any DandO Indemnified Person existing prior to the date of this Agreement.

(b) In addition to the other rights provided for in this _Section 7.7_ and
not in limitation thereof, for six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to (i) indemnify and hold harmless (and exculpate
and release from any liability to Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Subsidiaries) the DandO Indemnified Persons against all DandO
Expenses (as defined below) and all losses, claims, damages, judgments, fines,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement (" _D andO Losses_") in respect of any
threatened, pending or completed Proceeding, based on, arising out of,
relating to or in connection with the fact that such Person is or was a
director, officer, employee or other fiduciary of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or of any other entity arising out of or relating to acts or
omissions occurring or existing (or alleged to have occurred or existed) at or
prior to the Effective Time (including in 

 



65  respect of acts or omissions in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby) (a " _D andO Indemnifiable Claim_") and (ii)
advance, interest-free, to such DandO Indemnified Persons all DandO Expenses
incurred in connection with any DandO Indemnifiable Claim promptly after receipt
of statements therefor and upon receipt of a customary undertaking by such DandO
Indemnified Person to repay such DandO Expenses so advanced if it is determined
by a final non-appealable judgment or a court of competent jurisdiction that
such DandO Indemnified Person was or is not entitled to be indemnified under
Applicable Law. Advance payment of DandO Expenses in connection with any DandO
Indemnifiable Claims shall continue until such DandO Indemnifiable Claim is
disposed of or all judgments, Orders, decrees or other rulings in connection
with such DandO Indemnifiable Claim become final and nonappealable and are
fully and finally satisfied. For the purposes of this _Section 7.7_, " _D andO
Expenses_" shall include reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, expert fees, arbitrator and
mediator fees, and all other reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs,
charges and expenses paid or incurred in connection with investigating,
defending, being a witness in or otherwise participating in (including on
appeal), or preparing to defend, to be a witness in or participate in, any DandO
Indemnifiable Claim, but shall exclude losses, claims, damages, judgments,
fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (which items are included in
the definition of DandO Losses).

(c) The Company shall obtain prior to the Effective Time at Parents sole
cost and expense, a policy of directors and officers liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance on behalf of the persons currently covered
by the Companys and its Subsidiaries directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance policies with respect to acts or
omissions occurring or existing (or alleged to have occurred or existed) at or
prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby) for six (6) years from the Effective
Time with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage (including as
coverage relates to deductibles and exclusions) no less favorable, in the
aggregate, as the Companys and its Subsidiaries existing directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance policies;
_provided_ _,_ _however_ , that if the annual premium for such insurance at
any time during such period shall exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the
per annum rate of premium paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
date hereof for such insurance, then Parent shall only be obligated to provide
such coverage as shall then be available at an annual premium equal to three
hundred percent (300%) of such rate.

(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys fifty percent (50%)
or more of its properties and other assets to any Person (including by
liquidation, dissolution or assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar
action), then, and in each such case, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
applicable successors and assigns or transferees expressly assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 7.7_.

 

(e) The Surviving Corporation shall be a full indemnitor of first resort,
shall be required to advance the full amount of all DandO Expenses incurred by
a DandO Indemnified Person and shall be liable for the full amount of all DandO
Losses to the extent legally permitted

 



66  and as required, without regard to any rights a DandO Indemnified Person may
have against any other Company Related Party, any insurer providing insurance
coverage under an insurance policy issued to any other Company Related Party
or otherwise.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or otherwise,
the rights and benefits of each DandO Indemnified Person under this _Section
7.7_ shall not be terminated or modified in any manner as to adversely affect
any DandO Indemnified Person without the prior written consent of such
DandO Indemnified Person. The provisions of this _Section 7.7_ are intended to
be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified
Person referred to in _Section 7.7(a)_, his or her heirs and his or
her executors and administrators, each of whom is an intended third-party
beneficiary of this _Section 7.7_, and are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights, including rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have by Contract or otherwise. The
provisions of this _Section 7.7_ shall survive the consummation of the
Merger.

 

 _Section 7.8_ _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) As of the Closing Date, and for a one (1) year period following the
Closing Date, Parent will provide or cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide to those employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who remain
employed by the Surviving Corporation (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") (A)
salary and base wages that are at least equal to the salary and base wages
provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date and
(B) bonus opportunity and benefits (other than equity compensation benefits)
that, taken as a whole, are comparable in the aggregate to those provided
to similarly situated employees of Parent. For one (1) year following the
Closing Date, Parent shall provide the Continuing Employees with severance
benefits of the Company in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth
on  _Section 7.8(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing herein is intended to limit the right of Parent or the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of
any employee at any time.

(b) For purposes of determining eligibility and vesting (but not for accrual
of benefits, other than with respect to severance, vacation or paid time-off
entitlement) under all employee benefit plans, programs, policies, contracts,
fringe benefits or arrangements of Parent or its Affiliates (including, after
the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation) providing benefits after the
Closing Date to any Continuing Employee (all such plans, " _Parent Benefit
Plans_ "), Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, give each
Continuing Employee full credit for such Continuing Employees service
with the Company and its Affiliates (as well as service with any predecessor
employer, to the extent service with the predecessor employer is recognized by
the Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Closing Date) to the same extent
recognized by the Company or its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing
Date, except to the extent such recognition would result in duplication of
benefits. Parent shall waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions, actively at work requirements and waiting
periods under any Parent Benefit Plan that is a welfare benefit plan in which
Continuing Employees (and their dependents) will be eligible to participate
from and after the Closing Date, except with respect to evidence of
insurability requirements under any life insurance and disability plans.
Parent shall recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all
co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Continuing
Employee (and his or

 



67  her eligible dependents) under the Benefit Plans during the year in which
the Closing Date occurs for purposes of satisfying such years deductible and
co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they
will be eligible to participate from and after the Closing Date.

(c) Immediately following the Closing, Parent shall pay, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay, Continuing Employees a pro-rata bonus under the
annual incentive plans listed in _Section 7.8(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter for the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs based on achievement
of pro-rata performance targets for the number of days that have elapsed in
such fiscal year as of the Closing Date and with the bonus amounts to be the
pro-rata portion of a full annual bonus based on the number of days that have
elapsed in such fiscal year as of the Closing Date.

(d) The parties acknowledge and agree that, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof, Parent and the Company shall negotiate in
good faith mutually acceptable terms and conditions of an employee retention
plan and a sales force retention plan with a total target payout of
approximately Seventy Five Million Dollars ($75,000,000) in the aggregate,
which plans shall be funded and paid by Parent at the Closing in the aggregate
amount of Forty Four Million Dollars ($44,000,000) (such aggregate Forty Four
Million Dollars ($44,000,000) amount, the " _Retention Plan Amount_ ");
_provided_ , that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Company shall be permitted to provide for (i) payments of Four Million
Dollars ($4,000,000) in respect of a senior management bonus plan, (ii)
payments of approximately Eight Million Dollars ($8,000,000) in respect of an
employee bonus plan and (iii) payouts under an employee retention plan and
sales force retention plan of up to Thirty One Million Dollars ($31,000,000)
in excess of and in addition to the Retention Plan Amount, in which event any
such payments described in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) shall
reduce the Closing Date Cash to the extent such amounts have not been paid
prior to the Closing and such payments to the extent made shall not be deemed
an Expense Amount for purposes of determining the Aggregate Adjusted Cash
Consideration.

 

(e) Nothing expressed or implied herein shall (i) confer upon any past or
present employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or his or her
representatives, beneficiaries, successors and assigns, any rights or remedies
of any nature, including, any rights to employment or continued employment
with Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of
their respective successors or Affiliates, (ii) be construed to prohibit the
Parent from amending or terminating any employee benefit program or Parent
Benefit Plan or (iii) constitute or be construed as an amendment of any
employee benefit program or any Parent Benefit Plan.

_Section 7.9_ _Affiliate Arrangements_. All Contracts between the Company or
a Subsidiary of the Company, on the one hand, and any of their respective
Affiliates, on the other hand, other than Contracts (a) solely between the
Company and one or more of its Subsidiaries or between or among its
Subsidiaries or (b) set forth on  _Section 7.9_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, shall be terminated at and as of the Closing Date, and all obligations
and liabilities thereunder shall have been satisfied, other than such
provisions, obligations and liabilities that expressly survive such
termination, which provisions shall survive such termination.

 



68 _Section 7.10_ _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
to arrange and consummate the Financing on the terms and conditions described
in the Commitment Letter at or prior to the Closing (or on terms more
favorable in the aggregate to Parent and Merger Sub) including by: (i)
maintaining in effect and enforcing the Commitment Letter and complying with
their respective obligations thereunder; (ii) negotiating, entering into and
delivering the definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (the "
_Definitive Financing Agreements_ ") on the terms and conditions contained in
the Commitment Letter and, to the extent such definitive agreements are
executed and delivered prior to the Effective Time, maintaining in effect and
enforcing such definitive agreements; (iii) satisfying (or, if deemed
advisable by Parent, seeking the waiver of) on a timely basis all terms,
covenants and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter and the Definitive
Financing Agreements applicable to Parent and Merger Sub that are within their
control; (iv) participating in and assisting with the preparation of rating
agency presentations and meetings with rating agencies; and (v) upon
satisfaction of all of the conditions precedent under _Section 8.1_ and
_Section 8.2_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions), consummating or causing the consummation of the Financing
including by enforcing their rights under the Commitment Letter and the
Definitive Financing Agreements to the extent necessary at such time to fund
the Required Amount.

(b) Parent shall apprise the Company of material developments relating to the
Financing and shall give the Company prompt notice of any material adverse
change with respect to such Financing. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent
agrees to notify the Company promptly, and in any event within one (1)
Business Day the same comes to the Knowledge of Parent, if at any time prior
to the Closing Date (i) the Commitment Letter or any of the commitments with
respect to the Debt Financing thereunder or any Definitive Financing
Agreement, as applicable, shall expire or be terminated for any reason, (ii)
for any reason, all or a portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable or
(iii) any Financing Source or any other Person that is a party to
any Commitment Letter breaches, defaults, terminates or repudiates any
provisions thereunder or threatens in writing to do any of the foregoing.
Parent and Merger Sub shall not amend, alter or replace, or agree to amend,
alter or replace, the Commitment Letter in any manner that would (A) impose
new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Financing, (B) reduce the amount of cash
proceeds from the Financing available to fund the Required Amount, in each
case, in a manner that would materially adversely affect the ability of
Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates to enforce their respective
rights against the other parties to the Commitment Letter or the Definitive
Financing Agreements or reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impair
or delay the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, in each case with respect to the foregoing sub-clauses (A)
and (B) without the prior written consent of the Company (it being understood
and agreed that Parent and Merger Sub may amend the Commitment Letter solely
to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities who had not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date of
this Agreement and to reflect assignments and replacements of lenders in
accordance with the terms of the syndication provisions of the Commitment
Letter with respect to the Debt Financing, provided that no such addition,
assignment or replacement would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially impair or delay the ability of Parent to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

 



69 (c) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter for any reason, Parent and
Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain
alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient, when
taken together with the available cash of Parent, to fund the Required Amount
and pay any related fees and expenses earned, due and payable as of the
Closing Date (the " _Alternate Financing_ ") and to obtain, and, if obtained,
will provide the Company with true, correct and complete copies of, any new
financing commitment that provides for at least the same amount of financing
as such Commitment Letter as originally issued, to the extent needed to fund
the Required Amount (the " _Alternate Commitment Letter_ "). In the event any
Alternate Financing is obtained and an Alternate Commitment Letter is entered
into in accordance with this _Section 7.10(c)_, (i) any reference in this
Agreement to "Debt Financing" shall mean the debt financing contemplated by
the Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to clause (ii) below, and (ii) any
reference in this Agreement to the "Commitment Letter" (or defined terms that
use such phrase) shall be deemed to include the Commitment Letter to the
extent not superseded by an Alternate Commitment Letter, at the time in
question and any Alternate Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect. In
furtherance of and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that (i)
any portion of the Financing structured as a capital markets financing is
unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor and (ii) all closing conditions
contained in _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_ have been satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or
waived at the Closing, provided that such conditions are capable of being
satisfied as of such day assuming the Closing was to occur on such day), then
Parent or Merger Sub shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary to consummate, or cause to be
consummated, and shall use, or cause to be used, the proceeds of the Bridge
Financing in lieu of such capital markets financing no later than one (1)
Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of the applicable conditions
set forth in clause (ii) above to consummate the Closing when Parent and
Merger Sub are required to do so pursuant to _Section 2.2_; it being
understood that such obligations to use the Bridge Financing (including any
alternative bridge financing contemplated by any Alternate Financing obtained
in accordance with this Agreement) shall exist without regard to the then
market conditions or other general economic conditions, including the interest
rate and cost of any portion of the Financing structured as a capital markets
financing and regardless of whether or not it is commercially reasonable to
do so.

(d) From and after the date of this Agreement, and through the earlier of the
Closing and the date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
_Article IX_ , the Company shall, and the Company shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries and each of its and their respective senior management, advisors
and other Representatives to, use its respective reasonable best efforts to
provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent to assist Parent in the
arrangement of any Debt Financing or any capital markets financing undertaken
in lieu of or in replacement of all or a portion of such Debt Financing (the
" _Bond Financing_ " and, together with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_
") for the purposes of financing the Merger Consideration, any repayment or
refinancing of debt in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
and any other amounts required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
all related fees

 



70  and expenses of Parent and Merger Sub (it being acknowledged and agreed by
Parent and Merger Sub that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the receipt of such Financing is not a condition to the
consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement), including (A) participating in a reasonable number of
meetings, presentations, road shows, sessions with rating agencies, Financing
Arrangers and prospective Financing Arrangers and drafting sessions, and
participating in reasonable and customary due diligence, (B) furnishing Parent
and the financial institutions providing or arranging the Debt Financing and
the Bond Financing, including any underwriters, initial purchasers or
placement agents participating in the Financing (collectively, the "
_Financing Arrangers_ ") with such customary financial and other pertinent
information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably
requested to structure, arrange, syndicate and consummate the Debt Financing
and the Bond Financing, including (1) GAAP audited consolidated balance sheets
and related statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows of the
Company for the three most recent fiscal years ended at least ninety (90) days
prior to the Closing Date (or such shorter period as may be required by
Commission regulations applicable to the Financing, but no shorter than sixty
(60) days); (2) GAAP unaudited consolidated and (to the extent available)
consolidating balance sheets and related statements of income, stockholders
equity and cash flows of the Company for each subsequent fiscal quarter ended
at least forty-five (45) days prior to the Closing Date (or such shorter
period as may be required by Commission regulations applicable to the
Financing, but no shorter than thirty (30) days); and (3) all financial
statements of the Company and financial data of the Company, in each case
covering the periods specified in clauses (1) and (2) above, of the type
required in a Bond Financing by Parent by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K
under the Securities Act and of the type and form customarily included in
capital markets transactions similar to the Bond Financing (such information
described in this clause (B) collectively, the " _Required Information_ "),
(C) assisting Parent and the Financing Arrangers in the preparation of (1)
offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda,
registration statements, prospectuses and similar documents required for the
Debt Financing and the Bond Financing, (2) customary pro forma financial
statements reflecting the Merger and the Financing (it being understood and
agreed that any financial statements referenced in this  _Section 7.10_
shall in each case meet the requirements of Regulation S-X under the
Securities Act and all other accounting rules and regulations of the
Commission promulgated thereunder applicable to a registration statement under
the Securities Act on Form S-1) and (3) materials for rating agency

reasonable efforts to cause its independent accountants to provide assistance
and cooperation in the Debt Financing and the Bond Financing, including (1)

diligence sessions, (2) providing any necessary customary consents to use

customary "comfort" (including "negative assurance comfort") letters, (G)
providing the Financing Sources and their respective legal, financial and

Company and its

 



71  Subsidiaries in accordance with _Section 7.4_ and (H) furnishing Parent and
any Financing Sources promptly, and in any event at least three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, with all documentation and other information
required by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Debt Financing and
the Bond Financing under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, as
amended, that has been reasonably requested by Parent or any of the Financing
Sources at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. The Company
will notify Parent of any material error, mistake or omission in the Required
Information or the other information provided pursuant to this _Section 7.10_
that it becomes aware of and if requested by Parent will use its reasonable
efforts to promptly correct such error, mistake or omission. Nothing herein
shall require such cooperation to the extent it would (A) unreasonably disrupt
the conduct of the business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries,
(B) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to agree to pay any fees,
reimburse any expenses or otherwise incur any liability or give any
indemnities prior to the Effective Time, (C) require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to take any action that would reasonably be expected to conflict

by-laws or other comparable organizational documents of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, any Applicable Laws or any Contract, (D) require the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to pass resolutions or consents or approve or

upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and
documented costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives
in connection with the Financing (collectively, the " _Financing Expenses_ ").
Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and
their respective representatives from and against any and all losses, damages,
claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection
with the arrangement of the Financing and any information used in connection
therewith (other than arising from any information provided by the Company or
its Affiliates or its or their respective Representatives). On behalf of the
Surviving Corporation, at or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall pay
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts

_Section 7.11_ _Treatment of Certain Funded Debt_.

 

(a) If and when requested by Parent, the Company shall issue a conditional
notice of optional redemption (the " _Redemption Notice_ ") for all of the
outstanding principal amount of any or all series of the Company Notes
pursuant to the requisite provisions of the applicable indenture; _provided_ ,
that to the extent that any action described in the portion of this sentence
preceding this proviso can be conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, it
will be so conditioned, and, prior to the redemption date, Parent shall
deposit with the trustee under the applicable indentures cash or cash
equivalents sufficient to effect such redemption. At Parents request, the
Company will direct the trustee under the applicable indenture to give the

 



72  Redemption Notice to holders of the Company Notes on the Companys behalf,
and will timely provide the trustee with such officers certificates, legal
opinions and other documentation reasonably requested by the trustee in
connection therewith. The parties shall and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to provide cooperation reasonably requested by the other in
connection with the actions described in the two immediately preceding
sentences. Parent shall prepare the Redemption Notice, which shall be subject
to the review of, and comment by, the Company.

 

(b) On or prior to the second (2nd) Business Day prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall deliver to Parent copies of customary payoff letters, from
each administrative agent or other similar agent under the Senior Credit
Facilities and the ABL Facilities of the Company or its Subsidiaries that are
to be refinanced at Closing in accordance with this Agreement, and for the
release of all liens and other security over the Companys and its
Subsidiaries properties and assets securing its obligations under such credit

collateral in the possession of the applicable administrative agent or similar
agent to the extent practicable at the Closing.

 

 _Section 7.12_ _Tax Matters_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, real

documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes.

_Section 7.13_ _FIRPTA Certificate_. At or prior to Closing, the Company
shall deliver to Parent a duly executed certification, signed under penalties
of perjury by the Company and dated not more than thirty (30) days prior to
the Closing Date, that satisfies the requirements of Treasury Regulations

within five (5) years of the date of the certification, a "United States real
property holding corporation" as defined in Section 897 of the Code, and
shall authorize Parent, as agent for the Company, to deliver a copy of the
certification to the IRS on behalf of the Company.

 

 _Section 7.14_ _280G Approval_. No later than five (5) days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to seek the
approval by such number of stockholders of the Company as is required by the
terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code so that no payments and/or benefits
provided pursuant to Benefit Plans constitute "excess parachute payments" as
defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code. Prior to the stockholder approval
referenced in the preceding sentence, the Company shall have used its
reasonable best efforts to obtain a waiver of the right to receive payments

to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and to have the Consent
Solicitation Statement cleared by the Commission and its staff under the

Solicitation/Prospectus to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company, and
the Company shall otherwise take all actions necessary, proper or advisable
in accordance with Applicable Laws and the Organizational Documents of the
Company to seek the Company Stockholder Approval by written consent and

subject to _Section 7.16(h)_ use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to its stockholders
in advance of a vote on the adoption of this Agreement, or, if, as of the
time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled,
there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of such meeting; _provided_ , that such adjournment or postponement shall not
exceed ten (10) Business Days. The Company shall ensure that the Company
Stockholders Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and
that all proxies solicited in connection with the Company Stockholders

or the Amended Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus contained therein,
as applicable. All filings by the Company with the Commission in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Consent Solicitation
Statement and the Proxy Statement, as applicable, and, in each case, any
amendment or supplement thereto, and all mailings to the stockholders of the
Company in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
subject to the prior review and comment of Parent. All filings by Parent with
the Commission in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Form S-4 or the Amended Form S-4, as applicable, and, in each
case, any amendment or supplement thereto, shall be subject to the prior
review and comment of the Company.

 



75 (f) Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) as promptly as reasonably
practicable notify the other of (A) the receipt of any comments from the
Commission and all other written correspondence and oral communications with
the Commission relating to the Consent Solicitation Statement/Prospectus or
the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Amended Form S-4
(including the time when the Form S-4 or the Amended Form S-4, as applicable,
is declared effective under the Securities Act and the issuance of any stop
order or suspension of qualifications of the Parent Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction) and (B)
any request by the Commission for any amendment or supplements to the Consent
Solicitation Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Amended Form S-4 for additional information with
respect thereto and (ii) as promptly as reasonably practicable supply each
other with copies of (A) all correspondence between it or any of

applicable, and (B) all Orders of the Commission relating to the Form S-4 or
the Amended Form S-4 or the shares of Parent Common Stock included in the
Merger Consideration. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any

without limiting the generality of the provisions of _Section 7.16(e)_, (1)
prior to filing or mailing the Form S-4 or the Amended Form S-4 (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the
Commission with respect thereto, Parent (x) shall provide the Company an
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response (including the
proposed final version of such document or response) and (y) shall consider
in good faith all comments reasonably proposed by the Company and (2) prior to
filing or mailing the Consent Solicitation Statement/Prospectus or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding
to any comments of the Commission with respect thereto, the Company (x) shall
provide Parent an opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response (including the proposed final version of such document or response)
and (y) shall consider in good faith all comments reasonably proposed by
Parent. Each of the Company and Parent shall also take any other action (other
than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so
qualified) required to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act,
any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue sky" laws and the rules
and regulations thereunder in connection with the Merger and the issuance of
the shares of Parent Common Stock included in the Merger Consideration.

(g) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers, is discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub,
which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Consent
Solicitation Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Amended Form S-4, so that none of such documents
would include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the Commission by Parent in the case of the Form S-4 or
the Amended Form S-4 or the Company in the case of the Consent Solicitation
Statement/Prospectus or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and, to the extent
required by Applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

 



76 (h) The Company shall, through the Board of Directors of the Company,
recommend to its stockholders that they provide the Company Stockholder
Approval and shall include such recommendation in the Form S-4 or the Amended
Form S-4, as applicable, unless the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside counsel, that the failure to
withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation would reasonably be likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company.

 

(i) Parent shall prepare and submit to the NYSE a listing application covering
the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause such shares of Parent Common Stock to be
authorized for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance,
prior to the Closing Date.

 

 _Section 7.17_ _Notice of Events_. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of any notice or

immediately following sentence or (ii) as otherwise expressly provided
herein, all expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
expenses. If the Closing occurs, Parent shall bear (a) the costs, fees and
expenses incurred by it and Merger Sub in connection with the negotiation and
preparation of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including legal, accounting, brokerage and other fees
and expenses, (b) the Sponsor Fee Amount (as defined in _Section 7.18(g)(ii)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter), (c) the Financing Expenses, (d) any and all
Breakage Costs, (e) the Retention Plan Amount, (f) the reasonable and
customary out-of-pocket third-party costs, fees and expenses (including

Letter and (g) the reasonable and customary other out-of-pocket third-party
costs, fees and expenses of the Company and its Subsidiaries incurred in
connection with the negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including reasonable,
customary and documented third-party legal, accounting, brokerage and other
fees and expenses (the aggregate amount of the costs, fees and expenses
described in clauses (c), (f) and (g) of this  _Section 7.18_ to the extent
paid by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, the "
_Expense Amount_ "); _provided_ , that in no event shall the fees and expenses
of the Persons set forth in  _Section 7.18(g)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter exceed the amounts to which it is entitled pursuant to the engagement
letter referenced in _Section 5.24_; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the
event such third-party legal, accounting, brokerage and other professional
advisory fees and expenses described in clause (g) above exceed the amount set
forth in set forth in _Section 7.18(g)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
in the aggregate, the Company shall (i) as promptly reasonably practicable
notify Parent in writing of such occurrence, which notice shall set forth a
reasonably detailed itemization of such fees and expenses to the extent
reasonably available and (ii) from time to time, upon the reasonable request
of Parent (but in no event more than twice in any calendar month), provide to
Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable after each such

 



77  request, a reasonably detailed itemization to the extent reasonably
available of the then-current amount of such fees and expenses. For the
avoidance of doubt, any itemization of such costs, fees and expenses provided
by the Company to Parent shall not, in and of itself, limit Parents
obligation to bear such costs, fees and expenses in accordance with this
_Section 7.18_. Any unpaid costs, fees and expenses incurred by the Company
and to be borne by Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.18_ shall be paid by
Parent at the Effective Time by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the account or accounts designated in writing by the Company no later
than two (2) Business Days prior to the Effective Time.

be reasonably required to carry out the provisions hereof and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

cause any disposition of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities
with respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each Person
who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act with respect to the Company or will become subject to the
reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

(ii) is incapable of being cured by Parent or is not cured by Parent prior to
the earlier of (x) thirty (30) days following written notice to Parent of such
breach, inaccuracy or failure to perform or comply and (y) the Business Day
immediately prior to the Outside Date; _provided_ , that the Company is not
then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, obligation

time of such termination all of the conditions to the obligations of Parent to
consummate the Closing set forth in  _Section 8.1(a)_ and _Section 8.2_
shall have been satisfied or waived (other than (A) the conditions set forth
in _Section 8.1(a)_ (to the extent such Restraint arises under the HSR Act,
the EU Merger Regulation or any other applicable foreign, federal, state or
supranational antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar Applicable Laws
under a jurisdiction specified in _Section 8.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter) and (B) those other conditions that, by their nature, cannot be
satisfied until the Closing, but, in the case of this clause (B), which
conditions would be capable of satisfaction if the Closing were to occur on
the date of termination), then Parent shall pay to the Company a fee of Eight
Hundred Million ($800,000,000) (the " _Reverse Termination Fee_ ") (which fee
shall be payable within two (2) Business Days after written notice of such
termination, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by the Company).

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (but subject
to and without limitation of _Section 10.12_ and the proviso to this
sentence), the Company agrees that in the event that this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Section 9.1_ and the Reverse Termination Fee
is payable pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ and the Reverse Termination Fee is
paid to the Company pursuant to _Section 9.2_ and accepted by the Company,
(i) the payment of such Reverse Termination Fee, together with any amounts

_Section 9.2(c)_, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company
Related Parties against the Parent Related Parties and (ii) in no event will
the Company Related Parties be entitled to recover any other money damages or
any other remedy based on a claim in law or equity with respect to (A) the
loss suffered as a result of any failure of the Merger to be consummated, (B)

or obligation under this Agreement, (C) the termination of this Agreement and
(D) any other losses, damages, obligations or liabilities suffered as a result
of or under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and, subject to and without limitation of _Section 10.12_ and the
proviso to this sentence, upon payment to the Company of the Reverse
Termination Fee in accordance with this  _Section 9.2_, together with any
amounts payable pursuant to the last three sentences of _Section 7.10(d)_ and

amounts by the Company, no Parent Related Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation to the Company Related Parties relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, irrespective of whether the Reverse
Termination Fee has been paid, the Company shall be entitled to pursue, and
Parent and Merger Sub shall be responsible for any and all money damages
(or, to the extent the Reverse Termination Fee is received by the Company,
the excess, if any, of such money damages over such Reverse Termination Fee)
arising out of, resulting from or relating to Parents or Merger Subs
Intentional Breach of this Agreement, including _Section 7.3_ and, in any
determination of such damages, the court shall be permitted to award the
Company and its stockholders, if proven, their respective Benefit of the
Bargain Damages.

 



82 (c) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that (i) the
agreements contained in this _Section 9.2_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the Reverse Termination Fee
is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will
compensate the Company and its Affiliates in the circumstances in which such
fee is paid, other than in the case of an Intentional Breach as contemplated
in _Section 9.2(b)_ and subject to and without limitation of _Section
10.12_, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the

or a portion of the Reverse Termination Fee, Parent shall pay the Companys

action by the parties thereto to extend the term of the Confidentiality
Agreement for such two (2) year period (other than Paragraphs 6 and 8 of the

the right of the Company, on behalf of the stockholders of the Company and the
holders of Company Options and Company Stock-Based Awards, to pursue damages
in the event of Parents or Merger Subs breach of this Agreement (which right
is hereby acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub and,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to contrary, in the event of a
breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, such damages are agreed and
acknowledged by Parent and Merger Sub to include, if proven, in addition to
any and all damages to the Company and its Subsidiaries, in the circumstance
where this Agreement has been terminated, the benefit of the bargain lost by
the holders of Company Common Stock, Company Options or Company Stock-Based

taking into consideration all relevant matters, including other combination
opportunities and the time value of money (collectively, the " _Benefit of the

or by reason of this Agreement. This Agreement may not be assigned by any
party hereto without the prior written consent of each of the other parties;
_provided_ , that after the Effective Time, Parent may assign its rights
hereunder to an Affiliate thereof so long as Parent remains liable for
performance under this Agreement. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 10.6_ to the contrary, each Financing Source in
connection with the Debt Financing is an express third party beneficiary of
_Sections 10.1_ , _10.9(c)_ , _10.11_ , _10.13_ and this  _Section 10.6_ to
the extent such sections are applicable to such Financing Source and may

constitute and shall be deemed to be sufficient evidence of a partys
execution of this Agreement, without necessity of further proof. Each such
copy shall be deemed an original, and it shall not be necessary in making
proof of this Agreement to produce or account for more than one such
counterpart.

_Section 10.8_ _No Prejudice; Survival_. The parties hereto acknowledge that
the terms and language of this Agreement were the result of negotiations among
the parties and, as a result, there shall be no presumption that any
ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved against any particular party.
Any controversy over construction of this Agreement shall be decided without
regard to events of authorship. None of the representations, warranties,
covenants, obligations or other agreements in this Agreement shall survive
the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the portion of this sentence
preceding this proviso shall not limit any covenant, obligation or agreement
of any party which by its express terms contemplates performance after the

above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or
execution by reason of a lack of personal jurisdiction, that any such
proceeding brought in one of the above-named courts is improper by reason of
a lack of personal jurisdiction or venue, or that this Agreement or the
subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by such court by reason of a
lack of personal jurisdiction or improper venue, and (iii) hereby agrees not
to commence any action, claim, cause of action or suit (in contract, tort or
otherwise), inquiry, proceeding or investigation arising out of or related to
this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby other than before one of

by registered mail addressed to it at its address provided in _Section
10.5_. Each party agrees that a final judgment in any such action, claim,
cause of action or suit (in contract, tort or otherwise), inquiry, proceeding
or investigation shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by

and irrevocably agrees (i) that any action, claim, cause of action or suit
(in contract or in tort or otherwise), inquiry, proceeding or investigation

Financing or the performance of services thereunder in any other court, (iii)
that service of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail
addressed to them at their respective addresses provided in _Section 10.5_
shall be effective service of process against it for any such action, claim,
cause of action or suit (in contract or in tort or otherwise), inquiry,
proceeding or investigation brought in any such court, (iv) to waive and
hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any

claim, cause of action or suit (in contract or in tort or otherwise),
inquiry, proceeding or investigation in any such court, (V) TO WAIVE AND
HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUCH ACTION, CLAIM,
CAUSE OF ACTION OR SUIT (IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR OTHERWISE), INQUIRY,

claim, cause of action or suit (in contract or in tort or otherwise), inquiry,
proceeding or investigation shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided

right to serve process in any other manner permitted by Applicable Laws.

the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the Company in the

or in any document delivered pursuant hereto of the Company in the case of
Parent, or of Parent or Merger Sub, in the case of the Company, and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein of the
Company, in the case of Parent, or of Parent or Merger Sub, in the case of the
Company. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto

 



88  to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. No failure or delay by
any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall act as
a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
power or privilege hereunder.

 

 _Section 10.11_ _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY
APPLICABLE LAW WHICH CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES, AND COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT
OR OTHERWISE), ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, CLAIM, CAUSE OF
ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING (IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT, ANY DEBT FINANCING (OR AGAINST ANY FINANCING
SOURCE) OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED
OR INCIDENTAL TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT THIS  _SECTION 10.11_ CONSTITUTES A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT UPON WHICH THEY
ARE RELYING AND WILL RELY IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, AND ANY OTHER
AGREEMENTS RELATING HERETO OR CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. ANY PARTY HERETO MAY FILE
AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS _SECTION 10.11_ WITH ANY COURT AS
WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,

WAIVERS CONTAINED IN THIS _SECTION 10.11_ , (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, AND (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY.

 

 _Section 10.12_ _Enforcement of Agreement_. The parties rights in this
_Section 10.12_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and each party hereby waives any objections to any remedy
referred to in this _Section 10.12_. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of
this Agreement was not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was
otherwise breached or the Merger was not consummated, and that money damages
would not be an adequate remedy, even if available. It is accordingly agreed
that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (but subject
to and without limitation of the last sentence of this _Section 10.12_), the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
or remedy breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof (including the parties
obligations to consummate the Merger, and Parents obligation to pay, and the
right to receive the Merger Consideration by the stockholders of the Company
and the holders of Company Stock-Based Awards and the Per Option Consideration
by the holders of Company Options, as applicable) and to any further equitable
relief, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. In the event any party seeks any remedy referred to in
this _Section 10.12_, such party shall not be required to prove damages or
obtain, furnish, post or provide any bond or other security in connection
with or as a condition to obtaining any such remedy. For the avoidance of
doubt, it is hereby acknowledged

 



89  and agreed that (a) the Company shall be entitled to seek specific
performance or other equitable remedies to cause Parent or Merger Sub to
enforce, including against anticipatory breach, the obligation of the
Financing Sources to fund the Debt Financing under the Commitment Letter and
(b) in the event that any Financing Source initiates any litigation against
Parent or Merger Sub with respect to the Debt Financing, or advises Parent or
Merger Sub that it intends not to proceed with the Debt Financing in violation
of the terms of the Commitment Letter, the Company shall be entitled to
specific performance or other equitable remedies to require Parent or Merger
Sub to take enforcement action, including seeking specific performance, to
cause the Financing Sources to provide such Debt Financing. While the Company
may pursue both a grant of specific performance pursuant to this _Section
10.12_ and payment of the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to _Section
9.2(a)_, together with any amounts payable pursuant to the last three
sentences of _Section 7.10(d)_ and _Section 9.2(c)_, following termination
of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.1_, only in the event the
Company accepts payment of the Reverse Termination Fee, together with any
amounts payable pursuant to the last three sentences of _Section 7.10(d)_
and  _Section 9.2(c)_, following the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 9.1_ and payment of the Reverse Termination Fee by
Parent in accordance with _Section 9.2(a)_, together with any amounts
payable pursuant to the last three sentences of _Section 7.10(d)_ and
_Section 9.2(c)_, shall the Company not be entitled to specifically enforce
the terms and provisions of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.12_.

 

 _Section 10.13_ _Financing Sources_. The Company and its Affiliates hereby
agree that (a) in no event shall the Financing Sources have any liability or
obligation to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its Affiliates
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing, any
commitment letters or engagement letters relating thereto or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, (b) in no event shall the Company or any of
its Affiliates or stockholders seek or obtain any other damages of any kind
against any Financing Source (including consequential, special, indirect
or punitive damages) and (c) in no event shall the Company or any Company
Related Party have any liability or obligation to any of the Financing
Sources, in the case of each of the foregoing sub-clauses (a), (b) and (c),
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing, any
commitment letters or engagement letters relating thereto or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. The provisions of this _Section 10.13_ shall
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, each Financing Source, its
Affiliates and their respective successors and permitted assigns, each of
which is hereby intended to be an express third party beneficiary of this
_Section 10.13_. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section
10.13_, following the consummation of the Merger, such provisions will not
limit the rights of the parties to the Financing under the Definitive
Financing Agreements.

 

 _Section 10.14_ _Waiver of Conflicts_. Recognizing that Cleary Gottlieb has
acted as legal counsel to the Company, its Subsidiaries, certain of the
direct and indirect holders of shares of Company Common Stock and their
Affiliates prior to date hereof, and that Cleary Gottlieb intends to act as
legal counsel to certain of the direct and indirect holders of shares
of Company Common Stock and their Affiliates (which will no longer include
the Company and its Subsidiaries) after the Closing, each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause its
Affiliates, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to waive, any
conflicts that may arise in connection with Cleary Gottlieb representing any
direct or indirect holders of the Company Common Stock or their Affiliates
after the Closing as such representation may relate to Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company, the Surviving Corporation and its

 



90  Subsidiaries or the transactions contemplated hereby. In addition, all
communications involving attorney-client confidences between direct and
indirect holders of Company Common Stock, the Company and its Subsidiaries
and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and Cleary Gottlieb, on the
other hand, relating to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be attorney-client
confidences that belong solely to the direct and indirect holders of Company
Common Stock and their respective Affiliates (and not the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries). Accordingly, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall not have access to any such
communications or to the files of Cleary Gottlieb relating to such engagement
from and after the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, (a) the direct and indirect
holders of Company Common Stock and their respective Affiliates (and not the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) shall be the sole holders of the
attorney-client privilege with respect to such engagement, and none of the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries shall be a holder thereof, (b) to
the extent that files of Cleary Gottlieb in respect of such engagement
constitute property of the client, only the direct and indirect holders of
Company Common Stock and their respective Affiliates (and not the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries) shall hold such property rights and (c)
Cleary Gottlieb shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any
such attorney-client communications or files to the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries by reason of any attorney-client relationship between
Cleary Gottlieb and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise.

 

 _Section 10.15_ _Release_. As of the Closing, Parent, on its own behalf and
on behalf of its Affiliates, the Company and its Affiliates (each, a "
_Releasing Person_ "), hereby releases and forever discharges each of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock and their respective Affiliates,
successors and assigns, and each other Company Related Party (in each case,
solely in their capacities as such) to the extent such holder of shares of
Company Common Stock duly executes and delivers to Parent prior to the Closing
a Letter of Transmittal containing a release of Parent and its Affiliates,
including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, successors and
assigns and each other Parent Related Party ( _provided_ that the parties
acknowledge and agree that such release shall not contain a release of any
rights or obligations to the extent arising under any provision of this
Agreement that survives the Closing in accordance with the last sentence of
_Section 10.8_, the Stockholders Agreement and any other Contract entered
into by Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, the Principal Stockholder
or any of their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, in connection with
the Merger, including the Confidentiality Agreement, or any liability for
fraud) (each, a " _Released Person_ ") from all debts, demands, causes of
action, suits, covenants, torts, damages and any and all claims, defenses,
offsets, judgments, demands and liabilities whatsoever, of every name and
nature, both at law and in equity, known or unknown, accrued or
unaccrued, which have been or could have been asserted against any Released
Person, which any Releasing Person has or ever had, which arises out of or in
any way relates to events, circumstances or actions occurring, existing or
taken prior to or as of the Closing Date in respect of matters relating to
the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Released Claim_ "); _provided_ ,
that the parties acknowledge and agree that this _Section 10.15_ does not
apply to and shall not constitute a release of any rights or obligations to
the extent arising under any provision of this Agreement that survives the
Closing in accordance with the last sentence of _Section 10.8_, the
Stockholders Agreement and any other Contract entered into by Parent, on the
one hand, and the Company, the Principal Stockholder or any of their
respective Affiliates, on the other hand, in connection with the Merger,
including the Confidentiality Agreement, or any liability for fraud.

 



91 _Section 10.16_ _Non-Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the obligations and liabilities of the Company under this
Agreement and all other obligations, liabilities, claims, losses, damages, or
Proceedings (whether in law or in equity and whether based on contract, in
tort or otherwise) of or against the Company that may be based on, arise out
of or relate to this Agreement (including any breach or alleged breach
hereof), the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or the transactions
contemplated hereby or in respect of any other document or theory of law or
equity or in respect of any oral or written representations made or alleged to
be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, may only be made against the Company in its
capacity as a party to this Agreement and will be without recourse of any kind
to any former, current or future direct or indirect stockholders, equity
holders, controlling persons, portfolio companies, management
companies, directors, officers, employees, general or limited partners,
members, managers, trustees, attorneys, agents, Representatives or Affiliates
of the Company or any heir, executor, administrator, successor or assign of
any of the foregoing, or any former, current or future direct or indirect
stockholder, equity holder, controlling person, portfolio company, management
