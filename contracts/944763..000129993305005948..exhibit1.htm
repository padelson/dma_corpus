without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock of the Company:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;<U>Merger Consideration</U>. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than (i)&nbsp;Shares owned by Parent or any direct or indirect Subsidiary (as
defined in Section&nbsp;5.1(a)) of Parent, and (ii)&nbsp;Shares owned by the Company or any direct or

into the right to receive 1.40056 shares (the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be
delivered for each Share being hereafter referred to as the &#147;<U><I>Exchange Ratio</I></U>&#148;) of Parent
Common Stock (such shares of Parent Common Stock together with any cash in lieu of fractional
shares as contemplated by Section&nbsp;4.2(e) and dividends or distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section&nbsp;4.2(c) being hereinafter referred to as the &#147;<U><I>Merger
Consideration</I></U>&#148;); <U>provided</U>, however, that (x)&nbsp;if the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the
average last sale price of the Parent Common Stock (the &#147;<U><I>Parent Average Price</I></U>&#148;) as quoted
on the Nasdaq National Market (the &#147;<U><I>Nasdaq</I></U>&#148;) during the 30 calendar days ending one trading
day before the date of the Shareholder Meeting (the &#147;<U><I>Measurement Period</I></U><I>&#148;</I>) is less than
$6.50, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted so that the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Parent

and (z)&nbsp;if the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Parent Average Price is more than $8.50 per Share,
the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted so that the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Parent Average
Price is equal to $8.50, and in each such case, such adjusted Exchange Ratio shall be the Exchange
Ratio for all purposes of this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;<U>Further Adjustments to Exchange Ratio</U>. The Exchange Ratio set forth in Section
4.1(a) shall be further adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company
Common Stock or Parent Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with
respect to Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock occurring after the date of this Agreement
and prior to the Effective Time.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;<U>Cancellation of Shares</U>. All of the Shares (including the Excluded Shares) shall
cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a
&#147;<U><I>Certificate</I></U>&#148;) formerly representing any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and to vote as set forth in
Section&nbsp;4.2(e). Each Certificate representing Excluded Shares shall be cancelled without payment of
any consideration (including any Merger Consideration) therefor.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;<U>Merger Sub</U>. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of
common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;<U>Rights of Holders of Shares</U>. On and after the Effective Time and until
surrendered for exchange, each Certificate (other than Certificates representing Excluded Shares)
shall be deemed for all purposes to evidence ownership of and to represent the right to receive the
Merger Consideration. The record holder of such outstanding certificate shall, after the Effective
Time, be entitled to vote the shares of Parent Common Stock into which such Shares shall have been
converted on any matters on which the holders of record of Parent Common Stock, as of any date
subsequent to the Effective Time, shall be entitled to vote. In any matters relating to such
certificates, Parent may rely conclusively upon the record of shareholders maintained by the
Company containing the names and addresses of the holders of record of Shares at the Effective
Time.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">4.2. <U>Exchange of Certificates</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;<U>Exchange Agent</U>. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. or other mutually acceptable third party as exchange agent
(the &#147;<U><I>Exchange Agent</I></U>&#148;), for the benefit of the holders of Shares, certificates representing
the Parent Common Stock portion of the Merger Consideration for all Shares (such certificates,
together with any cash in lieu of fractional Shares as contemplated by Section&nbsp;4.2(e) and any
dividends or distributions as contemplated by Section&nbsp;4.2(c), being hereinafter referred to as the
&#147;<U><I>Exchange Fund</I></U>&#148;). The Exchange Agent shall hold the Exchange Fund for the benefit of
holders of Shares. The Exchange Agent shall distribute the Exchange Fund pursuant to Section&nbsp;4.1
in exchange for outstanding Shares (other than Excluded Shares). The Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose. Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent from time to time as
needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section&nbsp;4.2(e).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;<U>Exchange Procedures</U>. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within
three (3)&nbsp;Business Days thereof), the Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of record of Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares) (i)&nbsp;a letter of transmittal in
customary form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in Section&nbsp;4.2(g)) to the Exchange Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in Section&nbsp;4.2(g)) in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of
a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section&nbsp;4.2(g)) to the Exchange
Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) which such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article&nbsp;IV (after taking into
account all the shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder under all such Certificates
so surrendered), cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section&nbsp;4.2(e), and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section&nbsp;4.2(c). No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash
payable pursuant to Section&nbsp;4.2(c) or 4.2(e). The Exchange Agent shall forthwith cancel the
Certificates so surrendered. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number of
shares of Parent Common Stock and a check for any factional shares to be exchanged upon due
surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such transferee if the Certificate formerly
representing such Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required
to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have
been paid or are not applicable.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;<U>Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares</U>. Parent will pay no dividends
and make no other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock represented thereby, and Parent will make no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares
to any such holder pursuant to Section&nbsp;4.2(e), until the holder of record of such Certificate
surrenders such Certificate. Following surrender of any such Certificate, the Exchange Agent, on
behalf of Parent, shall pay to the record holder of the Certificate representing whole shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i)&nbsp;at the time of such
surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section&nbsp;4.2(e) and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii)&nbsp;at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares
of Parent Common Stock.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;<U>Transfers</U>. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this Article&nbsp;IV.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;<U>No Fractional Shares</U>.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:8%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 9%">(i)&nbsp;No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share
interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of
Parent.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:8%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 9%">(ii)&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Shares
exchanged for shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have
been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into
account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash
(without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Parent Common
Stock multiplied by the closing price of Parent Common Stock on the Closing Date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(f)&nbsp;<U>Termination of Exchange Fund</U>. The Exchange Agent shall deliver any portion of the
Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for one year after the
Effective Time to Parent, upon demand. Any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore
complied with this Article&nbsp;IV shall thereafter look only to Parent for receipt of the Merger
Consideration in respect thereof, and Parent shall promptly fulfill the obligations of the Exchange
Agent with respect to delivery of the Merger Consideration.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(g)&nbsp;<U>Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates</U>. In the event any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the individual,
firm, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, incorporated or unincorporated
association, joint venture, joint stock company, governmental agency or instrumentality or other
entity of any kind (collectively, &#147;<U><I>Person</I></U>&#148;) claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and
upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen, or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration in
respect thereof.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">4.3. <U>Treatment of Stock Options</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;<U>Outstanding Company Options.</U> Each option to purchase Shares (a &#147;<U><I>Company
Option</I></U>&#148;) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding following
the Effective Time.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;<U>Assumption of Company Options</U>. At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume each
Company Option by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of the Company or
the holders thereof. Parent shall assume each such Company Option in such manner that the
requirements of Treasury Regulation &#167;1.424-1 would be met with respect to the assumption of the
Company Option pursuant to the Merger, regardless of whether the Company Option is a statutory
option.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;<U>Terms of Assumed Company Options</U>. From and after the Effective Time, all
references to the Company in the Company Options and the related stock option agreements shall be
deemed to refer to Parent. After the Effective Time, each Company Option assumed by Parent shall
be exercisable upon the same terms and conditions as were in effect under the Company Options and
the related option agreements immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i)&nbsp;each Company
Option shall be exercisable for that whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, and (ii)
the option price per share of Parent Common Stock shall be an amount equal to the option price per
share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio (the option price per share, as so determined, being
rounded up to the nearest full cent).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;<U>Notices to Option Holders</U>. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall deliver to each holder of a Company Option, an appropriate notice setting forth such
holder&#146;s rights pursuant thereto. Parent shall notify such holders that the Company Option shall
continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (including anti-dilution provisions, and
subject to the adjustments required by this Section&nbsp;4.3 after giving effect to the Merger). Parent
shall comply with the terms of each Company Option. Parent shall use reasonable efforts to ensure
that each Company Option, to the extent it qualifies for special tax treatment prior to the
Effective Time (including, without limitation, Section&nbsp;422 of the Code), shall continue so to
qualify after the Effective Time. To the extent that a Company Option qualifies immediately prior
to the Effective Time as an &#147;incentive stock option&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;422 of the Code,
the option exercise price, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the
assumed Company Option and the terms and conditions of exercise of the assumed Company Option shall
be determined in order to comply with Section 424(a) of the Code. Parent shall take all corporate
action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for
delivery pursuant to the terms set forth in this Section&nbsp;4.3. After the Effective Time (but in no
event later than 15&nbsp;days after the Effective Time), Parent shall file a Registration Statement on
Form S-8 with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to Company Options, and shall
use its reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus contained therein) for so long as such options remain
outstanding.

ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the Company Reports is
recorded and reported within the time frames required by SEC rules and is accumulated and
communicated to the individuals responsible for the preparation of the Company Reports to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. The Company maintains internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under

providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the

maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the

involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company&#146;s
internal control over financial reporting. The Company has made available to Parent (i)
any written communication relating to such disclosure made by management to the Company&#146;s
auditors and audit committee since the Company Applicable Date and (ii)&nbsp;any material
written communication since the Company Applicable Date made by management or the Company&#146;s
auditors to the audit committee required or contemplated by listing standards of the

Accounting Oversight Board. Since the Company Applicable Date, no material complaints from
any source regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and no
concerns from Company employees regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters, have
been received by the Company. The Company has made available to Parent a summary of all
complaints or concerns relating to other matters made since the Company Applicable Date
through any whistleblower hot-line or equivalent system maintained by the Company for
receipt of employee concerns regarding possible violations of Law. No attorney

<P align="left" style="margin-left:8%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(iii)&nbsp;The Parent maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule&nbsp;13a-15
or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Parent in the Parent Reports is
recorded and reported within the time frames required by SEC rules and is accumulated and
communicated to the individuals responsible for the preparation of the Parent Reports to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. The Parent maintains internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under
the Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial reporting is effective in
providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and includes policies and procedures that (i)&nbsp;pertain to the
maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the asset of the Parent, (ii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the Parent are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Parent, and (iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the

summarize and report financial information and (B)&nbsp;any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Parent&#146;s internal
control over financial reporting. The Parent has made available to Company (i)&nbsp;any written
communication relating to such disclosure made by management to the Parent&#146;s auditors and
audit committee since the Parent Applicable Date and (ii)&nbsp;any material written
communication since the Parent Applicable Date made by management or the Parent&#146;s auditors
to the audit committee required or contemplated by listing standards of the Nasdaq, the
audit committee&#146;s charter or professional standards of the Public Parent Accounting
Oversight Board. Since the Parent Applicable Date, no material complaints from any source
regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and no concerns
from Parent employees regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters, have been
received by the Parent. The Parent has made available to Company a summary of all
complaints or concerns relating to other matters made since the Parent Applicable Date
through any whistleblower hot-line or equivalent system maintained by the Parent for
receipt of employee concerns regarding possible violations of Law. No attorney
representing the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation of securities laws, breach
of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Parent or any of its officers, directors,
employees or agents to the Parent&#146;s chief legal officer, audit committee (or other
committee designated for the purpose) of the board of directors or the board of directors

date and each of the consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders&#146; equity
(deficit)&nbsp;and cash flows included in or incorporated by reference into the Parent Reports

Reports filed after the date hereof, will fairly present the results of operations,
retained earnings (loss)&nbsp;and changes in financial position, as the case may be, of the
Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the
case of unaudited statements, to notes and normal year-end audit adjustments that will not

during the periods involved, except as may be noted therein. All inventory (including
consignment inventory) reflected on the consolidated balance sheets included in or

Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or subject to the provisions of any

with respect to both non U.S. Parent Benefit Plans and U.S. Parent Benefit Plans, no

Plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries has been timely amended within the applicable remedial
amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code to maintain the tax-qualified status of
each such plan, and the Parent is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in the

Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any ERISA
Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date hereof,
could subject the Parent or any Subsidiary to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section
4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which would be material. Neither
the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or reasonably expects to incur a tax or
penalty imposed by Section&nbsp;4980 of the Code or Section&nbsp;502 of ERISA.

Benefit Plan have been properly accrued and reflected in the most recent consolidated
balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the Parent Reports prior to the date

benefit plans which the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries are eligible to participate
in to take into account for purposes of eligibility and vesting and benefit accrual thereunder
(except for benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans, for purposes of qualifying for
subsidized early retirement benefits or to the extent it would result in a duplication of
benefits), service by employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as if such service were with

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall obligate Parent, the Surviving

damages or liabilities (collectively, &#147;<U><I>Costs</I></U>&#148;) incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that
the Company would have been permitted under Minnesota law and its articles of incorporation or
bylaws in effect on the date hereof to indemnify such Person (and Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, <U>provided</U> that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled
to indemnification); and <U>provided</U>, <U>further</U>, that any determination required to be
made with respect to whether an officer&#146;s or director&#146;s conduct complies with the standards set
forth under Minnesota law and the Company&#146;s articles of incorporation and bylaws shall be made by
independent counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a)&nbsp;of this Section
6.11, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly
notify Parent thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving
Corporation of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent such
failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party. In the event of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i)&nbsp;Parent
or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and Parent shall
not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof,
except that if Parent or the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for
the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between
Parent or the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain
counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees
and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are
received; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated pursuant to this paragraph (b)&nbsp;to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified
Parties in any action unless the use of one counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such
counsel with a conflict of interest; <U>provided</U> that the fewest number of counsels necessary
to avoid conflicts of interest shall be used; (ii)&nbsp;the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the
defense of any such matter, and (iii)&nbsp;Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for
any settlement effected without their prior written consent; and <U>provided</U>, <U>further</U>,
that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine that the
indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable Law. Nothing in this Section&nbsp;6.10(b) shall be effective to the extent it limits the
