ARTICLE IV    

 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock;_     

 _Exchange of Certificates_     

4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company:   

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares owned by Parent or any
direct or indirect Subsidiary (as defined in Section 5.1(a)) of Parent, and
(ii) Shares owned by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company (the " _ _Excluded Shares__ ")) shall be
converted into the right to receive 1.40056 shares (the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock to be delivered for each Share being hereafter referred
to as the " _ _Exchange Ratio__ ") of Parent Common Stock (such shares of
Parent Common Stock together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares as
contemplated by Section 4.2(e) and dividends or distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 4.2(c) being hereinafter referred to
as the " _ _Merger Consideration__ "); _provided_ , however, that (x) if the
Exchange Ratio multiplied by the average last sale price of the Parent Common
Stock (the " _ _Parent Average Price__ ") as quoted on the Nasdaq National
Market (the " _ _Nasdaq__ ") during the 30 calendar days ending one
trading day before the date of the Shareholder Meeting (the " _ _Measurement
Period__ _"_ ) is less than $6.50, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted so
that the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Parent Average Price is equal to
$6.50, (y) if the Parent Average Price is less than $4.35 (the " _ _Minimum
Price__ "), the Exchange Ratio shall be equal to $6.50 divided by the Minimum
Price, and (z) if the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Parent Average Price
is more than $8.50 per Share, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted so that
the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Parent Average Price is equal to $8.50,
and in each such case, such adjusted Exchange Ratio shall be the
Exchange Ratio for all purposes of this Agreement.   

(b) _Further Adjustments to Exchange Ratio_. The Exchange Ratio set forth in
Section 4.1(a) shall be further adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any
stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change
with respect to Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock occurring after
the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.   

(c) _Cancellation of Shares_. All of the Shares (including the Excluded
Shares) shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and each certificate (a " _ _Certificate__ ") formerly representing
any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and to vote as set forth
in Section 4.2(e). Each Certificate representing Excluded Shares shall be
cancelled without payment of any consideration (including any Merger
Consideration) therefor.   

(d) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.   

(e) _Rights of Holders of Shares_. On and after the Effective Time and
until surrendered for exchange, each Certificate (other than Certificates
representing Excluded Shares) shall be deemed for all purposes to evidence
ownership of and to represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
The record holder of such outstanding certificate shall, after the
Effective Time, be entitled to vote the shares of Parent Common Stock into
which such Shares shall have been converted on any matters on which the
holders of record of Parent Common Stock, as of any date subsequent to the
Effective Time, shall be entitled to vote. In any matters relating to
such certificates, Parent may rely conclusively upon the record of
shareholders maintained by the Company containing the names and addresses of
the holders of record of Shares at the Effective Time.   

4.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.   

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. or other mutually
acceptable third party as exchange agent (the " _ _Exchange Agent__ "), for
the benefit of the holders of Shares, certificates representing the Parent
Common Stock portion of the Merger Consideration for all Shares (such
certificates, together with any cash in lieu of fractional Shares as
contemplated by Section 4.2(e) and any dividends or distributions as
contemplated by Section 4.2(c), being hereinafter referred to as the " _
_Exchange Fund__ "). The Exchange Agent shall hold the Exchange Fund for the
benefit of holders of Shares. The Exchange Agent shall distribute the
Exchange Fund pursuant to Section 4.1 in exchange for outstanding Shares
(other than Excluded Shares). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose. Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent from time to
time as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 4.2(e).   

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event within three (3) Business Days thereof), the Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than holders
of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form specifying
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(g)) to the
Exchange Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(g)) in exchange
for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit
of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(g)) to the Exchange Agent
in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) which such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article IV (after taking
into account all the shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder
under all such Certificates so surrendered), cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 4.2(e), and any dividends or other distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 4.2(c). No interest will be paid or
will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to Section 4.2(c) or 4.2(e). The
Exchange Agent shall forthwith cancel the Certificates so surrendered. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number
of shares of Parent Common Stock and a check for any factional shares to be
exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such
transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented
to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid or are not applicable.   

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. Parent will pay no
dividends and make no other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
represented thereby, and Parent will make no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares to any such holder pursuant to Section 4.2(e), until the
holder of record of such Certificate surrenders such Certificate. Following
surrender of any such Certificate, the Exchange Agent, on behalf of Parent,
shall pay to the record holder of the Certificate representing whole shares
of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at
the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a
fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 4.2(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent
to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock.   

(d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
the Exchange Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to
this Article IV.   

(e) _No Fractional Shares_.    

(i) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and
such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or
to any rights of a stockholder of Parent.    

(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
Shares exchanged for shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such
holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount
equal to such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by
the closing price of Parent Common Stock on the Closing Date.   

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall deliver any
portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the
Certificates for one year after the Effective Time to Parent, upon demand.
Any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
Article IV shall thereafter look only to Parent for receipt of the
Merger Consideration in respect thereof, and Parent shall promptly fulfill
the obligations of the Exchange Agent with respect to delivery of the Merger
Consideration.   

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the individual, firm, corporation, partnership, limited
liability company, incorporated or unincorporated association, joint venture,
joint stock company, governmental agency or instrumentality or other entity
of any kind (collectively, " _ _Person__ ") claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such
Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required
by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen, or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration in respect thereof.   

4.3. _Treatment of Stock Options_.   

(a) _Outstanding Company Options._ Each option to purchase Shares (a " _
_Company Option__ ") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall remain outstanding following the Effective Time.   

(b) _Assumption of Company Options_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall
assume each Company Option by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of the Company or the holders thereof. Parent shall assume
each such Company Option in such manner that the requirements of Treasury
Regulation §1.424-1 would be met with respect to the assumption of
the Company Option pursuant to the Merger, regardless of whether the Company
Option is a statutory option.   

(c) _Terms of Assumed Company Options_. From and after the Effective Time,
all references to the Company in the Company Options and the related stock
option agreements shall be deemed to refer to Parent. After the Effective
Time, each Company Option assumed by Parent shall be exercisable upon the
same terms and conditions as were in effect under the Company Options and the
related option agreements immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that
(i) each Company Option shall be exercisable for that whole number of shares
of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, and
(ii) the option price per share of Parent Common Stock shall be an amount
equal to the option price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Option in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by
the Exchange Ratio (the option price per share, as so determined,
being rounded up to the nearest full cent).   

(d) _Notices to Option Holders_. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall deliver to each holder of a Company Option, an appropriate
notice setting forth such holders rights pursuant thereto. Parent shall
notify such holders that the Company Option shall continue in effect on the
same terms and conditions (including anti-dilution provisions, and subject to
the adjustments required by this Section 4.3 after giving effect to the
Merger). Parent shall comply with the terms of each Company Option. Parent
shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that each Company Option, to the
extent it qualifies for special tax treatment prior to the Effective Time
(including, without limitation, Section 422 of the Code), shall continue so
to qualify after the Effective Time. To the extent that a Company Option
qualifies immediately prior to the Effective Time as an "incentive stock
option" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, the option exercise
price, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to
the assumed Company Option and the terms and conditions of exercise of the
assumed Company Option shall be determined in order to comply with Section
424(a) of the Code. Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to
reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock
for delivery pursuant to the terms set forth in this Section 4.3. After the
Effective Time (but in no event later than 15 days after the Effective Time),
Parent shall file a Registration Statement on Form S-8 with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock subject to Company Options, and shall use its
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus contained
therein) for so long as such options remain outstanding.   

ARTICLE V    

 _Representations and Warranties_     

5.1. _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth in
the corresponding sections or subsections of the disclosure letter delivered
to Parent by the Company prior to entering into this Agreement (the " _
_Company Disclosure Letter__ "), the Company hereby represents and warrants
to Parent and Merger Sub that:   

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and (to
the extent such concept is applicable) in good standing under the Laws (as
defined in Section 5.1(i)) of its respective jurisdiction of organization and
has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a
foreign corporation or other legal entity in each jurisdiction where the
ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its
business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
organized, qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or authority,
are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to result in a
Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). The Company has made available to
Parent complete and correct copies of the Companys articles of incorporation
and bylaws, each as amended to date, and each as so delivered is in full force
and effect. Section 5.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a
correct and complete list of each jurisdiction where the Company and its
Subsidiaries are organized. As used in this Agreement, the term (i) " _
_Subsidiary__ " means, with respect to any Person, any other Person of which
at least a majority of the securities or ownership interests having by their
terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or
other persons performing similar functions is directly or indirectly owned or
controlled by such Person and/or by one or more of its Subsidiaries, (ii) " _
_Significant Subsidiary__ " is as defined in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation
S-X promulgated pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the " _ _Exchange Act__ ") and (iii) " _ _Material Adverse Effect__ " with
respect to any Person means a material adverse effect on the financial
condition, properties, or results of operations of the Person and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole other than any effect caused by or resulting
from:    

(A) changes in the economy or financial markets generally in the United States
or in other countries in which the Person and its Subsidiaries conduct
material operations;    

(B) changes that are the direct result of acts of war, terrorism or natural
disasters in the United States or in other countries in which the Person and
its Subsidiaries conduct material operations;    

(C) changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles (" _
_GAAP__ ") after the date hereof;    

(D) any loss of, or adverse change in, the relationship of the Person with
its customers, employees or suppliers caused by the announcement, pendency or
closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or    

(E) any failure of the Person to meet any estimates of revenues or earnings
for any period ending on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Closing;   

 _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to clauses (A), (B) and (C), such
change, event, circumstance or development does not (i) primarily relate only
to (or have the effect of primarily relating only to) the Person and its
Subsidiaries or (ii) disproportionately adversely affect the Person and its
Subsidiaries compared to other companies engaged in similar businesses.   

(b) _Capital Structure_.    

(i) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 20,000,000 shares
of Company Common Stock, of which 12,625,693 shares were issued and

shares of preferred stock, no par value per share, of which 300,000 shares
have been designated Series A Preferred Stock and no shares of which are
issued and outstanding. All of the outstanding Shares have been duly
authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and were
issued in compliance with all applicable Laws. Other than 1,415,728 shares of
Company Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Companys 1993 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan, 1988 Stock Option Plan and 1998 Stock Incentive Plan
(the " _ _Company Stock Plans__ "), and 650,000 shares of Company Common
Stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of options granted to executives
upon commencement of their employment, the Company has no shares of
Company Common Stock reserved for issuance. Section 5.1(b)(i) of the Company
Disclosure Letter contains a correct and complete list of options and
restricted stock, under the Company Stock Plans, including the holder, date
of grant, term, number of shares and exercise price and vesting schedule,
including whether the vesting will be accelerated by the execution of this
Agreement or consummation of the Merger or by termination of employment or
change of position following consummation of the Merger. Each of the
outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities of each of the
Companys Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, were issued in compliance with all applicable Laws and, except
for director qualifying shares in jurisdictions in which such shares
are required, owned by the Company or by a direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of any lien, charge, pledge,
security interest, claim or other encumbrance (each, a " _ _Lien__ "). Except
as set forth above and except for the rights (the " _ _Rights__ ") that have
been issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated as of February 18, 2003,
between the Company and Registrar and Transfer Company (the " _
_Rights Agreement__ "), there are no preemptive or other outstanding rights,
options, warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption
rights, repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments or
rights of any kind that obligate the Company to issue or sell any shares of
capital stock or other securities of the Company or any securities or
obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving
any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities of the Company,
and no securities or obligations evidencing such rights are authorized,
issued or outstanding. Upon any issuance of any Shares in accordance with the
terms of the Company Stock Plans, such Shares will be duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free and clear of any Liens.
The Company does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other
obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible into
or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the shareholders
of the Company on any matter.    

(ii) Section 5.1(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth (x) each
of the Companys Subsidiaries and the ownership interest of the Company in
each such Subsidiary, as well as the ownership interest of any other Person
or Persons in each such Subsidiary and (y) the Companys or its Subsidiaries
capital stock, equity interest or other direct or indirect ownership interest
in any other Person other than securities in a publicly traded company held
for investment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and consisting of
less than 1% of the outstanding capital stock of such company. The Company
does not own, directly or indirectly, any voting interest in any Person that
requires an additional filing by Parent under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _ _HSR Act__ ").   

(c) _Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness_.    

(i) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken
all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger, subject only
to adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding
Shares entitled to vote on such matter at a shareholders meeting duly called
and held for such purpose (the " _ _Company Requisite Vote__ "). The Company
Requisite Vote is the only vote of the holders of capital stock of the
Company necessary, under applicable Law or otherwise, to approve the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and
binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general
equity principles (the " _ _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception__ ").    

(ii) The board of directors of the Company has (A) unanimously determined that
the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its
shareholders, approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby and resolved to recommend
adoption of this Agreement to the holders of Shares (the " _ _Company
Recommendation__ "), (B) directed that this Agreement be submitted to the
holders of Shares for their adoption and (C) received the opinion of
its financial advisor, Greene Holcomb and Fisher LLC, to the effect that the
Merger Consideration is fair from a financial point of view to the holders
(other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) of Shares.   

(d) _Governmental Filings; No Violations; Certain Contracts_.    

(i) Other than the filings and/or notices pursuant to Section 1.3, Section 6.4
and Section 6.5, and under the HSR Act (the " _ _Company Approvals__ "), no
notices, reports or other filings are required to be made by the Company
with, nor are any consents, registrations, approvals, permits or
authorizations required to be obtained by the Company from, any (a) nation,
state, commonwealth, province, territory, county, municipality, district, or
other jurisdiction of any nature, or any political subdivision thereof,
(b) federal, state, local, municipal, foreign, or other government, or (c)
governmental or quasi-governmental authority of any nature (including any
governmental division, department, agency, commission, instrumentality,
official, organization, contractor, regulatory body, or other entity and any
court, arbitrator, or other tribunal), including, but not limited to, the
National Supplier Clearinghouse, the Durable Medical Equipment Regional
Carriers, and any Medicare Program Safeguards contractor (each a " _
_Governmental Entity__ "), in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, or in connection with
the continuing operation of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
following the Effective Time, except those that the failure to make or obtain
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect
or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.    

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or
violation of, or a default under, the articles of incorporation or bylaws of
the Company, (B) a breach or violation of, a termination (or right of
termination) or default under, the creation or acceleration of any
obligations under, or the creation of a Lien on any of the assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any agreement, lease,
license, contract, note, mortgage, indenture, arrangement or other obligation
(each, a " _ _Contract__ ") binding upon the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or, assuming (solely with respect to performance of
this Agreement and consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby) compliance with the matters referred to in Section
5.1(d)(i), any Law to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
subject, or (C) any change in the rights or obligations of any party under
any material Contract binding upon the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries except, in the case of clause (B) or (C) above, for any such
breach, violation, termination, default, creation, acceleration or change
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Section 5.1(d)(ii) of the
Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct and complete list of material
Contracts (as defined in Section 5.1(j)(ii), each a " _ _Material Contract__
")) pursuant to which consents or waivers are or may be required prior to
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether or
not subject to the exception set forth with respect to clauses (B) and (C)
above).   

(e) _Company Reports; Financial Statements; Minute Books_.    

(i) The Company has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis all
forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents required to be filed
or furnished by it with the Securities and Exchange Commission (" _ _SEC__ ")
pursuant to the Exchange Act since June 30, 2002 (the " _ _Company Applicable
Date__ ") (the forms, statements, reports and documents filed or furnished
since the Company Applicable Date and those filed or furnished subsequent to
the date of this Agreement, including any amendments thereto, the " _
_Company Reports__ "). Each of the Company Reports, at the time of its filing
or being furnished complied or, if not yet filed or furnished, will comply in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act
and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _ _Sarbanes-Oxley Act__ "), and any
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company
Reports. As of their respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date
hereof, as of the date of such amendment), the Company Reports did not, and
any Company Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date
hereof will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading. The Company has made available to Parent all SEC
comment letters received by the Company, and the Companys responses thereto,
since June 30, 2002.    

(ii) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the Nasdaq. Except
as permitted by the Exchange Act, including Sections 13(k)(2) and (3) or
rules of the SEC, since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, neither the
Company nor any of its Affiliates has made, arranged or modified (in any
material way) any extensions of credit in the form of a personal loan to any
executive officer or director of the Company since July 30, 2002. For purposes
of this Agreement, the term " _ _Affiliate__ " when used with respect to any
party shall mean any Person who is an "affiliate" of that party within the
meaning of Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act.    

(iii) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by
Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in the Company Reports is recorded and reported within the
time frames required by SEC rules and is accumulated and communicated to the
individuals responsible for the preparation of the Company Reports to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosures. The Company maintains
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or
15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such internal control over
financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain to
the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, (ii)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the Company, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on its
financial statements. The Company has disclosed, based on an evaluation of
its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer as of the end of
the most recent fiscal period covered by a periodic report filed with the SEC
under the Exchange Act, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of
the Companys board of directors (A) any significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal control over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal control over financial reporting. The Company has made
available to Parent (i) any written communication relating to such disclosure
made by management to the Companys auditors and audit committee since the
Company Applicable Date and (ii) any material written communication since the
Company Applicable Date made by management or the Companys auditors to the
audit committee required or contemplated by listing standards of the Nasdaq,
the audit committees charter or professional standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board. Since the Company Applicable Date, no
material complaints from any source regarding accounting, internal accounting
controls or auditing matters, and no concerns from Company employees
regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters, have been received by
the Company. The Company has made available to Parent a summary of
all complaints or concerns relating to other matters made since the Company
Applicable Date through any whistleblower hot-line or equivalent system
maintained by the Company for receipt of employee concerns regarding possible
violations of Law. No attorney representing the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation of securities laws,
breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company or any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents to the Companys chief legal
officer, audit committee (or other committee designated for the purpose) of
the board of directors or the board of directors pursuant to the rules
adopted pursuant to Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or any Company
policy contemplating such reporting.    

(iv) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company Reports (including the related notes and
schedules) fairly presents, or, in the case of Company Reports filed after
the date hereof, will fairly present the consolidated financial position of
the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the
consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders equity (deficit)
and cash flows included in or incorporated by reference into the Company
Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents, or in
the case of Company Reports filed after the date hereof, will fairly present
the results of operations, retained earnings (loss) and changes in financial
position, as the case may be, of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to notes and normal year-end audit adjustments that
will not be material in amount or effect), in each case in accordance with
GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted
therein. All inventory (including consignment inventory) reflected on the
consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into the
Company Reports is reflected at an amount not in excess of the lower of cost
or market. Except as set forth in the financial statements (including any
notes thereto) contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended September 30, 2005 filed with the SEC or as otherwise reflected
in the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company and its Subsidiaries have no
material liabilities or obligations, whether or not accrued, contingent or
otherwise, other than (i) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
business subsequent to September 30, 2005 and (ii) obligations under
contracts and commitments incurred in the ordinary course of business and not
required under generally accepted accounting principles to be reflected in
such financial statements, which, in both cases, individually and in the
aggregate is not reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.    

(v) The minute books of the Company and its Subsidiaries contain accurate and
complete records of all meetings of, and corporate action taken by, the
shareholders, the boards of directors and committees of the boards of
directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to June 30, 2005, and no
meeting of any such shareholders, board of directors, or committee has been
held for which minutes have not been prepared and are not contained in such
minute books.    

(vi) The Company is not a party to, nor does it have any obligation or
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract (including any contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company, on
the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate), including any structured
finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other
hand or any "off balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of
Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act), where the result, purpose or intended
effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, the Company in the Company
Reports.   

(f) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since September 30, 2005, and on or prior
to the date of this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries have
conducted their respective businesses only in, and have not engaged in any
material transaction other than in accordance with, the ordinary course of
such businesses consistent with past practices and there has not been:    

(i) to the knowledge of the officers of the Company, any change in the
financial condition, properties, or results of their operations or any
circumstance, occurrence or development (including any adverse change with
respect to any circumstance, occurrence or development existing on or prior
to September 30, 2005) which, individually or in the aggregate, would have a
Material Adverse Effect;    

(ii) any damage, destruction or other casualty loss with respect to any asset
or property owned, leased or otherwise used by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not covered by insurance, that would have a Material
Adverse Effect;    

(iii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or other
distribution with respect to any shares of capital stock of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (except for dividends or other distributions by any
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary to the Company or to any wholly-
owned Subsidiary of the Company), or any repurchase, redemption or other
acquisition by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any outstanding
shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (except any redemption in accordance with the exercise of a
stock option by tender of such capital stock in payment of the exercise
price);    

(iv) any material change in any method of accounting or accounting practice by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;    

(v) (A) any increase in the compensation payable or to become payable to its
officers or employees (except for increases in the ordinary course of
business and consistent with past practice) or (B) any establishment,
adoption, entry into or amendment of any collective bargaining, bonus,
pension, profit sharing, thrift, compensation, employment, termination,
severance or other plan, agreement, trust, fund, policy or arrangement for
the benefit of any director, officer or employee, except to the extent
required by applicable Laws and except for offers of employment in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice; or    

(vi) any agreement to do any of the foregoing.   

(g) _Litigation and Claims_. There are no civil, criminal or administrative
actions, suits, claims, hearings, arbitrations or other proceedings pending
or, to the knowledge of the officers of the Company, threatened against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries which, if determined adversely, could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
Except with respect to the Corporate Integrity Agreement, dated January 19,
2001, between the Company and the Office of Inspector General of the
Department of Health and Human Services and the related documentation (the "
_ _CIA__ "), neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
subject to the provisions of any judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree or
award of any Governmental Entity. The Company is in full compliance with the
CIA. To the knowledge of the officers of the Company, and except for regular
audit of welfare reimbursement submissions, neither the Company nor its
Subsidiaries are currently the subject of any investigation, inquiry
or proceeding by any Governmental Entity (or any Governmental Entitys
designated agent or agents), and except for such regular audits of
submissions and other regular regulatory audits and reviews of the Company
under Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies in the
ordinary course, the Company does not know of any grounds for any
investigation, inquiry or proceeding by any Governmental Entity, and except
as related to the CIA, no notice of any exclusion, sanction, or violation,
asserted deficiency, or other irregularity has been received by Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their officers or managing employees from any
Governmental Entity (or any Governmental Entitys designated agent or agents)
that would directly or indirectly, or with the passage of time, have a
Material Adverse Effect.   

(h) _Employee Benefits_.    

(i) All employee benefit plans covering current or former employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and current or former directors of the Company,
including, but not limited to, "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of
Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended (" _ _ERISA__ "), and deferred compensation (including nonqualified
deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code),
severance, stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation rights, or stock
based, incentive and bonus plans (such ERISA plans and other deferred
compensation, severance or stock based plans being hereafter referred to as
the " _ _Company Benefit Plans__ ") are listed on Schedule 5.1(h), and each
Benefit Plan which has received a current favorable opinion letter or
determination from the Internal Revenue Service, including any master
or prototype plan, has been separately identified. True and complete copies
of all Company Benefit Plans listed on Schedule 5.1(h), including, but not
limited to, any IRS determination or opinion letters, trust instruments,
insurance contracts and, with respect to any employee stock ownership plan,
loan agreements forming a part of any Company Benefit Plans, and all
amendments thereto have been made available to Parent.    

(ii) All (x) non U.S. Company Benefit Plans are in substantial compliance
with applicable Laws, and (y) all Company Benefit Plans, other than non U.S.
Company Benefit Plans, (collectively, " _ _U.S. Company Benefit Plans__ "),
are in substantial compliance with ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws;
_provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to both non U.S. Company Benefit
Plans and U.S. Company Benefit Plans, no failure to comply with ERISA, the
Code or other applicable Laws could result in the imposition of any material
liability against the Company or any Subsidiary. Each U.S. Company Benefit
Plan which is subject to ERISA (an " _ _ERISA Plan__ ") that is an "employee
pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a " _
_Pension Plan__ ") intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code,
has been timely amended within the applicable remedial amendment period under
Section 401(b) of the Code to maintain the tax-qualified status of each such
plan, and the Company is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in
the loss of the qualification of such Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction
with respect to any ERISA Plan that, assuming the taxable period of
such transaction expired as of the date hereof, could subject the Company or
any Subsidiary to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code
or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which would be material. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or reasonably expects to
incur a tax or penalty imposed by Section 4980 of the Code or Section 502 of
ERISA.    

(iii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have ever sponsored,
maintained or contributed to, or incurred an obligation to contribute to a
Pension Plan that is (x) subject to Title IV of ERISA or (y) a "multi-
employer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA. All
contributions required to be made under each Company Benefit Plan, as of the
date hereof, have been timely made and all obligations in respect of each
Benefit Plan have been properly accrued and reflected in the most recent
consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the Company
Reports prior to the date hereof. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any unfunded liability, determined on an accumulated
benefits obligation basis, for accrued pension benefits of employees
outside the United States related to periods of employment prior to the
Closing Date, which are not otherwise reflected on the consolidated balance
sheets and the consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders
equity (deficit) and cash flows for the period ended September 30,
2005.    

(iv) As of the date hereof, there is no material pending or, to the knowledge
of the officers of the Company threatened, litigation relating to the Company
Benefit Plans or any audit or investigation of the Company Benefit Plans by
and Governmental Entity. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any obligations for post-termination health and life benefits under any ERISA
Plan, other than in accordance with Section 4980B of the Code. The Company or
its Subsidiaries may amend or terminate any such plan at any time without
incurring any liability thereunder other than in respect of claims incurred
prior to such amendment or termination.    

(v) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, any Benefit Plan which would increase materially the expense of
maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for
the most recent fiscal year. Neither the execution of this Agreement,
shareholder adoption of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (w) entitle any employees of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in severance pay
upon any termination of employment after the date hereof, (x) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding (through a
grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the
amount payable or result in any other material obligation pursuant to, any of
the Company Benefit Plans, (y) limit or restrict the right of the Company or,
after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent
to merge, amend or terminate any of the Company Benefit Plans or (z) result
in payments under any of the Company Benefit Plans which would not be
deductible under Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the Code.   

(i) _Compliance with Healthcare and Other Laws; Licenses_. The businesses of
each of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the
Company for purposes of this Section 5.1(i)) have not been, and are not
being, conducted in violation of any federal, state, local or foreign law,
statute or ordinance, common law, or any rule, opinion, regulation,
standard, judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree, agency requirement,
arbitration award, license, authorization or permit of any Governmental
Entity (collectively, " _ _Laws__ "), except for such violations that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect
or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the knowledge of the officers
of the Company, no investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Company is pending or threatened, nor has any
Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct the same. To the
knowledge of the officers of the Company, no material change is required in
the Companys processes, properties or procedures in connection with any such
Laws, and the Company has not received any notice or communication of
any material noncompliance with any such Laws that has not been cured as of
the date hereof. The Company and has obtained all, and the businesses of the
Company have not been, and are not being, conducted in violation of or
inconsistent with any, permits, licenses, certifications,
approvals, registrations, consents, authorizations, accreditations,
franchises, variances, waivers, exemptions and orders required, issued or
granted by a Governmental Entity (" _ _Licenses__ ") as necessary for the
Company to conduct its business as presently conducted, all of which are valid
and in full force and effect, except where the failure to obtain or be in
compliance with such Licenses would not have a Material Adverse Effect. No
notices have been received by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or its
officers or managing employees with respect to any threatened, pending
or possible termination, revocation, suspension or limitation of any such
License, where such revocation would have a Material Adverse Effect. To the
knowledge of the officers of the Company, the businesses of the Company have
not been, and are not being, conducted in violation of or inconsistent with
such Licenses and no event has occurred or circumstance exists that may (with
or without notice or lapse of time) (A) constitute or result directly or
indirectly in a violation of or a failure to comply with any term or
requirement of any such License, or (B) result directly or indirectly in the
revocation, withdrawal, suspension, cancellation, or termination of, or
any modification to, any such License except to the extent such revocation,
withdrawal, suspension, cancellation, termination or modification would not
have a Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, Section
5.1(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a list of all
material Licenses of the Company and its Subsidiaries. All applications
required to have been filed for the renewal of any License of the Company or
its Subsidiaries have been duly filed on a timely basis with the appropriate
Governmental Entity, and all other filings required to have been made
with respect to such Governmental Entity have been duly made on a timely
basis, except where the failure to file on a timely basis would not have a
Material Adverse Effect. Except as described in Schedule 5.1(i) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, and except as would both not have a Material
Adverse Effect and not result in criminal penalties, neither the Company, nor
any of its Subsidiaries, officers, directors, or managing employees, has
engaged in any activity involving a material violation of applicable Law of
any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the Company and
its operations, including, without limitation, insurance Laws, the Department
of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(formerly known as the Health Care Financing Administration), state licensure
authorities, and state Medicaid programs or civil fraud law or authority,
including the federal Medicare and Medicaid Statutes, (including 42 U.S.C.
§§ 1395, 1320a-7, 1320a-7(a) and 1320a-7(b)), or the regulations promulgated
pursuant to such Laws.

subcontract with a prime contractor or other subcontractor who is a party to
any such contract).

Agreement except in each case, for such invalidity, failure to be binding,

and not required under generally accepted accounting principles to be
reflected in such financial statements, which, in both cases, individually
and in the aggregate is not reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.   

(f) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since October 1, 2005, and on or prior to
the date of this Agreement, the Parent and its Subsidiaries have conducted
their respective businesses only in, and have not engaged in any material
transaction other than in accordance with, the ordinary course of such
businesses consistent with past practices and there has not been:    

(i) to the knowledge of the officers of the Company, any change in the
financial condition, properties, or results of their operations or any
circumstance, occurrence or development (including any adverse change with
respect to any circumstance, occurrence or development existing on or prior
to October 1, 2005) which, individually or in the aggregate, would have a
Material Adverse Effect;    

(ii) any damage, destruction or other casualty loss with respect to any asset
or property owned, leased or otherwise used by the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not covered by insurance, that would have a Material
Adverse Effect;    

(iii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or other
distribution with respect to any shares of capital stock of the Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries (except for dividends or other distributions by any
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary to the Parent or to any wholly-
owned Subsidiary of the Parent), or any repurchase, redemption or other
acquisition by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of any outstanding
shares of capital stock or other securities of the Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries (except any redemption in accordance with the exercise of a
stock option by tender of such capital stock in payment of the exercise
price);    

(iv) any material change in any method of accounting or accounting practice by
the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries;    

(v) (A) any increase in the compensation payable or to become payable to its
executive officers or directors that has not been reported under the Exchange
Act or disclosed in Section 5.2(f)(v) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, or (B)
any establishment, adoption, entry into or amendment of any collective
bargaining, bonus, profit sharing, thrift, compensation, employment,
termination, severance or other plan, agreement, trust, fund, policy or
arrangement for the benefit of any director or executive officer except to
the extent required by applicable Laws and except for offers of employment in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice; or    

(vi) any agreement to do any of the foregoing.   

(g) _Litigation and Claims_. There are no civil, criminal or administrative
actions, suits, claims, hearings, arbitrations or other proceedings pending
or, to the knowledge of the officers of the Parent, threatened against the
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries which, if determined adversely, could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Parent. Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
subject to the provisions of any judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree or
award of any Governmental Entity. To the knowledge of the officers of the
Parent, and except for regular audit of welfare reimbursement
submissions, neither the Parent nor its Subsidiaries are currently the
subject of any investigation, inquiry or proceeding by any Governmental
Entity (or any Governmental Entitys designated agent or agents), and except
for such regular audits of submissions and other regular regulatory audits and
reviews of the Parent under Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory
agencies in the ordinary course, the Parent does not know of any grounds for
any investigation, inquiry or proceeding by any Governmental Entity, and no
notice of any exclusion, sanction, or violation, asserted deficiency, or
other irregularity has been received by Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their officers or managing employees from any Governmental Entity (or any
Governmental Entitys designated agent or agents) that would directly or
indirectly, or with the passage of time, have a Material
Adverse Effect.   

(h) _Employee Benefits_.    

(i) True and complete copies of all employee benefit plans covering current or
former employees of the Parent and its Subsidiaries and current or former
directors of the Parent, including, but not limited to, "employee benefit
plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA, and deferred compensation
(including nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section
409A of the Code), severance, stock option, stock purchase,
stock appreciation rights, or stock based, incentive and bonus plans (such
ERISA plans and other deferred compensation, severance or stock based plans
being hereafter referred to as the " _ _Parent Benefit Plans__ ") and all
amendments thereto have been made available to Company.    

(ii) All (x) non U.S. Parent Benefit Plans are in substantial compliance
with applicable Laws, and (y) all Parent Benefit Plans, other than non U.S.
Parent Benefit Plans, (collectively, " _ _U.S. Parent Benefit Plans__ ") are
in substantial compliance with ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws;
_provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to both non U.S. Parent Benefit
Plans and U.S. Parent Benefit Plans, no failure to comply with ERISA, the
Code or other applicable Laws could result in the imposition of any material
liability against the Parent or any Subsidiary. Each Pension Plan of Parent
or its Subsidiaries has been timely amended within the applicable
remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code to maintain the
tax-qualified status of each such plan, and the Parent is not aware of any
circumstances likely to result in the loss of the qualification of such Plan
under Section 401(a) of the Code. Neither the Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any ERISA Plan
that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date
hereof, could subject the Parent or any Subsidiary to a tax or penalty
imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an
amount which would be material. Neither the Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred or reasonably expects to incur a tax or penalty
imposed by Section 4980 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.    

(iii) Neither the Parent, any or its Subsidiaries have ever sponsored,
maintained or contributed to, or incurred an obligation to contribute to a
Pension Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA. All contributions required
to be made under each Parent Benefit Plan, as of the date hereof, have been
timely made and all obligations in respect of each Benefit Plan have been
properly accrued and reflected in the most recent consolidated balance sheet
filed or incorporated by reference in the Parent Reports prior to the
date hereof. Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any unfunded
liability, determined on an accumulated benefits obligation basis, for
accrued pension benefits of employees outside the United States related to
periods of employment prior to the Closing Date, which are not otherwise
reflected on the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements
of income, changes in shareholders equity (deficit) and cash flows for the
period ended October 1, 2005.    

(iv) As of the date hereof, there is no material pending or, to the knowledge
of the officers of the Parent threatened, litigation relating to the Parent
Benefit Plans or any audit or investigation of the Parent Benefit Plans by
and Governmental Entity. Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any obligations for post-termination health and life benefits under any ERISA
Plan, other than in accordance with Section 4980B of the Code. The Parent or
its Subsidiaries may amend or terminate any such plan at any time
without incurring any liability thereunder other than in respect of claims
incurred prior to such amendment or termination.    

(v) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, any Benefit Plan which would increase materially the expense of
maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for
the most recent fiscal year. Neither the execution of this Agreement,
stockholder adoption of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (w) entitle any employees of the Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in severance pay
upon any termination of employment after the date hereof, (x) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding (through a
grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the
amount payable or result in any other material obligation pursuant to, any of
the Parent Benefit Plans, (y) limit or restrict the right of the Parent or,
after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Company to
merge, amend or terminate any of the Parent Benefit Plans or (z) result in
payments under any of the Parent Benefit Plans which would not be deductible
under Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the Code.   

(i) _Compliance with Healthcare and Other Laws; Licenses_. The businesses of
each of the Parent and its Subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the
Parent for purposes of this Section 5.2(i)) have not been, and are not being,
conducted in violation of any Laws, except for such violations that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect
or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the knowledge of the officers
of the Parent, no investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or
threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct
the same. To the knowledge of the officers of the Parent, no material change
is required in the Parents processes, properties or procedures in connection
with any such Laws, and the Parent has not received any notice
or communication of any material noncompliance with any such Laws that has
not been cured as of the date hereof. The Parent has obtained all, and the
businesses of the Parent have not been, and are not being, conducted in
violation of or inconsistent with, any Licenses necessary for the Parent
to conduct its business as presently conducted, all of which are valid and in
full force and effect, except where the failure to obtain or be in compliance
with such Licenses would not have a Material Adverse Effect. No notices have
been received by the Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or its officers or
managing employees with respect to any threatened, pending or possible
termination, revocation, suspension or limitation of any such License, where
such revocation would have a Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the
officers of the Parent, the businesses of the Parent have not been, and are
not being, conducted in violation of or inconsistent with such Licenses and
no event has occurred or circumstance exists that may (with or without notice
or lapse of time) (A) constitute or result directly or indirectly in a
violation of or a failure to comply with any term or requirement of any such
License, or (B) result directly or indirectly in the revocation, withdrawal,
suspension, cancellation, or termination of, or any modification to, any such
License. All applications required to have been filed for the renewal of any
such License have been duly filed on a timely basis with the appropriate
Governmental Entity, and all other filings required to have been made with
respect to such Governmental Entity have been duly made on a timely basis,
except where the failure to file on a timely basis would not have a
Material Adverse Effect. Except as described in Schedule 5.2(i) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter, and except as would both not have a Material Adverse
Effect and not result in criminal penalties, neither the Parent, nor any of
its Subsidiaries, officers, directors, or managing employees, has engaged in
any activity involving a material violation of applicable Law of any
Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the Parent and its operations,
including, without limitation, insurance Laws, the Department of Health and
Human Services, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(formerly known as the Health Care Financing Administration), state licensure
authorities, and state Medicaid programs or civil fraud law or authority,
including the federal Medicare and Medicaid Statutes, (including 42 U.S.C. §§
1395, 1320a-7, 1320a-7(a) and 1320a-7(b)), or the regulations
promulgated pursuant to such Laws.

of its Subsidiaries is in default or breach in any respect under the terms of
such Contract, and to the knowledge of the officers of the Parent, no

permit termination, modification or acceleration by the other party
thereunder.    

(iii) With respect to each material Government Contract to which the Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party:

lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or default by any of the
Parent or its Subsidiaries or permit termination, modification
or acceleration by the lessor thereunder, or prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement except in each case, for such invalidity, failure to be binding,
unenforceability, ineffectiveness, breaches, defaults, terminations,
modifications, accelerations or repudiations that would not, individually or

result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or
lapse of time or both) under, or give rise to a right of, or result in,
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to a loss of a
material benefit under, or result in the creation of any encumbrance in or
upon any of the properties or assets of any Company or Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries under such Contract; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing

Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its best efforts to instruct and
cause its and its Subsidiaries employees, investment bankers, attorneys,

provide information in response to a request therefor by a Person who has
made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal providing for the
acquisition of more than 50% of the assets (on a consolidated basis) or
total voting power of the equity securities of the Company if the board of
directors receives from the Person so requesting such information an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms substantially similar to those contained
in the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 9.7), (B) engage in
discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made such an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal or (C) after having complied with the
requirements of this Section 6.3, approve, adopt, recommend, or otherwise
declare advisable or propose to approve, adopt, recommend or declare
advisable (publicly or otherwise) such an Acquisition Proposal, if and only to
the extent that, (x) in each such case referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C)
above, the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith after
consultation with outside legal counsel that failure to take such action is
reasonably likely to result in a breach of their respective fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; (y) in each such case referred to in clause (A) or (B),
if the board of directors of the Company has determined in good faith based
on the information then available and after consultation with its financial
advisor that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal
(as defined below) or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal;
and (z) in the case referred to in clause (C) above, the board of directors of
the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal is a
Superior Proposal.   

(b) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:   

" _ _Acquisition Proposal__ " means (i) any proposal or offer with respect to
a merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution,
liquidation, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange,
business combination or similar transaction involving the Company or any of
its Significant Subsidiaries or (ii) any proposal or offer to acquire in any
manner, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of any class of equity securities
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or consolidated total assets
(including, without limitation, equity securities of its Subsidiaries) of the
Company, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.   

" _ _Superior Proposal__ " means an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal
(i) involving all of the assets (on a consolidated basis) or more than 50% of
the total voting power of the equity securities of the Company, (ii) is fully
financed or reasonably capable of being financed and is not contingent on the
availability of financing, and (iii) that the board of directors of the
Company has determined in its good faith judgment is reasonably likely to be
consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the Person making
the proposal, and if consummated, would result in a transaction more
favorable to the Companys shareholders from a financial point of view than
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into account any
revisions to the terms of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement made
by Parent pursuant to Section 6.3(c)).   

(c) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. The
board of directors of the Company and each committee thereof shall
not:    

(i) except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.3, withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation
with respect to the Merger; or    

(ii) except as expressly permitted by Section 8.3(a) hereof, cause or permit
the Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other
agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section
6.3(a) entered into in the circumstances referred to in Section 6.3(a)) (an "
_ _Alternative Acquisition Agreement__ ") relating to any Acquisition
Proposal.   

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
the adoption of this Agreement by the Company Requisite Vote, the Company
board of directors may withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify the Company
Recommendation or approve, adopt, recommend or otherwise declare advisable
any Superior Proposal made after the date hereof and not solicited, initiated
or encouraged in breach of this Agreement, if, subject to compliance with
Section 6.3(c), the Company board of directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to do so would
reasonably be likely to result in a breach of their respective fiduciary
duties under applicable law (a " _ _Change of Company Recommendation__ "). In
determining whether to make a Change of Company Recommendation in response to
a Superior Proposal or otherwise, the Company board of directors shall take
into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent or
any other information provided by Parent in response to such notice.   

(d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section 6.3
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its disclosure
obligations under U.S. federal or state law with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such disclosure does not reaffirm
the Company Recommendation or has the substantive effect of withdrawing or
adversely qualifying or modifying the Company Recommendation, Parent, shall
have the right to terminate this Agreement as set forth in Section
8.4(a).   

(e) _Existing Discussions_. The Company agrees that it will immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal.

hereof, (i) the Company and Parent shall cooperate in the preparation of a
registration statement on Form S-4 (the " _ _Form S-4__") to be filed by
Parent in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger
(including the joint proxy statement and prospectus and other
proxy solicitation materials of the Company and Parent constituting a part
thereof (the " _ _Joint Proxy Statement__ ")). Each of the Company and Parent
shall use their best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under
the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and
to maintain such effectiveness until the shares covered thereby have been
issued. Parent shall provide the Company with copies of all filings made
pursuant to this Section 6.4 and shall consult with the Company on any
responses to comments made by the staff of the SEC with respect thereto. The
Company and Parent will use their best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy
Statement to be mailed to their respective shareholders as promptly as
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities
Act. Parent shall, at its expense, also take any action required to be taken
under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance of
Parent Common Stock in the Merger.   

If at any time prior to the Effective Time either party becomes aware of any
event or circumstance which is required to be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement, it shall promptly notify
the other Party in writing. Each of Parent and the Company will advise the
other, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the
Form S-4 has become effective or any supplement or amendment thereto has been
filed, the issuance of any stop order, or any request by the SEC for
amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or Form S-4 or comments thereon or
responses thereto.   

6.5. _Shareholder Meetings_. Each of Parent and the Company shall take, in
accordance with applicable law, applicable Nasdaq rules and its respective
certificate or articles of incorporation and bylaws, all action necessary to
convene, respectively, (i) an appropriate meeting of stockholders of Parent
to consider and vote upon the approval of the issuance of the shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger pursuant to this Agreement,
and any other matters required to be approved by Parent stockholders for
consummation of the Merger (the " _ _Stockholder Meeting__ "), and (ii) an
appropriate meeting of shareholders of the Company to consider and vote upon
the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger and any other
matters required to be approved by the Companys shareholders for
consummation of the Merger (the " _ _Shareholder Meeting__ ") as promptly as
practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective. The board
of directors of Parent and subject to section 6.3 hereof, the board of
directors of the Company shall recommend such approval, and each of Parent
and the Company shall take all reasonable lawful action to solicit such
approval by its respective stockholders. The Company and Parent shall
coordinate and cooperate with respect to the timing of the meetings and shall
use their respective best efforts to hold such meetings on the same day as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof.   

6.6. _HSR Filings; Other Actions; Notification_.   

(a) _Cooperation_. The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and
use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and
make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as soon as practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly
as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and
other filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents,

Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the Foregoing, the Parent shall
prepare and file within ten Business Days of the date hereof, and the Company
shall provide all information required to assist with, an appropriate filing
under the HSR within five Business Days of the date hereof. The Company and
Parent will each request early termination of the waiting period with respect
to the Merger under the HSR Act. The Company shall substantially comply with
any additional requests for information, including requests for production of
documents and production of witnesses for interviews or depositions, by
any Governmental Entity. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange
of information, Parent shall have the right to direct all matters with any
Governmental Entity consistent with its obligations hereunder; _provided_
that Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to
the extent practicable each will consult with the other on and consider in
good faith the views of the other in connection with, all of the information
relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Proxy Statement). In exercising the foregoing
rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly
as practicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 6.6(a), Parent shall not be required, as a condition to any approval
under the HSR Act, (i) to dispose, transfer or hold separate, or cause any of
its Subsidiaries to dispose, transfer or hold separate any significant assets
or operations, or to commit or to cause any of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to dispose, transfer or hold separate any significant assets
or operations; (ii) to discontinue or cause any of its Subsidiaries to
discontinue offering any product or service that is material to the Company
or any one of its divisions or operating units, or to commit to cause any of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to discontinue offering any such

(b) _Information_. The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the
other, furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Form S-4, the
Joint Proxy Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application
made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   

(c) _Status_. Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including (i) promptly furnishing the other with copies
of notices or other communications received by Parent or the Company, as the
case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) any legal proceeding or material
claim threatened in writing, commenced or asserted against or with respect to
the Company or any Subsidiary or the transactions contemplated hereby. The
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any change, fact or condition
that is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect or of any
failure or impossibility of any condition to Parents obligations to effect
the Merger.   

6.7. _Access and Reports_. Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable notice,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parents
officers and other authorized Representatives, and the Parent shall (and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford the Companys officers and other
authorized Representatives, reasonable access, during normal business
hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its employees,
properties, books, contracts and records and, during such period, the each
shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the other all
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
may reasonably be requested, _provided_ that the foregoing shall not require
the Company or the Parent (i) to permit any inspection, or to disclose any
information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company or the Parent (as
the case may be) would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third
parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality
if the Company or the Parent (as the case may be) shall have used reasonable
best efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or
disclosure or (ii) to disclose any privileged information of the Company, the
Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries. All requests for information
made pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall be directed to an executive officer of
the Company or Parent or such Person as may be designated by such executive
officers. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall
use its best efforts to provide to Parent a list of all Licenses to
supplement Section 5.1(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter within thirty
(30) days of the date of this Agreement. All such information shall be
governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.   

6.8. _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a
joint press release and thereafter the Company and Parent each shall consult
with each other and provide each other with copies of proposed press
releases, public announcements and filings prior to issuing any press
releases or otherwise making public announcements with respect to the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making
any filings with any third party or any Governmental Entity (including any
national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service) with respect
thereto, except as may be required by Law or by obligations pursuant to
any listing agreement with or rules of any national securities exchange or
interdealer quotation service or by the request of any Government
Entity.   

6.9. _Employee Benefits_. (a) Parent agrees that, following the Effective
Time, the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be eligible to
participate in the employee benefit plans of Parent or Parents Subsidiaries
on substantially the same terms and conditions of similarly situated
employees of Parent or Parents Subsidiaries. Parent will cause any
employee benefit plans which the employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries are eligible to participate in to take into account for purposes
of eligibility and vesting and benefit accrual thereunder (except for benefit
accrual under defined benefit pension plans, for purposes of qualifying
for subsidized early retirement benefits or to the extent it would result in
a duplication of benefits), service by employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as if such service were with Parent, to the same extent such
service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall obligate Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to (i) maintain any
particular Benefit Plan or (ii) retain the employment of any particular
employee.   

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan or
arrangement, the Company shall (1) cause to be amended the employee benefit
plans and arrangements of it and its Subsidiaries to the extent necessary to
provide that no employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries shall commence
participation therein following the Effective Time unless the Surviving
Corporation or such Subsidiary explicitly authorizes such participation and
(2) cause the Company 401(k) Plan to be terminated effective immediately
prior to the Effective Time.   

(c) Except communication to members of the Board of Directors in their
capacities as members of the Board, prior to making any written or oral
communications to the directors, officers or employees of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are
affected by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall
provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication, Parent shall have a
reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication, and
Parent and the Company shall cooperate in providing any such mutually
agreeable communication.   

6.10. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.5, whether or not
the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expense.   

6.11. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) From and
after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation agrees
that it will indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting
in his or her "official capacity" as defined in Section 302A.521 of
the MBCA), determined as of the Effective Time (the " _ _Indemnified
Parties__ "), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, penalties, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(collectively, " _ _Costs__ ") incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been
permitted under Minnesota law and its articles of incorporation or bylaws in
effect on the date hereof to indemnify such Person (and Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, _provided_ that the Person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification);
and _provided_ , _further_ , that any determination required to be made with
respect to whether an officers or directors conduct complies with the
standards set forth under Minnesota law and the Companys articles of
incorporation and bylaws shall be made by independent counsel selected by the
Surviving Corporation.   

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a)
of this Section 6.11, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the
failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of
any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent
such failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party. In the event of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising
before or after the Effective Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and Parent shall not be
liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or
any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in
connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent or the Surviving
Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified
Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest
between Parent or the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor
are received; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (b) to pay for only
one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any action unless the use
of one counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a
conflict of interest; _provided_ that the fewest number of counsels
necessary to avoid conflicts of interest shall be used; (ii) the Indemnified
Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and (iii) Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without their prior written consent; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation hereunder to
any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in
the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law. Nothing in
this Section 6.10(b) shall be effective to the extent it limits the rights of
an Indemnifying party under applicable law, including, as it applies to the
Surviving Corporation, the MBCA.   

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain the Companys directors and
officers liability insurance (" _ _D andO Insurance__"), or Parent shall
provide for equivalent DandO Insurance providing substantially the same
benefits and levels of coverage as the current DandO Insurance, with respect to
acts or omissions prior to the Effective Time for a period of six years after
the Effective Time so long as the premium therefor is not in excess of 200%
of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof (the
" _ _Current Premium__ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if the current DandO
Insurance or such equivalent insurance provided by Parent expires, is
terminated or cancelled or is otherwise unavailable on such terms during such
six-year period, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain as much DandO Insurance on substantially the
same terms as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for a premium
not in excess of 200% of the Current Premium.   

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
