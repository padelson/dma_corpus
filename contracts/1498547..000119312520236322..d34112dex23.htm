effective as of the Merger Effective Time and ensure that from and after the

or similar Law. Any amounts so delivered that remain unclaimed by holders of
Eligible Shares immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would

and clear of any claims or interest of such holders or their successors,
assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto.

Surviving Entity or the Transfer Agent, or any of their agents, as
applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration and any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of CCPT V Common Stock such amounts as it is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to such payments under the Code or any
other provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. Any such amounts so
deducted and withheld shall be timely paid to the applicable Governmental
Authority in accordance with applicable Law and shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

Section 3.5 _Dissenters Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall
be available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 3.6 _General Effects of the Merger_. At the Merger Effective
Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as set forth in this Agreement and the

thereto, at the Merger Effective Time, all of the property, rights,

Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Entity.

assuming receipt of the Stockholder Approval, conflict with or violate any
provision of (A) the CCPT V Governing Documents or (B) any equivalent
organizational or governing documents of any other CCPT V Subsidiary, (ii)
assuming (solely with respect to performance of this Agreement) compliance
with the matters referred to in _Section_ __ _ 4.3(b)_, conflict with or
violate any Law or Environmental Permit applicable to CCPT V or any CCPT V
Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of CCPT V or any CCPT V
Subsidiary is bound, or (iii) with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
constitute or result in a breach or violation of, or a default under, or
give rise to any Lien, acceleration of remedies, right of termination,
purchase, first offer or forced sale under, any Contract of CCPT V or any CCPT
V Subsidiary or related to any of their respective properties, except, as to

required by any applicable state securities or "blue sky" Laws and (v) where
failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to
make such filings, notifications or reports, individually or in the

Effect. As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of CCPT V, there is no reason
why the necessary approvals referenced in clause (v) of the preceding
sentence will not be received in order to permit consummation of the Merger on
a timely basis.

validity of any CMFT Permit or which would reasonably be expected, if accepted
or granted, to result in the revocation of any CMFT Permit, except where
the impairment or revocation of any such CMFT Permits, individually, or in

broadly disseminating public disclosure (other than confidential information)
or (C) providing access to the properties, offices, assets, books, records and
personnel of CCPT V and the CCPT V Subsidiaries and furnishing non-public
information pursuant to (but only pursuant to) one or more Acceptable NDAs;
_provided_ , _however_ , that CCPT V shall prior to, or concurrently with the
time such access or non-public information is provided, provide such access
and make available such non-public information to CMFT to the extent it has
not already done so; (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any Person relating to, or in furtherance
of, such inquiries, proposals, offers or other actions or to obtain, an
Acquisition Proposal; (iii) refrain from enforcing any standstill agreement or
similar obligation to CCPT V or any of the CCPT V Subsidiaries; and (iv)
disclose to the stockholders of CCPT V any information required to be
disclosed under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of
this clause (iv), to the extent any such disclosure addresses the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the CCPT V Special
Committee or the CCPT V Board with respect to this Agreement or an Acquisition
Proposal, such disclosure shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation
Change if not accompanied by an express public affirmation of the CCPT V
Board Recommendation. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Go Shop
Bidder_ " shall mean any Person (including its controlled Affiliates and
Representatives) that submits a written proposal or offer regarding an
Acquisition Proposal prior to the Go Shop Period End Time that has not been
withdrawn and that the CCPT V Special Committee determines, in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
prior to the Go Shop Period End Time (or in the case of any Acquisition
Proposal received less than three (3) Business Days before the date of the Go
Shop Period End Time, not later than three (3) Business Days after the
receipt of such Acquisition Proposal), has resulted in, or would be
reasonably expected to result in, a Superior Proposal (as defined below);
_provided_ , that a Go Shop Bidder shall cease to be a Go Shop Bidder if (1)
the negotiations between CCPT V and such Go Shop Bidder with respect to the
Acquisition Proposal that resulted in such Go Shop Bidder becoming a Go Shop
Bidder shall have been terminated, (2) the Acquisition Proposal submitted by
such Go Shop Bidder prior to the Go Shop Period End Time is withdrawn,
terminated or modified in a manner such that, in the CCPT V Special
Committees good faith determination, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, the Acquisition Proposal as modified no
longer constitutes, or would no longer reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Superior Proposal, or (3) such Go Shop Bidder otherwise ceases to be actively
pursuing efforts to acquire CCPT V. No later than twenty-four (24)
hours after the Go Shop Period End Time (or after a bidder is determined to
be a Go Shop Bidder if such

 



-63- 

    

 determination occurs after the Go Shop Period End Time), CCPT V shall notify
CMFT in writing (I) if any Go Shop Bidders remain at such time, (II) of the
identity of such Go Shop Bidder(s) and (III) of the material terms and
conditions of the most recent Acquisition Proposal received from such Go Shop
Bidder(s) (and shall include with such notice (x) copies of any written
Acquisition Proposal, including any proposed transaction agreement and any
related transaction documents and financing commitments, if any and (y) a
written summary of the material terms of any related Acquisition Proposal not
made in writing (including any material terms proposed orally or
supplementally)), and thereafter shall promptly (and in any event no later
than twenty-four (24) hours after the occurrence of such developments,
discussions or negotiations or receipt of materials) (1) keep CMFT reasonably
informed of all material developments, discussions and negotiations concerning
any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and (2) provide CMFT with
any written supplements or written additions to any written
Acquisition Proposal, including any revisions to any proposed transaction
agreement and any related transaction documents and financing commitments, if
any.

 

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, and except
with respect to a Go Shop Bidder, from and after the Go Shop Period End Time,
CCPT V shall not, and shall cause each of the CCPT V Subsidiaries and shall
direct each of its and their respective directors, officers, Affiliates and
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
facilitate or knowingly encourage any inquiries, proposals or offers for, or
engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or
nonpublic information or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person
relating to, any inquiry, proposal, offer or other action that constitutes, or
may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter
into or engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any Person regarding or otherwise in furtherance of, or
furnish to any Person other than CMFT or its Representatives, any information
in connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating any
inquiry, proposal, offer or other action that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, or to otherwise obtain, an Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) release any Person from or fail to enforce any confidentiality
agreement, standstill agreement or similar obligation (provided that CCPT V
shall be permitted to waive or to not enforce any provision of any
confidentiality agreement, standstill agreement or similar obligation to
permit a Person to make a confidential Acquisition Proposal directly to
the CCPT V Special Committee if the CCPT V Special Committee determines in
good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that any such failure
to waive or to not enforce would be inconsistent with the CCPT V directors
duties or standard of conduct under Maryland Law), (iv) enter into any
Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other
than an Acceptable NDA), or (v) take any action to exempt any Person from any
Takeover Statute or similar restrictive provision of the CCPT V Charter, the
CCPT V Bylaws or organizational documents or agreements of any CCPT V
Subsidiary. In furtherance of the foregoing and except with respect to a Go
Shop Bidder and as otherwise permitted by this  _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, CCPT V
shall, and shall cause each CCPT V Subsidiary and each Representative of CCPT
V and the CCPT V Subsidiaries to, immediately cease any discussions,
negotiations or communications with any Person with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal and shall immediately
terminate all physical and electronic

 



-64- 

    

 data room access previously granted to any such Person and use reasonable
efforts to cause such Person to return or destroy all non-public
information concerning CCPT V and the CCPT V Subsidiaries to the extent
permitted pursuant to any confidentiality agreement with such Person and
promptly terminate all physical and electronic data room access granted to
such Person. For the avoidance of doubt, from and after the Go Shop Period
End Time and until the receipt of Stockholder Approval, CCPT V, the CCPT V
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives may continue to take any of
the actions described in  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ with respect to any
proposals or offers regarding any Acquisition Proposal submitted by a Go Shop
Bidder on or before the Go Shop Period End Time or with respect to any amended
or modified proposal or offer with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal
submitted by a Go Shop Bidder after the Go Shop Period End Time that, in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.3(d)_, CCPT V discloses to CMFT (and
provides copies to CMFT of) if the CCPT V Special Committee has determined in
good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel and outside financial
advisors that such Acquisition Proposal (as may be amended or modified) is or
is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal. The Parties acknowledge
that (a) CMFT has entered into or intends to enter into merger agreements with
each of Cole Office and Industrial REIT (CCIT II), Inc. and Cole Office and
Industrial REIT (CCIT III), Inc. pursuant to which Cole Office and Industrial
REIT (CCIT II), Inc. and Cole Office and Industrial REIT (CCIT III), Inc. shall
be merged with and into an affiliate of CMFT (the " _Other Merger Agreements_
") and (b) nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ shall be construed to
restrict the ability of CCPT V and its directors, officers, Affiliates and
Representatives to participate in discussions with Cole Office and Industrial
REIT (CCIT II), Inc. and Cole Office and Industrial REIT (CCIT III), Inc. and
their respective Representatives relating to the Other Merger Agreements and
the transactions contemplated thereby.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
after the Go Shop Period End Time and prior to the time, but not after,
Stockholder Approval is obtained, CCPT V and its Representatives may, in
response to an unsolicited, _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal that did
not result from a material breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, (x) contact
such Person to clarify the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal
and (y)(i) provide information in response to a request therefor by the Person
who made such written Acquisition Proposal, provided that (A) such
information is provided pursuant to (and only pursuant to) one or more
Acceptable NDAs, and (B) CCPT V, prior to or concurrently with the time such
information is provided, provides such information to CMFT, and (ii) engage
or participate in any discussions or negotiations with the Person who made
such written Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that, in each
such case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, the CCPT V Special
Committee has either determined that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal or determined in good faith after consultation with outside
legal counsel and outside financial advisors that such Acquisition Proposal
could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal.

(d) From and after the Go Shop Period End Time, CCPT V will promptly (and
in any event no later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt thereof)
notify CMFT in writing if (i) any Acquisition Proposal is received by CCPT V
or any CCPT V Subsidiary, (ii) any request for information relating to CCPT V
or any CCPT V Subsidiary is received by CCPT V or any CCPT V Subsidiary from
any Person who informs CCPT V or any CCPT V Subsidiary that it is considering
making or has made an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) any discussions
or negotiations are sought to be initiated with CCPT V or any CCPT V
Subsidiary regarding any Acquisition Proposal, and shall, in any such notice
to CMFT, indicate the identity of the Person making, and the material terms
and conditions of, such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (and shall
include with such notice (A) copies of any written Acquisition Proposal,
including any proposed

 



-65- 

    

 transaction agreement and any related transaction documents and financing
commitments, if any, and (B) a written summary of the material terms of any
related Acquisition Proposal not made in writing (including any material
terms proposed orally or supplementally)), and thereafter shall promptly (and
in any event no later than twenty-four (24) hours after the occurrence of such
developments, discussions or negotiations or receipt of materials) (I) keep
CMFT reasonably informed of all material developments, discussions and
negotiations concerning any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and
(II) provide CMFT with any written supplements or written additions to any
written Acquisition Proposal, including any revisions to any proposed
transaction agreement and any related transaction documents and financing
commitments, if any. Neither CCPT V nor any CCPT V Subsidiary will enter into
any agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that
prohibits CCPT V from providing any information to CMFT in accordance with
this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_.

 

(e) Except as expressly provided in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(f)_, _Section_ __ _
7.3(h)_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(ii)_, neither the CCPT V Board, nor any
committee thereof, nor any group of directors, formally or informally, shall:
(i) change, withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify or publicly propose or
announce or authorize or resolve to, or announce its intention to change,
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, in each case in a manner adverse to
CMFT, the CCPT V Board Recommendation, (ii) authorize, approve, endorse,
declare advisable, adopt or recommend or propose to publicly authorize,
approve, endorse, declare advisable, adopt or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) authorize, cause or permit CCPT V or any CCPT V Subsidiary to
enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement, or (iv) fail to make the
CCPT V Board Recommendation or to include the CCPT V Board Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement (any event described in clause (i), (ii) or this clause
(iv), an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, subject to
compliance with the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(f)_, if CCPT V
receives an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not from a Go Shop Bidder), which
Acquisition Proposal did not result from a material breach of this  _Section_
__ _ 7.3_ and is not withdrawn, and the CCPT V Special Committee determines
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor,
that failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with
such Superior Proposal or that failure to terminate this Agreement to enter
into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement for such Superior Proposal would be
inconsistent with the CCPT V directors duties or standard of conduct under
Maryland Law, then, provided that Stockholder Approval has not yet been
obtained, the CCPT V Board (based on the recommendation of the CCPT V Special
Committee) may (x) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (y) enter
into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement relating to or implementing the
Superior Proposal and terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 9.1(c)(ii)_;  _provided_ , that, in the case of each of clause (x) and
(y), the CCPT V Board may not take action contemplated by this _Section_ __ _
7.3(f)_ unless:

 

(i) CCPT V has notified CMFT in writing that the CCPT V Board intends to
take such action at least four (4) Business Days in advance of effecting an
Adverse Recommendation Change and/or entering into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the reasons for
such action, describe the material terms of the Superior Proposal and attach
the most current version of such agreements (including any amendments,
supplements or modifications) between CCPT V and the party making such
Superior Proposal (a " _CCPT V Change Notice_ "); and

 



-66- 

    

(ii) during the four (4) Business Day period following CMFTs receipt of a
CCPT V Change Notice, CCPT V shall, and shall direct its outside financial and
outside legal advisors to, negotiate in good faith with CMFT (to the extent
CMFT wishes to negotiate) to make adjustments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement such that the Superior Proposal ceases to constitute (in the
good faith determination of the CCPT V Special Committee, after consultation
with outside legal counsel and outside financial advisors) a
Superior Proposal; _provided,_ that any amendment, supplement or modification
to any Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed a new Acquisition Proposal and
CCPT V may not enter into any agreement relating to the Superior Proposal
pursuant this  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(f)_ or make an Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(f)_ or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(ii)_ unless CCPT V has complied with the
requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(f)_ with respect to such new
Acquisition Proposal including sending an additional CCPT V Change Notice
(except that the new negotiation period under this  _Section_ __ _
7.3(f)(ii)_ shall be three (3) Business Days instead of four (4) Business
Days). Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(f)(ii)_, neither
CMFTs acceptance nor rejection of CCPT Vs offer to negotiate pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(f)(ii)_ shall have any bearing on CMFTs right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)(ii)_ herein.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
after the date of this Agreement and before Stockholder Approval is obtained,
the CCPT V Special Committee and the CCPT V Board may, if the CCPT V Special
Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the duties or
standard of conduct of the directors under Maryland Law, make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event; _provided_ , that,
prior to making such Adverse Recommendation Change, CCPT V shall
have complied with clauses (i) and (ii) of _Section_ __ _ 7.3(f)_.

(h) Nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prevent the CCPT V Special Committee, the CCPT V Board or CCPT V,
directly or indirectly, from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of
the CCPT V a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal as contemplated
by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making
any required disclosure to the stockholders of CCPT V under applicable Law,
including Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A or (iii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of CCPT V
if the CCPT V Board determines in good faith after consultation with its
outside legal counsel (and based on the recommendation of the CCPT V Special
Committee) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the duties
and standard of conduct of the CCPT V directors under Maryland Law; _provided_
, _however_ , that to the extent any such disclosure addresses the approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by the CCPT V Special Committee
or the CCPT V Board with respect to this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal,
such disclosure shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change if not
accompanied by an express public affirmation of the CCPT V Board
Recommendation;  _provided_ , _further_ , that a "stop, look and

 



-67- 

    

 listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act shall not be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
none of CCPT V, any CCPT V Subsidiary or their respective Affiliates or
Representatives shall reimburse or agree to reimburse the fees or expenses of
any Person (including any Go Shop Bidder or its Representatives) in connection
with an Acquisition Proposal (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in
connection with any Acceptable NDA but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
in connection with any acquisition agreement or merger with respect to a
Superior Proposal entered into pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ and
resulting in termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.1(c)_).

 

(j) CCPT V agrees that in the event any Representative of CCPT V or any
CCPT V Subsidiary takes any action that, if taken by CCPT V would constitute
a violation of this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, and such action was taken at the
direction or with the prior consent of the CCPT V Special Committee, then CCPT
V shall be deemed to be in violation of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ for all
purposes of this Agreement.

(k) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any bona fide proposal or offer from
any Person (other than CMFT or any CMFT Subsidiaries) made after the date of
this Agreement, whether in one transaction or a series of related
transactions, relating to any (A) merger, consolidation, share exchange,

Subsidiary that would constitute a "significant subsidiary" (as defined in
Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X) representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the
consolidated assets of CCPT V, (B) sale or other disposition, by merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination or any similar
transaction, of any assets of CCPT V or any CCPT V Subsidiaries that

or any CCPT V Subsidiaries of (including by way of merger, consolidation,

associated with the outstanding shares of CCPT V Common Stock, (D) tender
offer or exchange offer in which any Person or " _group_ " (as such term is
defined under the Exchange Act) shall acquire beneficial ownership (as such
term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), or the right to acquire
beneficial ownership, of twenty percent (20%) or more of the votes associated
with the outstanding shares of CCPT V Common Stock, or (E)
recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other similar
type of transaction with respect to CCPT V in which a third party shall
acquire beneficial ownership of twenty percent (20%) or more of the
outstanding shares of CCPT V Common Stock;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the
term "Acquisition Proposal" shall not include (I) the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (II) any merger,
consolidation, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization or
similar transaction solely among CCPT V and one or more of the CCPT V
Subsidiaries or solely among the CCPT V Subsidiaries.

 



-68- 

    

(ii) " _Intervening Event_ " means, with respect to CCPT V, a change in
circumstances or development that materially affects the business, assets or
operations of CCPT V and the CCPT V Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that was
not known to or reasonably foreseeable by the CCPT V Board prior to the
execution of this Agreement, which change in circumstances or development
becomes known to the CCPT V Board prior to Stockholder Approval being
obtained; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the following
events, circumstances or changes in circumstances constitute an Intervening
Event: (i) the receipt, existence or terms of an Acquisition Proposal or any
matter relating thereto or consequence thereof, (ii) any effect arising out of
or related to the COVID-19 pandemic or COVID-19 Measures and (iii) any effect
arising out of the announcement or pendency of, or any actions required to be
taken pursuant to, this Agreement.

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a written Acquisition Proposal (except
for purposes of this definition, the references in the definition of
"Acquisition Proposal" to "twenty percent (20%)" shall be replaced with "fifty
percent (50%)") that the CCPT V Board (based on the recommendation of the
CCPT V Special Committee) determines in its good faith judgment (after
consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors, and after taking
into account (A) all of the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal
and this Agreement (as it may be proposed to be amended by CMFT) and (B) the
feasibility and certainty of consummation of such Acquisition Proposal on the
terms proposed (taking into account such legal, financial, regulatory and
other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal and conditions to consummation
thereof as the CCPT V Special Committee determines in good faith to be
material to such analysis)), to be more favorable from a financial point of
view to the stockholders of CCPT V (in their capacities as stockholders) than
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (as it
may be proposed to be amended by CMFT) pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.3(f)(ii)_.

 

Section 7.4 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Adverse
Recommendation Change or any action taken pursuant to, and in accordance
with, _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, so long as this Agreement
is in effect, the Parties shall consult with each other before issuing any
press release or otherwise making any public statements or filings with
respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and none of the Parties shall issue any such press release or make
any such public statement or filing prior to obtaining the other Parties
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), provided, that a Party may, without obtaining the other Parties
consent, issue such press release or make such public statement or filing as
may be required by Law if it is not possible to consult with the other Party
before doing so. The Parties have agreed upon the form of a joint press
release announcing the Merger and the execution of this Agreement, and
shall make such joint press release no later than one (1) Business Day

taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary or advisable to obtain an
approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by,
any Governmental Authority or other Persons necessary in connection with the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iv) subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.6(c)_, defending any lawsuits
or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging

divestiture or other disposition of any assets or businesses of such Party,
any of its subsidiaries (including subsidiaries of CMFT after the Closing) or
their Affiliates or (B) otherwise to take or commit to take any actions that
would limit the freedom of such Party, its subsidiaries (including
subsidiaries of CMFT after the Closing) or their Affiliates with respect to,
or their ability to retain, one or more of their businesses, product lines or
assets; provided, further, that CCPT V and the CCPT V Subsidiaries shall not
take any of the actions referred to in the proceeding proviso (or agree to
take such actions) without CMFTs prior written consent and CMFT can compel
CCPT V and the CCPT V Subsidiaries to take any of the actions referred to in
the proceeding proviso (or agree to take such actions) if such actions are
only effective after the Merger Effective Time.

 

(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing _Section_ __ _
7.5(a)_, each of the Parties shall give (or shall cause their respective
Affiliates to give) any notices to third parties, and each of the Parties
shall use, and cause each of their respective Affiliates to use, its
reasonable best efforts to obtain any third party consents that are

that, to the extent reasonably practicable, the Parties or their
Representatives shall have the right to review in advance and each of the

business information may be redacted from such exchanges. To the extent
reasonably practicable, no Party shall, nor shall any Party permit its
respective Representatives to, participate independently in any meeting or
engage in any substantive conversation with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other
Parties prior notice of such meeting or conversation and, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, without giving the other Parties the opportunity
to attend or participate (whether by telephone or in person) in any such
meeting with such Governmental Authority.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in
connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than
any Governmental Authority) with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, none of the Parties or any of
their respective Representatives shall be obligated to pay or commit to pay
to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other
consideration, make any accommodation or commitment or incur any liability or
other obligation to such Person. Subject to the immediately foregoing
sentence, the Parties shall cooperate with respect to reasonable
accommodations that may be requested or appropriate to obtain such consents.

 

Section 7.6 _Notification of Certain Matters; Transaction Litigation_.

 

(a) CMFT, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives shall give prompt
notice to CCPT V, and CCPT V and its Representatives shall give prompt notice
to CMFT and Merger Sub, of any notice or other communication received by such
Party from any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(b) CMFT, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives shall give prompt
notice to CCPT V, and CCPT V and its Representatives shall give prompt notice
to CMFT and Merger Sub, if (i) any representation or warranty made by it
contained in this Agreement becomes untrue or inaccurate such that it would be
reasonable to expect that the applicable closing conditions would be
incapable of being satisfied by the Outside Date or (ii) it fails to comply
with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement
to be

 



-71- 

    

 complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided_ , that no
such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the Parties or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties
under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the failure by CMFT, Merger Sub, CCPT V or their respective
Representatives to provide such prompt notice under this  _Section_ __ _

_Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)(i)_.

Section 7.7 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __
_Insurance_.

(a) From the Merger Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the Merger Effective Time, CMFT shall (and shall cause the Surviving Entity
to), to the fullest extent CCPT V would be permitted to do so under applicable
Law and the CCPT V Governing Documents, (i) indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each current and former manager, director, officer, partner, member,
trustee, employee and agent of CCPT V or any of the CCPT V Subsidiaries or
other individuals with rights to indemnification or exculpation pursuant to
the CCPT V Governing Documents or any indemnification agreements of CCPT V or
CCPT V Subsidiaries (such agreements, the " _Additional Indemnification
Agreements_ ") (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against and from
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any Action to the extent such Action arises out of or pertains
to (A) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such
Indemnified Partys capacity as a manager, director, officer, partner, member,
trustee, employee or agent of CCPT V or any of the CCPT V Subsidiaries
(whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Merger Effective Time)
or (B) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Merger Effective Time), and (ii) pay in advance of the final
disposition of any such Action the costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees that are subject to indemnification hereunder), without the
requirement of any bond or other security, in each case to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, but subject to CMFTs or the Surviving Entitys
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified

 



-72- 

    

 Party to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, CMFT or the Surviving Entity, as
applicable, (x) shall not settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any Action against or
of any Indemnified Party for which indemnification may be sought under this
_Section_ __ _ 7.7_ without the Indemnified Partys prior written consent
(which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)
unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such Action that is subject to indemnification by CMFT and the Surviving
Entity under this _Section_ __ _ 7.7_, (y) shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and (z) shall not have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party to the extent that a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine in a final and non-appealable order
that such indemnification is prohibited by applicable Law. Without limiting
the foregoing, and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, each of CMFT
and the Surviving Entity agree that during the period commencing as of the
Merger Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Merger
Effective Time, all rights to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Merger
Effective Time, and advancement of expenses now existing in favor of any
Indemnified Party as provided in the CCPT V Governing Documents and
Additional Indemnification Agreements shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

 

(b) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, CMFT shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Entity to, obtain and fully pay the premium for "tail" insurance
policies for the extension of (or the substantial equivalent of) the
directors and officers liability coverage of the existing directors and
officers insurance policies of CCPT V for a claims reporting or discovery
period of six (6) years from and after the Merger Effective Time, on prepaid
and non-cancellable terms, for an aggregate cost not in excess of three times
the current annual premiums for such insurance. CMFT and the Surviving Entity
shall not take any action to terminate or modify the terms of the extended
reporting period coverage.

 

(c) For a period of six (6) years following the Merger Effective Time, the
organizational documents of CMFT and any applicable CMFT Subsidiary shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions and rights to advancement
of expenses relating thereto existing in favor of any Indemnified Party than
those included in the CCPT V Governing Documents or any similar organizational
documents or agreements of any CMFT Subsidiary. No such provision shall be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years
following the Merger Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely
the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Merger Effective
Time, were Indemnified Parties, unless such modification shall be required
by applicable Law and then only to the minimum extent required by applicable
Law.

(d) If CMFT or the Surviving Entity or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or
winds-up, or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its

 



-73- 

    

 properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of CMFT or the
Surviving Entity, as applicable, assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.7_.

(e) The provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ are intended to be for
the express benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party,
his or her heirs and his or her personal representatives, shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of CMFT, CCPT V and the Surviving Entity and shall
not be amended in a manner that is adverse to the Indemnified Party (including
his or her successors, assigns and heirs) without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party (including such successors, assigns and heirs) affected
thereby. The exculpation and indemnification provided for by this _Section_ __
_ 7.7_ shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which an
Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to applicable Law, Contract
or otherwise. CMFT shall cause the Surviving Entity to pay all reasonable
expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnified Party in enforcing the obligations provided in this _Section_ __
_ 7.7._

Section 7.8 _Dividends_.

 

(a) In the event that a distribution with respect to the shares of CCPT V
Common Stock permitted under the terms of this Agreement has a record date
prior to the Merger Effective Time and has not been paid prior to the Closing
Date, such distribution shall be paid to the holders of such shares of CCPT V
Common Stock on the Closing Date immediately prior to the Merger Effective
Time. In the event that a distribution with respect to the shares of CMFT
Common Stock permitted under the terms of this Agreement has a record date
prior to the Merger Effective Time and has not been paid prior to the Closing
Date, such distribution shall be paid to the holders of such shares of CMFT
Common Stock on the Closing Date immediately prior to the Merger Effective
Time. CCPT V shall coordinate with CMFT on the declaration, setting of record
dates and payment dates of dividends on CCPT V Common Stock so that holders
of CCPT V Common Stock (i) do not receive dividends on both CCPT V Common
Stock and CMFT Common Stock received in the Merger in respect of a single
distribution period or fail to receive a dividend on either CCPT V Common
Stock or CMFT Common Stock received in the Merger in respect of a single
distribution period or (ii) do not receive both a dividend permitted by the
proviso to _Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)(iii)_ on CMFT Common Stock and a dividend
permitted by the proviso to _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)(iii)_ on CCPT V Common
Stock received in the Merger or fail to receive either a dividend permitted by
the proviso to  _Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)(iii)_ on CMFT Common Stock or a
dividend permitted by the proviso to _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)(iii)_ on CCPT V
Common Stock received in the Merger.

 

(b) In the event that either CCPT V or CMFT shall declare or pay any
dividend or other distribution that is expressly permitted pursuant to the
proviso at the end of _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)(iii)_ or _Section_ __ _
6.2(b)(iii)_, respectively, it shall notify the other Party at least twenty
(20) days prior to the Closing Date, and such other Party shall be entitled
to declare a dividend per share payable (i) in the case of CCPT V, to holders
of CCPT V Common Stock, in an amount per share of CCPT V Common Stock equal to
the product of (A) the dividend declared by CMFT with

 



-74- 

    

 respect to each share of CMFT Common Stock by (B) the Exchange Ratio, and
(ii) in the case of CMFT, to holders of CMFT Common Stock, in an amount per
share of CMFT Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the
dividend declared by CCPT V with respect to each share of CCPT V Common Stock
by (B) the Exchange Ratio. The record date and time and payment date and time
for any dividend payable pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.8(b)_ shall be
prior to the Closing Date.

Section 7.9 _Takeover Statutes_. The Parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover
Statute becomes applicable to the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (b) if any such Takeover Statute becomes
applicable to any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover
Statute or the restrictions in the CMFT Charter or the CCPT V Charter on the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

including by executing and delivering the tax representation letters referred
to herein and, unless otherwise required by a final determination within the
meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or a similar determination under
applicable state or local Law), reporting consistently for all federal, state,

become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (together with any related interest, penalties or additions to such

minimize the amount of Transfer Taxes. These taxes shall be the obligations of
CMFT and the CMFT Subsidiaries without deduction or withholding from or to the
Merger Consideration.

 

(e) With respect to the taxable year of CCPT V ending with the Merger
Effective Time, CCPT V shall take all necessary actions, including declaring

credit facilities of CMFT or any CMFT Subsidiary or of the existing credit
facility of CCPT V or of any other debt facility or instrument of CCPT V or
any CCPT V Subsidiary as may be sought by CMFT, in its sole and absolute
discretion. CCPT V shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, refrain from
taking, directly or indirectly, any action that would reasonably be expected
to impair the ability of CMFT to effect such amendment, refinancing or

of the Other Merger Agreements referred to in the foregoing clause (b). In
addition, in the event that CMFT amends the CCIT II Merger Agreement to
include cash consideration as part of the merger consideration payable
thereunder, CMFT agrees to enter into an amendment to this Agreement to
revise the form of Merger Consideration such that the Merger Consideration

TERMINATION, FEES AND EXPENSES, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

 

Section 9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be abandoned at

9.1_):

 

(a) by mutual written consent of each of CMFT and CCPT V;

 

(b) by either CMFT or by CCPT V:

 

(i) if the Merger shall not have occurred on or before 11:59 p.m., New York
City time, on May 30, 2021 (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)(i)_
shall not be available to any Party if the failure of such Party (or, in the
case of CMFT, Merger Sub) to perform or comply in all material respects with
the obligations, covenants or agreements of such Party set forth in this
Agreement shall have been the primary cause of, or resulted in, the failure of
the Merger to be consummated by the Outside Date;

(ii) if any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have
issued an Order permanently restraining or otherwise prohibiting the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such Order shall have become
final and nonappealable; _provided_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to a
Party if the issuance of such final, non-appealable Order was primarily due to
the failure of such Party (or, in the case of CMFT, Merger Sub) to perform or
comply in all material respects with any of its obligations, covenants or
agreements under this Agreement; or

 

(iii) if the Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the
Stockholders Meeting (unless such meeting has been adjourned or postponed, in
which case at the final adjournment or postponement thereof); _provided_ ,
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section_ __ _
9.1(b)(iii)_ shall not be available to a Party if the failure to receive the
Stockholder Approval was primarily due to the failure of a Party to perform or
comply in all material respects with any of its obligations, covenants or
agreements under this Agreement;

 

(c) by CCPT V:

 

(i) if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform or
comply with any obligation, covenant or agreement on the part of CMFT or
Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement has occurred that would cause any of
the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ not
to be satisfied (a " _CMFT Terminating Breach_ "), which breach or failure to
perform or comply cannot be cured, or, if capable of cure, has

 



-81- 

    

 not been cured by the earlier of twenty (20) days following written notice
thereof from CCPT V to CMFT and two (2) Business Days before the Outside Date;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that CCPT V shall not have such right to terminate
this Agreement if a CCPT V Terminating Breach shall have occurred and be
continuing at the time CCPT V delivers notice of its election to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(i)_;

(ii) at any time before Stockholder Approval is obtained, in order to
enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal in accordance with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.3_; _provided_
, _however_ , that CCPT V shall have complied with _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ and
shall have paid or shall concurrently pay to CMFT in full the Termination
Payment in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_; or

 

(iii) if CMFT amends the CCIT II Merger Agreement to (A) increase the
exchange ratio set forth therein to 1.562 shares (or more) of CMFT Common
Stock for each share of Cole Office and Industrial REIT (CCIT II), Inc.

 

(d) by CMFT:

 

(i) if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform or
comply with any obligation, covenant or agreement on the part of CCPT V set
forth in this Agreement has occurred that would cause any of the conditions
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ not to be satisfied
(a " _CCPT V Terminating Breach_ "), which breach or failure to perform or
comply cannot be cured, or if capable of cure, has not been cured by the
earlier of twenty (20) days following written notice thereof from CMFT to CCPT
V and two (2) Business Days before the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that CMFT shall not have such right to terminate this Agreement if a CMFT
Terminating Breach shall have occurred and be continuing at the time CMFT
delivers notice of its election to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)(i)_; or

 

(ii) if, at any time prior to the receipt of the Stockholder Approval, (A)
the CCPT V Board has made an Adverse Recommendation Change, (B) a tender
offer or exchange offer for any shares of CCPT V Common Stock that constitutes
an Acquisition Proposal is commenced and the CCPT V Board fails to recommend
against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the stockholders
of CCPT V and to publicly reaffirm the CCPT V Board Recommendation within ten
(10) Business Days of being requested to do so by CMFT or (C) CCPT V shall
have breached or failed to comply in any material respect with any of its
obligations under _Section_ __ _ 7.3_.

 

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, written notice thereof shall
forthwith be given to the other Parties, in accordance with the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 10.2_, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which
such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of CMFT,
Merger Sub or CCPT V, except that the Confidentiality Agreement and the
provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 4.22_ ( _No Other Representations and
Warranties; Non-Reliance_), _Section_ __ _ 5.21_ ( _No Other Representations
and Warranties; Non-Reliance_), this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, _Section_ __ _
9.3_ ( _Fees and Expenses_ ) and _Article 10_ ( _General Provisions_ ) shall
survive the termination of this Agreement; _provided_ , that no such
termination shall relieve

 



-82- 

    

 any Party from any liability or damages resulting from any intentional and
willful material breach (or failure to perform) that is the consequence of an
act or omission by a Party with the actual knowledge that the taking of such
act (or failure to act) would cause a breach of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_, all Expenses
shall be paid by the Party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not
the Merger is consummated; _provided_ that the Parties will share equally any
Form S-4 filing fees as may be required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

 

(i) by CCPT V or CMFT pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)(i)_ or  _Section_

Proposal with respect to CCPT V has been publicly announced, disclosed or

publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make such an
Acquisition Proposal (and such Acquisition Proposal or intention shall not
have been publicly withdrawn on a bona fide basis without qualification
at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Outside Date (with respect to a
termination pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)(i)_) or the Stockholders
Meeting (with respect to a termination pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
9.1(b)(iii)_)) and (B) within twelve (12) months after the date of such
termination, (I) a transaction in respect of an Acquisition Proposal with
respect to CCPT V is consummated, (II) CCPT V enters into a definitive
agreement in respect of an Acquisition Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal
is actually consummated thereafter, or (III) CCPT V recommends to stockholders
of CCPT V or fails to recommend against an Acquisition Proposal structured as
a tender offer or exchange offer and such Acquisition Proposal is actually
consummated thereafter (with, for all purposes of clause (I), (II) and (III)
of this _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)(i)_, all percentages included in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" increased to 50%), then CCPT V shall pay
to CMFT (1) the Full Termination Payment and (2) up to one million six hundred
seventy thousand dollars ($1,670,000) as reimbursement for CMFTs Expenses;

(ii) by CCPT V pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(ii),_ then CCPT V shall
pay to CMFT an amount equal to (A)(1) the Go Shop Termination Payment if such
termination occurs no later than ten (10) Business days after the Go Shop
Period End Time (or, in the event of timely delivery of a CCPT V
Change Notice, the negotiation period contemplated by _Section_ __ _
7.3(f)(ii)_) or (2) the Full Termination Payment if clause (1) is inapplicable
and (B) up to one million six hundred seventy thousand dollars
($1,670,000) as reimbursement for CMFTs Expenses;

(iii) by CMFT pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)(ii)_, then CCPT V shall

the Go Shop Period End Time (or, in the event of timely delivery of a CCPT V
Change Notice, the negotiation period contemplated by _Section_ __ _
7.3(f)(ii)_) or (2) the Full Termination

 



-83- 

    

 Payment if (1) is inapplicable and (B) up to one million six hundred seventy
thousand dollars ($1,670,000) as reimbursement for CMFTs Expenses;

 

(iv) by CCPT V pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(i), then CMFT shall pay to CCPT V
an amount up to $1,670,000 as reimbursement for CCPT Vs Expenses; or

(v) by CMFT pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(i), then CCPT V shall pay to CMFT
an amount up to one million six hundred seventy thousand dollars ($1,670,000)
as reimbursement for CMFTs Expenses.

 

(c) _Termination Payment_. The Parties agree and acknowledge that in no
event shall CCPT V be required to pay the applicable Termination Payment on
more than one occasion. Payment of the Termination Payment and reimbursement
of Expenses, as applicable, shall be made by wire transfer of same day funds
to the account or accounts designated by CMFT, (i) in the case of any amount
payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)(i)_, immediately prior to or
concurrently with the earlier of (A) the execution of definitive documentation
providing for any transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal and (B)
the consummation of any Acquisition Proposal; (ii) immediately prior to or
concurrently with termination in the case of any amount payable pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)(ii)_ or if such day is not a Business Day, no later
than the immediately following Business Day; and (iii) as promptly as
reasonably practicable after termination (and, in any event, within two (2)
Business Days thereof), in the case of any amount payable pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)(iii)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)(iv)_ or _Section_ __ _
9.3(b)(v)_.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the
event that the Termination Payment becomes payable and is paid hereunder,
then such payment (together with any Expenses or other amounts payable
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.3(e)_) shall be
CMFTs and its Affiliates sole and exclusive remedy as liquidated damages
for any and all losses or damages of any nature against CCPT V and the CCPT V
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives in respect of this
Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith, and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

(e) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that without these agreements, the other Parties would not
enter into this Agreement. In the event that CCPT V shall fail to pay the
applicable Termination Payment when due, CCPT V shall reimburse CMFT for all
reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by CMFT (including
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection
under and enforcement of this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_. Further, if one Party to
this Agreement (the " _Termination Payor_ ") fails to timely pay any amount
due to the other Party (the " _Termination Payee_ ") pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 9.3(b)_ and, in order to obtain the payment, the Termination Payee
commences an Action that results in a judgment against the Termination Payor
for the payment set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 9.3_, the Termination
Payor shall pay to the Termination Payee its reasonable and documented costs
and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in
connection with such Action, together with interest on such amount at a rate
per annum equal to the prime rate published in the Wall Street Journal in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date of
payment.

 



-84- 

    

(f) If the Termination Payor becomes obligated to pay a fee under this
_Section_ __ _ 9.3_, then, if requested by the Termination Payee, the
Termination Payor shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the
applicable Termination Payment with an escrow agent selected by the
Termination Payee, after reasonable consultation with the Termination Payor,
and pursuant to a written escrow agreement (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ")
reflecting the terms set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.3(f)_ and
otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Termination Payor and the escrow
agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the applicable Termination
Payment shall be made by CCPT V in accordance with the timing set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 9.3(c)_ or, at the Termination Payees reasonable request,
promptly after receipt of notice from the Termination Payee that the Escrow
Agreement has been executed by the parties thereto. The Escrow Agreement shall
provide that the Termination Payment in escrow or the applicable portion
thereof shall be released to the Termination Payee on an annual basis based
upon the delivery by the Termination Payee to the escrow agent of any one (or
a combination) of the following:

 

(i) a letter from the Termination Payees independent certified public
accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow
agent to the Termination Payee without causing the Termination Payee to fail
to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the
applicable taxable year of the Termination Payee determined as if the payment
of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections
856(c)(2)(A)-(I) or 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code (such income, " _Qualifying
REIT Income_ "), in which case the escrow agent shall release to the
Termination Payee such maximum amount stated in the accountants letter;

 

(ii) a letter from the Termination Payees counsel indicating that the
Termination Payee received a private letter ruling from the IRS holding that
the receipt by the Termination Payee of the applicable Termination Payment
would either constitute Qualifying REIT Income or would be excluded from gross
income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in which
case the escrow agent shall release to the Termination Payee the remainder of
the applicable Termination Payment; or

 

(iii) a letter from the Termination Payees counsel indicating that the
Termination Payee has received a tax opinion from the Termination Payees
outside counsel or accountant, respectively, to the effect that the receipt by
the Termination Payee of the applicable Termination Payment should either
constitute Qualifying REIT Income or should be excluded from gross income
within the meaning of Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in which case the
escrow agent shall release to the Termination Payee the remainder of the
applicable Termination Payment.

 

If the Termination Payee is CCPT V, the Escrow Agreement shall further provide
that, at the end of the third calendar year beginning after the date on which
the Termination Payors obligation to pay the Termination Payment arose (or
earlier if directed by the Termination Payee), any remaining amount then being
held in escrow by the escrow agent shall be disbursed to the
Termination Payor and, in the event the Termination Payment has not by then
been paid in full, such unpaid portion shall never be due. The Parties agree
to cooperate in good faith to amend this _Section_ __ _ 9.3(f)_ at the
reasonable request of the Termination Payee in order to (A) maximize the
portion of the applicable Termination Payment that may be distributed to the
Termination Payee hereunder without causing the Termination Payee to fail to
meet the 

 



-85- 

    

 requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (B) improve the
Termination Payees chances of securing the favorable private letter ruling
from the IRS described in this  _Section_ __ _ 9.3(f)_ or (C) assist the
Termination Payee in obtaining the favorable tax opinion from its outside
counsel or accountant described in this _Section_ __ _ 9.3(f)_. The Escrow
Agreement shall provide that the Termination Payee shall bear all costs and
expenses under the Escrow Agreement. The Termination Payor shall not be a
party to the Escrow Agreement and shall not bear any liability, cost or
expense resulting directly or indirectly from the Escrow Agreement (other
than any Taxes imposed on the Termination Payor in connection therewith).

Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present
or future Law, or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be
fully separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if

Section 10.5 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement (including the Exhibit, Schedules, the CMFT Disclosure Letter and
the CCPT V Disclosure Letter) and the Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute
the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter
of this Agreement and (b) except for the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ (
_Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_ ), which,
from and after the Merger Effective Time, shall be for the benefit of the
Indemnified Parties, are not intended to confer upon any Person other than the
Parties hereto any rights or remedies. The representations and warranties in
this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties and any
inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by
the Parties in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 10.6_ without notice or
liability to any other Person. Consequently, Persons other than the Parties
may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 10.6 _Amendment; Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the
Merger Effective Time, the Parties may, to the extent permitted under
applicable Law and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) amend any

inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other Party
contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement or (d) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained in this Agreement. Any such amendment of this Agreement shall be
valid only if specifically set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of all Parties. Any such grant by a Party of an extension or waiver in
respect of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid only if specifically
set forth in an instrument in writing by such Party. The failure of any Party
to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights. The rights and
remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights
or remedies provided by Law, except to the extent expressly
provided otherwise in _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ ( _Fees and Expenses_ ).

Section 10.7 _Governing Law; Venue_.

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of actions (whether at Law, in
contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or related to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement,
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State
of Maryland without giving effect to its conflicts of laws principles
(whether the State of Maryland or any other jurisdiction that would cause the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Maryland).

 

(b) All disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be
heard and determined exclusively in any Maryland state or federal court. Each
of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any such Maryland state or federal court for the
purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by
any Party, (ii) agrees not to commence any such Action except in such courts,
(iii) agrees that any claim in respect of any Action may be heard and
determined in any such Maryland state or federal court, (iv) waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,

 



-88- 

    

 any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any such Action, (v) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such dispute
and (vi) agrees, with respect to any Action filed in a Maryland state court,
to jointly request an assignment to the Maryland Business and Technology Case
Management Program. Each of the Parties agrees that a final judgment in any
such dispute shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each Party
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in _Section_ __ _ 10.2_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of
any Party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 

Section 10.8 _Assignment_. Except as may be required to satisfy the
obligations contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ _(_ _ _Indemnification;
Directors__ _ ___ _ _and Officers__ _ ___ _ _Insurance__ _)_ , neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this
Agreement shall be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of
Law or otherwise, by any of the Parties without the prior written consent of
the other Parties. This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and
assigns, and any attempted or purported assignment or delegation in violation
of this _Section_ __ _ 10.8_ shall be null and void.

 

Section 10.9 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the effective time of any
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article 9_ , each Party shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, and
each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which such Party is entitled at Law or in equity. In the event that
any Action should be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this
Agreement, no Party shall allege, and each Party hereby waives the defense,
that there is an adequate remedy at law. To the extent any Party brings an
Action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of
this Agreement (other than an Action to specifically enforce any provision
that survives termination of this Agreement) when expressly available to such
Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Outside Date shall
automatically be extended to (a) the twentieth (20th) Business Day following
the resolution of such Action, or (b) such other time period established by
the court presiding over such Action.

 

Section 10.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY and
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY INSTRUMENT
OR OTHER DOCUMENT DELIVERED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY (a) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (b) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS

 



-89- 

    

 CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER AND THAT IT MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (c) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION_ __ _ 10.10_.

 

Section 10.11 _Authorship_. The Parties agree that the terms and language
of this Agreement are the result of negotiations between the Parties and
their respective advisors and, as a result, there shall be no presumption that
any ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved against any Party. Any
controversy over construction of this Agreement shall be decided without
regard to events of authorship or negotiation.

 



-90- 

    

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Agreement to be signed by
their respective duly authorized officers, all as of the date first written
above.
