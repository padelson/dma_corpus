ARTICLE II

 

PURCHASE AND SALE

2.1 _Purchase and Sale of the Shares_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing the Seller shall sell the Shares
to the Purchaser and the Purchaser shall purchase the Shares from the Seller.
The purchase price for the Shares shall be $300,000,000 in cash (the "
_Purchase Price_ "). The Purchase Price shall be paid as provided in Section
2.3 and shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.4. The
purchase and sale of the Shares is referred to herein as the " _Acquisition_
".

 

2.2 _Closing Date_. The closing of the Acquisition (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP, 101 Park Avenue,
New York, NY, at 10:00 a.m. on the third Business Day after satisfaction (or
waiver as provided herein) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other
than those conditions that by their nature will be satisfied at the Closing),
or such other time, date or place as shall be agreed in writing by the
parties. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the "
_Closing Date_."

 

2.3 _Transactions to be Effected at the Closing_.

(a) At the Closing, the Purchaser shall deliver (i) the Purchase Price, _plus_
or _minus_ (ii) an amount equal to an estimate, prepared in good faith by
Seller and delivered to the Purchaser in a written statement (the "
_Estimated Net Working Capital Statement_ ") at least three Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, of the excess of Net Working Capital as of 11:59
p.m. on the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date (the "
_Estimated Net Working Capital_ ") over $0 (the " _Net Working Capital Target_
") or excess of the Net Working Capital Target over the Estimated Net Working
Capital, respectively, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated in writing by the Seller to the Purchaser no
fewer than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

(b) At the Closing, the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser certificates
representing the Shares, duly endorsed by the Seller for transfer to the
Purchaser or accompanied by separate stock powers attached thereto and signed
in blank.

 



9 (c) At the Closing, the Purchaser and the Seller shall execute and deliver to
each other the Transition Services Agreement.

2.4 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. The Purchase Price shall be subject to
adjustment after the Closing Date as follows:

(a) Within 90 days following the Closing Date, the Purchaser will prepare, or
cause to be prepared, and deliver to the Seller an unaudited statement (the "
_Closing Net Working Capital Statement_ "), which shall set forth the
Purchasers good faith calculation of the Net Working Capital as of 11:59 p.m.
on the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date (" _Closing Net
Working Capital_ "). The Closing Net Working Capital Statement shall be
prepared in accordance with the accounting principles, practices,
methodologies and policies set forth on  _Section 1.1(b) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule_ and, in accordance with GAAP. After the Closing Date, at
the Purchasers request, the Seller shall assist the Purchaser and its
representatives in the preparation of the Closing Net Working Capital
Statement, shall provide the Purchaser and its representatives with any
information reasonably requested by them and shall give them reasonable
access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the
personnel, properties, books and records of the Seller for such purpose.

(b) Upon receipt from the Purchaser, the Seller shall have 30 days to review
the Closing Net Working Capital Statement (the " _Review Period_ "). If the
Seller disagrees with the Purchasers computation of Closing Net Working
Capital, the Seller may, on or prior to the last day of the Review Period,
deliver a notice to the Purchaser (the " _Notice of Objection_ "), which sets
forth its objection to the Purchasers calculation of Closing Net Working
Capital. Any Notice of Objection shall specify those items or amounts with
which the Seller disagrees, together with a reasonably detailed written
explanation of the reasons for disagreement with each such item or amount, and
shall set forth the Sellers calculation of Closing Net Working Capital.
The parties hereto acknowledge that (x) the sole purpose of the determination
of Closing Net Working Capital is to adjust the Purchase Price so as to
reflect the difference between the Closing Net Working Capital and the Net
Working Capital Target and (y) the calculation of the Closing Net Working
Capital is to be made on a basis consistent with the calculation of the Net
Working Capital Target using the same accounting principles, practices,
methodologies and policies.

 

(c) Unless the Seller delivers the Notice of Objection to the Purchaser within
the Review Period, the Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the
purchasers calculation of Closing Net Working Capital and the Closing Net
Working Capital Statement shall be final, conclusive and binding on all
parties hereto. If the Seller delivers the Notice of Objection to the
Purchaser within the Review Period, the Purchaser and the Seller shall,
during the 30 days following such delivery or any mutually agreed extension
thereof, use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the
disputed items and amounts in order to determine the amount of Closing Net
Working Capital. If, at the end of such period or any mutually agreed
extension thereof, the Purchaser and the Seller are unable to resolve their
disagreements, they shall jointly retain and refer their disagreements to a
nationally recognized independent public accounting firm mutually acceptable
to the Purchaser and the Seller (the " _Independent_

 



10   __ _Accounting Firm_ "). If the Purchaser and the Seller are unable so to
agree, each shall select a nationally recognized independent accounting firm
and those two firms shall select a third such firm, in which event "
_Independent Accounting Firm_ " shall mean the third such firm. The parties
shall instruct the Independent Accounting Firm promptly to review this Section
2.4 and to determine solely with respect to the disputed items and amounts so
submitted whether and to what extent, if any, the Closing Net Working Capital
set forth in the Closing Net Working Capital Statement requires adjustment.
The Independent Accounting Firm shall base its determination solely on
written submissions by the Purchaser and the Seller and not on an independent
review. The Purchaser and the Seller shall make available to the Independent
Accounting Firm all relevant books and records and other items reasonably
requested by the Independent Accounting Firm. As promptly as practicable, but
in no event later than 45 days after its retention, the Independent Accounting
Firm shall deliver to the Purchaser and the Seller a report which sets forth
its resolution of the disputed items and amounts and its calculation of
Closing Net Working Capital; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
Closing Net Working Capital as determined by the Independent Accounting Firm
be more than the Sellers calculation set forth in the Estimated Net Working
Capital Statement nor less than the Purchasers calculation of Closing Net
Working Capital set forth in the Closing Net Working Capital Statement. The
decision of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be final, conclusive and
binding on the parties. The Purchaser and the Seller shall each pay their own
costs and expenses incurred under this Section 2.4; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Independent Accounting Firm shall allocate, and the Purchaser and
the Seller shall pay, its fees, costs and expenses between the Purchaser and
the Seller in accordance with the percentage which the portion of the
contested amount not awarded to the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Seller, on the other hand, bears to the amount actually contested by or on
behalf of such parties.

(d) Within three Business Days after Closing Net Working Capital has been
finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.4:

(i) if the Closing Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated Net Working
Capital, the Sellers shall pay to the Purchaser, as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price, in the manner provided in Section 2.4(e), an amount of cash
equal to the difference between the Estimated Net Working Capital and Closing
Net Working Capital; or

(ii) if the Closing Net Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Net Working
Capital, the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller, in the manner provided in
Section 2.4(e), an amount of cash equal to the difference between the Closing
Net Working Capital and the Estimated Net Working Capital. 

(e) Any payment required to be made pursuant to Section 2.4(d) shall be made
by the party required to make such payment by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by the party entitled to
receive such payment at least one Business Day prior to such transfer.

(ii) shall contest, administratively or in

 



28  court, any ruling, order or other action of any Governmental Entity or any
other Person respecting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
provided that the Purchaser shall pursue any of foregoing actions described
in this clause (ii) only upon the express and affirmative consent of the
Seller.

(d) The parties hereto shall instruct their respective counsel to cooperate
with each other and use their respective best efforts to facilitate and
expedite the identification and resolution of any issues arising under the HSR
Act and the any Other Antitrust Laws at the earliest practicable dates. Such
best efforts and cooperation include, but are not limited to such counsels
undertaking (i) promptly to inform the other parties hereto of any oral
communication with, and provide copies of written communications with, any
Governmental Entity regarding any such filings or applications or any such
transaction, and (ii) to confer with each other regarding appropriate contacts
with and response to personnel of such Governmental Entity. No party hereto
shall independently participate in any meeting or discussion with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any such filings, applications,
investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party hereto
prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by the relevant
Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend and participate (which, at
the request of any of the parties, shall be limited to outside antitrust
counsel only).

 

5.4 _Notification_. The Seller has the right to notify the Purchaser of the
existence or happening of any fact, event or occurrence which, if existing or
known as of this date hereof, would have been required to be set forth or
described in the Seller Disclosure Schedule. No such notice shall be deemed to
supplement or amend the Seller Disclosure Schedules; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that if such fact, event or occurrence would constitute a breach of any
representation or warranty such that the condition set forth in Section 6.2(a)
would not be satisfied, and the Closing occurs, the Seller
Disclosure Schedule will be deemed supplemented or amended by such notice for
purposes of Article VIII.

5.5 _Non-Solicit_. 

(a) The Seller agrees that it and its Subsidiaries shall not (and shall cause
their respective Affiliates not to), for a period of two years immediately
following the Closing Date, solicit, entice or induce for itself or any other
Person, the services or employment of any Person who was an employee or
independent contractor (other than guides) of the Company or any Subsidiary
thereof on the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that advertisements by
way of newspapers, magazines, trade publications, internet or other general
media or executive search not specifically directed at any such Person shall
not constitute a violation of this provision.

(b) With respect to guides, the Seller agrees that it and its Subsidiaries
shall not (and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to), for a period
of two years immediately following the Closing Date entice or induce, for
itself or any other Person, any guide to terminate its services with
the Company.

 



29 5.6 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) The Purchaser acknowledges that the information being provided to it in
connection with the consummation of the Acquisition is subject to the terms
of a confidentiality agreement dated as of August 21, 2012 between the
Purchaser and the Seller (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms of
which are incorporated herein by reference. Effective upon the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect to information relating
solely to the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Purchaser acknowledges that
all other information made available to it by the Seller or any Affiliate
thereof or their respective representatives concerning the Seller or any of
their Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall remain
subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement after the
Closing Date.

 

(b) For a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the date hereof, the Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates and representatives to, maintain in confidence any written, oral or
other information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries obtained by
virtue of the Sellers ownership thereof prior to the Closing

 

5.7 _Support Services_. Except as set forth in the Transition Services
Agreement, the Purchaser agrees that as of the Closing Date, the Seller and
its respective Affiliates shall have no obligation to provide any support or
other services to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any of the
services for which allocations were previously paid by the Company). 

5.8 _Resignations_. On the Closing Date, the Seller shall cause to be
delivered to the Purchaser duly signed resignations, effective as of the
Closing, of all directors of their position as a director of the Company;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such resignation by any individual shall be a
resignation from employment with the Company if such individual is so
employed unless the Purchaser so requests.

5.9 _Consents_. The Purchaser acknowledges that certain consents and waivers
with respect to the Acquisition may be required from parties to Contracts to
which the Seller or its Affiliates is a party and that such consents and
waivers have not been obtained as of the date hereof. Provided that the
Seller is in compliance with the terms of this Section 5.9, the Purchaser
agrees that the Seller and its Affiliates shall have no liability to the
Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof (including, following the Closing, the
Company) arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consents or
waivers that may be required in connection with the Acquisition or the
termination of any Contract as a result thereof. The Purchaser acknowledges
that the Closing is not conditioned on the Seller or the Purchaser obtaining
any such consents or waivers. Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with the Purchaser, upon the request
of the Purchaser, in any commercially reasonable manner in connection with
the Purchaser obtaining any such consents and waivers in order for such
Contracts to remain in full force and effect following the Closing; _provided_
, _however_ , that such cooperation shall not include any requirement of the
Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the Company) to expend money,
commence, defend or participate in any litigation or offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party.

 



30 5.10 _Public Announcements_. Neither the Purchaser nor the Seller nor any of
their respective Affiliates shall, without the approval of the other party,
issue any press releases or otherwise make any public statements with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby, except as may be required by
applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any
national securities exchange or stock market, in which case the party required
to make the release or announcement shall allow the other party with as much
time as practicable to comment on such release or announcement in advance of
such issuance.

5.11 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) All Transfer Taxes arising out of or in connection with the transactions
effected pursuant to this Agreement shall be borne one-half by the Purchaser
and one-half by the Seller when due, and each party shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the other party and its respective Affiliates with respect
to such Transfer Taxes for which such party is responsible hereunder.
The Purchaser shall file all necessary documentation and Tax Returns with
respect to such Transfer Taxes, and, if required by applicable Law, the Seller
will, and will cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax
Returns and documentation.

(b) The Seller shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of (i) all
Tax Returns required by Law to be filed by the Company, or which include the
Company, for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date, and (ii)
all Combined Tax Returns for all taxable periods, and (iii) shall pay all Tax
liabilities shown by such Tax Returns to be due. The Seller shall have the
sole right to file amended Tax Returns with respect to the Company or its
Subsidiaries relating to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date;
provided that any such amendment does not materially increase any obligations
of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof with respect to Taxes for a Post-
Closing Period or materially affect any Tax attribute of the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof for a Post-Closing Period. The Seller shall retain any
refunds received for Taxes paid for Pre-Closing Periods with respect to the
Company or its Subsidiaries, along with any interest related thereto, and any
such refunds received by the Company after the Closing shall be paid promptly
to the Seller, along with any interest related thereto. The Purchaser and the
Company shall retain all other refunds received for Taxes with respect to the
Company or its Subsidiaries, along with any interest related thereto.

 

(c) The Purchaser shall file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns of, or that
include, the Company or its Subsidiaries, and that are not described in
Section 5.11(b) and shall pay all Tax liabilities shown by such Tax Returns to
be due. The Purchaser shall provide a substantially complete and accurate
draft of each Straddle Period Tax Return to the Seller no later than 20
Business Days prior to the due date for such Tax Return (including any
extension thereof) for the review and approval of the Seller, such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld. Not later than five Business Days before the
due date for any Straddle Period Tax Return (including any extension
thereof), the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser the portion of the Taxes set
forth on such Tax Return that are allocable to the Pre-Closing Period (under
principles set forth in Sections 5.11(d) and (e)), net of any payments made
prior to the Closing Date in respect of such Taxes, whether as estimated Taxes
or otherwise.

 



31 (d) If the Company or its Subsidiaries are permitted but not required under
applicable Tax Laws to treat the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable
period for any applicable Tax, then the parties hereto shall cause the Company
or such Subsidiary, as applicable, to treat that day as the last day of a
taxable period. In the case of Taxes arising in a taxable period of the
Company or a Subsidiary that includes but does not end on the Closing Date,
except as provided in Section 5.11(e), the allocation of such Taxes between
the Pre-Closing Period and the Post-Closing Period shall be made on the basis
of an interim closing of the books as of the end of the Closing Date.

(e) In the case of (i) franchise Taxes based on capitalization, debt or
shares of stock authorized, issued or outstanding and (ii) ad valorem Taxes,
in either case attributable to any taxable period that includes but does not
end on the Closing Date, the portion of such Taxes attributable to the Pre-
Closing Period shall be the amount of such Taxes for the entire taxable
period, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in such taxable period ending on and including the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the entire number of calendar days in such
taxable period.

(f) Each party hereto shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates
to, provide to each of the other parties hereto such cooperation and
information as any of them reasonably may request in filing any Tax Return,
amended Tax Return or claim for refund, determining a liability for Taxes or
a right to refund of Taxes or in conducting any audit or other proceeding in
respect of Taxes. Such cooperation and information shall include providing
copies of all relevant portions of relevant Tax Returns, together with
relevant accompanying schedules and relevant work papers, relevant documents
relating to rulings or other determinations by taxing authorities and relevant
records concerning the ownership and Tax basis of property, which any such
party may possess. Each party shall make its employees reasonably available on
a mutually convenient basis at its cost to provide explanation of any
documents or information so provided.

 

(g) The Purchaser shall not make an election under Section 338(g) of the Code
with respect to its purchase of the stock of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code with Respect
to Consumersearch. The Purchaser will be responsible for any Taxes
attributable to any action taken by the Purchaser, its Affiliates or
the Company or its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date following the time of the
Closing outside the ordinary course of business, other than any actions
expressly contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(h) Prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall terminate any and all
agreements (except as noted in _Section 3.7(d) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule_) providing for the allocation of Taxes between the Company or its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Person other than the Company or its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, such that neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall have any obligations thereunder following the Closing

 



32 5.12 _Procedures Relating to Tax Claims_.

 

(a) The Seller shall, at its own expense, control any audit of or proceeding
involving any Tax of the Company or its Subsidiaries if such claim either (i)
relates solely to a Pre-Closing Period or (ii) relates to a Combined Tax
Return and, without limiting the foregoing, may in its sole discretion pursue
or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings
and conferences with any Taxing Authority with respect thereto and may, in
its sole discretion, either pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where
applicable Law permits such refund suits or contest the Tax Claim in any
permissible manner; provided that any such pursuit (or decision to forgo such
pursuit), payment, contest or other action in connection therewith does not
materially increase any obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof
with respect to Taxes for a Post-Closing Period or materially affect any Tax
attribute of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof for a Post-Closing Period;
_provided_ , _further_ , that in the event that the Seller receives a claim
for Taxes or a notice of a pending or threatened audit from any Taxing
Authority in writing (a " _Tax Claim_ ") with respect to a Tax Return (other
than a Combined Tax Return) that relates to the Company or a Subsidiary for
any such period, the Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser of such Tax Claim
and of any action taken or proposed to be taken. In the event that the
Purchaser wishes to participate (but not control the conduct of) in such audit
or proceeding relating solely to the Company and its Subsidiaries, it may do
so at its own expense.

(b) The Purchaser shall, at its own expense (subject to the Sellers
indemnification obligation under Section 8.2), control any audit of or
proceeding not described in Section 5.12(a); _provided_ , _however_ , that in
the event that the Purchaser receives a Tax Claim or a notice of a Tax Claim
with respect to a Tax Return that relates to the Company or its Subsidiaries
for a Tax period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall promptly notify the Seller of such Tax Claim and of any action taken or
proposed to be taken and shall describe the asserted Tax liability in
reasonable detail and provide to the Seller copies of any notice or other
document received from any Taxing Authority in respect of such asserted Tax
liability. In the event that the Seller wishes to participate in such audit
or proceeding, it may do so at its own expense. Purchaser shall not, without
the Sellers consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), settle or compromise such Tax Claim.

 

(c) If the Purchaser, the Seller or their respective Affiliates, as the case
may be, receives a notice with respect to a Tax Claim for which the other
party is responsible hereunder, such party shall promptly provide the
Purchaser or the Seller, as the case may be, with a copy of such notice as
appropriate.

(d) If there is a conflict relating to the procedures set forth in Sections
8.4 and 8.5 and the procedures set forth in Sections 5.11 and 5.12, the
procedures set forth in Sections 5.11 and 5.12 shall govern with respect to
Tax matters.

 



33 5.13 _Section 338(h)(10) Election; Election Allocations_.

 

(a) The Purchaser and the Seller shall, or shall cause their Affiliates to,
join in making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations and any corresponding or similar elections under state,
local or foreign tax law (collectively, the " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_")
with respect to the Company. Seller will pay any Taxes resulting from the
making of the Section 338(h)(10) Election. No Section 338(h)(10) Election
shall be made with respect to Consumersearch.

(b) For the purpose of making the Section 338(h)(10) Election for federal
income tax purposes, on or prior to the Closing Date, the Purchaser and the
Seller each shall deliver to the other an executed original IRS Form 8023 (or
successor form). The Purchaser will file the IRS Form 8023 with the IRS at
least 30 days prior to the due date of such form, and the Purchaser will
provide the Seller a copy of such filing. 

(c) The Purchaser shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of all
forms and documents required to effectuate the Section 338(h)(10) Election.
In addition to the IRS Form 8023, the Seller shall execute (or cause to be
executed) and deliver to the Purchaser such additional documents or forms as
are reasonably requested to complete properly the Section 338(h)(10) Election
at least 60 days prior to the date such Section 338(h)(10) Election is
required to be filed.

(d) The Purchaser and the Seller shall file, and shall cause their Affiliates
to file, all Tax Returns and statements, forms and schedules in connection
therewith in a manner consistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Election and
shall take no position contrary thereto unless required to do so by applicable
laws.

(e) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall provide to the
Seller a statement (the " _Allocation Statement_ ") allocating the Purchase
Price or any other items that are treated as additional Purchase Price for
tax purposes among the Company and its Subsidiaries and among the different
items of assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Purchaser shall
provide the Seller a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Allocation Statement and cooperate in good faith with the Seller to resolve
any disagreement relating to the calculations or allocations set forth in the
Allocation Statement. If an Agreement is reached with respect to the
Allocation Statement, Purchaser and Seller shall file all Tax Returns (such
as IRS Form 8883 or any other forms required to be filed pursuant to Section
338 of the Code or any comparable provisions of Law) in a manner that is
consistent with the Allocation Statement and refrain from taking any action
inconsistent therewith. If the Purchaser and Seller do not reach an agreement
with respect to the Allocation Statement, the Purchaser and Seller shall file
their respective Tax Returns in the manner each party in good faith
deems appropriate.

 



34 5.14 _Employment Matters_.

 

(a) With respect to the Employees, the Purchaser agrees: (i) for the 12 month
period following the Closing Date, to provide (x) annual base salary or base
wages, and cash incentive compensation opportunities that are no less
favorable than the amount of such annual base salary or base wages and cash
incentive compensation opportunities (excluding change in control, retention
or any similar arrangements) provided to the Employees immediately prior to
the Closing Date (it being understood that, as it relates to sales Employees,
sales quotas/targets for 2013 may be set or adjusted in the
Purchasers discretion), and (y) employee benefits that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate as to those provided to similarly situated
employees of Purchaser; (ii) for the calendar year including the Closing Date,
to waive any limitations regarding pre-existing conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods under any plan that provides for medical benefits maintained
by the Purchaser or any of their Affiliates for the benefit of such Employee
to the extent waived or satisfied under the applicable corresponding Company
Benefit Plan or Seller Benefit Plan; (iii) for all purposes under all benefit
plans of the Purchaser or its Affiliates, including, but not limited to, any
plan that provides for vacation, paid-time-off or severance benefits, in
which such Employee is eligible to participate, to treat all service by the
Employee provided to the Company before the Closing Date as service provided
to the Company, the Purchaser and their Affiliates, excluding
benefit accruals under defined benefit pension plans and (iv) to recognize
any unused sick, vacation or personal leave days that such Employee has
accrued as of the Closing Date for purposes of the vacation plan or policies
of the Purchaser or its Affiliates.

(b) Without limiting the scope of Section 5.14(a), should the employment of
any Employee be terminated during the 12 month period following the Closing
(i) by the Purchaser or its Affiliates, or (ii) by the Employee on account of
a relocation without consent of his or her principal place of employment to a
location that increases his or her commuting distance by 50 miles or more, or
on account of a change in his or her position such that it is no longer
comparable to the position held immediately prior to the Closing, the
Purchaser shall provide such Employee severance payments and benefits in an
amount no less than that to which the Employee would have been entitled
pursuant to the terms of the severance pay plan applicable to such employee
immediately prior to the Closing (taking into account both pre-Closing
and post-Closing service performed by such Employee, and without regard to
the ability of the plan administrator thereunder to reduce the severance
levels).

(c) On or immediately prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall, or shall cause
any applicable Subsidiary of Seller or other Affiliate of Seller to, fully
vest the unvested account balances of the Employees who participated in The
New York Times Companies Pension Plan and The New York Times Company Savings
Restoration Plan as of immediately prior to the Closing. As soon as
practicable after the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause to be maintained
for the benefit of the Employees a defined contribution plan intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code which includes a qualified cash or
deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the "
_Purchaser s 401(k) Plan_"). As soon as practicable thereafter, and if
requested by an Employee, the Seller or one of its Affiliates shall take all
actions necessary to initiate a transfer of eligible rollover distributions
as defined in section 401(a)(31) of

 



35  the Code, from the tax-qualified 401(k) plan maintained by the Seller or its
Affiliates in which the Employees participate, to the Purchasers 401(k) Plan,
and the Purchaser shall cause its 401(k) Plan to accept such rollover.
Individual account balances shall be valued as of the date of transfer, and
the transfer shall be in cash, except that outstanding loan balances shall be
transferred in the form of notes or other documentation evidencing such
loans.

(d) As soon as practicable after the Closing, and in accordance with the terms
of the Transition Services Agreement, the Purchaser shall cause the Company
to be responsible for all health, disability and workers compensation claims
in respect of the Employees or former employees of the Company (or their
beneficiaries and dependents) that would otherwise be covered under a Seller
Benefit Plan, Company Benefit Plan or a workers compensation policy of the
Seller or its Affiliates. The Purchaser shall also cause the Company to be
responsible for the provision of "COBRA" coverage under part 6 of Title I of
ERISA with respect to the Employees or former employees of the Company (or
their beneficiaries and dependents), regardless of when the "qualifying event"
occurred.

 

(e) No provision of this Agreement is intended to or will create any third
party beneficiary rights to any person, including any Employee, any
representative of an Employee, or any dependent of such an Employee,
including, without limitation, with respect to continued employment or resumed
employment, employee benefits or any other matter.

 

(f) Neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall adopt, become a
sponsoring employer of, or, except as otherwise provided in Section 5.14(d),
have any liabilities or obligations with respect to the Seller Benefit Plans.

5.15 _Further Action_.

(a) From and after the Closing Date each of the Purchaser and the Seller
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute and deliver
such documents and other papers and take such further actions as may be
reasonably required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and give effect to the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby. Subject to the terms of the Transition Services Agreement: (i)
all cash and other remittances, mail and other communications relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries received by the Seller or its Affiliates
shall be promptly turned over to the Purchaser by the Seller; and (ii) all
cash and other remittances, mail and other communications relating to the
Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) received by the Purchaser shall be promptly turned over to the
Seller by the Purchaser.

(b) For a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the date hereof, the Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain all books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries relating to periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date and
shall make them, and any individuals responsible for the preparation and
maintenance of such books and records, available to the Seller as reasonably
requested. If at any time after the Closing, the Seller reasonably requires a
copy of any such book or record, it shall have the right to promptly obtain a
copy thereof (at the Sellers cost) from the Purchaser.

 



36 5.16 _Non-Competition_. The Seller agrees that it and its Subsidiaries shall
not (and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to), for a period of two
years immediately following the Closing Date, directly or indirectly,
singularly or in the aggregate, anywhere in the world, own or control any
ownership interests of, or otherwise run, manage, operate, direct, control or
participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of, any
Competing Business other than an ownership interest of not more than 5% in the
aggregate in any Person that is a Competing Business. " _Competing Business_
" means any business engaged in the production at scale of content created by
subject matter experts writing original content in their individual areas of
expertise (e.g., "how-to" content), primarily for digital distribution, and
operating on an economic model that incentivizes the creators for increased
page views, engagement and/or monetization. For avoidance of doubt, "Competing
Business" shall not include (i) any website that is the internet version of
any print media equivalent produced by the Seller or its Affiliates (e.g., the
online version of a newspaper or magazine such as nytimes.com) or (ii) any
other internet site owned or operated by the Seller or its Affiliates on the
date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that the terms of this Section 5.16 shall in no event restrict the
Seller in any way from acquiring or investing in any Person or business
which is engaged in part in a Competing Business (provided that (A) such
Competing Business does not generate more than either (x) 25% of the total
revenues generated by such Person or business or (y) $25,000,000 or (B) if
such Competing Business does not meet the terms of clause (A) of this
proviso, the Purchaser uses commercially reasonable efforts to sell such
Competing Business promptly and in any event within one year following the
date of such acquisition). 

5.17 _Software License_. Immediately following the Closing, the Purchaser
shall cause the Company to grant to the Seller and its Affiliates a
perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up, non-exclusive,
sublicensable (through multiple tiers solely for the purposes of providing
services to or processing the business of the Seller and its
Affiliates) right and license, effective as of the Closing Date, in, to and
under the SOS System (the " _Licensed Software_ ") for continued internal use
in the respective businesses of the Seller and its Affiliates, including the
right to (a) internally use, reproduce, create derivative works of, perform
and display the Licensed Software and use of the source code form of the
Licensed Software to modify and maintain the Licensed Software. Seller
acknowledges and agrees that all derivative works of the Licensed Software
created by or on behalf of the Seller or its Affiliates are and shall remain
subject to the Companys exclusive ownership of the underlying copyright in
the Licensed Software. The license granted by the Company shall be non
transferrable, except that the Seller and each of its Subsidiaries may
transfer the foregoing rights and licenses to any Person in connection with
the sale, divestiture, merger, reorganization, consolidation or change-in-
control transaction of the business or business unit using the Licensed
Software. The Seller and its Affiliates will keep the source code form of the
Licensed Software confidential and shall disclose it only to their respective
employees, consultants and contractors in order for the Seller and its
Affiliates to internally use, modify and maintain such source code as
permitted in this Section 5.17. Within five Business Days following the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause the Company to confirm in writing to the
Seller that the foregoing license has been granted, such

 



37  writing to be in a format acceptable to the Seller in its sole discretion
(an example of an acceptable writing would be a short written statement,
signed by an officer of the Company, confirming and ratifying the Companys
intention to be bound by the license set forth in this Section 5.17.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Seller and its
Affiliates acknowledge and agree that (x) the Purchaser and its Affiliates
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall have no obligation (whether
express or implied) to deliver, maintain, correct, update, upgrade, test, or
otherwise support any version of the Licensed Software and (y) the
Licensed Software is licensed by the Company to Seller and its Affiliates on
an as-is, where-is basis and without any representations or warranties of any
kind (whether express or implied), including any implied warranties of
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or noninfringement.

5.18 _Exclusivity_. During the term of this Agreement, the Seller agrees that
it and its Subsidiaries shall not, and shall not permit their respective
Affiliates, partners, officers, employees, representatives or agents (if
applicable) to, nor shall they encourage or authorize any individual
(including any partner, officer, employee, representative or agent),
corporation, or other Person, to solicit, encourage or authorize any
individual, corporation or other Person to make any inquiries or offer any
proposals (each an "Acquisition Proposal") relating to the disposition of any
of the Companys or its Subsidiaries business or assets, the direct or
indirect acquisition of the Companys or its Subsidiaries equity interests,
or the merger of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with any other
Person; or negotiate with or entertain any such Acquisition Proposal.

5.19 _Intercompany Obligations_. The Seller and its applicable Affiliates
(other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the
Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall take such action as may
be necessary so that, as of the Closing Date, there shall be no intercompany
rights or obligations, except as contemplated by the Transition Services
Agreement or as set forth on _Section 5.19 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule_.

 

5.20 _Assigned Contracts_. Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall cooperate
with the Purchaser, upon the request of the Purchaser, and use its reasonable
best efforts to (i) cause the Contracts set forth in _Section 5.20 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule_ to be assigned to the Company or (ii) cause the
Company to execute and enter into a new Contract with each counterparty in
the Contracts set forth in _Section 5.20 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_
on substantially similar terms. In the event that, pursuant to the foregoing,
such assignment is not obtained or a new Contract is not entered into with
respect to any Contract set forth in _Section 5.20 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule_, the Seller shall provide the services or benefits of such Contract
to the Company in accordance with the Transition Services Agreement.

5.21 _Company Transition Services_. For a period of up to six months following
the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to
continue to provide to the Seller and its subsidiaries support services in
respect of the SOS System and Blogrunner hosting as described on, and at a
cost to the Seller set forth on, _Section 5.21 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule_ , on terms substantially similar to the terms of the Transition
Services Agreement (the " _Company Transition Services_ "). The specific terms
of the Company Transition Services shall 

 



38  be mutually agreed to by the parties in good faith prior to the Closing and
set out in a transition services agreement to be executed and delivered by the
Company and Seller at the Closing. The Company Transition Services are
currently being provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to Seller and its
other Subsidiaries at a comparable or lesser cost.

ARTICLE VIII

INDEMNIFICATION

 

8.1 _Survival_. The representations and warranties of the parties hereto
contained in this Agreement and (except as expressly set forth therein) any
certificate or other document provided hereunder or thereunder (including the
Ancillary Agreements) will terminate at the Closing, except that (a) except as
provided in clauses (b) and (c) of this Section 8.1, the representations and
warranties set forth in Articles III and IV shall survive in full force and
effect until the date that is 18 months following the Closing Date, (b) the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.13(c),
3.19, 4.1, 4.2, 4.5 and 4.7 (the " _Fundamental Representations_ "), will

41  in Section 3.7 and Section 3.16(c)(i) shall survive until 60 days following
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Notwithstanding the

accordance with the preceding sentence will continue to survive if a Claim

such termination date until the related claim for indemnification has been
satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided in Article VIII, but only with
respect to matters described in such Claim Notice. The covenants and
agreements which by their terms do not contemplate performance after
the Closing shall survive until 60 days following the Closing. The covenants
and agreements which by their terms contemplate performance after the Closing
and expire upon a date certain shall survive until such date certain, and
those which do not expire upon a date certain shall survive the Closing in
accordance with their terms until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations. The parties hereto intend that provisions of this Section 8.1
limit the time in which a claim may be made, regardless of whether a longer
period would be permitted by applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, for the purposes of determining the failure of any
representations or warranties to be true and correct or the breach of any
covenants and agreements, and calculating Losses or a partys indemnification
obligation hereunder, any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar
qualifications in the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
shall be disregarded.

8.2 _Indemnification by the Seller_. Subject to the limitations set forth
herein, following the Closing, the Seller shall indemnify and defend the
Purchaser its Affiliates and (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) and
their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives
(the " _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ ") against, and shall hold the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties harmless from, any loss, liability, claim,
charge, action, suit, proceeding, penalty, damage, expense (including
reasonable fees of attorneys or other expenses incurred in connection with
any Actions related to any claim for indemnification) or Tax (collectively, "
_Losses_ ") resulting from, arising out of, or incurred by any Purchaser
Indemnified Party in connection with (a) any breach of any representation or
warranty of the Seller contained in this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (b) any breach of any covenant or
agreement of the Seller contained in this Agreement, (c) (i) any and all
Taxes imposed on, allocated or attributable to or incurred or payable by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor thereof) for any Pre-
Closing Period; (ii) any and all Taxes imposed on any member of a
consolidated, combined or unitary group of which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or any predecessor thereof) is or was a member on or prior to
the Closing Date, by reason of the liability of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or any predecessor thereof), pursuant to Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-6(a) (or any predecessor or successor thereof or any analogous
or similar provision under state, local or foreign Law); (iii) any failure by
the Seller to timely pay any and all Taxes required to be borne by the Seller
pursuant to Section 5.11(a) (Transfer Taxes); and (iv) any Taxes resulting
from, arising out of or based on the Section 338(h)(10) Election, (d) all
Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (e) all Transaction
Expenses.

8.3 _Indemnification by the Purchaser_. Subject to the limitations set forth
herein, following the Closing the Purchaser shall indemnify and defend the
Seller, its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, agents,
representatives and employees (the " _Seller Indemnified_  

 



42   _Parties_ "), against, and shall hold the Seller harmless from, any Loss
resulting from, arising out of, or incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties
in connection with (a) any breach of any representation or warranty of the
Purchaser contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant
to this Agreement, or (b) any breach of any covenant or agreement of the
Purchaser made in this Agreement, or (c) any failure by the Purchaser to
timely pay any and all Taxes required to be borne by the Purchaser pursuant to
Section 5.11(a) (Transfer Taxes).

8.4 _Indemnification Procedure for Third Party Claims_.

(a) In the event that any claim or demand for which an Indemnitor may be
liable to an Indemnitee hereunder is asserted by a third party (a " _Third
Party Claim_ "), the Indemnitee shall promptly notify the Indemnitor in
writing of such Third Party Claim (such notice, a " _Claim Notice_ ")
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure or delay to so notify the Indemnitor
shall not relieve the Indemnitor of any obligation or liability that the
Indemnitor may have to the Indemnitee unless, and then only to the extent
that, the Indemnitor is materially prejudiced thereby. The Claim Notice shall
(i) state that the Indemnitee has paid or properly accrued Losses or
anticipates that it may incur liability for Losses for which such Indemnitee
is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) specify in
reasonable detail each individual item of Loss included in the amount so
stated, the date such item was paid or properly accrued, the basis for
any anticipated liability and the nature of the breach of representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement to which each such item is related and the
computation of the amount to which such Indemnitee claims to be entitled
hereunder (in each case to the extent determinable). The Indemnitee shall
enclose with the Claim Notice a copy of all papers served with respect to such
Third Party Claim, if any, and any other documents evidencing such Third Party
Claim.

 

(b) The Indemnitor shall have 45 days from the date on which the Indemnitor
received the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnitee that the Indemnitor
desires to assume the defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim and any
litigation resulting therefrom with counsel of its choice and at its sole cost
and expense. If the Indemnitor assumes the defense of such claim
in accordance herewith: (i) the Indemnitee may retain separate co-counsel at
its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of such Third Party
Claim, but the Indemnitor shall control the investigation, defense and
settlement thereof; (ii) the Indemnitee shall not file any papers or consent
to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor; and
(iii) the Indemnitor shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim to the extent such
judgment or settlement provides for equitable relief without the prior written
consent of the Indemnitee (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). The parties shall (subject to the terms hereof) use commercially
reasonable efforts to minimize Losses from Third Party Claims, act in good
faith in responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise dealing with
such claims, and cooperate in any such defense and give each other reasonable
access to and copies of information, records and documents relevant thereto.
Whether or not the Indemnitor has assumed the defense of such Third Party
Claim, the Indemnitor will not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee
hereunder with respect to any settlement entered into or any judgment
consented to without the Indemnitors prior written consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



43  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Indemnitor be entitled
to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, and the Indemnitor in such cases
shall be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of the Indemnitee
in connection with the defense and resolution of such Third Party Claim, if
(i) counsel for Indemnitee reasonably determines that a conflict of interest
exists between the positions of the Indemnitee and Indemnitor, (ii) the Third
Party Claim is criminal in nature or seeks a form of injunctive relief or
(iii) the Third Party Claim expressly seeks an amount that if fully
adjudicated in favor of such third party would be reasonably likely to result
in monetary damages in excess of the Cap. The Indemnitee may take any actions
reasonably necessary to defend such Third Party Claim prior to the time the
Indemnitor assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim hereunder.

 

(c) If the Indemnitor does not assume the defense of such Third Party Claim
within 45 days of receipt of the Claim Notice, the Indemnitee will be
entitled to assume such defense, at its sole cost and expense (or, if the
Indemnitee incurs a Loss with respect to the matter in question for which the
Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2 or 8.3, as
applicable, at the expense of the Indemnitor); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Indemnitor: (i) shall have the right to participate in the defense of the
Third Party Claim at its sole cost and expense, but the Indemnitee shall
control the investigation, defense and settlement thereof; (ii) may at any
time thereafter assume defense of the Third Party Claim (subject to the terms
hereof), in which event the Indemnitor shall bear the reasonable fees, costs
and expenses of the Indemnitees counsel incurred prior to the assumption by
the Indemnitor of defense of the Third Party Claim; and (iii) shall not be
obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder for any settlement entered
into or any judgment consented to without the Indemnitors prior written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the
Indemnitee defends such Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall cooperate with
the Indemnitee and give the Indemnitee reasonable access to and copies of
information, documents and records relevant thereto.

8.5 _Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims_. The Indemnitee
will notify the Indemnitor in writing promptly of its discovery of any matter
for which the Indemnitor may be liable to the Indemnitee hereunder that does
not involve a Third Party Claim, which Claim Notice shall (a) state that the
Indemnitee has paid or properly accrued Losses or anticipates that it will
incur liability for Losses for which such Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, and (b) specify in reasonable
detail each individual item of Loss included in the amount so stated, the date
such item was incurred or paid or properly accrued, the basis for any
anticipated liability and the nature of the breach of
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement to which each such item is
related and the computation of the amount to which the Indemnitee claims to be
entitled hereunder(in each case to the extent determinable). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in no event shall the failure of an Indemnitee to promptly
notify the Indemnitor per the terms of the immediately preceding sentence
affect the Indemnitees rights to be indemnified hereunder, unless (and then
only to the extent that) the Indemnitor is materially prejudiced thereby. In
the event that the Indemnitor does not notify the Indemnitee that it disputes
such claim within 45 days following receipt of such Claim Notice, the claim
specified therein shall be deemed a liability of the Indemnitor hereunder
(subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VIII, as applicable).
The Indemnitee

 



44  shall reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnitor in determining the
validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnitee and in otherwise
resolving such matters. Such assistance and cooperation shall include
providing reasonable access to and copies of information, records and
documents relating to such matters, furnishing employees to reasonably (in the
view of the providing party) assist in the investigation, defense
and resolution of such matters and providing reasonable (in the view of the
providing party) legal and business assistance with respect to such matters.

8.6 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

(a) No party hereto shall be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless
any Person pursuant to this Section 8.2(a): (i) unless a Claim Notice is
timely delivered pursuant to this Article VIII; (ii) unless and until the
aggregate Losses of (A) the Purchaser, in the case of the Seller, with
respect to any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
of the Seller contained in this Agreement, or (B) the Seller, in the case of
the Purchaser, with respect to any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of the Purchaser contained in this Agreement, exceed 1%
of the Purchase Price, after which such party shall be liable only for such
Losses in excess of such amount; and (iii) for any individual items where the
Loss relating thereto is less than $50,000, and such items shall not be
aggregated for purposes of the immediately preceding clause (ii).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in clauses (ii) and
(iii) of the immediately preceding sentence shall not apply to the
obligations of the Seller to indemnify the Persons entitled to indemnification
under Section 8.2(a) in connection with: (i) any claims for indemnification
under Section 8.2(a) relating to Fundamental Representations, (ii) any claim
for indemnification in respect of Taxes, and (iii) any claim for
indemnification based upon fraud or knowing and intentional breach.

 

(b) In no event shall the cumulative indemnification obligations of the
Seller, on the one hand, or the Purchaser, on the other hand, under this
Section 8.2(a) in the aggregate exceed 15% of the Purchase Price (the " _Cap_
"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the limitations set forth
in the immediately preceding sentence be deemed to apply to (i) any claims
for indemnification under Section 8.2(a) relating to Fundamental
Representations (ii) any claim for indemnification based upon fraud or knowing
and intentional breach, or (iii) the obligations of the Seller or
the Purchaser in respect of Taxes.

(c) The amount of Losses payable under this Article VIII by the Indemnitor
shall be reduced (i) by any amounts recovered by the Indemnitee under
insurance policies or from any other Person and (ii) to take account of any
Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnitee during the taxable year such
indemnified amount is paid or during a prior taxable year.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article VIII,
nothing in this Article VIII or otherwise shall preclude or otherwise limit
the right of Person entitled to indemnification hereunder to seek specific
performance or injunctive relief

 



45 (e) No party hereto shall be obligated to indemnify any other Person with
respect to (i) any covenant or condition waived by the other party on or
prior to the Closing, (ii) except to the extent awarded to a Person in an
indemnifiable Third Party Claim any punitive damages, or (iii) any Loss with
respect to any matter to the extent that such matter was raised in the
calculation of the adjustment of the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.4.

8.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that, should
the Closing occur, its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all
matters arising out of, relating to or connected with this Agreement, the
Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be
a claim pursuant to the provisions of this Article VIII (other than
injunctions or other equitable remedies or claims arising from fraud or
knowing and intentional breach); _provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions
of this Section 8.7 shall not limit any claim or cause of action under
applicable Laws against, or the liability of any party hereto in respect
of, fraud or knowing and intentional breach on the part of such party in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

8.8 _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. Except as otherwise
required by applicable Law, the parties hereto shall treat any indemnification
payment made hereunder as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax
purposes.

SIGNATURE PAGE TO STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT EXHIBIT A

FORM OF TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT

This Transition Services Agreement (this " _Agreement_ ") is entered into as
of [ ] [ ], 2012, between The New York Times Company, a New York
corporation (" _NYT_ "), and About, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _About,
Inc._ ").

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of August [],
2012 (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "), by and between NYT and
IAC/InterActiveCorp, a Delaware corporation (" _IAC_ "), IAC has, among other
things, agreed to purchase all of the capital stock of About, Inc. from NYT;

WHEREAS, in order to facilitate the transactions contemplated by the Purchase
Agreement, About, Inc. desires to purchase from NYT, and NYT is willing to
provide, or to cause its subsidiaries and third party service providers to
provide, to About, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, " _About_ "),
certain transitional services pursuant to the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein; and

WHEREAS, NYT acknowledges and agrees that pursuant to the Purchase Agreement
it has received adequate and valuable consideration for the Services (as
defined below) to be provided by it hereunder and that the benefit of the
Services and the restrictions set forth in this Agreement was a material
inducement for IAC entering into the Purchase Agreement.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants and
agreements contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

SECTION 1. _Definitions_. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this
Agreement shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Purchase Agreement.
The interpretive conventions set forth in Article IX of the Purchase Agreement
are hereby incorporated by reference herein, _mutatis mutandis_.

SECTION 2. _Transition Services_. (a) During the Term (as defined below), NYT
shall provide, or shall cause one or more of its subsidiaries or third party
service providers to provide, to About the Services set forth on _Annex A_
hereto (the " _Services_ "), in the manner and at a level of Service and with
a standard of care substantially consistent with that provided by NYT, its
subsidiaries or its third party service providers to About immediately
preceding the date of this Agreement, and About shall use the Services for
substantially the same purposes and in substantially the same manner as About
used the Services immediately preceding the date hereof. NYT shall be
required to provide, or cause one or more of its subsidiaries or its third
party service providers to provide, the Services only to About, or to its
Affiliates or designated representatives, and only in connection with the
conduct of the business of About. About shall not resell or permit the resale
of any of the Services to any Person whatsoever or permit the use of the
Services by any Person other than in connection with the conduct of the
business of About in the ordinary course consistent with past practice prior
to the Closing Date. To the extent permitted by the underlying Contract under
which NYT or its subsidiary receives a Service, NYT shall provide, or shall
cause one or more of its subsidiaries to provide to About, or to its
Affiliates or designated representatives, such nonexclusive licenses as are
reasonably necessary  for such party to use the Services provided pursuant to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, About agrees that NYT is only obliged to
undertake commercially reasonable efforts to cause a third party service
provider to provide any part of the Services. If at any time during the Term,
any third party service provider is unable or unwilling to provide a Service
(or unable or unwilling to provide a Service at the required Service level or
at the agreed-to cost) and NYT is unable, after using its commercially
reasonable efforts, to procure substantially equivalent Services from an
alternative provider, NYT and About shall cooperate to find a suitable
alternative arrangement. 

(b) About acknowledges that neither NYT nor its subsidiaries are engaged in
the business of providing Services of the type provided hereunder to third
parties and that the Services to be provided to About are being provided to
About to facilitate the operation of its business during the Term.

(c) About acknowledges that NYT and its subsidiaries may be providing similar
Services, and/or Services that involve the same resources as those used to
provide the Services, to its internal organizations and subsidiaries. NYT
reserves the right to modify the Services in connection with changes to its
internal organization or its business in the ordinary course of business,
including terminating any third party service provider, _provided_ , 
_however_ , that no such modifications may materially diminish the Services.

(d) In providing the Services, NYT may (a) use such Personnel of NYT or its
Affiliates as NYT reasonably deems necessary or appropriate, or (b) employ the
services of third parties to the extent that such third party services (i) are
generally utilized or were generally utilized prior to the Closing Date to
provide such Services to NYT or (ii) are reasonably necessary to the efficient
performance of any the Services.

(e) About reserves the right to modify the Services in connection with changes
to its internal organization or its business in the ordinary course of
business, including terminating any third party service provider.

SECTION 3. _Proprietary Materials_. (a) If NYT, any of its subsidiaries or
third party service providers furnishes to About any NYT Proprietary
Materials pursuant to this Agreement, NYT, its subsidiaries or third party
service providers, as the case may be, shall retain exclusive ownership
therein (including all rights to Intellectual Property inherent therein and
appurtenant thereto). As used herein, " _NYT_ _Proprietary Materials_ " means
all information, data and knowledge furnished or made available by NYT, its
subsidiaries or third party service providers to About as part of the
Services, or used in the performance of Services hereunder, and copies
thereof, including software, documentation, techniques, tools, templates,
processes, procedures, discoveries, inventions and technical data.

 

(b) If About or any of its Affiliates furnishes to NYT any About Proprietary
Materials pursuant to this Agreement, About or its Affiliates, as the case
may be, shall retain exclusive ownership therein (including all rights to
Intellectual Property inherent therein and appurtenant thereto). As used
herein, " _About_ _Proprietary Materials_ " means all information, data and
knowledge furnished or made available by About or its Affiliates to NYT in
connection with the Services provided by NYT, and copies thereof, including
software, documentation, techniques, tools, templates, processes, procedures,
discoveries, inventions and technical data.

 



2 SECTION 4. _Access; Coordination_. (a) About shall make available on a
timely basis to NYT and its subsidiaries all information and materials
reasonably requested by NYT to enable it to provide the Services hereunder.
About shall give NYT and its subsidiaries reasonable access, during regular
business hours and at such other times as are reasonably required to Abouts
premises for the purpose of providing the Services hereunder.

(b) Promptly after the date hereof, About and NYT shall each designate an
individual with authority and an alternate to act in the absence of such
individual, to act as its coordinator (a partys " _Coordinator_ "). The
Coordinators appointed for each of the parties will be responsible for
liaison between NYT and About with respect to the coordination and performance
of all Services.

SECTION 5. _Payment_. About, Inc. shall pay NYT, in consideration for the
Services provided hereunder, an amount equal to NYTs cost and fees for
providing the Services as set forth on  _Exhibit A_ (the " _Fees_ "). For the
Services rendered under this Agreement, About will pay the Fees in United
States Dollars by wire transfer in immediately available funds on the first
business day of each month (each, a " _Payment Date_ ") during which the
Services are to be provided, unless a different date is expressly agreed by
the parties hereto. The Fees will be paid to one or more accounts designated
by NYT.

 

SECTION 6. _Taxes_. Any Taxes (other than income, gross receipts, franchise or
other taxes based on revenue or income) assessed on the provision of the
Services hereunder shall be paid by About; _provided_ , _however_ , such Taxes
shall not include any portion of employment, property, or other taxes assessed
on the employees or property of NYT providing the Services or fees,
assessments or charges payable in connection with obtaining any governmental
licenses or permits necessary to provide the Services for the Fee.

SECTION 7. _Term of Agreement_. The term (" _Term_ ") of this Agreement shall
commence on the date hereof and shall continue for a period ending on the
earliest of (i) of [March 31, 2013], and (ii) the date on which all Services
have been terminated by About or NYT under Section 8; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (i) any particular Service may expire in a shorter time period as set
forth opposite such Service in _Annex A_ hereto and (ii) About may terminate
any individual Service prior to the expiration of the time period for such
Service set forth in _Annex A_ pursuant to Section 8\.

 

SECTION 8. _Partial Termination; Termination_.

(a) Any individual Service provided by NYT or its subsidiaries or third party
providers under this Agreement are terminable (i) by About on fifteen (15)
calendar days prior written notice to NYT or (ii) by NYT as provided in
Section 2(a). Once About or NYT has terminated any Service, About shall not be
entitled to have such Service resumed pursuant hereto. Upon termination of any
individual Service, NYT shall no longer be obligated to provide such Service
and About shall thereafter no longer be obligated to pay the Fees for such
Service (except with respect to any Fees incurred up to such date); provided
that About shall be obligated to reimburse NYT for any reasonable documented
expenses or costs actually incurred in connection with such termination.

 



3 (b) This Agreement may be terminated prior to the expiration of its stated
term, upon written notice as set forth below:

(i) by NYT, on the one hand, or About, on the other hand, if the other party
commits a material breach of this Agreement and such breach continues uncured
for a period of thirty (30) days following a written request to cure such
breach; provided, that if any such breach relates solely to the failure to
timely pay any Fees pursuant to the terms hereof, then NYT may terminate this
Agreement within three (3) Business Days following receipt by About of a
written notice from NYT notifying About of such payment default; or

 

(ii) by NYT, on the one hand, or About, on the other hand, if the other party
files, or has filed against it, a petition for voluntary or involuntary
bankruptcy or pursuant to any other insolvency law or makes or seeks to make a
general assignment for the benefit of its creditors or applies for or consents
to the appointment of a trustee, receiver or custodian for it or a
substantial part of its property, in which case this Agreement shall
automatically terminate without any prior notice or the passage of any period
or the taking of any other action.

SECTION 9. _Limitations on Damages_. (a) NEITHER PARTY NOR ANY OF THEIR
AFFILIATES SHALL BE LIABLE, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, FOR ANY
PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER,
WHICH IN ANY WAY ARISE OUT OF, RELATE TO, OR ARE A CONSEQUENCE OF, THEIR OR
ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES OR A THIRD PARTYS PERFORMANCE OR NONPERFORMANCE
HEREUNDER, OR THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE SERVICES
HEREUNDER, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS OR DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS AND
CLAIMS OF THIRD PARTIES OR EMPLOYEES OF ABOUT.

(b) Neither NYT nor any of its subsidiaries shall have any liability with
respect to this Agreement or anything done in connection herewith, including
the performance or breach hereof, or from the sale, delivery, provision or
use of any of the Services provided under or pursuant to this Agreement,
whether in Contract, in tort or otherwise, other than by reason of NYT or such
subsidiarys gross negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct. 

(c) NYT agrees that the payments contemplated by this Agreement shall
constitute the exclusive and sole remedy for any termination of NYTs
engagement and NYT covenants not to assert or pursue any other remedies, at
law or in equity, with respect to any termination of the engagement.

SECTION 10. _Relationship_. (a) This Agreement does not authorize NYT to act
as an agent of About or any of its Affiliates or to make commitments on behalf
of About or any of its Affiliates. NYT at no time shall hold itself out as an
agent of About or any of its Affiliates for any purpose, including reporting
to any Governmental Entity, and shall have no authority to bind About or any
of its Affiliates to any obligation whatsoever. 

 



4 (b) NYT shall perform the Services required by this Agreement during normal
business hours at any place or location as About, Inc. shall determine, but
shall comply with the reasonable deadlines set by About.

SECTION 11. _Indemnification_. (a) About hereby releases NYT and each of its
subsidiaries and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
stockholders, agents and representatives (the " _NYT Indemnitees_ " __),
and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the NYT Indemnitees, from and
against any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, obligations or
expenses, including third-party legal fees and expenses (collectively, "
_Losses_ " __), to the extent arising or resulting from third party claims
arising or resulting from NYT s or its subsidiaries performance of the
Services hereunder, except to the extent that such Losses are due to such NYT
Indemnitees gross negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct.

(b) NYT hereby releases About and each of its subsidiaries and each of their
respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents and
representatives (the " _About Indemnitees_ "), and agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless the About Indemnitees, from and against any and all Losses
arising from NYTs gross negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct.

SECTION 12. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights and
obligations of the parties hereunder may be assigned by either of the parties
hereto without the prior written consent of the other party hereto, _provided_
, _however_ , that no assignment by either party hereto shall constitute
a novation or release the assignor from any obligation hereunder. Any
attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this Section 11 shall be
void.

SECTION 13. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 10,
this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their

construed to give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and such
assigns, any legal or equitable rights hereunder.

SECTION 14. _Notices_. All notices, requests, permissions, waivers and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been
duly given in accordance with Section 9.1 of the Purchase Agreement addressed

Purchase Agreement.

SECTION 15. _Captions_. All captions contained in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only, do not form a part of this Agreement and shall
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

SECTION 16. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
facsimile or other electronic delivery shall be effective as delivery of a
manually executed counterpart to this Agreement.

 



5 SECTION 17. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including _Annex A_ hereto,
the Purchase Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the Confidentiality
Agreement, including in each case the schedules and exhibits thereto,
constitute the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or
representations by or between the parties hereto, written or oral, with
respect to such subject matter (except for the Confidentiality Agreement,
which shall continue in full force and effect, and shall survive the
termination of this Agreement, in accordance with its terms). _Annex A_ hereto
is intended to be and hereby is specifically made part of this Agreement. In
the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement (including
_Annex A_ hereto), on the one hand, and the provisions of the Purchase
Agreement (including the schedules and exhibits thereto), on the other hand,
the Purchase Agreement shall control.

 

SECTION 18. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law, and if the
rights or obligations of any party hereto under this Agreement will not be
materially and adversely affected thereby, (a) such provision will be fully
severable, (b) this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such
provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c) the remaining provisions of
this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected
by such provision or its severance herefrom and (d) in lieu of
such provision, there will be added automatically as a part of this Agreement
a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such provision
as may be possible.

SECTION 19. _Governing Law_. All matters relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby (whether sounding in
contract, tort or otherwise) will be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice of
law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or
any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

SECTION 20. _Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or Federal
court located within the County of New York in the State of New York for the
purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby, and agrees to commence any
such action, suit or proceeding only in such courts. Each party further agrees
that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered
mail to such partys respective address set forth herein shall be effective
service of process for any such action, suit or proceeding. Each party
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of
any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in such courts, and hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that
any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF SUCH PARTY
IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

 



6 SECTION 21. _Service of Process_. Each party agrees that service of any
process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such partys
respective address set forth in Section 9.1 of the Purchase Agreement shall be
effective service of process for any Action in Delaware with respect to any
matters for which it has submitted to jurisdiction pursuant to Section 20\.

SECTION 22. _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment of any provision of this
Agreement shall be valid unless such amendment is in writing and signed by the
parties hereto. No failure or delay by any party hereto in exercising any
right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

SECTION 23. _Independent Contractor_. At all times during the term of this
Agreement, NYT and each of its subsidiaries providing Services hereunder shall
be independent Contractors in providing the Services hereunder with the sole
right to supervise, manage, operate, control and direct the performance of the
Services and the sole obligation to employ, compensate and manage their
employees and business affairs. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed or construed to create a partnership or joint venture, to create the
relationships of employee/employer or principal/agent, or otherwise create any
liability whatsoever of any party with respect to the
indebtedness, liabilities, obligations or actions of the other party or any
of its respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents or
representatives, or any other Person or entity.

 

SECTION 24. _Survival_. The provisions of Section 1, Section 5, Section 6, and
Section 9 through Section 28, shall survive the expiration or earlier
termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever.

SECTION 25.  _Force Majeure_. NYT and its subsidiaries shall not be in
default hereunder by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its
obligations hereunder where such failure or delay is solely due to any cause
beyond its control, including strikes, labor disputes, civil disturbances,
riot, rebellion, invasion, epidemic, hostilities, war, terrorism, embargo,
natural disaster, acts of God, flood, fire, sabotage, accident, delay in
transportation, loss and destruction of property, intervention by
Governmental Entities, change in laws, regulations or orders, other events or
any other circumstances or causes solely beyond NYTs control (" _Force
Majeure Events_ "). In any such event, NYTs obligations under this Agreement
shall be postponed for such time as its performance is suspended or delayed on
account thereof and any required payments with respect to the affected
performance obligations, other than payments for Services already
performed, shall delayed accordingly. NYT will promptly notify About in
writing upon learning of the occurrence of such Force Majeure Event and shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or remove such causes of
nonperformance. Upon the cessation of the Force Majeure Event, NYT will use
its reasonable best efforts to resume its performance with the least
practicable delay. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if NYTs performance is
excused by a Force Majeure Event shall be excused from such performance to
the extent such performance is prevented, restricted, interrupted or suspended
as a result of such Force Majeure Event and neither NYT nor its subsidiaries
is obliged to provide any disaster recovery or remediation services
in connection with a Force Majeure Event.

 



7 SECTION 26. _Confidentiality_. (a) About acknowledges that the
information provided to it in connection with the Services (including, if
applicable, any NYT Proprietary Material) is subject to the terms of the
confidentiality agreement dated as of August 21, 2012 between IAC and NYT, the
terms of which are incorporated herein by reference.

(b) NYT acknowledges that, in the performance of the Services, it may have
access to, receive and be entrusted with (and in the past has, in fact, had
access to, received and been entrusted with) About Proprietary Material. NYT
shall not, except as may be required to perform the Services under this
Agreement or as required by applicable law, without limitation in time,
communicate, divulge, disseminate, disclose to others or otherwise use,
whether directly or indirectly, any About Proprietary Material.

 

SECTION 27. _Interpretation_. The parties hereto have participated jointly in
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement, and any rule of construction
or interpretation otherwise requiring this Agreement to be construed or
interpreted against any party by virtue of the authorship of this Agreement
shall not apply to the construction and interpretation hereof.

 

SECTION 28. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed by them in accordance with the terms hereof and that each
party hereto shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof
without the necessity of posting a bond or other security or proving damages
or the inadequacy of monetary damages, in addition to any other remedy at law
or equity.
