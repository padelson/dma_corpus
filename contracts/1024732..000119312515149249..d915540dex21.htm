approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has, in accordance with
Sections 1721 and 2538, if applicable, of the PBCL (as defined below),
unanimously (i) determined that the entry into this Agreement, and the
consummation of the Merger (as defined below), on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the
Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988 (including any successor laws,

law, rule, or regulations of the Pennsylvania Associations Code, as amended
or supplemented hereafter, the " _PBCL_ "), of Merger Sub with and into the

subsidiary of Parent (the " _Merger_ "), and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the " _Transactions_ ") are in
the best interests of the Company and (ii) approved the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement, and the consummation of the Merger and the
other Transactions, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in

WHEREAS the respective Boards of Directors of SA, NA and Merger Sub have

this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS as a condition and inducement to Parents willingness to enter into

herewith entered into an agreement (the " _Voting Agreement_ ") in connection
with the Merger, providing that such shareholders have, among other things,
agreed to vote the shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by them
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, on the terms and subject to the
conditions in the Voting Agreement;

WHEREAS Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows: ARTICLE I

 

The Merger

 

Section 1.01 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the PBCL, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time,
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company
shall continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_
").

Section 1.02 _Merger Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ")
shall take place at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, 601 Lexington
Avenue, New York, New York 10022 at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the
second business day following the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by
Law) waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the
conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), or at such other place, time
and date as shall be agreed in writing by the parties hereto; _provided_ that
if all the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ have not been satisfied or (to
the extent permitted by Law) waived on such second business day, then the
Closing shall take place on the first business day on which all such
conditions shall have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Law)
waived, or at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing by
the parties hereto. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in
this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ".

Section 1.03 _Effective Time_. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall prepare, and on the Closing Date, the Company shall file with the
Department of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the articles of
merger or other appropriate documents (in any such case, the " _Articles of
Merger_ ") executed in accordance with the provisions of the PBCL and shall
make all other filings or recordings required under the PBCL to effectuate the
Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Articles of
Merger are duly filed with the Department of State of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania or at such other time as Parent and the Company shall agree and
specify in the Articles of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being
the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

Section 1.04 _Effects of Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
herein and in Section 1929 of the PBCL.

 

Section 1.05 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws_. (a) At the Effective
Time, the articles of incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be amended and restated in its entirety to
be in the form attached as Exhibit B and, as so amended and restated, such
articles of incorporation shall be the articles of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended as provided
therein or permitted by applicable Law.

 



2 (b) At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be amended and restated in its entirety to
be in the same form as the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time and, as so amended and restated, such bylaws shall be
the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or permitted by applicable Law, except that references to
the name of Merger Sub shall be replaced by the name of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

Section 1.06 _Directors and Officers_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

 

Section 1.07 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common
Stock_ "), or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation. 

(b) _Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock that is owned as treasury stock by the Company or owned
by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable
in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Other Company Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding
share of Company Common Stock (but excluding shares to be cancelled and
retired in accordance with _Section 1.07(b)_) shall be converted into the
right to receive $48.00 in cash and without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company
Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of any such
shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section 1.08_, without interest.

 

Section 1.08 _Payment of Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration to former
holders of Company Common Stock. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, deposit with the Paying Agent, immediately after the
Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, cash (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_
") in amounts necessary for the payment of Merger Consideration pursuant to 
_Section 1.07(c)_ upon surrender of Certificates in accordance

 



3  with _Section 1.08(b)_ or delivery of an "agents message" in accordance
with _Section 1.08(c)_, it being understood that all such funds shall be
invested as directed by Parent in accordance with _Section 1.08(h)_ and that
any and all interest or other amounts earned with respect to funds made
available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be turned over
to Parent.

 

(b) _Payment Procedure_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in no event later than two business days after the
Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_
") which were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 1.07_ (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall include
an accompanying IRS Form W-9 or an applicable IRS Form W-8 and shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions (including
customary provisions regarding delivery of an "agents message" with respect
to Book-Entry Shares) as are customary and reasonably acceptable to the
Company and Parent) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate to the Paying Agent for cancelation, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash equal to
the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant
to _Section 1.07_, and each Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered
is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay
any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 1.08_, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the amount of Merger Consideration into
which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such
Certificate have been converted pursuant to _Section 1.07_. No interest shall
be paid or accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

 

(c) _Treatment of Book-Entry Shares_. No holder of record of Book-Entry Shares
shall be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of
transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration in respect
of such Book-Entry Shares. In lieu thereof, such holder of record shall upon
receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message" in customary form (or
such other evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), be
entitled to receive, and the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event
later than two business days after the Effective Time to each such holder of
record as of the Effective Time), an amount of U.S. dollars equal to the
aggregate amount of Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled
hereunder, and such Book-Entry Shares shall forthwith be canceled.

 



4 (d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article I_ as a
result of the conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Company Common Stock, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporations
obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record
date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the
Company on such shares of Company Common Stock not in violation of the terms
of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement. After the Effective
Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article I_.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced
or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by
such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate.

(f) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed as of the 12-month anniversary of the Closing Date shall
be delivered to Parent or its designated affiliate, upon demand, and any
former holder of Company Common Stock entitled to payment of Merger
Consideration who has not theretofore complied with this _Article I_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent or its successor-in-interest for payment of its
claim for Merger Consideration (subject to applicable abandoned property,
escheat and other similar Law).

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has
not been surrendered prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately
prior to such date become the property of the Surviving Corporation or its
designated affiliate, free and clear of any claims or interest of any such
holders or their successors, assigns or personal representative previously
entitled thereto, subject to the claims of any former holder of Company
Common Stock entitled to payment of Merger Consideration who has not
theretofore complied with this _Article II_.

 

(h) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the
Paying Agent in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United States of
America or (ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith and credit of
the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of
principal and interest. Nothing contained in this _Section 1.08(h)_ and

 



5 no investment losses resulting from the investment of the Payment Fund shall
diminish the rights of the shareholders to receive the Merger Consideration.
To the extent there are losses or the Payment Fund diminishes for any reason
below the level required to promptly pay the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 1.07(c)_, Parent shall replace or restore the cash in the Payment
Fund to ensure the prompt payment of the Merger Consideration. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall be the property of, and
paid to, Parent or its designated affiliate.

 

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any former holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax law; _provided_ that Parent agrees that no non-U.S. Taxes
shall be deducted and withheld from the Merger Consideration (other than any
such Taxes required to be withheld in respect of compensation payable to any
present or former employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries).
To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, and paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

 

ARTICLE II

 

Representations and Warranties of the Company

 

Except (a) as disclosed in the reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents filed by the Company with, or furnished by the Company to, the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") during the period from
January 1, 2012 to the business day prior to the date hereof ( _provided_ ,
that if this Agreement is executed on any day other than a Sunday or a
Monday, the period referenced in this clause (a) shall be from January 1, 2012
to the second business day prior to the date hereof) (excluding any
disclosures contained under the captions "Risk Factors" or "Forward Looking
Statements" or similarly titled captions and any other disclosures contained
therein that are cautionary or forward-looking in nature) (the " _Filed
Company SEC Documents_ ") ( _provided_ , _further_ , that this clause (a)
shall not be applicable to _Section 2.02_, _Section 2.04_, Section 2.06(e),
Section 2.06(g), _Section 2.07_, or _Section 2.08(a)_) or (b) as set forth
in the letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement, from the Company to
Parent and Merger Sub (which shall be arranged in numbered and lettered
sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained in this
_Article III_ , and the disclosure in any section shall be deemed to qualify
or apply to other sections in this _Article III_ to the extent that it is
reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure also
qualifies or applies to such other sections, the " _Company Disclosure
Letter_ "), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as
follows:

 



6 Section 2.01 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of the Company and each
of its subsidiaries (the " _Company Subsidiaries_ ") is duly organized or
formed, as applicable, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the jurisdiction in which it is organized (in the case of good standing, to
the extent the concept is recognized by such jurisdiction), except in the
case of Company Subsidiaries where any such failure would not reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (a) has full power
and authority necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its
properties and assets and to conduct its business as presently conducted and
(b) is duly qualified or licensed to do business in each jurisdiction where
the nature of its business or its ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than where
the failure to have such power and authority or to be so qualified
or licensed would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. True and complete copies of
the articles of incorporation of the Company, as amended to the date of this
Agreement (as so amended, the " _Company Articles_ "), and the bylaws of the
Company, as amended to the date of this Agreement (as so amended, the "
_Company Bylaws_ ") are included in the Filed Company SEC Documents. The
Company has made available to Parent the organizational documents of each
material Company Subsidiary, in each case as amended and in effect as of the
date of this Agreement.

 

Section 2.02 _Capital Structure_. (a) The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 700,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, 1 share of
Series A Preferred Stock, without par value (the "Series A Preferred Stock"),
480,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, without par value (the "Series B
Preferred Stock"), and 19,519,999 shares of additional Preferred Stock,
without par value (together with the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B
Preferred Stock, the "Company Preferred Stock"). At the close of business on
April 22, 2015 (the "Measurement Date"), (i) 81,926,476 shares of Company
Common Stock were issued, of which 80,936,374 shares of Company Common Stock

Shareholders Meeting (the " _Shareholder Approval Time_ "), in response to a
written, _bona fide_ Company Takeover Proposal that did not result from a
material breach of this  _Section 4.03(a)_ and that the Company Board

Superior Company Proposal (a " _Qualifying Company Takeover Proposal_ "), the
Company may (A) furnish information with respect to the Company to the Person
making such Qualifying Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives
pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement so long as the Company

to Parent, and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person
and its Representatives regarding such Qualifying Company Takeover Proposal
including soliciting the making of a revised Qualifying Company Takeover

venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement relating to any

31  Agreement entered into in accordance with _Section 4.03(a)_), or resolve,
agree or publicly propose to take any such action. Notwithstanding anything to
contrary in the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, at any
time prior to (x) 11:59 p.m. New York time on the Written Consent End Date (in
the event that the Shareholder Consent is executed and delivered to Parent in
accordance with _Section 5.01(b)_) or (y) the Shareholder Approval Time (in
the event that the Shareholder Consent is not delivered in accordance with
_Section 5.01(b)_ and this Agreement is not terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.01(g)_), as applicable, the Company Board may, subject to
compliance with this _Section 4.03(b)_:

(i) in response to an Intervening Event, take or fail to take any of the
actions specified in clause (A) of the definition of Adverse Recommendation
Change (an " _Intervening Event Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") if the
Company Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law and

 

(ii) if the Company Board receives a Superior Company Proposal, terminate this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.01(f)_ in accordance with _Section
7.04(b)_;

provided _that_ , prior to so making an Intervening Event
Adverse Recommendation Change, or so terminating this Agreement, (1) the
Company Board shall have given Parent at least four calendar days prior
written notice (such notice period, as it may be renewed pursuant to the terms
of this proviso, the " _Match Period_ ") of its intention to take such action
and a description of the reasons for taking such action (which notice, in
respect of a Superior Company Proposal, shall specify the identity of the
Person who made such Superior Company Proposal and all of the material terms
and conditions of such Superior Company Proposal and attach the most current
version of the relevant transaction agreement), (2) the Company shall have
negotiated, and shall have caused its Representatives to negotiate in good
faith, with Parent during such notice period, to the extent Parent wishes to
negotiate, to enable Parent to revise the terms of this Agreement in such a
manner that would eliminate the need for taking such action (and in respect
of a Superior Company Proposal, would cause such Superior Company Proposal to
no longer constitute a Superior Company Proposal), (3) following the end of
such notice period, the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any
revisions to this Agreement offered in writing by Parent in a manner that
would form a binding contract if accepted by the Company, and shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that
failure to effect such Company Intervening Event Adverse Recommendation
Change or to terminate this Agreement to accept a Superior Company Proposal
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and, with
respect to a Superior Company Proposal, that such Superior Company Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Company Proposal and (4) in the event of
any change to any of the material terms (including the form, amount and timing
of payment of consideration) of such Superior Company Proposal, the Company
shall, in each case, deliver to Parent an additional notice consistent with
that described in clause (1) of this proviso and a renewed notice period under
clause (1) of this proviso shall commence (except that the four-calendar-day
notice period referred to in clause (1) of this proviso shall instead be equal
to three calendar days) during which time the Company shall be required to
comply with the requirements of this  _Section 4.03(b)_ anew with respect to
each such additional notice, including clauses (1) through (4) of this
proviso. Regardless of whether there is an Adverse Recommendation Change, the
Company Shareholders Meeting shall be held in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to
_Article VII_.

 



32 (c) Nothing contained in this _Section 4.03_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to shareholders), including making
any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the shareholders of the Company,
or (ii) making any disclosure to its shareholders if the Company Board
determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
or applicable Law; _provided_ that this _Section 4.03(c)_ shall not be deemed
to affect whether any such action (other than a recommendation against a
Company Takeover Proposal or a "stop, look and listen" communication by the
Company Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act) would
otherwise constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

(d) In addition to the requirements set forth in paragraphs _(a)_ and _(b)_
of this _Section 4.03_, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable and in
any event with 24 hours after receipt thereof, advise Parent orally and in
writing of (i) any Company Takeover Proposal or any request for information or
inquiry, proposal or offer that the Company reasonably believes could lead to
or contemplates a Company Takeover Proposal and (ii) the terms and conditions
of such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer (including any
subsequent amendments or modifications thereto) and the identity of the
Person making any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry, proposal or
offer. Commencing upon the provision of any notice referred to above, the
Company and its Representatives shall keep Parent informed on a reasonably
prompt basis as to the status and details of any such Company Takeover
Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer (and any subsequent amendments or
modifications thereto).

 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means a customary
confidentiality agreement that contains provisions that are no less favorable
in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 

(ii) " _Company Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from
any Person or group (other than Parent and its subsidiaries) relating to (i)
any direct or indirect acquisition, purchase or license in a single

the fair market value thereof) of the assets (including capital stock of the
Company Subsidiaries) of the Company and Company Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (B) 20% or more of the aggregate voting power of the capital stock
of the Company or (ii) any tender offer, exchange offer, merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, extraordinary dividend,
liquidation, dissolution, binding share exchange or similar transaction
involving the Company that, if consummated, would result in any Person or
group (or the shareholders of any Person) beneficially owning, directly or
indirectly, 20% or more of the aggregate voting power of the capital stock of
the Company or of the surviving entity or the resulting direct or indirect
parent of the Company or such surviving entity, other than, in each case, the
Transactions.

 



33 (iii) " _Intervening Event_ " means a material event, change, effect,
development, condition or occurrence that affects or would be reasonably
likely to affect the business, financial condition or continuing results of

that, to the knowledge of the Company Board, was not reasonably foreseeable as
of the date of this Agreement and (2) does not relate to a Company Takeover
Proposal;  _provided_ , that in no event shall the following constitute, or
be taken into account in determining the existence of an Intervening Event:
(x) the fact that the Company meets or exceeds any internal or published
forecasts or projections for any period, or any changes after the date of
this Agreement in the market price or trading volume of Company Common Stock,
(y) the reasonably foreseeable consequences of the announcement of this
Agreement or (z) any event, fact or circumstance relating to or involving the
Parent.

(iv) " _Superior Company Proposal_ " means any written,  _bona fide_ Company
Takeover Proposal received after the date hereof that if consummated would
result in a Person or group (or the shareholders of any Person) owning,
directly or indirectly, (i) 50% or more of the aggregate voting power of the
capital stock of the Company or of the surviving entity or the resulting
direct or indirect parent of the Company or such surviving entity or (ii) 50%
or more (based on the fair market value thereof) of the assets (including
capital stock of the Company Subsidiaries) of the Company and Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, on terms which the Company Board determines,
in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and a financial
advisor, are, if consummated, more favorable from a financial point of view
to the shareholders of the Company than the Transactions, taking into account
all financial, legal, financing, regulatory and other aspects of such Company
Takeover Proposal and of this Agreement (including any changes to the terms
of this Agreement proposed by Parent and any fees to be paid by the Company
for terminating this Agreement); _provided_ , that a Company Takeover Proposal
may only be a " _Superior Company Proposal_ " if, at the time of the Company
Boards determination, either the Company Board has received executed
commitment letters in respect of any financing required to consummate the
transaction contemplated by such Company Takeover Proposal, or if no such
commitment letters have been provided, the Company Board has determined in
good faith that the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal is reasonably
capable of financing the proposed transaction without third party financing
that is based upon the financial statements of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries.

Wherever the term "group" is used in this  _Section 4.03(e)(i)-(iv)_, it is
used as defined in Rule 13d-5 under the Exchange Act.

not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the shareholders of the Company.

to solicit the adoption of this Agreement by such shareholders.

Section 5.02 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Except if prohibited by
any applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and to Parents Representatives, reasonable
access during normal business hours (under the supervision of appropriate
personnel and in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the
normal operation of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries)
during the period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement to all their respective properties, assets, books and records,
Contracts, permits, documents, information, directors, officers and employees

Subsidiary to, furnish, as promptly as reasonably practicable, to Parent all
information concerning its business, properties, customers and personnel as
Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ , that any such access shall be
afforded and information shall be furnished at Parents expense.
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, neither the Company nor
any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required to afford access or furnish
information to the extent (a) such information is subject to the terms of a
confidentiality agreement with a third party, (b) such information relates to
the applicable portions of the minutes of the meetings of the Company Board

Board) where the Company Board discussed the Transactions or any similar
transaction involving the sale of the Company to, or combination of the

disclosure of such information and take such other reasonable action
(including entering into a joint defense agreement or similar arrangement to
avoid loss of attorney-client privilege) with respect to such information as
is necessary to permit disclosure to Parent. All information exchanged

letter agreement dated March 3, 2015 between the Company and SA (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

_Section 5.03(c)_ of this Agreement, each of the parties shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, as promptly as practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions,
including (i) the obtaining of all necessary or advisable actions or non-
actions, waivers and consents from, the making of all necessary
registrations, declarations and filings with and the taking of all reasonable

fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. In connection with and
without limiting the foregoing, and notwithstanding any Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Company and the Company Board shall (A) take all
action necessary to ensure that no Takeover Statute or similar statute or
regulation is or becomes applicable to any Transaction or this Agreement and
(B) if any Takeover Statute or similar statute or regulation becomes
applicable to any Transaction or this Agreement, take all action necessary to
ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect
of such statute or regulation on the Transactions and this Agreement.

 

(b) Parent and the Company shall, in consultation and cooperation with the
other, file (i) with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_
") and the United States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") the
notification and report form, if any, required under the HSR Act for the
Merger or any of the other Transactions as promptly as practicable (but in no
event later than ten business days after the date of this Agreement) and (ii)
all appropriate filings, notices, applications or similar documents required
under any Foreign Antitrust Law as promptly as practicable (but in no
event later than ten business days after the date of this Agreement). Any
such filings shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of the
HSR Act or the applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws, as the case may be. Each of

information and reasonable assistance as the other party may request in
connection with its preparation of any filing or submission which is necessary

connection with, any such filings, submissions, communications, inquiries or
requests, (iii) unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable
Governmental Entity, and to the extent reasonably practicable, (A) not

37  in respect of the Merger or any of the other Transactions without the other
party, (B) give the other party reasonable prior notice of any such meeting or
conversation, (C) in the event one party is prohibited by applicable Law or
by the applicable Governmental Entity from participating in or attending any
such meeting or engaging in any such conversation, keep such party apprised
with respect thereto, (D) cooperate in the filing of any substantive
memoranda, white papers, filings, correspondence or other written
communications explaining or defending this Agreement, the Merger or any of
the other Transactions, articulating any regulatory or competitive argument
or responding to requests or objections made by any Governmental Entity and
(E) furnish the other party with copies of all filings, submissions,
correspondence and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance
thereof) between it and its affiliates and their respective Representatives,
on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of any Governmental
Entitys staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement, the Merger
and the other Transactions and (iv) comply with any inquiry or request from
the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity as promptly as reasonably
practicable. Any such additional information shall be in substantial
compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act or the applicable Foreign
Antitrust Law, as the case may be. Parent agrees not to extend, directly or
indirectly, any waiting period under the HSR Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law
or enter into any agreement with a Governmental Entity to delay or not
to consummate the Merger or any of the other Transactions, except with the
prior written consent of the Company, which consent may be withheld in its
sole discretion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent and
the Company shall have joint control over all communications and strategy
relating to obtaining all approvals, Consents, waivers, registrations,
permits, Authorizations and other confirmations under the HSR Act and any
Foreign Antitrust Law from any Governmental Entity or other third party in
connection with consummating the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or to any litigation arising therefrom under
the HSR Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent and the Company shall consult in advance with the other party and
in good faith take the other partys views into account regarding the overall
strategic direction of any such approval process, as applicable, and consult
with the other party prior to taking any material substantive positions,
making dispositive motions or other material substantive filings or
submissions or entering into any negotiations concerning such approvals, as
applicable.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to take promptly any and all steps
necessary to avoid, eliminate or resolve each and every impediment and obtain
all clearances, Consents, approvals and waivers under the HSR Act or any
Foreign Antitrust Law that may be required by any Governmental Entity, so as
to enable the parties to close the Transactions as promptly as practicable
(and in any event no later than the Outside Date), including committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, trust, or otherwise, (i)
the sale, license, holding separate or other disposition of assets or
businesses of Parent or the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries,
(ii) terminating, relinquishing, modifying, or waiving existing relationships,
ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements of Parent or
Company or their respective subsidiaries and (iii) creating any relationships,
ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements of Parent or
Company or their respective subsidiaries (each a " _Remedial Action_ ");
_provided_ that (x) the Company shall not be obligated to agree to, commit or
effect, any Remedial Action unless such Remedial Action is conditioned upon,
or will occur subsequent to, consummation of the

 



38  Transactions and (y) Parent and its subsidiaries shall not be required to,
and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, take any Remedial Action, or commit to take any
Remedial Action, or agree to any Remedial Action, that would, or would
reasonably be expected to, have a material adverse effect on the business,
results of operations, or financial condition of either (x) SA and its
subsidiaries (but not including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) or
(y) the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, (in each case of (x) and (y),
measured on a scale relative to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole) (a " _Burdensome Condition_ "). In the event that any
litigation or other administrative or judicial action or Proceeding is
commenced, threatened or is foreseeable challenging any of the Transactions
and such litigation, action or Proceeding seeks, or would reasonably be
expected to seek, to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Transactions, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take any and all action, including a Remedial Action, to avoid or resolve
any such litigation, action or Proceeding and each of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub shall cooperate with each other and use its respective reasonable
best efforts to contest and resist any such litigation, action or Proceeding
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, Judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
Transactions as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than the
Outside Date); _provided_ , that Parent shall not be required to, and the
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, take
any action under this sentence that would, or would reasonably be expected
to, result in the imposition of a Burdensome Condition.

 

Section 5.04 _Equity Awards_. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of
Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the
Company Stock Plan) shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions
as may be required to effect the following:

 

(i) _Cashout Company Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each Cashout
Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be canceled, with the holder of such Cashout Company Stock Option
becoming entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to (A) the excess, if
any, of (1) the Merger Consideration minus (2) the exercise price per share
of Company Common Stock subject to such Cashout Company Stock Option,
multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Cashout Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
(such amount, the " _Cashout Option Amount_ ")

(ii) _NEO Equity Awards_. At the Effective Time, each NEOs equity awards
shall automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an
NEO Converted Cash Award, which NEO Converted Cash Award will, subject to the
NEOs continued employment with the Parent and its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting
dates, vest and be payable with respect to one-half of the NEO Converted Cash
Award as soon as practicable following the Closing Date and, thereafter, one-
quarter on each subsequent Payment Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that an NEO incurs a Qualifying Termination or dies, in each case
following the Effective Time, any theretofore unpaid portion of such holders
NEO Converted Cash Award shall vest and be paid to such holder (or
beneficiary, in the case of death) no later than ten days after the date of
such Qualifying Termination or death, as applicable.

 



39 (iii) _Non-NEO Equity Awards_.

 

(1) _Non-NEO Company Performance Share Awards_. At the Effective Time, each
Non-NEOs Company Performance Share Awards outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into a right to receive a performance
share award with respect to that number of shares of Parent Common Stock,
determined by multiplying the target number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Non-NEO Company Performance Share Award by the Non-NEO Company
Performance Share Award Exchange Ratio, rounded up the nearest whole share if
the resulting number yields one-half or more of a share (a " _Non-NEO
Converted Performance Share Award_ "). Each Non-NEO Converted Performance
Share Award shall be subject to the performance metrics, service conditions,
and other terms and conditions of the applicable performance share award plan
of Cap Gemini S.A. then in effect and shall, assuming the achievement of the
applicable performance metrics, vest and be payable with respect to one-
quarter of the Non-NEO Converted Performance Share Award on the first, second,
third and fourth anniversaries of the Closing Date; _provided_ , if there is
no performance share award plan in effect as of the applicable Payment Date,
or if there is an insufficient number of shares available under such
performance plan, the Non-NEO Converted Performance Share Award shall be
settled in cash but otherwise be subject to the same service and performance
vesting conditions described above.

 

(2) _Non-NEO Company Restricted Shares_. At the Effective Time, each Non-NEOs
Company Restricted Shares shall automatically be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive a Non-NEO Restricted Share Converted Cash Award, which
Non-NEO Restricted Share Converted Cash Award will, subject to the Non-NEOs
continued employment with the Parent and its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting
dates, vest on the same schedule as set forth in the award agreement governing
the applicable Company Restricted Share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that a Non-NEO incurs a Qualifying Termination or dies, in each case
following the Effective Time, any theretofore unpaid portion of such holders
Non-NEO Restricted Share Converted Cash Award shall vest and be paid to such
holder (or beneficiary, in the case of death) no later than ten days after the
date of such Qualifying Termination or death, as applicable.

 

(3) _Non-NEO Company Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each Non-NEOs
Company Stock Options that are not Cashout Company Stock Options shall
automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a Non-NEO
Stock Option Converted Cash Award, which Non-NEO Stock Option Converted Cash
Award will, subject to the Non-NEOs continued employment with the Parent and
its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries)
through the applicable vesting dates, vest on the same schedule as set forth
in the award agreement governing the applicable Company Stock Option.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a Non-NEO incurs a Qualifying
Termination or dies, in each case following the Effective Time, any
theretofore unpaid portion of such holders Non-NEO Stock Option Converted
Cash Award shall vest and be paid to such holder (or beneficiary, in the case
of death) no later than ten days after the date of such Qualifying Termination
or death, as applicable.

 



40 (iv) _Company RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each Company RSU held by a non-
employee member of the Company Board outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled, with the holder of such Company RSU becoming
entitled to receive, a lump sum cash payment equal to the product of (A) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the Merger Consideration (such
amount, the " _RSU Amount_ ").

 

(b) For the avoidance of doubt and for purposes of clarity, (i) the portion of
the NEO Converted Cash Awards attributable to Non-Cashout Company Stock
Options shall be paid prior to any portion of such individuals NEO Converted
Cash Award attributable to Company Performance Share Awards and Company
Restricted Shares (and, only for those NEOs who are U.S. taxpayers, to
the extent any such portion of such individuals NEO Converted Cash Award
would be payable after the date on which such Non-Cashout Company Stock Option
would have otherwise vested pursuant to its terms, such portion shall instead
be paid on such original vesting date) and (ii) in lieu of paying Converted
Cash Awards in cash, Parent shall have the option to deliver any portion of a
Converted Cash Award in fully vested shares of Parent Common Stock having a
Fair Market Value equal to the value of the corresponding Converted Cash
Award that Parent so elects to not pay in cash.

(c) All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 5.04 shall be subject to any
required withholding of Taxes and shall be paid without interest.

(d) Subject to this Section 5.04 promptly following the Closing (but in no
event later than five business days following the Closing), (i) Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay through its payroll systems
the applicable Cashout Option Amounts, and NEO Converted Cash Awards to the
former holders of Company Stock Options, and Company Restricted Shares who
remain employees of Parent or one of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) at the time of such payment and (ii) Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to pay, in accordance with the applicable provisions of this
Section 5.04, the applicable Cashout Option Amounts, NEO Converted Cash
Awards, and RSU Amounts to the former holders of Company Stock Options,
Company Restricted Shares, and Company RSUs who are not eligible to be paid
through the Surviving Corporations or Parents payroll systems. For the
avoidance of doubt, Parent shall take all steps necessary to enable and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to the Paying Agent,
immediately after the Effective Time, cash necessary to pay the applicable
Cashout Option Amounts, NEO Converted Cash Awards, and RSU Amounts to the
former holders of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares, and
Company RSUs who are not eligible to be paid through the Surviving
Corporations or Parents payroll systems (and such cash shall constitute part
of the Payment Fund).

a period of one year following the Effective Time (the " _Continuation
Period_ "), Parent shall provide or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide

immediately prior

 



43  to the Effective Time and who continues employment with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Company Subsidiary (each, a " _Company Employee_

employment, severance, retention, termination and change in control plans,
policies, programs, agreements and arrangements (including any change in
control severance agreement or other Company Benefit Agreement between the
Company and any Company Employee) maintained by the Company or any Company
Subsidiaries, in each case, as in effect at the Closing Date, including with

efforts to, (i) waive or cause to be waived any limitations as to preexisting
conditions and exclusions and waiting periods and actively-at-work
requirements with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents and beneficiaries,
to the extent such limitations were waived, satisfied or did not apply to such
employees or eligible dependents or beneficiaries under the corresponding and
comparable welfare Company Benefit Plan in which such employees
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide Company
Employees and their eligible dependents and beneficiaries with credit for any
co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any
analogous deductible or out-of-pocket maximum requirements for such year to
the extent applicable under any such plan in which they will be eligible to
participate.

 

(f) With respect to any Company Employees based outside of the United States,
Parents obligations under this _Section 5.05_ shall be modified to the
extent necessary to comply with applicable Laws of the foreign countries and
political subdivisions thereof in which such Company Employees are based.

 

(g) The provisions of this _Section 5.05_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no Company Employee or any other Person
(including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement (except to the extent provided in _Section
8.07_ with respect to _Section 5.06_), and no provision of this  _Section
5.05_ shall create such rights in any such Persons in respect of any benefits
that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any Company Benefit Plan
or Company Benefit Agreement or any employee program or any plan
or arrangement of Parent or any of its subsidiaries.

Section 5.06 _Indemnification_. (a) All rights to indemnification
and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time (and rights to advancement of expenses) now existing in
favor of any Person who is or prior to the Effective Time becomes, or has been
at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, a director, officer,
employee or agent (including as a fiduciary with respect to an employee
benefit plan) of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective predecessors (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in the
Company Articles, the Company Bylaws, the organizational documents of any
Company Subsidiary or any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified
Party and the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries that is in effect as
of the date of this Agreement and that has been made available to Parent (i)
shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further
action, at the Effective Time, (ii) shall survive the Merger, (iii) shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms with respect
to any claims against any such Indemnified Party arising out of such acts or
omissions and (iv) for a period of six years following the date of this
Agreement, shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner
that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified
Party. Parent shall ensure that the Surviving Corporation complies with and
honors the foregoing obligations.

 



45 (b) Without limiting _Section 5.06(a)_ or any rights of any Indemnified Party
pursuant to any indemnification agreement, from and after the Effective Time,
in the event of any threatened or actual Proceeding, whether civil or
administrative, based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part
out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent (including as a fiduciary with respect to
an employee benefit plan) of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or
any of their respective predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the
Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and
severally, indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, each such Indemnified Party against any losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any Proceeding to
each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law upon
receipt of any undertaking required by applicable Law), Judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement of or in connection with any such threatened or
actual Proceeding;  _provided_ , that any expenses advanced to an Indemnified
Party pursuant to this sentence shall be paid by Parent within 20 calendar
days following receipt of a reasonably detailed request therefor, together
with an undertaking by such Indemnified Party to repay all amounts so
advanced in the event it is ultimately determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification).
None of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual Proceeding
for which indemnification could be sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder,
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such Proceeding or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing
to such settlement, compromise or consent. Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate with an Indemnified Party in the defense of any
matter for which such Indemnified Party could seek indemnification hereunder.
Parents and the Surviving Corporations obligations under this _Section
5.06(b)_ shall continue in full force and effect for the period beginning
upon the acceptance for payment of, and payment by Merger Sub for, any shares
of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger and ending six years from the
Effective Time; _provided_ that all rights to indemnification in respect of
any Proceeding asserted or made within such period shall continue until the
final disposition of such Proceeding.

 

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company or Parent (following
reasonable consultation with the Company and with the Companys assistance
and cooperation) may obtain and fully pay the premium for "tail" directors
and officers liability insurance policies in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions
occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions) for the period beginning upon the Effective
Time and ending six years from the Effective Time, covering each Indemnified
Party and containing terms (including with respect to coverage and amounts)
and conditions (including with respect to deductibles and exclusions) that are
in the aggregate, no less favorable to any Indemnified Party than those of the
Companys directors and officers liability insurance policies in effect on
the date of this Agreement (the " _Existing D andO Policies_"); _provided_ that
the aggregate cost of any such "tail" insurance policies shall not exceed
350%

 



46  of the aggregate annual premium paid by the Company for the Existing DandO
Policies (which amount the Company represents and warrants is set forth in
_Section 5.06(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter). If such "tail"
insurance policies have been obtained, Parent shall cause such "tail"
insurance policies to be maintained in full force and effect, for their full
term, and cause all of its obligations thereunder to be honored by it and the
Surviving Corporation. In the event that such "tail" insurance policies are
not obtained, then, for the period beginning upon the Effective Time and
ending six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect the
Existing DandO Policies in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection
with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions); _provided_ that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall be required to pay an aggregate annual premium for such insurance
policies in excess of 350% of the annual premium paid by the Company for the
Existing DandO Policies; _provided_ _further_ that if the annual premium of
such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to obtain the most advantageous policies
available for an annual premium equal to such amount; and _provided_
_further_ that Parent may substitute therefor policies of a reputable and
financially sound insurance company containing terms (including with respect
to coverage and amounts) and conditions (including with respect to
deductibles and exclusions) that are, individually and in the aggregate, no
less favorable to any Indemnified Party.

and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that

(e) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this 
_Section 5.06_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this _Section 5.06_ applies
without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party. The provisions of
this  _Section 5.06_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her
representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any

_Section 5.06_, this  _Section 5.07_ and _Section 5.09_, all fees and

Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not the Merger is consummated.

47 (i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.01(f)_;

(ii) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(c)_; or

 

(iii) after the date of this Agreement, a Company Takeover Proposal is

terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 7.01(b)(i)_
or _Section 7.01(h)_ or by Parent pursuant to  _Section 7.01(d)_ or
_Section 7.01(g)_ and (B) within twelve months after such termination the
Company enters into a definite agreement to consummate, or consummates, a

to 20% shall be deemed references to 50%. Any fee due under this _Section
5.07(b)_ shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds to an
account designated by Parent, (1) in the case of clause (i) above, prior to

Fee shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub
against the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective current,
former or future Representatives for any loss suffered as a result of the
failure of the Transactions to be consummated, and upon payment of
the Company Termination Fee, none of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
or any of their respective current, former or future Representatives shall
have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing

therefor, all reasonably documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred
by Parent, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates in connection with the
Transactions (not to exceed $20,000,000) (the " _Parent Expenses_ "). To

 



48  the extent either Parent or the Company terminates pursuant to _Section
7.01(h)_ or Parent terminates pursuant to _Sections 7.01(d)_ or _7.01(g)_ ,
and thereafter the Company becomes obligated to pay Parent the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 5.07(b)(iii)_ after having paid Parent
any amount in Parent Expenses pursuant to this _Section 5.07(d)_, the Company
shall be obligated to pay only such portion of the Company Termination Fee
that exceeds the amount paid by the Company to Parent in Parent Expenses
pursuant to this _Section 5.07(d)_.

and their respective Representatives from and against any and
all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses (including

foregoing that result from fraud or intentional misconduct by the Company or

Agreement in connection with any dispute between the parties regarding this
Agreement.

or that does not contain a full release of Parent and its affiliates. Each of

other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if". The word

Agreement.

 

Section 8.05 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full

invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 8.06 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or

Section 8.07 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries; No Other
Representations or Warranties_. (a) This Agreement, the Voting Agreement and

Confidentiality Agreement and (ii) except for _Section 5.06_, are not
intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties any rights or
remedies. Notwithstanding clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence,

64 (b) Except for the representations and warranties contained in _Article II_ ,
each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that neither the Company nor any
Person on behalf of the Company makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or with respect to any other information made available to
Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the Transactions. Neither the Company
nor any other Person will have or be subject to any liability or
indemnification obligation to Parent, Merger Sub or any other
Person resulting from the distribution to Parent or Merger Sub, or Parents
or Merger Subs use of, any projections or forecasts made available to Parent
or Merger Sub in certain "data rooms" or management presentations in
expectation of the Transactions, unless and then only to the extent that any
such information is expressly included in a representation or warranty
contained in _Article III_.

 

(c) Except for the representations and warranties contained in _Article III_ ,
the Company acknowledges that none of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person

with the Transactions.

Section 8.08 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles
of conflicts of laws thereof.

 

Section 8.09 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties; _provided_ that Merger Sub may
assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests
and obligations under this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Merger
Sub of any of its obligations under this Agreement; _provided_ _further_ that
no such assignment shall materially impede or delay the consummation of the
Transactions. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void.
Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective
successors and assigns.

Section 8.10 _Specific Enforcement; Jurisdiction_. (a) The parties
acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, or any other appropriate form of equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court referred to in _Section
8.10(b)_, without proof of damages or otherwise (and each party hereby waives
any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with
such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. The right to

 



65  specific enforcement shall include the right of the Company to cause Parent
and Merger Sub to cause the Merger and the other Transactions to be
consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any
reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the right of
specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without such
right, none of the parties would have entered into this Agreement. If, prior
to the Outside Date, any party brings any Proceeding, in each case in
accordance with _Section 8.10(b)_, to enforce specifically the performance of
the terms and provisions hereof by any other party to consummate the
Transactions, and at such time all conditions to each partys obligations to
Closing are satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing or are capable of being satisfied at
the Closing or those conditions that relate to the subject matter of the
Proceeding for specific performance), the Outside Date shall automatically be
extended by (i) the amount of time during which such Proceeding is pending,
plus five business days or (ii) such other time period established by the
court presiding over such Proceeding, as the case may be.

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania (and, to the extent the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania does not have subject matter jurisdiction,
the jurisdiction of the courts of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in
Philadelphia County) (the " _Chosen Courts_ "), for the purpose of any
Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the actions of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the negotiation, administration,
performance and enforcement thereof, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably agrees that all claims with respect to such Proceeding may be
heard and determined exclusively in the Chosen Courts. Each of the parties
hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the
Chosen Courts in the event any Proceeding arises out of this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the other Transactions, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt
to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for
leave from any such Chosen Court, (iii) irrevocably consents to the service of
process in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the other Transactions, on behalf of itself or its property,
by U.S. registered mail, (A) in the case of the Company, to the Companys
address set forth in _Section 8.02_, and (B), in the case of Parent or
Merger Sub, to the Process Agent in accordance with _Section 8.10(c)_ (
_provided_ that nothing in this _Section 8.10(b)_ shall affect the right of
any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law) and
(iv) agrees that it will not bring any Proceeding relating to this Agreement,
the Merger or any of the other Transactions in any court other than the Chosen
Courts. The parties hereto agree that a final trial court Judgment in any
such Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the Judgment or in any other manner provided by Law;
_provided_ that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any partys rights to
seek any post-Judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial
court Judgment.

(c) Parent and Merger Sub hereby irrevocably designate AAAgent Services, LLC
(in such capacity, the " _Process Agent_ "), with an office at 125 Locust
Street, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, 17101, as its designee, appointee and agent
to receive, for and on its behalf service of process in any
Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of
the other Transactions, and such service shall be deemed

 



66  complete upon delivery thereof to the Process Agent; _provided_ that in the
case of any such service upon the process agent, the party effecting such
service shall also deliver a copy thereof to each other such party in the
manner provided in _Section 8.02_ of this Agreement. Parent shall take all
such action as may be necessary to continue said appointment in full force and
effect or to appoint another agent so that Parent will at all times have an
agent for service of process for the above purposes in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania.

(d) This  _Section 8.10_ shall not be construed as a waiver of the parties
right to seek enforcement of a decision of the Chosen Courts before any other
courts, whether in the United States or abroad.

 

Section 8.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any Proceeding arising out of this Agreement, the Merger
or any other Transaction. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event
of any Proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges
that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this
Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in
this _Section 8.11_.

Section 8.12 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the
rights and remedies provided in this Agreement shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by applicable Law, and the
exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy.

Section 8.13 _Cooperation_. The parties agree to provide reasonable
cooperation with each other and to execute and deliver such further
documents, certificates, agreements and instruments and to take such actions
as may be reasonably requested by the other parties to evidence or effect the

officer of the Corporation, or predecessor of the Corporation, as applicable,
or in any other capacity on behalf of the Corporation while such person is or
was serving as a director or executive officer of the Corporation, or

director or executive officer of the Corporation in advance of the final
disposition of a proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an
undertaking, by or on behalf of such person, to repay all amounts so advanced
if and to the extent it shall ultimately be determined by a court that he or
she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation under this Article 11
or otherwise.

(d) The right to indemnification and advancement of expenses provided herein
shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or executive
officer of the Corporation or to serve in any of the other capacities
described herein, and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such person.

 

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, Articles 9 through
12 hereof shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six (6) years from the date hereof in any manner that would adversely
affect any right thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the date
hereof, were directors, officers, employees or agents (including as a
fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan) of any predecessor
corporation of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or any of their
respective predecessors.

Article 11 hereof is not paid in full by the Corporation within thirty (30)
days after a written claim therefor has been received by the Corporation, the
claimant may, at any time thereafter, bring suit against the Corporation to
recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in
part on the merits or otherwise in establishing his or her right to
indemnification or to the advancement of expenses, the claimant shall be

of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of a final
disposition conferred in Article 11 and the right to payment of expenses
conferred in Article 12 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to
which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses hereunder may
be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders, vote of
directors or otherwise, both as to actions in his or her official capacity and
as to actions in any other capacity while holding that office, the Corporation
having the express authority to enter into such agreements or arrangements as
the Board of Directors deems appropriate for the indemnification of and
