AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  

  

  

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of May 1, 2011 (this "Agreement"),
is among Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., an Israeli corporation
("Parent"), Copper Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and an indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Cephalon, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company").

  

  

WHEREAS, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Merger Sub will, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), merge with and into the Company, with the
Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the "Merger");

  

  

WHEREAS, (i) the respective boards of directors of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub have approved the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and (ii) the respective boards of directors of the Company and
Merger Sub have resolved that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL), are advisable and in the best interests of their
respective stockholders; and

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
hereby agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE I

  

  

THE MERGER

  

  

  

Section 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and the Company shall
be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").

  

  

Section 1.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, Four Times
Square, New York, New York 10036 at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the
date that is two (2) Business Days following the satisfaction or waiver (to
the extent permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article
VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at
such time), or such other date, time, or place is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to
in this Agreement as the "Closing Date."

  

  

Section 1.3 Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
soon as practicable on the Closing Date the parties shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger, executed
in accordance with, and in such form as is required by, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL (the "Certificate of Merger"). The Merger shall become
effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger or at such later time
as is agreed to by the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of
Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective is herein referred to
as the "Effective Time").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 1.4 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

  

Section 1.5 Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and by-
laws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to be in the form of
(except with respect to the name of the Company) the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of Merger Sub attached hereto as Exhibit A and as
amended shall be the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law
(and subject to Section 5.8 hereof).

  

  

Section 1.6 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(a) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the
Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

  

(b) The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors
are duly appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation.

  

  

  

ARTICLE II

  

  

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS;
EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS

  

  

Section 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or any
holder of any shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company ("Company Common Stock") or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

  

  

  

(a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. Any shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock, and any
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub, shall be
automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

  

  

(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock (other than (i) shares to be canceled in accordance with
Section 2.1(b), and (ii) Dissenting Shares) shall thereupon be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to $81.50 without interest (the "Merger Consideration").
As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and the holders immediately prior to the Effective Time of shares of
Company Common Stock not represented by certificates ("Book-Entry Shares") and
the holders of certificates, which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate"),
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon
surrender of such Book-Entry Share or Certificate in accordance with Section
2.2, without interest (subject to any applicable withholding Tax).

  

  

Section 2.2 Exchange of Certificates.

  

  

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the
"Paying Agent") to receive, for the benefit of holders of shares of Company
Common Stock, the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of shares of
Company Common Stock shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.1. Parent
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, such aggregate Merger Consideration
with the Paying Agent at or prior to the Effective Time. Such aggregate Merger
Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent shall, pending its disbursement
to such holders, be invested by the Paying Agent in (i) short-term direct
obligations of the United States of America or (ii) short-term obligations for
which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to
provide for the payment of principal and interest. Any interest and other
income from such investments in excess of the amounts necessary to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration shall be the sole and exclusive property of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation and shall be paid promptly to Parent or
the Surviving Corporation as directed by Parent. No investment by the Paying
Agent of the aggregate Merger Consideration shall relieve Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by
this Article II and Parent shall promptly replace any funds deposited with the
Paying Agent lost through any investment made pursuant to this paragraph. No
investment by the Paying Agent of the aggregate Merger Consideration shall
have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to
this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Payment Procedures. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in no event more than five (5) Business Days thereafter),
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder
of record of Company Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which, in the
case of shares of Company Common Stock represented by Certificates, shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and
the Company may reasonably agree and shall be prepared prior to Closing) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for
payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the Paying Agent or
receipt of an "agent's message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence,
if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of
Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions (and such other
customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the
holder of such Certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, subject to any
required withholding taxes, the Merger Consideration, without interest, for
each share of Company Common Stock surrendered, and any such Certificates (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares shall forthwith be
canceled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate (or affidavit
of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (x) the Person requesting
such exchange present proper evidence of transfer or shall otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall have
paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share
surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate and
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated
by this Article II, without interest.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock. The Merger
Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon the
surrender for exchange in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the shares of Company Common Stock, and at the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall (automatically, and without further action
by any Person) be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares that evidenced ownership of shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except as
otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. Subject to the last
sentence of Section 2.2(e), if, at any time after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

  

  

(d) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company
Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this
Article II.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Termination of Fund. At any time following the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with
respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and which
have not been disbursed in accordance with this Article II, and thereafter
Persons entitled to receive payment pursuant to this Article II shall be
entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with
respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon
surrender of any Company Common Stock held by such holders, as determined
pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall
become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

  

  

(f) No Liability. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of Parent, the Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the
Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

  

(g) Withholding Taxes. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Code"),
or under any applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. If any
withholding obligation may be avoided or reduced by such holder providing
information or documentation to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, such holder shall be permitted to provide such information or
documentation in order to avoid or reduce any such withholding. To the extent
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, the
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

  

  

Section 2.3 Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a stockholder
who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and
who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with the provisions of, Section
262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Stockholders"), shall not be converted into
or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration (the
"Dissenting Shares"), but shall instead be converted solely into the right to
receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting
Stockholder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time,
such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such Dissenting Stockholder shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights set forth in
Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such Dissenting Stockholder shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost rights to
appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such
Dissenting Stockholder's shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be
treated as if they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the
right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each
such share of Company Common Stock, in accordance with Section 2.1, without
any interest thereon, and such shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting
Shares. The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice, together with copies,
of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to stockholders'
rights of appraisal, and (b) Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle any
such demands or waive any failure to properly make or effect any such
appraisal demand or other action required to perfect appraisal rights in
accordance with the DGCL, or agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

Section 2.4 Company Stock Options and Restricted Stock.

  

  

(a) Each option that represents the right to acquire shares of Company Common
Stock granted under the Company Plans which is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (whether or not then vested or exercisable) (each, an
"Option") shall at the Effective Time be cancelled and terminated at the
Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive a cash amount equal to the
Option Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock then subject to
the Option. The Option Consideration shall be paid by the Surviving
Corporation within two (2) Business Days of the Closing Date. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Option Consideration" means, with respect to any share of
Company Common Stock issuable under a particular Option, an amount equal to
the excess, if any, of (i) the Merger Consideration per share of Company
Common Stock over (ii) the exercise price payable in respect of such share of
Company Common Stock issuable under such Option; provided, however, that if
the exercise price per share of any such Option is equal to or greater than
the per share Merger Consideration, such Option shall be canceled without any
cash payment being made in respect thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Warrants are not options granted under the Company Plans.

  

  

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock issued pursuant to any Company Stock
Plan that is subject to specified vesting criteria (each, a share of
"Restricted Stock") which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall at the Effective Time become fully vested and be treated in
accordance with Section 2.1.

  

  

(c) The right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock under the ESPP is not
an Option for purposes of this Agreement. As soon as practicable following the
date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors (or, if appropriate, any
committee administering the ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or take such
other actions as may be required to provide that, with respect to the ESPP:
(i) each individual participating in the Offering Period (as defined in the
ESPP) in progress as of the date of this Agreement (the "Final Offering")
shall not be permitted (x) to increase the amount of his or her rate of
payroll contributions thereunder from the rate in effect when the Final
Offering commenced, or (y) to make separate non-payroll contributions to the
ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement; (ii) each individual
participating in the Offering Period (as defined in the ESPP) in progress as
of the date of this Agreement shall receive notice of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement no later than ten (10) days prior to the
Closing Date and shall have an opportunity to terminate his or her outstanding
purchase rights under the ESPP; (iii) no individual who is not participating
in the ESPP as of the date of this Agreement may commence participation in the
ESPP following the date of this Agreement; (iv) the Final Offering shall end
on June 30, 2011; (v) each ESPP participant's accumulated contributions under
the ESPP shall be used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of the ESPP as of the end of the Final Offering;
(vi) the applicable purchase price for Company Common Stock as set forth in
the ESPP shall not be decreased below the levels set forth in the ESPP as of
the date of this Agreement, and (vii) the ESPP shall terminate immediately
following the end of the Final Offering and no further rights shall be granted
or exercised under the ESPP thereafter.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Section 2.4 to any holder of
Options and shares of Restricted Stock such amounts as the Surviving
Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, or any applicable provision of state, or local
Tax Law, and the Surviving Corporation shall make any required filings with
and payments to Tax authorities relating to any such deduction or withholding.
To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving
Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for the purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Options or Restricted Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Corporation.

  

  

(e) No later than the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to
be provided, to the Surviving Corporation all funds necessary to fulfill the
obligations under this Section 2.4.

  

  

Section 2.5 Adjustments. Notwithstanding any provision of this Article II to
the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence or
record date of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, exchange or readjustment of shares or
similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted
to reflect such change.

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite
corporate power and authority necessary to own or lease all of its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The
Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or
in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or
reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined
below). For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Material Adverse Effect"
shall mean any change, event, occurrence, circumstance or effect that,
individually or in the aggregate with any other change, event, occurrence,
circumstance or effect, (a) is materially adverse to the business, results of
operations or financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole or (b) prevents, materially delays or materially impairs the ability
of the Company to consummate the Merger; provided, however, that, in the case
of clause (a), Company Material Adverse Effect shall not include any change,
event, occurrence, fact, circumstance or effect arising out of, resulting from
or attributable to the following: (i) any condition, change, event, occurrence
or effect in any of the industries or markets in which the Company or its
Subsidiaries operate; (ii) any enactment of, change in, or change in
interpretation of, any Law (including the rules, regulations and policies of
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") and the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration (the "DEA")) or GAAP; (iii) any changes in general
economic, regulatory or political conditions (or changes therein) or
conditions (or changes therein) in the financial, credit or securities markets
(including changes in interest or currency exchange rates) in any country or
region in which the Company or its Subsidiaries conduct business; (iv) the
results of pre-clinical and clinical testing or the determination by, or the
delay of a determination by, the FDA (or any panel or advisory committee
empowered or appointed thereby), in each case, after the date of this
Agreement, with respect to the approval or non-approval of any Company Product
which has not, as of the date of this Agreement, been approved or cleared by
the FDA; (v) any of the matters referred to under the headings "Provigil
Patent Litigation and Settlements," "Amrix Patent Litigation," and "Fentora
Patent Litigation" in Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Part II, Item 8 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed
on February 11, 2011, including adverse developments relating to such matters,
but subject to compliance with Section 5.1(xvi); (vi) any acts of God, natural
disasters, terrorism, armed hostilities, sabotage, war or any escalation or
worsening of acts of terrorism, armed hostilities or war; (vii) the identity
of Parent or Merger Sub, the announcement or pendency of this Agreement or the
Transactions or the consummation of the Transactions; (viii) any action taken
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or with the consent or at the
direction of Parent or Merger Sub; (ix) any decline in the market price, or
change in trading volume, of the capital stock of the Company (provided that
the underlying causes of such decline or change may be considered in
determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred); (x) any
failure by the Company or its Subsidiaries, in and of itself, to meet
internal, analysts' or other earnings estimates or financial projections or
forecasts for any period, or any changes in credit ratings and any changes in
any analysts recommendations or ratings with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (provided that the underlying causes of such decline or
change may be considered in determining whether a Company Material Adverse
Effect has occurred); and (xi) any pending, initiated or threatened legal or
administrative proceeding, claim, suit or action against the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers or directors, in each
case, arising out of or relating to (A) the execution of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or (B) the attempt and proposal by Valeant
Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. ("Valeant") to acquire the Company or the
consent solicitation related thereto, as such proposal or consent solicitation
may be amended from time to time; provided, that with respect to the foregoing
clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (vi), any effects resulting from any change,
event, occurrence, circumstance or effect that has a disproportionate effect
on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other
comparable companies in the industry in which the Company and its Subsidiaries
operate shall be counted for purposes of determining whether a Company
Material Adverse Effect has occurred, but only to the extent of such
disproportionate effect.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Each of the Company's subsidiaries that constitutes a "significant
subsidiary" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X
under the Exchange Act ("Significant Subsidiary") is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization, except where the failure to be in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. All the outstanding shares of capital stock
of, or other equity interests in, each such Significant Subsidiary (except for
directors' qualifying shares or the like) are owned directly or indirectly by
the Company free and clear of all liens, pledges, security interests and
transfer restrictions, except for such transfer restrictions of general
applicability as may be provided under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Securities Act"),
and other applicable securities laws.

  

  

(c) The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of
the certificate of incorporation and by-laws, in each case as amended to the
date of this Agreement, of (i) the Company, (the "Company Charter Documents")
and (ii) each Significant Subsidiary (the "Subsidiary Charter Documents"). The
Company Charter Documents and the Subsidiary Charter Documents are in full
force and effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Significant Subsidiaries
nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any of the other parties thereto, is in
violation of any material provision of such organizational or governing
documents, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or
reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

consummation by it of the Transactions. This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery hereof by the other parties hereto, constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the

violate any Law applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by
which any property or asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound
or affected or (iii) result in any breach of, or constitute a default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to any right of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, any Contract to which
the Company or any Significant Subsidiary is a party, or result in the
creation of a Lien, other than any Permitted Lien, upon any of the properties
or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than, in the case of
clauses (ii) and (iii), as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have

the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
pursuant to the DGCL, (iii) the filing of all applications, consents,

(a) Since January 1, 2010, the Company has filed with or furnished to the SEC,
on a timely basis, all filings required to made by the Company, including all
required registration statements, forms, agreements (oral or written), reports
and proxy statements (collectively, and in each case including all exhibits
and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein, as such
statements and reports may have been amended since the date of their filing,
the "Company SEC Documents"). As of their respective effective dates (in the
case of Company SEC Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant
to the requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their respective SEC
filing dates (in the case of all other Company SEC Documents), the Company SEC
Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the
"Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of
the SEC thereunder, applicable to such Company SEC Documents, and none of the
Company SEC Documents as of such respective dates (or, if amended prior to the
date of this Agreement, the date of the filing of such amendment, with respect
to the disclosures that are amended) contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of
this Agreement, except in respect of solicitation materials filed by the
Company with the SEC in connection with the consent solicitation by Valeant,
(i) there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters
received from the SEC staff with respect to the Company SEC Documents and (ii)
to the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Company SEC Documents is the

16  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Except to the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a
subsequent Company SEC Document, as of their respective dates of filing with
the SEC, the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries included in the Company SEC Documents (i) complied as to form in

the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC), (ii)
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
during the periods involved (except (A) as may be indicated in the notes
thereto or (B) as permitted by Regulation S-X) and (iii) present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, and the results of their operations and cash flows, for each
of the dates and for the periods shown, in conformity with GAAP.

  

  

(c) The Company and its Subsidiaries have implemented and maintain a system of
internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company's management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal
controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2010 and
the description of such assessment set forth in the Company's Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 is accurate in all
material respects. The Company (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act)
designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company,
including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the Chief Executive Officer and
the Chief Financial Officer of the Company by others within those entities,
and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date
hereof, to the Company's outside auditors and the audit committee of the Board
of Directors (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Company's internal controls over financial reporting.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any
structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on
the other hand), or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result, purpose or intended
effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in the Company SEC Documents.

  

  

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities debts,
liabilities and obligations, whether accrued or fixed, absolute or contingent,

Law and those arising under any Contract which would be required to be
reflected or reserved against on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company
prepared in accordance with GAAP or the notes thereto, except for liabilities

Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 (the "Balance Sheet Date") (including the
notes thereto) included in the Filed Company SEC Documents, (ii) incurred
after the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice, (iii) as contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise in
connection with the Transactions or (iv) that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 3.6 Absence of Certain Changes. Between January 1, 2011 and the date
of this Agreement, (a) except for the negotiation, execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement, the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has been conducted in all material respects in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice and (b) there has not been
any change, event, occurrence, set of facts, development or effect that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 3.7 Legal Proceedings. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened, legal or administrative proceeding, arbitration, inquiry,
claim, investigation, suit or action ("Action") against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, nor is there any injunction, order, judgment, ruling, writ
or decree imposed upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case,
by or before (or that is reasonably likely to come before) any Governmental
Authority, that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably

assistance of Parent) and file a preliminary Proxy Statement as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the date hereof (and in any event within 20
Business Days of the date of this Agreement), with the SEC and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to respond (with the assistance of Parent) to any
comments of the SEC or its staff, and to cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to the Company's stockholders as promptly as practicable after the
Proxy Statement has been cleared by the SEC for mailing to the Company's
stockholders. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information and will promptly supply Parent with copies of all correspondence
between the Company or any of the Company's Representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement or the Transactions. If at any time prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting there shall occur any event that should be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly
notify Parent of such occurrence and promptly prepare (with the assistance of
Parent) and mail to its stockholders such an amendment or supplement, in each
case to the extent required by applicable Law. Parent shall cooperate with the
Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of
Parent and Merger Sub will furnish to the Company the information relating to
it required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Proxy Statement. Prior
to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the
Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such document or response; provided, however, that the requirement
set forth in this sentence shall not apply with respect to a Takeover
Proposal, a Superior Proposal, a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or any
matters relating thereto. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
ensure that the Proxy Statement complies as to form in all material respects
with the requirements of the Exchange Act.

Section 5.3 No Solicitation; Change in Recommendation.

  

  

(a) The Company agrees that it shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries,
directors, officers and employees to, and shall direct and use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its other Representatives to, immediately cease all
existing discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Parent and
its Affiliates) conducted heretofore with respect to any proposal that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal,
and request from each Person that has executed a confidentiality agreement
with the Company the prompt return or destruction of all confidential
information previously furnished to such Person or its Representatives and
terminate access by each such Person and its Representatives to any online or
other data rooms containing any non-public information in respect of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Except as expressly permitted in this
Section 5.3, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the date, if any on which this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 7.1, the Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and employees to, and shall direct and use
its reasonable best efforts to cause its other Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate, any Takeover Proposal or the making or consummation
thereof by any Person (other than Parent), including by approving any
transaction, or approving any Person (other than Parent and Merger Sub)
becoming an "interested stockholder" for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL),
(ii) enter into, or otherwise participate in any discussions (except to notify
such Person of the existence of the provisions of this Section 5.3) or
negotiations regarding any Takeover Proposal, (iii) furnish to any Person any
information concerning the Company, or any access to the properties, books and
records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in connection with, any Takeover
Proposal, or (iv) propose, agree or publicly announce an intention to take any
of the foregoing actions or any other action which would reasonably be
expected to lead to, encourage or facilitate a Takeover Proposal. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company agrees that in the event any Subsidiary of
the Company or any of its and their respective Representatives takes any
action which, if taken by the Company, would constitute a violation of this
Section 5.3, the Company shall be deemed to be in breach of this Section 5.3.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.3, if at
any time after the date hereof and prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company or its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective
Representatives receives a written Takeover Proposal, the Company, its Board
of Directors and Representatives may engage in negotiations and discussions
with, and furnish any information (so long as all such information has
previously been made available to Parent or is made available to Parent prior
to or concurrently with the time such information is made available to such
Person) and other access to, any Person making such Takeover Proposal and its
Representatives if, and only if, the Company's Board of Directors determines
in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal and
financial advisors, that (i) such Takeover Proposal would reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure of the Board of
Directors of the Company to furnish such information or access or enter into
such discussions or negotiations would reasonably be expected to be a
violation of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Law; provided that prior to furnishing any material nonpublic
information, the Company receives from the Person making such Takeover
Proposal an executed confidentiality agreement with terms at least as
restrictive in all material respects on such Person as the Confidentiality
Agreement is on Parent (excluding the "standstill" provisions and paragraph 2
thereof and except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement), which
confidentiality agreement shall not prohibit the Company from complying with
the terms of this Section 5.3. The Company will promptly (i) notify Parent in
writing of the receipt of such Takeover Proposal and (ii) communicate the
material terms of such Takeover Proposal to Parent. The Company will keep
Parent reasonably apprised of the status of and other matters relating to any
such Takeover Proposal on a timely basis (including by providing the name of
the Person making such Takeover Proposal and copies of material written
proposals relating to the terms of such Takeover Proposal). Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall notify Parent in advance of
beginning to provide information to any third party related to a Takeover
Proposal or beginning discussions with a third party related to a Takeover
Proposal. In addition, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of
the Effective Time or the date, if any on which this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 7.1, the Company shall not terminate, amend, modify or
waive any provision of any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and shall enforce,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the provisions of any
such agreement, including by obtaining injunctions to prevent any breaches of
such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof
in any court of the United States of America or of any state having
jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Company shall be permitted to terminate, amend, modify, waive
or fail to enforce any provision of any confidentiality, "standstill" or
similar obligation of any Person if the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be a
violation of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Law.

  

  

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.3, neither the Company nor
the Board of Directors of the Company shall (i)(A) withdraw, modify or
qualify, or publicly propose to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approval of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, or the Company Board
Recommendation or (B) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, to the stockholders of the Company any Takeover Proposal (any
action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "Company Adverse
Recommendation Change") or (ii) authorize, approve, recommend or declare
advisable, or propose to adopt, approve, recommend or declare advisable, or
allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement,
option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or similar
agreement with respect to, or that is intended to or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to in Section 5.3(b) pursuant to and in accordance with the
limitations set forth therein).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of
the Company may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (and, solely with
respect to a Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(d)(ii)), if either (A)(1) the Board of Directors of the Company receives a
written Takeover Proposal from any Person that is not withdrawn and (2) the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation
with its independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or (B) a material
development or material change in circumstances occurs or arises after the
date of this Agreement that was not known by the Board of Directors of the
Company as of the date of this Agreement and does not relate to (i) a Takeover
Proposal or (ii) a material development or material change in circumstances of
Parent, that does not also relate to the Company, in the case of either clause
(A) or clause (B) of this Section 5.3(d), if and only if:

  

  

(i) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of
Directors of the Company to take such action would reasonably be expected to
be a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and

  

  

(ii) solely with respect to clause (A) above of this Section 5.3(d) with
respect to a Superior Proposal:

  

  

(1) the Company provides Parent prior written notice of its intent to make any
such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) at least four (4) Business Days prior to taking
such action, to the effect that the Board of Directors of the Company has
received a Superior Proposal and, absent any revision to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company has
resolved to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii), which notice shall specify the
basis for such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or termination, including
the material terms of the Superior Proposal (a "Notice of Superior Proposal")
(it being understood that such Notice of Superior Proposal shall not in itself
be deemed a Company Adverse Recommendation Change);

  

  

(2) during such four (4) Business Day period, the Company negotiates in good
faith with Parent (to the extent that Parent wishes to negotiate) to enable
Parent to make an offer that is at least as favorable to the stockholders of
the Company so that such Takeover Proposal would cease to constitute a
Superior Proposal;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(3) Parent does not, within such four (4) Business Day period, make an offer
that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel,
to be an offer such that such Takeover Proposal would cease to constitute a
Superior Proposal (provided that, in the event of any amendment to the
financial (including form of consideration) or other material terms of such
Takeover Proposal, the Company shall deliver to Parent a new written Notice of
Superior Proposal and shall comply with the requirements of this Section
5.3(d) with respect to such new Notice of Superior Proposal); and

  

  

(4) the Company's Board of Directors, after taking into account any
modifications to the terms of this Agreement and the Merger agreed to by
Parent and Merger Sub after receipt of such notice, continues to believe that
such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal.

  

  

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Board of Directors of the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the
shareholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the
Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation
M-A or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any disclosure to the
shareholders of the Company if the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure of the Company to make such disclosure would reasonably be
expected to be a violation of applicable Law or (iii) informing any Person of
the existence of the provisions contained in this Section 5.3; provided that
any Company Adverse Recommendation Change may only be made in accordance with
Section 5.3(d); it being understood that neither (A) a "stop, look and listen"
communication to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the shareholders of
the Company) nor (B) a Distribution Date Delay (or a Form 8-K or other
disclosure in respect thereof) shall be deemed to be or constitute a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change.

  

  

(f) As used in this Agreement, "Takeover Proposal" shall mean any bona fide
proposal or offer (whether in writing or otherwise) from any Person (other
than Parent, Merger Sub and any of its Affiliates thereof) relating to, or
that is reasonably expected to lead to, any direct or indirect purchase or
acquisition, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, of (A)
any assets or businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including
securities of Subsidiaries) that constitute 20% or more of the Company's
consolidated assets or to which 20% or more of the Company's revenues, net
income or earnings before interest expense, taxes depreciation and
amortization on a consolidated basis are attributable, or (B) beneficial
ownership (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of 20% or more
of any class of equity securities of the Company pursuant to a merger,
consolidation or other business combination, sale of shares of capital stock,
tender offer, exchange offer, license agreement or similar transaction.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(g) As used in this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona fide
written Takeover Proposal on terms which the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal
counsel and independent financial advisors, and taking into account all the
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such Takeover Proposal,
would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable to the
holders of Company Common Stock from a financial point of view than the
Transactions (in each case, taking into account any revisions to this
Agreement made or proposed by Parent); provided that for purposes of the
definition of "Superior Proposal", the references to "20%" in the definition
of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

  

  

(h) For the avoidance of doubt, (i) nothing contained in this Section 5.3
shall restrict the ability of the Company and its Representatives from, in
connection with Valeant's existing consent solicitation and any of the
Company's consent revocation solicitations in connection therewith, or any
consent solicitation commenced after the date hereof by any third party
(including Valeant), whether or not in connection with a Takeover Proposal,
continuing to solicit consent revocations and to make statements in connection
therewith consistent with the statements that have been made by the Company in
its solicitation materials filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof or
other statements deemed necessary or desirable by the Company in good faith in
connection with such consent revocation solicitations and (ii) no Company
Adverse Recommendation Change shall change the approval of the Company's Board
of Directors for purposes of causing any Takeover Provision to be inapplicable
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(i) Except with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company shall not (i) redeem
the Rights (as defined in the Rights Agreement), (ii) amend the Rights
Agreement or (iii) take any action which would allow any Person (as defined in
the Rights Agreement) other than Parent or Merger Sub to acquire "Beneficial
Ownership" (solely for purposes of this Section 5.3(i), as defined in the
Rights Agreement) of 20% or more of the Common Stock (as defined in the Rights
Agreement) without causing a "Distribution Date," a "Stock Acquisition Date"
or a "Flip-In Event" (as each such term is defined in the Rights Agreement) to
occur; provided, that the Board of Directors of the Company shall be permitted
to postpone the "Distribution Date" with respect to any Person that commences
or announces an intent to commence a tender or exchange offer to acquire
shares of Company Common Stock (a "Distribution Date Delay").

  

  

Section 5.4 Reasonable Best Efforts.

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) use their respective reasonable best
efforts to (A) cause the Transactions to be consummated as soon as
practicable, (B) make promptly any required submissions and filings under
applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions, (C) promptly
furnish information required in connection with such submissions and filing
under such Antitrust Laws, (D) keep the other parties reasonably informed with
respect to the status of any such submissions and filings under Antitrust
Laws, including with respect to: (1) the receipt of any non-action, action,
clearance, consent, approval or waiver, (2) the expiration of any waiting
period, (3) the commencement or proposed or threatened commencement of any
investigation, litigation or administrative or judicial action or proceeding
under Antitrust Laws and (4) the nature and status of any objections raised or
proposed or threatened to be raised under Antitrust Laws with respect to the
Transactions and (E) obtain all actions or non-actions, approvals, consents,
waivers, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from
any Governmental Authority or third party necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Transactions as soon as practicable. For purposes hereof,
"Antitrust Laws" means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, the EC
Merger Regulation, and all other applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws and all
other applicable Laws issued by a Governmental Authority that are designed or
intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition
through merger or acquisition.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing: (i) each party
hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as soon as
practicable and in any event within ten (10) business days of the date hereof
(unless the parties otherwise agree to a different date), and to supply as
soon as practicable any additional information and documentary material that
may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions consistent with this Section
5.4 necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act (including any extensions thereof) as soon as
practicable; (ii) Parent agrees to file with the European Commission as soon
as practicable the Form CO, if any, required for the Transactions pursuant to
the EC Merger Regulation and to supply as soon as practical any additional
information and documentary material that may be required or requested by the
European Commission and use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be
taken all other actions consistent with this Section 5.4 necessary to obtain
any necessary approvals, consents, waivers, permits, authorizations or other
actions or non-actions from the European Commission as soon as practicable.
The parties agree that they will use their reasonable best efforts to ensure
that they have "substantially complied" with any "second request" for
information from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") or U.S. Department
of Justice ("DOJ") or similar request by the European Commission or other
Governmental Authority under any Foreign Antitrust Law by October 15, 2011 if
such compliance is required for clearance or approval.

  

  

(c) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall: (i) promptly notify the others
of, and if in writing, furnish the others with copies of (or, in the case of
oral communications, advise the others of the contents of) any communication
to such Person from a Governmental Authority concerning the Transactions and
permit the others to review and discuss in advance (and to consider in good
faith any comments made by the others in relation to) any proposed written
communication to a Governmental Authority concerning the Transactions, (ii)
keep the others reasonably informed of any developments, meetings or
discussions with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings,
investigation, or inquiry concerning the Transactions, including any
settlement discussions, and (iii) not independently participate in any meeting
or discussions with a Governmental Authority in respect of any filings,
investigation or inquiry concerning the Transactions without giving the other
party prior notice of such meeting or discussions and, unless prohibited by
such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate.
However, each of Parent and Company may designate any non-public,
competitively-sensitive information provided to any Governmental Authority as
restricted to "Outside Antitrust Counsel" only and any such information shall
not be shared with employees, officers or directors or their equivalents of
the other party without approval of the party providing the non-public
information.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent and Merger
Sub agree to take promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid, eliminate or
resolve each and every impediment and obtain all clearances, consents,
approvals and waivers under Antitrust Laws that may be required by any
Governmental Authority, so as to enable the parties to close the Transactions
as soon as practicable (and in any event no later than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Walk-Away Date), including (i) committing to or effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate orders, trust, or otherwise, the sale, license
or other disposition of assets or businesses of Parent or Company or their
respective Subsidiaries, (ii) terminating, relinquishing, modifying, or
waiving existing relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or
other arrangements of Parent or Company or their respective Subsidiaries and
(iii) creating any relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or
other arrangements of Parent or Company or their respective Subsidiaries (and,
in each case, to enter, or offer to enter, into agreements and stipulate to
the entry of an order or decree or file appropriate applications with any
Governmental Authority in connection with any of the foregoing and in the case
of actions by or with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or
their businesses or assets, by consenting to such action by the Company;
provided, however, that any such action may, at the discretion of the Company,
be conditioned upon consummation of the Transactions) (each a "Divestiture
Action") as may be necessary or required, to avoid the entry of, or to effect
the dissolution of or vacate or lift, any order, decree or ruling, that would
otherwise have the effect of preventing the consummation of the Transactions,
and to ensure that no Governmental Authority with the authority to clear,
authorize or otherwise approve the consummation of the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, fails to do so as promptly as practicable and
in any event no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Walk-Away
Date; provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, Parent shall not be required to take any action or enter into or
to negotiate any agreement with any Governmental Authority (1) to divest
Nuvigil other than with respect to the divestiture of Nuvigil ANDA rights (and
their equivalents under the Laws of other jurisdictions); (2) that places any
conduct, operational, financial or ownership restrictions of any kind on the
business or actions of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the
Closing, the Company), either pre- or post-consummation of the Transactions,
other than those that (x) are standard and customary in consent decrees or
their equivalent under other Antitrust Laws enforcing asset divestitures and
that are directly related to the assets that are being divested or (y) would
not reasonably be expected to be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, it being agreed that Parent shall not be required to agree
to any such restriction that would materially impair the value of Nuvigil; or
(3) that requires relief with respect to Provigil or any generic equivalent of
Provigil other than (i) with respect to the divestiture of Provigil ANDA
rights (and their equivalents under the Laws of other jurisdictions), and (ii)
such relief that is necessary to resolve objections to the Transaction raised
in U.S. federal court by the FTC or DOJ that are ruled valid by the applicable
court in a successful petition for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the
Transactions or to resolve any written objections by Governmental Authorities
under any Foreign Antitrust Laws seeking to enjoin or prohibit the
Transaction. Parent shall have the sole and exclusive right to propose,
negotiate, offer to commit and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order
or otherwise, any and all Divestiture Actions or otherwise to offer to take or
offer to commit (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect) to take
any Divestiture Action as may be required to resolve any Governmental
Authority's objections to the Transaction, provided, however, that Parent
shall consider in good faith the views of the Company and its counsel in
connection therewith.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) In the event that any litigation or other administrative or judicial
action or proceeding is commenced challenging any of the Transactions and such
litigation, action or proceeding seeks, or would reasonably be expected to
seek, to prevent the consummation of the Transactions, Parent shall, subject
to the terms of this Section 5.4, take any and all action to resolve any such
litigation, action or proceeding and each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub shall cooperate with each other and use its respective reasonable best
efforts to contest any such litigation, action or proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Transactions.

  

  

(f) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, nor shall they permit their
respective Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire any rights, assets,
business, Person or division thereof (through acquisition, license, joint
venture, collaboration or otherwise), if such acquisition, would reasonably be
expected to materially increase the risk of not obtaining any applicable
clearance, consent, approval or waiver under Antitrust Laws with respect to
the Transactions.

  

  

Section 5.5 Public Announcements. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Following such initial press
release, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing,
and give each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press
release or other public statements with respect to the Transactions and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to
such consultation and obtaining the other party's consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except that no such consent shall be
necessary to the extent such disclosure is required by applicable Law, court
process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system; provided,
however, that the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.5 shall not apply
to any release or public statement (a) made or proposed to be made by the
Company in connection with a Takeover Proposal, a Superior Proposal, a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or any action taken pursuant thereto, (b) in
connection with any dispute between the parties regarding this Agreement or
the Transactions or (c) made pursuant to Section 5.3(h).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 5.6 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

  

  

(a) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, from
the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date on which
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall
afford, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
to afford, to Parent and Parent's Representatives (i) reasonable access during
normal business hours to the Company's and its Subsidiaries' personnel,
properties, books, Contracts and records, and the Company shall furnish
promptly to Parent such information concerning its business, assets,
liabilities, employees and other aspects of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
in each case, as Parent may reasonably request (other than any publicly
available document filed by it pursuant to the requirements of federal or
state securities Laws), (ii) permit Parent and Merger Sub to make such
inspections as they may reasonably require and (iii) cause its officers and
those of its Subsidiaries to furnish Parent and Merger Sub with such financial
and operating data and other information with respect to the business,
properties, litigation matters, personnel and environmental compliance of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent or Merger Sub may from time to time
reasonably request (including any final revenue summary and final summary
monthly financial reporting package that is provided to the Company's senior
executive managers and a monthly discussion of such materials with the
Company's senior executive managers); provided that Parent and its
Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company;
provided, further, that the Company shall not be obligated to provide such
access or information if the Company determines, in its reasonable judgment,
that doing so would violate applicable Law or a Contract or obligation of
confidentiality owing to a third party, jeopardize the protection of the
attorney-client privilege, or expose the Company to risk of liability for
disclosure of sensitive or personal information or deemed in good faith to be
too competitively sensitive to warrant disclosure (provided that the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts, as may be requested by Parent, to take
such other actions (such as the redaction of identifying or confidential
information, entry into a joint defense agreement or other agreement or by
providing such access, inspections, data or other information solely to
outside counsel to avoid the loss of attorney client privilege) as is
necessary to provide such access, inspections, data or other information to
Parent and Parent's Representatives in compliance with applicable Law unless
the Company in good faith deems such action to be materially harmful to the
Company's business interests). Until the Effective Time, the information
provided will be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated
as of April 11, 2011, between Parent and the Company (as it may be amended
from time to time, the "Confidentiality Agreement"), and, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent shall not, and shall cause its
Representatives not to, use such information for any purpose unrelated to the
consummation of the Transactions, it being acknowledged and agreed that the
execution of this Agreement by the Company shall (A) constitute written
consent by the Company, and the Confidentiality Agreement is hereby deemed
amended and or waived to the extent required, to allow Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective Representatives to contact and provide Evaluation Material
(as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) to potential sources of
financing and their Representatives and (B) result in the ending of the
Standstill Period (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) and the
termination of Parent's obligations pursuant to paragraph 5 thereof.

  

  

Section 5.7 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental

Section 5.8 Indemnification and Insurance.

  

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless (including by advancing
expenses) each current and former director, officer and employee of the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries and each person who served as a director,
officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise if
such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnitee" and, collectively, the "Indemnitees")
against all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties,
costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses
(including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any actual
or threatened claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation (whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative) (each, a "Claim"), whenever
asserted, arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or
omission relating to their position with the Company or its Subsidiaries
occurring or alleged to have occurred before or at the Effective Time
(including any Claim relating in whole or in part to the Agreement or the
Transactions), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law. Each of
(x) the Company Charter Documents and the respective organizational documents
of each of the Company's Subsidiaries as currently in effect, (y) any
indemnification agreements with an Indemnitee listed on Section 5.8(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, which shall in each case survive the Transactions
and continue in full force and effect to the extent permitted by applicable
Law and (z) the respective organizational documents of the Company's
Subsidiaries as currently in effect shall not, for a period of six (6) years
from the Effective Time, be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees
except, in the case of clauses (x) and (z), as required by applicable Law.
Without limiting the foregoing, at the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause
the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation to
include provisions for limitation of liabilities of directors and officers,
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of the Indemnitees no
less favorable to the Indemnitees than as set forth in the Company Charter
Documents in effect on the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall, for
a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the Indemnitees except as required by applicable Law.

  

  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a claims
period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time from the
Company's current insurance carrier or from an insurance carrier with the same
or better credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with
respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance (the "DandO Insurance") for the persons who, as of the date
of this Agreement, are covered by the Company's existing DandO Insurance. Such
"tail" insurance policies shall have terms, conditions, retentions and levels
of coverage at least as favorable as the Company's existing DandO Insurance with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions); provided,
however, that the maximum aggregate premium for such insurance policies for
any such year shall not be in excess of the Maximum Premium. Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain such "tail" insurance policies in
full force and effect for their full term. If the Company and the Surviving
Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect, at no expense to
the Indemnitees, for a period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time, the Company's DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this
Agreement with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least
as favorable as provided in the Company's existing policies as of the date of
this Agreement, or, if such insurance is unavailable, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
purchase the best available DandO Insurance for such six-year period from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's
current insurance carrier with respect to the Company's existing DandO Insurance
with terms, conditions, retentions and with levels of coverage at least as
favorable as provided in the Company's existing policies as of the date of
this Agreement; provided, however, that that neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be required to pay an aggregate premium for such insurance
policies in excess of 250% of the annual premium paid by the Company for
coverage for its last full fiscal year for such insurance (the "Maximum
Premium"); and provided, further, that if the premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding such amount.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.8 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for or
limitation of, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such Person may have by contract or otherwise.

  

  

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set
forth in this Section 5.8.

  

  

Section 5.9 Fees and Expenses. Except as provided in Section 7.3, whether or
not the Merger is consummated, all fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid by the party incurring or required to incur such fees or expenses.

  

  

Section 5.10 Section 16. The Company shall take all steps reasonably necessary
to cause the Transactions, including any dispositions of equity securities of
the Company (including derivative securities with respect to such equity
securities of the Company) by each individual who is or will be subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.11 Employee Matters.

  

  

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each active employee of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries) ("Company Employees") annual base salary and base wages, annual
cash incentive opportunity, and employee benefits, in each case, that are no
less favorable in the aggregate than such annual base salary and base wages,
annual cash incentive opportunity, and employee benefits provided to the
Company Employees on the effective date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (x) (i) Parent shall or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide Company Employees whose
employment terminates during the two-year period following the Effective Time
with severance benefits at levels no less than and pursuant to the terms of
the Company's severance policies as set forth on Section 5.11 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and (ii) such severance benefits shall be determined
taking into account the service crediting provisions set forth in Section
5.11(b) below; and (y) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, continue to participate in the Retiree Health Access program (or a
successor or similar program) during the two year period following the
Effective Time in the same manner as the Company participates in such program
immediately prior to the Effective Time, to the extent such program remains
available on terms, and a cost, comparable to those in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits but not for purposes of defined benefit
pension accrual) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its
Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employee after the Effective
Time (including the Company Plans) (the "New Plans"), each Company Employee
shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to
the same extent as such Company Employee was credited, before the Effective
Time, for such service under any similar Company employee benefit plan in
which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same
period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Company
Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the
Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"), and (ii) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be
waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the
extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived under the comparable Old
Plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such Company Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall cause any
eligible expenses incurred by any Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such Company Employee's participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable
to such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor all obligations under the Company
Plans and compensation and severance arrangements and agreements in accordance
with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time and the
transactions contemplated hereunder shall be deemed to constitute a "change in
control," "change of control" or "corporate transaction" under such Company
Plans, arrangements or agreements. With respect to any annual cash incentive
opportunity in effect on the date of this Agreement which is based upon the
Company\'s performance for the 2011 fiscal year as the applicable performance
period, Parent shall continue such arrangements in accordance with their terms
for the balance of the Company\'s 2011 fiscal year, with such adjustments to
performance criteria as are determined by the applicable plan administrator in
good faith to be appropriate to reflect the Transaction, provided the adjusted
criteria are substantially comparable to the criteria in effect prior to
Effective Time. Any Company Employee whose employment terminates by reason of
a Qualifying Termination (as defined in the Management Retention Plan, whether
or not such Company Employee participates in such plan) following the
Effective Time during fiscal 2011 shall be paid an annual bonus, as soon as
practicable following such Qualifying Termination, equal to the product of (i)
such Company Employee\'s target annual bonus for fiscal 2011 and (ii) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in 2011 that such
individual was a Company Employee, and the denominator of which is 365. Any
Company Employee whose employment terminates by reason of a Qualifying
Termination after 2011 but prior to the date that annual bonuses are paid with
respect to fiscal 2011 shall, as soon as practicable following such Qualifying
Termination, be paid such Company Employee\'s target annual bonus for fiscal
2011.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this Agreement (i) shall be treated as an amendment to
any Company Plan; (ii) shall obligate Parent or the Surviving Corporation to
(A) maintain any particular benefit plan or arrangement or (B) retain the
employment of any particular employee; (iii) shall prohibit or restrict Parent
or the Surviving Corporation from terminating the employment of any employee;
(iv) shall prevent Parent or the Surviving Corporation from amending or
terminating any benefit plan or arrangement; or (v) is intended to or shall
confer third party beneficiary rights on any Company Employee with respect to
the matters set forth in this Section 5.11.

  

  

(e) If the Closing Date is on a date which is later than the date on which
annual Option and Restricted Stock grants would have been made by the Company
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, Parent
agrees to make equity grants to Company Employees on a basis reasonably
comparable to substantially similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries on or about the date such grants are next made to such similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries in accordance with its
regular granting practices.

  

  

Section 5.12 Obligations of Parent and of the Company. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include
an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take
such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving
Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 5.13 No Control of Other Party's Business. Nothing contained in this
Agreement is intended to give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the Company's or its Subsidiaries' operations
prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

  

  

Section 5.14 Takeover Laws. The Company and its Board of Directors shall each
(1) use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that no Takeover Provision is or
becomes applicable to the Transactions and (2) if any Takeover Provision
becomes applicable to the Transactions, use its reasonable best efforts to
ensure that such Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect
of such Takeover Provision on the Transactions.

the extent that such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an

expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Parent shall have
received a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by an executive officer
of the Company to such effect.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51

certificate signed on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub by an executive officer
of Parent and Merger Sub to such effect.

Section 6.4 Frustration of Closing Conditions. None of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Section 6.2
or 6.3, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such

and the other Transactions, as required by Section 5.4.

  

  

ARTICLE VII

  

  

TERMINATION

  

  

Section 7.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Transactions
abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval (with any termination by Parent
also being an effective termination by Merger Sub):

  

  

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent; or

  

  

(b) by either of the Company or Parent:

  

  

(i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before December 2,
2011 (as it may be extended pursuant to the following proviso, the "Walk-Away
Date"); provided, however, that if the Closing has not occurred by such date
and on such date the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(b) have not been
satisfied or waived and each of the other conditions to consummation of the
Merger set forth in Article VI has been satisfied, waived or remains capable
of satisfaction, then the Walk-Away Date shall automatically be extended to
March 2, 2012; provided, further, that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)(i) shall not be available to a party if the
failure of the Merger to have been consummated on or before the Walk-Away Date
was primarily due to the failure of such party to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement;

  

  

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in Section 6.1(c) shall be
in effect and shall have become final and non-appealable; provided, however,
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)(ii) shall
not be available to a party that has failed to comply with its obligations
under Section 5.4 in any material respect with respect to Restraint;

  

  

(iii) if the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the
Company Stockholders Meeting; or

  

  

(c) by Parent,

  

  

(i) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or (b) and (ii) cannot be
cured by the Company by the Walk-Away Date or, if capable of being cured,
shall not have been cured within 30 calendar days following receipt of written
notice from the Parent stating the Parent's intention to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c)(i) and the basis for such
termination; provided that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c)(i) if it is then in material breach
of any representation, warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) the Board of Directors of the Company: (A) shall have effected a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or (B) the Company fails to include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement;

  

  

(iii) if the Board of Directors of the Company shall have failed to reject
(and, if requested by Parent, publicly recommend against) any Takeover
Proposal within ten (10) Business Days after such Takeover Proposal is
publicly announced or otherwise becomes publicly known;

  

  

(iv) if a tender or exchange offer relating to Company Common Stock shall have
been commenced by a Person unaffiliated with Parent, and the Company shall not
have publicly disclosed within ten (10) Business Days after such tender or
exchange offer is first commenced a statement that the Company Board
recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer;

  

  

(v) if the Board of Directors of the Company fails to reaffirm publicly the
Company Board Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days of Parent's written
request for such reaffirmation (provided, that (A) such reaffirmation may
include such additional disclosures as would reasonably be necessary to
satisfy the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company or
comply with applicable Law and (B) Parent shall be entitled to make such a
written request for reaffirmation only once for each Takeover Proposal and
once for each material amendment to such Takeover Proposal); or

  

  

(d) by the Company,

  

  

(i) if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) or (b) and (ii) cannot be
cured by Parent or Merger Sub by the Walk-Away Date or, if capable of being
cured, shall not have been cured within 30 calendar days following receipt of
written notice from the Company stating the Company's intention to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(d) and the basis for such
termination; provided that, Company shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(d) if it is then in material breach of
any representation, warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder; or

  

  

(ii) in order to enter into a transaction that is a Superior Proposal, if
prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, (A) the Company
complies with the procedures set forth in Section 5.3(d) with respect to a
Superior Proposal and (B) prior to or concurrently with such termination, the
Company pays the Termination Fee due under Section 7.3(d)(iii).

Section 7.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, written notice thereof shall be given to
the other party or parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which
such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and
void (other than Sections 5.9, 7.2 and 7.3, Article VIII and the last sentence
of Section 5.6, all of which shall survive termination of this Agreement), and
there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company
or their respective directors, officers and Affiliates; provided, however,
that, subject to Section 7.3 (including the limitations on liability contained
therein), no party shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or
damages arising out of (i) any willful and material breach of its obligations,
under this Agreement or (ii) fraud.

  

  

Section 7.3 Termination Fee.

  

  

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

  

  

(1) (A) by (1) Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii) or
Section 7.1(b)(i) (in the case of Section 7.1(b)(i), only if at such time the
Company has failed to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and Parent is not
in breach of its obligations under Section 5.4) or (2) Parent pursuant to
Section 7.1(c)(i), (B) a bona fide Takeover Proposal (excluding the Takeover
Proposal by Valeant that was publicly announced on March 29, 2011, but
including any revised Takeover Proposal at a higher price from Valeant after
the date hereof) shall have been publicly disclosed after the date hereof and
not clearly withdrawn in good faith prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting
(in the case of termination pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii)), prior to the
termination date (in the case of termination pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i)) or
prior to the breach giving rise to the right of termination (in the case of
termination pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i)) and (C) within 12 months of the
date this Agreement is terminated, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal or
consummates the transactions contemplated by any Takeover Proposal (provided
that for purposes of this clause (C), the references to "20%" in the
definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%"),
then the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee on the date of entry
into such agreement or, if earlier, consummation of such Takeover Proposal.

  

  

(2) by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii), Section 7.1(c)(iii), Section
7.1(c)(iv) or Section 7.1(c)(v), then the Company shall pay to Parent the
Termination Fee within two (2) Business Days of such termination.

  

  

(3) by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii), then the Company shall pay
to Parent the Termination Fee prior to or concurrently with such termination.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company be required
to pay the fee referred to in this Section 7.3(a) on more than one occasion.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties agree
that the payment of the Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
available to Parent and Merger Sub with respect to this Agreement and the
Transactions in the event any such payment becomes due and payable and is
paid, and, upon payment of the Termination Fee, the Company (and the Company's
Affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers, employees,
stockholders and Representatives) shall have no further liability to Parent
and Merger Sub under this Agreement; provided, however, that the Company shall
not be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its
willful and material breach of Section 5.2 or Section 5.3; provided, further,
that the aggregate amount of damages determined by a court to be payable by
the Company pursuant to the foregoing proviso shall be reduced by the amount
of any Termination Fee payable to Parent pursuant this Section 7.3.

  

  

(c) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and that, without these
agreements, the parties would not have entered into this Agreement. Any amount
that becomes payable pursuant to Section 7.3(a) shall be paid by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent in writing
and shall be reduced by any amounts required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under applicable Law in respect of Taxes.

  

  

ARTICLE VIII

  

  

MISCELLANEOUS

  

  

Section 8.1 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. None of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time. This

hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed

hereunder. Any purported assignment not permitted under this Section shall be
null and void.

  

  

Section 8.5 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (each
of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the

not limit the right of a party to effect service of process on the other party
by any other legally available method.

  

  

Section 8.8 Specific Enforcement. The parties agree that immediate, extensive
and irreparable damage would occur for which monetary damages would not be an

seeking to enforce this Agreement against such nonperforming party under this
Agreement shall be entitled to specific performance and the issuance of

Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without
the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy, and the
parties further agree to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other
equitable relief, this being in addition to and not in limitation of any other
remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. The parties agree that
(x) by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 8.8, a party shall
not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may
be available to a party under this Agreement, including monetary damages in
the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the
remedies provided for in this Section 8.8 are not available or otherwise are
not granted and (y) nothing contained in this Section 8.8 shall require any
party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any party's right to institute
any proceeding for) specific performance under this Section 8.8 before
exercising any termination right under Article VII (and, if applicable,
pursuing damages after such termination) nor shall the commencement of any
Action pursuant to this Section 8.8 or anything contained in this Section 8.8
restrict or limit any party's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with the terms of Article VII or pursue any other remedies under this
Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

Section 8.13 Interpretation.

  

  

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, a Section,
Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to an Article of, a Section of,
or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The
table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation". The words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words
of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. All terms
defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any
document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein.
The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the
feminine and neuter genders of such term. When used in reference to the
Company or its Subsidiaries, the term "material" shall be measured against the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Any Law defined or referred to
herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such
Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the
case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor Law. References to a
Person are also to its permitted assigns and successors. All references to
"dollars" or "$" refer to currency of the United States of America.

  

  

(b) The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly
drafted by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement.

  

  

(c) Disclosure of any matter in any Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule
or Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosure of such matter
with respect to any other sections of the Company Disclosure Schedule or
Parent Disclosure Schedule, respectively, to which such matter is specifically
cross referenced or to which such matter relates to the extent it is
reasonably apparent from the text of such disclosure that such disclosure
applies to the relevant representation or warranty of such other Section. The
inclusion of any item in the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure
Schedule shall not be deemed to be an admission or evidence of materiality of
such item, nor shall it establish any standard of materiality for any purpose
whatsoever.

  

  

(d) No party hereto nor any other Person will have or be subject to any
liability or obligation to any other party hereto or any other Person
resulting from the distribution to it of, or its use of, any information,
including any information, documents, projections, forecasts of other material
made available to it in certain "data rooms" (electronic or otherwise) or
management presentations in expectation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, unless any such information is expressly included in a representation
or warranty contained in Article III or Article IV, as applicable, of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that (i) none of the other
parties hereto nor any Person on behalf of such other party is making or has
made (A) any representation or warranty whatsoever, either express or implied,
as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the information provided or made
available to it or any of its Representatives, beyond those expressly given by
such other party in Article III or Article IV, as applicable, of this
Agreement and (B) any representations or warranties with respect to any
projections, forecasts, estimates, budgets or prospective information that may
have been made available to it or any of its Representatives, and (ii) no
party has been induced by, or relied upon, any representations, warranties or
statements (written or oral), whether express or implied, made by any Person,
other than those expressly set forth in Article III or Article IV, as
applicable, of this Agreement.
