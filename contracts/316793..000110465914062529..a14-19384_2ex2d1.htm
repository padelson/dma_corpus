as of August 20, 2014, among International Rectifier Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), Infineon Technologies AG, a stock corporation
( _Aktiengesellschaft_ ) organized under the laws of the Federal Republic of
Germany (" _Parent_ ") and Surf Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ ").

 



 

RECITALS

 



 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
determined that it is fair to, advisable and in the best interests of the
Company and the holders of the common stock of the Company, par value $1.00
per share (the " _Common Stock_ "), to enter into this Agreement with Parent
and Merger Sub, providing for the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of Merger Sub with
and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation of the
Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, the Company Board and the respective boards of directors or other
equivalent bodies of Parent and Merger Sub have approved the Merger upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and have
approved and declared advisable this Agreement; and

 



 

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE I

 



 

 _The Merger; Closing; Effective Time_

 



 

1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company, in accordance with the provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, as amended (the " _DGCL_ ") and the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the
Surviving Corporation and the separate corporate existence of the Company,
with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall
continue unaffected by the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

 



 

1.2. _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent, the closing for the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at the offices of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson LLP, One New
York Plaza, New York, New York, 10004 at 9:00 a.m. (New York time) on the
fifth Business Day (the " _Closing Date_ ") following the day on which the
last to be satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of
the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to

      
 

 



 

be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement.
For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Business Day_ " shall mean any day
other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day (i) on which banks are required or
authorized to close in New York, New York, London, United Kingdom, Frankfurt
am Main, Germany, or Munich, Germany or (ii) that is not a day on which
TARGET2 is open for the settlement of payments in Euros.

 



 

1.3. _Effective Time_. At the Closing, the parties hereto shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by causing a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed and filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the DGCL, and shall make all other filings, recordings or publications
required under the DGCL in connection with the Merger, if any. The Merger
shall become effective at the time when the Certificate of Merger has been
duly filed with, and accepted for record by, the office of the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL, or at such later
time or date as the parties hereto shall agree and specify in the Certificate
of Merger in accordance with applicable Law (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

ARTICLE II

 



 

 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws 
of the Surviving Corporation_

 



 

2.1. _The Certificate of Incorporation_. The certificate of incorporation of
the Company shall be amended and restated in the Merger to be identical to
that set forth on Annex B attached hereto (the " _Charter_ ") and, as so
amended and restated, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein and in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL (subject to Section
6.16).

 



 

2.2. _The Bylaws_. The bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation (the " _Bylaws_ ") until thereafter amended as provided
therein and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL (subject
to Section 6.16).

 



 

ARTICLE III

 



 

 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_

 



 

3.1. _Directors_. The parties hereto shall take, and cause to be taken, all
actions necessary so that the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time
shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office until their respective successors
have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws.

 



 

3.2. _Officers_. The officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from
and after the Effective Time, be the initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office until their respective successors shall have
been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws.

 



      
 

 



 

ARTICLE IV

 



 

 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; 
Exchange of Certificates_

 



 

4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company or the sole stockholder of Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share (a " _Share_ " and, collectively, "
_Shares_ ") of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time other than (i) Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other
direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, (ii) Dissenting Shares
(as defined below) and (iii) Shares held by the Company in treasury (each
Share referred to in clauses (i) and (iii) above being an " _Excluded Share_ "
and, collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall be converted into the
right to receive $40.00 in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without
interest. At the Effective Time, all of the Shares (other than the Dissenting
Shares and the Excluded Shares) shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate formerly representing
any such Shares (a " _Certificate_ ") and any such Share that is non-
certificated (a " _Book Entry Share_ ") shall thereafter cease to have any
rights with respect to such Shares and shall represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of such Shares
formerly represented thereby, without interest.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of the Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall
cease to be outstanding, shall be canceled without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

 



 

(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, any
certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for
all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.

 



 

4.2. _Payment_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. On the Closing Date and prior to the filing of the
Certificate of Merger, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited,
with a paying agent selected by Parent with the CompanyÂ’s prior approval (the
" _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the Record Holders (other than Record
Holders to the extent they hold the Dissenting Shares or the Excluded Shares),
a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the aggregate Merger
Consideration payable in respect of all Shares other than the Dissenting
Shares and the Excluded Shares (such aggregate amount as deposited with the
Paying Agent, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). As used in this Article IV, the term "
_Record Holder_ " means, with respect to any Shares, a Person who was,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the holder of record of such Shares.
If a Dissenting Stockholder effectively withdraws its demand for, or loses
its, appraisal rights

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any Dissenting Shares,
Parent shall make available or cause to be made available to the Paying Agent
additional funds in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of the
Dissenting Shares for which the Dissenting Stockholder has withdrawn its
demand for, or lost its, appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
and (ii) the Merger Consideration. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash
portion of the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that Parent
shall ensure that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by
the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1
or better by MoodyÂ’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and PoorÂ’s,
respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankerÂ’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or
in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category
granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of investment. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part
of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the aggregate Merger
Consideration payable under Section 4.1(a) shall be promptly returned to the
Surviving Corporation. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to
any such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the
level required for the Paying Agent to make prompt cash aggregate payment of
the Merger Consideration under Section 4.1(a), Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the
Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such aggregate
payment of the Merger Consideration under Section 4.1(a). Any portion of the
Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section
4.2(a) in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent upon
demand.

 



 

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

 



 

(i) _Letter of Transmittal_. Promptly (and in any event, within two Business
Days) after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each Record Holder of Shares (other than the Excluded
Shares) represented by one or more Certificates a letter of transmittal (a "
_Letter of Transmittal_ ") specifying that delivery of Certificates shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section
4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree and (y) include
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 4.2(e)) in
exchange for the Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly
represented thereby.

 



 

(ii) _Payment for Shares_. Upon delivery to the Paying Agent of a Letter of
Transmittal by any Record Holder of Shares represented by Certificates (other
than the Dissenting Shares or the Excluded Shares), duly completed and signed
in accordance with its instructions, and surrender of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented such Shares (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), such
Record Holder shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect
of such Shares, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no
Record Holder of a Book Entry Share shall be required to deliver a Certificate
or an executed Letter of Transmittal

 



      
 

 



 

to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of such
Shares. In lieu thereof, such Record Holder shall upon receipt by the Paying
Agent of an "agentÂ’s message" in customary form (or such other evidence, if
any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), be entitled to receive, and
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration in
respect of each Book-Entry Share of such holder, and such Book Entry Shares
shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any
cash to be delivered upon compliance with the procedures described above, may
be issued to the transferee if the Paying Agent receives documents reasonably
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or that stock transfer Taxes
are not applicable. All cash paid as Merger Consideration upon the surrender
of Certificates or in respect of Book Entry Shares in accordance with the
terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the applicable Shares. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any amount payable as provided above.

 



 

(iii) _Special Payment Procedures for DTC_. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying
Agent and the Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") with the objective that (x)
if the Effective Time occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m. (New York time) on the
Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the
Closing Date the Merger Consideration in respect of each Share held of record
by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time (such aggregate
cash amount, the " _DTC Cash Payment_ ") and (y) if the Effective Time occurs
after 11:30 a.m. (New York time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will
transmit to DTC or its nominee on the first Business Day after the Closing
Date the DTC Cash Payment (with cash payment being delivered in immediately
available funds).

 



 

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate or Book Entry Share is presented to the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be canceled and
exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available funds to which the
holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this Article IV.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the Record Holders of Shares for 270 days after the Effective Time shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, be delivered by the Paying Agent to
Parent. Any Record Holder of Shares (other than the Dissenting Shares and the
Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws) for, and the Surviving Corporation shall
remain liable for, payment of the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, for such Shares upon surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book Entry Shares. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, neither Parent, the Surviving

 



      
 

 



 

Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such Record Holders by the earlier of
(i) the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) such time at which such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Entity shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property
of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ "
shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or
limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or
nature.

 



 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such Person of
a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration in respect of the number of Shares formerly
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.

 



 

(f) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares (other than the Excluded Shares) that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a
stockholder who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in
writing) and who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Shares (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all
respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting
Stockholders_ ") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead such holder shall be entitled
to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such
Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the
Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights set
forth in Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such holder shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost its right to
appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such holderÂ’s
Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and
become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the
Merger Consideration for each such Share, in accordance with Section 4.1,
without interest. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice and
a copy of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are
received by the Company relating to Company stockholdersÂ’ rights of appraisal
and (ii) at ParentÂ’s expense, the opportunity to participate in all
communications, negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal by Company stockholders under the DGCL, so long as Parent does not
create any obligations of the Company that would be effective prior to the
Effective Time. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal, offer to settle, settle any such demands, approve any withdrawal of
any such demands, waive any failure to timely

 



   

     
 

 



 

deliver a written demand for appraisal in accordance with the DGCL or agree to
do any of the foregoing.

 



 

4.3. _Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) _Options._ Except as may otherwise be agreed by Parent and the holder of
an option to purchase Shares under the Company Stock Plans or otherwise (each,
an " _Option_ "), on the Closing Date, each Option that is then outstanding,
whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be canceled and the Company or the
Surviving Corporation shall pay each holder of any such Option, in full
satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, on the Closing
Date or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter (but in any event
no later than the date that is 20 Business Days following the Effective Time)
for each such Option canceled an amount in cash, without interest, determined
by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
applicable per share exercise price of such Option by (ii) the number of
Shares such holder could have purchased (assuming full vesting of all Options)
had such holder exercised such Option in full on the Closing Date; _provided_
that if the exercise price per share of any such Option is equal to or greater
than the per share Merger Consideration, such Option shall be canceled without
any cash payment being made in respect thereof. For the avoidance of doubt,
except as may otherwise be agreed by Parent and the holder of an Option,
Parent shall not assume any Options in connection with the Merger.

 



 

(b) _RSUs_.

 



 

(i) _Vested RSUs_. Except as may otherwise be agreed by Parent and the holder
of a Vested RSU, on the Closing Date, each Vested RSU shall be canceled, and
the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall pay each holder of any such
Vested RSU, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect
thereto, on the Closing Date or as soon as administratively practicable
thereafter (but in any event no later than the date that is 20 Business Days
following the Effective Time) for each such Vested RSU an amount in cash,
without interest, determined by multiplying (A) the Merger Consideration by
(B) the number of shares of Common Stock covered by such Vested RSU. For the
avoidance of doubt, except as may otherwise be agreed by Parent and the holder
of a Vested RSU, Parent shall not assume any Vested RSU in connection with the
Merger.

 



 

(ii) _Rollover RSUs_. Except as may otherwise be agreed by Parent and the
holder of a Rollover RSU, at the Effective Time, each Rollover RSU shall
automatically be converted into a right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, determined by multiplying (A) the Merger Consideration by (B) the
number of shares of Common Stock covered by such Rollover RSU (each, a "
_Converted RSU Cash Award_ "). Each portion of any Converted RSU Cash Award
will, subject to the holderÂ’s continued employment with the Parent and its
Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) through the applicable
vesting dates, vest and be paid to the holder of such Converted RSU Cash Award
(A) with respect to Rollover RSUs that were otherwise scheduled to vest in
June, 2016, in December, 2015, (B) with respect to Rollover RSUs that were
otherwise scheduled to vest in June, 2017, in September, 2016 and (C) with
respect to Rollover RSUs that were otherwise scheduled to vest after June,
2015 and on

 



      
 

 



 

any other date than those listed in clauses (A) and (B) of this Section
4.3(b)(ii), on the date that is six months prior to the date that the
applicable Rollover RSUs were otherwise scheduled to vest, and the Converted
RSU Cash Awards will otherwise retain the same terms and conditions
(including, in the event of certain terminations of employment, accelerated
vesting and payment) as contained in the original Rollover RSU (but taking
into account any changes to such Rollover RSUs that are necessary to reflect
the provisions of this Section 4.3(b)(ii)). For the avoidance of doubt, Parent
shall assume the Rollover RSUs as Converted RSU Cash Awards in connection with
the Merger subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence.

 



 

(c) _PSUs_. Except as may otherwise be agreed by Parent and the holder of a
PSU, on the Closing Date, each PSU that is then outstanding shall vest or be
forfeited, as applicable, to the extent it would vest (disregarding any
required service period following the achievement of the applicable
performance goals for the purposes of the Supplemental PSUs) or be forfeited
under the terms of the applicable award agreement as if (i) the Merger
Consideration was the "final average share price" or the "average share price"
(as applicable) and (ii) the Closing Date was the "vesting date" (as such
terms are defined under the applicable award agreement). For the avoidance of
doubt, to the extent that the "average share price" performance goal under the
terms of the applicable award agreement is achieved for Supplemental PSUs,
such Supplemental PSUs shall be vested PSUs as of the Closing Date and be
canceled and paid out in accordance with the next sentence. Each such vested
PSU shall be canceled, and the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall pay
each holder of any such vested PSU, in full satisfaction of the rights of such
holder with respect thereto on the Closing Date or as soon as administratively
practicable thereafter (but in any event no later than the date that is 20
Business Days following the Effective Time) for each such vested PSU an amount
in cash, without interest, determined by multiplying (i) the Merger
Consideration by (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock covered by such
vested PSU. For the avoidance of doubt, except as may otherwise be agreed by
Parent and the holder of a PSU, Parent shall not assume any PSU in connection
with the Merger and each PSU with respect to which the applicable performance
goal is not satisfied under the terms of the applicable award agreement shall
be canceled as of the Effective Time for no consideration.

 



 

(d) The Company or the Surviving Corporation shall pay through its payroll
system, to each holder of an Option, a Vested RSU or a PSU, the cash payments
subject to and in accordance with this Section 4.3.

 



 

(e) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company, the Company Board or the
compensation committee of the Company Board (or another committee duly
authorized by the Company Board for such purpose), as applicable, shall adopt
any resolutions and take such other actions as may be necessary to implement
the provisions of this Section 4.3 and the provisions of Section 6.9(e) of
this Agreement, provided that such resolutions or actions shall in no event
limit the ability or right (i) of Parent and any individual holder of an
Option, Vested RSU, Rollover RSU or PSU to agree to treat any such applicable
award otherwise than as provided in this Section 4.3 or (ii) of Parent and any
Covered Individual (as defined below) to agree to terms different than those
set forth in Section 6.9(e) of this Agreement.

the Effective Time, (iii) is scheduled to vest pursuant to its terms at any
time prior to or during June, 2015 (and, for the avoidance of doubt, not
taking into account any accelerated vesting in connection with a termination
of employment or service) or (iv) that the Company is required to vest upon
the Closing pursuant to the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan or
award agreement governing such RSU.

 



 

4.4. _Company ESPP_. The Company, the Company Board or the compensation

stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, rights
offering, split, combination or exchange of shares.

 



      
 

 



 

4.6. _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Company, the Surviving

under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") and the

the applicable Governmental Entity. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity by Parent, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Persons otherwise entitled to the payment in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

legal entity (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good

its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except, in the case of clauses (B) and (C), where any such

the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through the
ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; and (iv) " _Company
Material Adverse Effect_ " means a fact, circumstance, change, event,

event, occurrence, development set forth in clause (x)(A), (x)(B), (y)(A),
(y)(C) or (y)(D) above may be taken into account in determining whether there
has been Company Material Adverse Effect to the extent such change, event,

the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other
participants in the industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries

debentures, notes or other similar obligations, the holders of which have the
right to vote (or which are convertible into or exercisable for securities

There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting of
the capital stock or other equity interests of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except in each case for such agreements and arrangements between

by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock
entitled to vote on such matter at a stockholdersÂ’ meeting duly called and

required to adopt this Agreement and approve and consummate the Merger and
transactions contemplated hereby is the Requisite Company Vote, and the

and permits contemplated by clauses (A) through (G) of Section 5.1(d)(ii) have
been obtained, and all filings described in such clauses have been made,
conflict with, result in any breach or violation of, or constitute a default
(or an event which with or without notice, lapse of time or both would become
a default) or result in the loss of a benefit under, or give rise to any
breach or violation of, a termination or right of termination, acceleration or
other alteration in the rights under, any Lease or Material Contract; or (C)
assuming all consents, approvals, authorizations, declarations and permits

respective properties or assets is subject except, in the case of clauses (B)
and (C) above, for any such conflict, breach, violation, default, termination,
acceleration, loss, alteration or other occurrence that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect (provided, that clause (y)(B) of the
definition of Company Material Adverse Effect shall be disregarded for
purposes of this Section 5.1(d)(i)).

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
and the consummation of the Merger by the Company do not and will not require
any consent, approval, authorization, declaration or permit of, action by,

have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or
materially impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

(e) _Company Reports; Financial Statements_.

 



 

(i) The Company has filed with, or furnished to, on a timely basis, all forms,

Superior Proposal. The Company shall not provide (and shall not permit any of
its Representatives to provide) any commercially or competitively sensitive
material non-public information in connection with the actions permitted by
this Section 6.2(b), except in accordance with "clean room" or other similar

material respects with the CompanyÂ’s practices in dealing with the disclosure
of such information to Parent or its Representatives.

one such request under clause (C) in connection with any single Acquisition
Proposal by a third party) (any of the actions described in the foregoing
clause (i) or this clause (ii) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ");

 



 

(iii) authorize, cause or permit the Company to enter into any acquisition
agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive agreement or a letter of
intent or agreement in principle with respect thereto (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (an " _Alternative Acquisition

so would be inconsistent with the directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable
Law (such action, a " _Change of Recommendation_ ") or (y) effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(a) to enter into a definitive
Alternative Acquisition Agreement providing for a Superior Proposal as
contemplated herein, in each case which Superior Proposal did not result from
any breach of this Section 6.2, if the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would
be inconsistent with the directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ that prior to any Change of Recommendation or termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(a):

 



 

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent and Merger
Sub, at least three Business Days in advance, of its intention to effect a
Change of Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.3(a), which notice, if concerning an intended Change of Recommendation in
response to the Intervening Event shall include a description of the
Intervening Event in reasonable detail or, if concerning an intended Change of

Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent
and Merger Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Sub indicate in
writing a desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as would permit

 



      
 

 



 

the Company not to effect a Change of Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(a); and

 



 

(iii) the Company Board (after consulting with its outside financial advisor
and outside legal counsel) shall have considered in good faith any changes to
this Agreement offered in writing by Parent in a manner that would form a
binding contract if accepted by the Company and (A) with respect to an
intended Change of Recommendation in response to the Intervening Event, shall
have determined in good faith that failure to effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the directorsÂ’ fiduciary
duties under applicable Law and (B) with respect an intended termination
pursuant to Section 8.3(a) or an intended Change of Recommendation in response
to a Superior Proposal, shall have determined that the Superior Proposal would
continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes were to be given
effect and that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

 



 

 _provided_ _further_ _that_ , if the intended action is a termination of
this Agreement to concurrently enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
providing for a Superior Proposal, in the event of any material revisions to
the financial terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required
to deliver a new written notice to Parent and Merger Sub and to comply with
the requirements of this Section 6.2(e) with respect to such new written
notice, except that the deadline for such new written notice shall be reduced

position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act

and listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the
stockholders of the Company). For the avoidance of doubt, complying with such
obligations or making such disclosure shall not in any way limit or modify the
effect that any such action has under this Agreement, including whether there
has been a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



 

(g) Except as provided in Section 6.2(e), the Company agrees that it will
promptly (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours of the CompanyÂ’s
Knowledge of any such event) notify Parent if any proposals or offers with

(other than Parent), including in such notification a copy (if in writing) or
written summary of material terms (if oral) and the identity of the Person
from which such expression of interest, proposal, offer or request for

including any change in the CompanyÂ’s intentions as previously notified,

reference in the Proxy Statement will contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If at any time prior
to the Stockholders Meeting, any event or circumstance relating to the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates should be
discovered by Parent or Merger Sub which, pursuant to the Securities Act or
Exchange Act, should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy
Statement, such party shall reasonably promptly inform the Company. If at any
time prior to the Stockholder Meeting, any such event or circumstance is
discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, then in each case the Company
shall, reasonably promptly after becoming aware thereof, amend or supplement,
as applicable, the Proxy Statement to include disclosure of such fact or
event.

 



 

(d) The Company agrees that the Proxy Statement will not, at the time the
Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC, at the time the Proxy Statement is
first mailed to the stockholders of the Company or at the time of the
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue

 



      
 

 



 

statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. No
representation is made by the Company with respect to statements made in the
Proxy Statement based on information supplied, or required to be supplied, by
or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates specifically for
inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

 



 

(e) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt of all comments of
the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any request by the SEC for
any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information. The Company
shall promptly provide to Parent copies of all correspondence between the
Company and/or any of its Representatives and the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts (with the
assistance of Parent) to promptly provide responses to the SEC with respect to
all comments received on the Proxy Statement from the SEC and the Company
shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed promptly after the
date the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments thereon or that the
Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement.

 



 

(f) Subject to applicable Law, notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated
above, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or filing any other
required filings (or, in each case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, to the fullest
extent reasonably practicable the Company shall provide Parent with an
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and shall in
good faith consider for inclusion in such document or response comments
reasonably proposed by Parent.

Company will take, in accordance with applicable Law (including the DGCL) and

convene and hold a meeting of holders of Common Stock (the " _Stockholders
Meeting_ ") for purposes of obtaining the Requisite Company Vote on a date
selected by the Company after consultation with Parent as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than 45 calendar days after
(i) the tenth calendar day after the preliminary Proxy Statement therefor has
been filed with the SEC if by such date the SEC has not informed the Company
that it intends to review the Proxy Statement or (ii) if the SEC has by such

date on which the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy
Statement, subject to any delay that may be reasonably necessary to comply
with the rules of the NYSE and/or Rule 14a-13 under the Exchange Act with
respect to the record date for the Stockholders Meeting); _provided_ ,
_however_ , the Company may postpone or adjourn the Stockholders Meeting
solely (i) with the consent of Parent; (ii)(A) due to the absence of a quorum
or (B) if the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient
number of Shares for the Requisite Company Vote, whether or not a quorum is
present, to solicit additional proxies; or (iii) to allow reasonable
additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended
disclosure which the Company Board

 



   

     
 

 



 

has determined in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel is
necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure
to be disseminated and reviewed by the CompanyÂ’s stockholders prior to the
Stockholders Meeting _; provided further_ that the Company may not postpone or
adjourn the Stockholders Meeting more than a total of two times pursuant to
clause (ii)(A) and/or clause (ii)(B) of the immediately preceding proviso.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall, at the request of Parent, to
the extent permitted by Law, adjourn the Stockholders Meeting to a date

received proxies representing a sufficient number of Shares for the Requisite
Company Vote; _provided_ that the Company shall not be required to adjourn the

Stockholders Meeting due to the absence of a quorum or if the Company has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of Shares for the Requisite
Company Vote, and, if applicable, the advisory vote required by Rule 14a-21(c)
under the Exchange Act shall be the only matters which the Company shall
propose to be acted on by the CompanyÂ’s stockholders at the Stockholders
Meeting unless otherwise approved in writing by Parent.

 



 

(c) Subject to Section 6.2, the Company Board shall (i) recommend adoption by
the stockholders of the Company of this Agreement (the " _Company Board
Recommendation_ "), (ii) include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement and (iii) use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all lawful actions to solicit such adoption of this Agreement.

after the date of this Agreement, file or cause to be filed premerger
notifications with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
herein required under the HSR Act and any other applicable Antitrust Law set

(iii) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
Parent and the Company, to the fullest extent reasonably practicable, will
consult in advance with the other and in good faith take into account the
views of the other in connection with, all of the information relating to
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective
Subsidiaries, that appears in any notice, filing or submission made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Proxy Statement), and each of the Company and Parent
shall permit the other party to review reasonably in advance any communication

information relating to it or its directors, officers or employees and which
appears in any such notice, filing, submission or communication or (B)

respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including under the HSR Act, any other applicable Antitrust Law and
any applicable filings and notices to CFIUS. Nothing herein

 



      
 

 



 

shall be deemed to require the Company to provide to Parent disclosure of
export-controlled information or other confidential information considered
classified or confidential by the Department of Commerce, the Department of
State, or any other U.S. government agency. Nothing herein shall prevent
Parent or the Company from (i) designating as for "outside counsel only" any

information related to the valuation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Governmental Entity, to the fullest extent reasonably practicable, the Company

(including summaries of oral communications) received by Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any
third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the fullest extent
reasonably practicable, neither the Company nor Parent shall permit any of its
officers or any other Representatives to participate in any meeting or
conference with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings,
investigation or other inquiry with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity,
gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

 



 

(d) _Antitrust and CFIUS Matters_. Without limiting the generality of the
other undertakings and limitations on undertakings pursuant to this Section
6.5, each of the Company and Parent shall use its respective reasonable best
efforts to:

 



 

(i) not take or permit any of its Affiliates to take any action that would
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



 

(ii) subject to Section 6.5(a)(iii), promptly provide, or cause to be
provided, to each and every federal, state, local or foreign court or
Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable
Antitrust Law (a " _Governmental Antitrust Entity_ ") and to CFIUS of
information and documents that are necessary, proper or advisable to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



 

(iii) obtain CFIUS Clearance; for purposes hereof, " _CFIUS Clearance_ " means

review under Section 721 of the DPA, of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement has been concluded, and CFIUS shall have determined that there are
no unresolved national security concerns with respect to the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, and advised that action under Section 721 of
the DPA, and any investigation related thereto, has been concluded with
respect to the transaction; (B) CFIUS shall have concluded that the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement is not a covered transaction and
not subject to review under Section 721 of the DPA; or (C) CFIUS shall have
sent a report to the President of the United States requesting the PresidentÂ’s
decision on the Joint Notice

 



      
 

 



 

submitted by the Company and Parent and either (1) the period under Section
721 of the DPA during which the President may announce his decision to take
action to suspend or prohibit the transactions contemplated hereby shall have
expired without any such action being announced or taken, or (2) the President
shall have announced a decision not to take any action to suspend or prohibit
the transactions contemplated hereby;

 



 

(iv) obtain from any Governmental Entity any consents, licenses, permits,
waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained by such
party, resolve, avoid or eliminate impediments or objections that may be
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
avoid the entry or enactment of any permanent, preliminary or temporary
injunction or other order, decree, decision, determination, judgment,
investigation or Law that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise
prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere herein, Parent
shall not be obligated to (and the Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent) (A) propose, negotiate, commit to and effect, by
consent decree, hold separate orders or otherwise, the sale, divesture,
disposition, license of any assets, properties, businesses, products, product
lines, rights, or services of Parent, ParentÂ’s Subsidiaries or Affiliates, the
Company, or the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries, or any interest or interests therein,
(B) otherwise take or commit to take actions that after the Closing Date would
limit ParentÂ’s freedom of action with respect to, or its or their ability to
retain, one or more of the assets, properties, businesses, product lines, or
services of Parent, the Company, or ParentÂ’s Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or
any interest or interests therein or (C) agree to take mitigation measures, if
any, to obtain CFIUS Clearance, other than, in the case of clause (C), any
mitigation measure as set forth on Section 6.5 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule; and

 



 

(v) in the event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction,
decision, order, judgment, determination, decree or Law is entered, issued or
enacted, or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered, issued or enacted,
in any proceeding, review or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation
of the Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that
would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of
Parent and the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, any and all steps (including litigation) necessary
to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate, avoid or
remove such actual, anticipated or threatened injunction, decision, order,
judgment, determination, decree or enactment so as to permit such consummation
on a schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by this Agreement.
Parent shall be entitled to direct all clearance discussions and negotiations
with any Governmental Entity or other Person relating to the Merger or
regulatory filings under applicable Antitrust Laws, after due consultation
with Company, to extent legally permissible, and subject to other provisions
of this Section 6.5.

 



      
 

 



 

6.6. _Access and Reports_.

 



 

(a) Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers
and employees to) afford to the officers and other authorized Representatives
of Parent, reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the
period prior to the Effective Time, to its employees, properties, books,
contracts, personnel files and records and, during such period, the Company
shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish to Parent all information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as may be reasonably
requested; _provided_ , that no investigation or provision of information
pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by the Company herein; _provided_ , _further_
, that notwithstanding the investigation or provision of information by any
party, no party shall be deemed to make any representation or warranty except
as expressly set forth in this Agreement; and _provided further,_ in no event
shall Parent be permitted to conduct any sampling of soil, sediment,
groundwater, surface water, air or building materials at any real property
owned or leased by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time without the CompanyÂ’s prior consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld). Nothing in this Section 6.6 shall require the Company
to provide any access, or to disclose any information (i) that in the
reasonable judgment of the Company, would result in the disclosure of any
trade secrets of third parties if the Company shall have used reasonable best
efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or
disclosure, (ii) if providing such access or disclosing such information would
violate Applicable Law (including antitrust and privacy laws), (iii) if such
information is protected by attorney-client privilege to the extent such
privilege cannot be protected by the Company through exercise of its
reasonable efforts or (iv) if such information is required to be kept
confidential by reason of contracts or agreements with third parties. All such
information shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement
and the Clean Team Agreement.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, with respect to the information disclosed
pursuant to Section 6.6, Parent shall comply with, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and Representatives to comply with, all of its obligations under
the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, in each case, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, (i) of any notice or other communication received by such
party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or from any Person alleging that the consent of
such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, if the subject matter of such communication or
the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) of any actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partyÂ’s knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or otherwise affecting such party of any of
its Subsidiaries which relate to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (iii) if such party becomes aware of any facts or circumstances
that such party believes do, or with the passage of time are reasonably likely
to, constitute a material breach of this Agreement by the other party.

 



      
 

 



 

6.7. _Stock Exchange De-listing_. Parent shall cause the CompanyÂ’s securities
to be de-listed from the NYSE and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon
as practicable following the Effective Time.

 



 

6.8. _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a
joint press release. Thereafter, the parties hereto will consult with each
other and will mutually agree upon any press releases or public announcements
pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall
not issue any such press releases or make any such public announcements prior
to such consultation and agreement, except as may be required by applicable
Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange (and then only after as much advance notice and
consultation as is practicable). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Company nor Parent needs to consult or agree with the other with respect to
any press release or public announcement to be issued or made with respect to
any Change of Recommendation or in connection with an Acquisition Proposal
from, negotiations with, or an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with, any
third party, and neither Parent nor the Company shall be required to consult
with the other party hereto in connection with any such press release or
public announcement in connection with any dispute between the parties
regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

6.9. _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) From the Effective Time and continuing through December 31, 2015, Parent
shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to the
Company Employees who are employed by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Closing (other than any employees covered by a
Collective Bargaining Agreement) (i) base salaries or regular hourly wage
allowances and annual cash incentive compensation opportunities that are no
less favorable than the base salaries or regular hourly wage allowances and
annual cash incentive compensation opportunities provided to such Company
Employees by the Company and the Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) employee benefits that are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to such Company Employees by
the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time under
the applicable Benefit Plans as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (iii) severance benefits that are no less favorable than (x) the
Benefit Plans set forth in Section 6.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
applicable to such Company Employee (other than any Covered Individual)
immediately prior to the Effective Time for any Company Employees primarily
located in the United States, Mexico, Singapore and United Kingdom (the "
_Core Countries_ ") and (y) any Benefit Plan providing severance benefits
applicable to such Company Employee (other than any Covered Individual)
immediately prior to the Effective Time for any Company Employee primarily
located in a country other than a Core Country.

 



 

(b) To the extent permitted under applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation
will cause any employee benefit plans (other than any equity based plan or
defined benefit plan) which Company Employees are entitled to participate in
to take into account for purposes of eligibility, vesting, and, with respect
to vacation, paid time-off and severance benefits only, the level of benefits
thereunder, service by Company Employees as if such service were with Parent
or its applicable Affiliate in the same jurisdiction as (or if not available,
in the

 



      
 

 



 

jurisdiction most comparable in respect of such benefits to) the jurisdiction
in which any such Company Employee is employed, to the same extent such
service was credited under a comparable Benefit Plan (for Company Employees
primarily located in a Core Country) or comparable employee benefit plan for
the benefit of Company Employees primarily located in a country other than a
Core Country (except to the extent it would result in a duplication of
benefits).

 



 

(c) To the extent permitted under applicable Law, with respect to any employee
benefit plans maintained for the benefit of the employees, Parent will cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries in respect of Company Employees
to (i) cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition exclusion and
actively-at-work requirements and similar limitations, eligibility waiting
periods and evidence of insurability to the same extent such exclusions or
requirements were not applicable under the comparable Benefit Plan, in each
case as of the Effective Time and (ii) give effect, in determining any
deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, amounts paid
by such Company Employees during the plan year in which Effective Time occurs
under the comparable Benefit Plan, in each case maintained by the Company and
its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) With respect to Company Employees, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor, fulfill and discharge the CompanyÂ’s and its
SubsidiariesÂ’ obligations under all Benefit Plans, in each case in existence
as of the date hereof or after the date hereof in accordance with Section 6.1
and all employment, change in control or severance agreements entered into
prior to the date hereof, including with respect to the Covered Individuals
(as defined below). For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of any Benefit
Plan or any agreement between a Company Employee and the Company or any
Subsidiary containing a definition of "change in control" or "change of
control", the Closing shall be deemed to constitute a "change in control" or
"change of control".

 



 

(e) The parties agree to take the actions with respect to the employment,
severance or change in control agreements with respect to the persons set
forth on Schedule 6.9(e) (the " _Covered Individuals_ ").

 



 

(f) Except as set forth in Section 9.8, this Section 6.9 shall be binding upon
and shall inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this
Agreement, and nothing in this Section 6.9, express or implied, is intended to
confer upon any other Person (including for the avoidance of doubt any current
or former directors, officers, employees, contractors or consultants of any of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or
on or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries) any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Section 6.9. No provision of this Agreement is intended to, or
does, (i) prohibit the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates from amending
or terminating any Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms and applicable
Law, (ii) require the Surviving Corporation to keep any person employed for
any period of time, or (iii) constitute the establishment or adoption of, or
amendment to, any Benefit Plan or other benefit plan, program or arrangement,
and no person participating in any such Benefit Plan maintained by either the
Company or Parent shall have any claim or cause of action, under ERISA or

 



      
 

 



 

otherwise, in respect of any provisions of this Agreement as it relates to any
such Benefit Plan or otherwise.

 



 

6.10. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.5, whether or not
the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expense, except (a) Parent
and the Company shall each bear 50% of the expenses incurred by the Company in
connection with the filing fees for the Proxy Statement (and printing and
mailing the Proxy Statement) and (b) for ParentÂ’s reimbursement and
indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 6.13.

 



 

6.11. _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company and the Company Board shall grant such approvals and take such actions
as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such
transactions.

 



 

6.12. _Parent Vote and Merger Sub_.

 



 

(a) Immediately after the date hereof, Parent shall vote (or consent with
respect to) or cause to be voted (or a consent to be given with respect to)
all of the shares of common stock of Merger Sub in favor of the adoption and
approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby at a
meeting of stockholders of Merger Sub at which this Agreement shall be
submitted for adoption and approval and at all adjournments or postponements
thereof (or by any action of the sole stockholder of Merger Sub by consent in
lieu of a meeting)

 



 

(b) Parent will take all action necessary (i) to cause Merger Sub to perform
its obligations under this Agreement to consummate the Merger on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement and (ii) to ensure that, prior to the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not conduct any business or make any
investments other than as contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall be
responsible for any failure of Merger Sub to comply with any representation,
warranty, covenant or other provision required to be performed on or prior to
the Closing, under this Agreement.

 



 

6.13. _Financing Cooperation_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, use reasonable best efforts to provide to Parent and Merger Sub, at
ParentÂ’s sole expense, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is
customary or necessary in connection with obtaining financing in connection
with the Merger (so long as such cooperation does not unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries), including,
upon the reasonable request of Parent, (i) preparing and furnishing to Parent
any pertinent information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries that is
customarily included in an information package used in connection with the
syndication of financing in connection with transactions similar to the
Merger, (ii) having the Company designate members of senior

 



      
 

 



 

management to participate with reasonable advance notice and at reasonable
times in a reasonable number of presentations, due diligence sessions,
drafting sessions and sessions with ratings agencies in connection with any
such financing, and (iii) providing to Parent the resolutions of the Company
Board approving this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby, and recommending the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of
the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.13
until the Effective Time occurs, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective Representatives shall (i) be
required to pay any commitment or other similar fee, (ii) enter into any
definitive agreement or have any liability or any obligation under any
certificate, document, instrument, credit agreement or any related document or
any other agreement or document related to the financing in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case that is not contingent upon
the Closing, (iii) be required to incur any expenses in connection with such
financing or (iv) be required to take any action in his or her capacity as a
director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to such
financing. Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees) incurred
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives
in connection with their respective obligations pursuant to, and in accordance
with, this Section 6.13, and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company,
its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and
all damages, losses, costs, liabilities or expenses suffered or incurred by
any of them in connection with the arrangement of ParentÂ’s financing and any
information used in connection therewith (other than information provided by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) and all other actions taken by the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives pursuant to
this Section 6.13. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed, on a
reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of ParentÂ’s
financing (or any alternative or other contemplated financing for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), including any material change in
ParentÂ’s plans or intentions as previously notified, regarding such financing.

 



 

(b) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of
financing is not a condition to Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, if any
financing contemplated to be obtained by Parent or Merger Sub in connection
with the Merger has not been obtained prior to Closing, Parent and Merger Sub
shall continue to be obligated, subject to the fulfillment or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VII, to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the Closing in accordance with
this Agreement.

 



 

6.14. _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such
steps as may be reasonably required or advisable to cause dispositions of
Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the
transactions contemplated hereby by each individual who is a director or
officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

 



 

6.15. _Transaction Litigation_. In the event that any stockholder litigation
related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement is brought against the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or the
members of the Company Board or the board of directors of any of the CompanyÂ’s
Subsidiaries after the date of this Agreement and

 



      
 

 



 

prior to the Effective Time (" _Transaction Litigation_ "), the Company shall
promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) notify Parent of any such
Transaction Litigation, give Parent the opportunity to participate in, but not
control, the defense of any such litigation and keep Parent reasonably
informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company agrees that it shall
not compromise, offer to settle, agree to any settlement of or come to any
arrangement regarding any such litigation without ParentÂ’s prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Parent shall notify the Company promptly (and in any event within 48
hours) of the commencement of any such litigation of which it has received
notice.

 



 

6.16. _Director and Officer Liability_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation agrees that
it will, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and
hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, _provided_ that the Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such Person is not entitled to indemnification), each present and former
director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneysÂ’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or related to such Indemnified PartiesÂ’ service as a director
or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries or services performed by such
persons at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for "tail" insurance policies
providing for the extension of (i) the directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability
coverage of the CompanyÂ’s existing directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ insurance
policies, and (ii) the CompanyÂ’s existing fiduciary liability insurance
policies, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of six years
from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the CompanyÂ’s current insurance carrier with respect
to directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as the
CompanyÂ’s existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged error,
misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or
any matter claimed against a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ ,

successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation

substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation

otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right
thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

8.1. _Termination by Mutual Consent_. This Agreement may be terminated and the

obligations under this Agreement.

Merger may be abandoned by the Company by action of the Company Board:

the Company has complied with the requirements of Section 6.2(e) that the
Company is required to satisfy before taking action pursuant to this Section
8.3(a) and such Superior Proposal did not result from a breach of Section 6.2;
or

shorter period of time that remains between the date the Company provides

Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.3(a) if it is then in material breach of any representation,
warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder that would result in the
closing conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) not being satisfied.

 



 

8.4. _Termination by Parent_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time by Parent:

termination the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal is consummated
(in each case whether or not such Acquisition Proposal is the same as the

this clause (i) the references to "20%" in the definition of " _Acquisition

(iv) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(a)
(relating to an Alternative Acquisition Agreement);

 



      
 

 



 

then the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than three (3) Business
Days after the date of such termination (or (A) in the case of clause (i) or
(ii) above, within three (3) Business Days after the date on which the Company
enters into a definitive agreement with respect to or consummates the
Acquisition Proposal referred to in clause (i)(C) or (ii)(C) above,
respectively, or (B) in the case of clause (iv) above, immediately prior to,
or concurrently with, termination of this Agreement by the Company), pay
Parent the Termination Fee (as defined below) by wire transfer of same day
funds (it being understood that in no event shall the Company be required to
pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion). The term " _Termination
Fee_ " shall mean an amount equal to $70 million. Any Termination Fee paid to
Parent pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by
Parent to the Company for such purpose.

time of such termination or the Requisite Company Vote shall not have been
obtained at or prior to the time of such termination) or Section 8.2(b)
(relating to failure to obtain the Requisite Company Vote at the Company
Stockholders Meeting), then the Company shall reimburse Parent $15,000,000 in
respect of expenses incurred by Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent
within two (2) Business Days of such termination. Any amount so received by

Date were the date of such termination), then Parent shall promptly, but in no
event later than three (3) Business Days after the date of such termination,
pay to the Company the Reverse Termination Fee (as defined below) by wire
transfer of same day funds (it being understood that in no event shall Parent
be required to pay the Reverse Termination Fee on more than one occasion);

Fee_ " shall mean an amount equal to $70 million. Any Reverse Termination Fee
paid to the Company pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing
by the Company to Parent for such purpose.

 



 

(e) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.5
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that without these

 



      
 

 



 

agreements, the parties hereto would not enter into this Agreement;

Parent receives the Termination Fee from the Company pursuant to and in
accordance with this Section 8.5, such payment shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates against the
Company, its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current, or
future stockholders, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents for any losses
or damages suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement made by the Company in this Agreement or in any
certificate or other document delivered in connection herewith (other than in
connection with any intentional and material breach of this Agreement) or the

covenant or agreement made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement or in any
certificate or other document delivered in connection herewith (other than in
connection with any intentional and material breach of this Agreement) or the
failure of the Merger to be consummated, and upon payment of such amount if
and when due, none of Parent, its Affiliates or any of their respective
former, current, or future stockholders, directors, officers, Affiliates or
agents shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(other than in connection with any intentional and material breach of this

(d) _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties hereto
shall be entitled, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance
with Article VIII, to an injunction or

 



      
 

 



 

injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in any of the Chosen
Courts, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or
in equity. Each party hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by such party, and
to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of such party under this Agreement. Any party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction. The parties hereto further agree that (x) by seeking the
remedies provided for in this Section 9.5(d), a party shall not in any respect
waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to a
party under this Agreement (including monetary damages) in the event that the
remedies provided for in this Section 9.5(d) are not available or otherwise
are not granted, and (y) nothing set forth in this Section 9.5(d) shall
require any party hereto to institute any proceeding for (or limit any partyÂ’s
right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this Section
9.5(d) prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under
Article VIII (and/or seeking any other form of relief that may be available to
a party under this Agreement (including monetary damages)).

9.7. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any exhibits hereto), the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule, the letter
agreement, dated July 11, 2014, as amended, modified or supplemented from time
to time, between Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ")
and the letter agreement, dated July 29, 2014, as amended, modified or
supplemented from time to time, between Parent and the Company (the " _Clean
Team Agreement_ "), constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other
prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties both written
and oral, among the parties hereto, with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof.

 



 

9.8. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to, and
shall not, confer upon any other Person any rights, benefits or remedies of
any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than (a)
with respect to the provisions of Section 6.16 (of which each Indemnified
Party is an intended beneficiary following the Effective Time), (b) with
respect to the provisions set forth in the last sentence of Section 6.13(a)
(of which the Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries are intended
beneficiaries following the Effective Time), (c) following the Effective Time,
the rights of the holders of Shares to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and
(d) following the Effective Time, the rights of the

 



      
 

 



 

holders of Options, RSUs and PSUs to receive the payments contemplated by
Section 4.3, and the rights of the Covered Individuals to receive the payments
contemplated by Section 6.9(e) (of which each of the holders of Shares, the
holders of Options, RSUs and PSUs and the Covered Individuals is an intended
beneficiary following the Effective Time). Except as set forth in this Section
9.8, nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon
any Person other than the parties hereto any legal or equitable right, benefit
or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

9.9. _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include
an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take
such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving
Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

 



 

9.10. _Mutual Drafting_. The parties hereto have participated jointly in
negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of
proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party hereto by virtue of the
authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

9.11. _Cooperation_. The parties agree to provide reasonable cooperation with
each other and to execute and deliver such further documents, certificates,
agreements and instruments and to take such other actions as may be reasonably
requested by the other parties to evidence or reflect the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to carry out the intent and
purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

9.12. _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in Annex A is defined in the
Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term. Any capitalized terms
used in any Exhibit, Annex or Schedule but not otherwise defined therein,
shall have the meaning as defined in this Agreement.

 



 

9.13. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefore in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

 



      
 

 



 

9.14. _Interpretation; Construction_.

 



 

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof.

 



 

(b) Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such
reference shall be to a Section or Exhibit, as applicable, of this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated. All Exhibits and Schedules annexed hereto or
referred to herein are hereby incorporated in and made a part of this
Agreement as if set forth in full herein. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The word "extent" in the phrase
"to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other theory
extends and such phrase shall not mean "if." The word "or" shall not be
exclusive unless expressly indicated otherwise.

 



 

(c) Any singular term in this Agreement shall be deemed to include the plural,
and any plural term the singular. References in the singular or to "him,"
"her," "it," "itself," or other like references, and references in the plural
or the feminine or masculine reference, as the case may be, shall also, when
the context so requires, be deemed to include the plural or singular, or the
masculine or feminine reference, as the case may be.

 



 

(d) References to any statute shall be deemed to refer to such statute as
amended from time to time and to any rules or regulations promulgated
thereunder. References to any agreement or contract are to that agreement or
contract as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time in accordance
with the terms hereof and thereof. References to any Person include the
successors and permitted assigns of that Person. References from or through
any date mean, unless otherwise specified, from and including or through and
including, respectively.

 



 

(e) References to "days" shall refer to calendar days unless Business Days are
specified. If any period expires on a day which is not a Business Day or any
event or condition is required by the terms of this Agreement to occur or be
fulfilled on a day which is not a Business Day, such period shall expire or
such event or condition shall occur or be fulfilled, as the case may be, on
the next succeeding Business Day. Any action required to be taken "within" a
specified time period following the occurrence of an event shall be required
to be taken by no later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on the last day of such
time period, which shall be calculated starting with the day immediately
following the date of the event.

 



 

(f) An accounting term not otherwise defined has the meaning assigned to it in
accordance with GAAP.

 



 

(g) All monetary figures shall be in United States dollars unless otherwise
specified.

 



 

(h) "made available" means (unless otherwise specified), with respect to a
particular document, item or other piece of information, inclusion and
availability in the virtual data room hosted by Intralinks in connection with
the Merger on or prior to 5:00 p.m. New York time on August 19, 2014.

 



      
 

 



 

9.15. _Disclosure Schedules_. The parties hereto agree that any reference in a
particular Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure
Schedule, as applicable, shall be deemed to be an exception to (or, as
applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) the representations and warranties
(or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant party that are contained in the
corresponding Section of this Agreement and any other representations and
warranties of such party that is contained in this Agreement to which the
relevance of such item thereto is reasonably apparent on its face (other than
any matters required to be disclosed for purposes of Sections 5.1(b)(i),
5.1(b)(iii) or 5.1(f), which matters shall only be disclosed by specific
disclosure in the corresponding section of the Company Disclosure Schedule).
Each party here has or may have set forth information in the Company
Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, in a section
thereof that corresponds to the Section of this Agreement to which it relates.
The fact that any item of information is disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed to mean that
such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement. The mere
inclusion of an item by the Company in the Company Disclosure Schedule or by
Parent and Merger Sub in the Parent Disclosure Schedule as an exception to
(or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) a representation or warranty
shall not be deemed an admission that (a) such item represents a material
exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or
would reasonably be expected to have, with respect to the Company, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, and with respect to Parent, a material adverse
effect, as applicable or (b) such information (or any non-disclosed
information of comparable or greater significance) is required to be disclosed
by the terms of this Agreement or is material to the business, results of
operations or financial condition of the Company or Parent, as applicable.

 



 

9.16. _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Merger Sub shall be permitted to assign its rights and obligations under this
Agreement to any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent without such consent upon
notice to the Company; _provided_ , _further_ , that such assignment by Merger
Sub shall not (a) relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its obligations
hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any obligation of the Company or (b)
prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Any
purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.
