In the event that the Escrow Representative believes in good faith that the Closing Net Debt Statement or Closing Net Working Capital Schedule is not accurate or has not been determined on the basis set forth in Section 2.8(a), the Escrow Representative shall inform Parent in writing (the " _Escrow Representative s Objection_"), setting forth a specific description of the basis of the Escrow Representatives Objection and the adjustments to the Closing Net Debt or Closing Net Working Capital which the Escrow Representative believes should be made, on or before the last day of such thirty (30) day period. Failure to notify Parent within such thirty (30) day period shall constitute acceptance and approval by the Escrow Representative of Parents Closing Net Debt Statement and Closing Net Working Capital Schedule. If the Escrow Representative objects to the Closing Net Debt Statement or Closing Net Working Capital Schedule, Parent shall then have fifteen (15) days to review and respond to the Escrow Representatives Objection. If any proposed change set forth in the Escrow Representatives Objection is not accepted by Parent, then Parent shall within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the Escrow Representatives Objection give written notice to the Escrow Representative of Parents objection to such change (the " _Parent s Objection_"). Failure to so notify the Escrow Representative within such fifteen (15) day period shall constitute acceptance and approval by Parent of the Escrow Representatives Objection. Parents Closing Net Debt Statement and Closing Net Working Capital Schedule, as adjusted for any matter included in the Escrow Representatives Objection that is not disputed in Parents Objection, shall be deemed conclusively accepted by the Escrow Representative and Parent, except in respect of those matters still in dispute in accordance herewith. For a period of fifteen (15) days after Parents Objection (the " _Negotiation Period_ "), the Escrow Representative 

   ##### 

  

    

and Parent shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any remaining disputes as
expeditiously as possible. 

  

 (c) If Parent and the Escrow Representative are unable to resolve all of their disagreements with respect to the determination of Closing Net Debt or Closing Net Working Capital after the expiration of the Negotiation Period, they shall refer their remaining differences to a mutually agreeable nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "), which shall determine solely on the basis of the standard set forth in Section 2.8(a) hereof, and only with respect to the remaining differences and objections so submitted, whether and to what extent, if any, the Closing Net Debt or Closing Net Working Capital requires adjustment. Each of Parent and the Escrow Representative shall make complete submissions to the Independent Accounting Firm within ten (10) days following the engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm. Failure by either party to make a complete submission prior to the ten (10) day period will be deemed to be a waiver of such partys right to make a submission. The parties shall instruct the Independent Accounting Firm to deliver its written determination to the Escrow Representative and Parent no later than the twentieth (20th) day after the remaining differences underlying the Escrow Representatives Objection and Parents Objection are referred to the Independent Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm shall resolve the dispute and determine the Closing Net Debt and Closing Net Working Capital, not on the basis of an independent review, but only within the disputed range and based on the standard set forth in this Agreement. Such resolution shall be set forth in a written statement delivered to Parent and the Escrow Representative. The Independent Accounting Firms determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Escrow Representative and Parent. The fees and disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be shared equally by Parent and the Escrow Representative. 

  

 (d) Within ten (10) Business Days following determination of the Closing Net Debt and the Closing Net Working Capital (as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.8) Parent shall make an adjustment to, and publicly disclose in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC its determination of, the maximum number of Earnout Shares issuable pursuant to Section 2.9(b), (c), (d) or (e), as follows: (i) for every dollar by which (a) the net debt included in Schedule 2.8(d)(i) exceeds the Closing Net Debt and/or (b) the Closing Net Working Capital exceeds the net working capital included in Schedule 2.8(d)(ii), the Earnout Shares issuable upon the achievement of the First Target, or, if the First Target is not achieved, the Second Target, under Section 2.9(b), (c), (d) or (e), as the case may be, shall be increased (without duplication) by an amount equal to (x) $1 divided by (y) the Trust Value Per Share, and (ii) for every dollar by which (a) the Closing Net Debt exceeds the net debt included in Schedule 2.8(d)(i) and/or (b) the net working capital included in Schedule 2.8(d)(ii) exceeds the Closing Net Working Capital, the Earnout Shares issuable upon the achievement of the First Target, or, if the First Target is not achieved, the Second Target, under Section 2.9(b), (c), (d) or (e), as the case may be, shall be decreased (without duplication) by an amount equal to (x) $1 divided by (y) the Trust Value Per Share (the amount of the increase or decrease pursuant to clause (i) or clause (ii) of this Section 2.8 being referred to as the " _Earnout Adjustment_ "), in either case, together with interest on the Earnout Adjustment at the rate designated by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as its prime rate in effect on the Closing Date for the period from and including the Closing Date to, but excluding, the date of such issuance of such Earnout Shares. The adjustment to the maximum number of Earnout Shares issuable shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Merger 

   ##### 

  

    

Consideration. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued
by virtue of Section 2.8(d), and each holder of shares of Company Common
Stock and Company Preferred Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise receive)
shall, subject to compliance with Section 2.10 hereof, receive from Parent,
in lieu of such fractional share, a number of shares that is rounded up to the
next whole number. 

  

 Section 2.9 _Earnout_. 

   

 (a) Subject to Section 2.8(d), a total number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to up to (i) $156,000,000 divided by (ii) the Trust Value Per Share (the " _Earnout Shares_ "), divided into two tranches, the first of which shall consist of $50,000,000 divided by the Trust Value Per Share of the total Earnout Shares (the " _First Tranche_ ") and the second of which shall consist of $106,000,000 divided by the Trust Value Per Share of the total Earnout Shares (the " _Second Tranche_ ") (each, a " _Tranche_ "), shall be issuable to the Company Stockholders subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Section 2.9. 

  

 (b) Not more than ten (10) Business Days after Parent has filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, Parent shall notify the Escrow Representative of and shall publicly disclose in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC of its determination of the Earnout EBITDA for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009. If the Earnout EBITDA for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, is equal to or greater than $55,000,000 (the achievement of the foregoing, the " _First Target_ "), then within ten (10) Business Days, or twenty (20) Business Days if the Company has made any election of the type described in Section 2.9(f), after the public disclosure of the Earnout EBITDA for such period, Parent shall issue the First Tranche of the Earnout Shares (less any Earnout Shares for which an offer made by the Company pursuant to Section 2.9(f) has been accepted), which shares (the " _First Target Shares_ ") and cash, if any, shall be allocated among the Company Stockholders in accordance with Section 2.9(g) hereof. Except as specified in Section 2.9(e), if the First Target is not achieved upon completion of the audit of Parents financial statements for 2009, the First Target Shares shall not be issuable. 

  

 (c) Not more than ten (10) Business Days after Parent has filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, Parent shall notify the Escrow Representative of and shall publicly disclose in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC of its determination of the Earnout EBITDA for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010. If the Earnout EBITDA for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, is equal to or greater than $78,000,000 (the achievement of the foregoing, the " _Second Target_ "), then within ten (10) Business Days, or twenty (20) Business Days if the Company has made any election of the type described in Section 2.9(f), after the public disclosure of the Earnout EBITDA for such period, Parent shall issue the Second Tranche of the Earnout Shares (less any Additional First Tranche Earnout Shares issued in accordance with Section 2.9(d) and less any Earnout Shares for which an offer made by the Company pursuant to Section 2.9(f) has been accepted), which shares (the " _Second Target Shares_ ") and cash, if any, shall be allocated among the Company Stockholders in accordance with Section 2.9(g) hereof. Except as specified in Section 2.9(e), if the Second Target is not achieved upon completion of the audit of Parents financial statements for 2010, the Second Target Shares shall not be issuable. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) In addition to the foregoing, if the Earnout EBITDA for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 is greater than $55,000,000, then for every dollar by which such Earnout EBITDA exceeds $55,000,000 up to a maximum of $80,000,000 of Earnout EBITDA, Parent shall within ten (10) Business Days, or twenty (20) Business Days if the Company has made any election of the type described in Section 2.9(f), after the public disclosure of the Earnout EBITDA for such period, Parent shall issue additional First Target Shares equal to (i) $1 divided by (ii) the Trust Value Per Share (the " _Additional First Tranche Earnout Shares_ ") (less any Earnout Shares for which an offer made by the Company pursuant to Section 2.9(f) has been accepted), which shares and cash, if any, shall be allocated among the Company Stockholders in accordance with Section 2.9(g) hereof. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the First Target is not met and the cumulative Earnout EBITDA for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2009 and 2010 is equal to or greater than $133,000,000, then within ten (10) Business Days, or twenty (20) Business Days if the Company has made any election of the type described in Section 2.9(f), Parent shall issue the First Target Shares (less any Earnout Shares for which an offer made by the Company pursuant to Section 2.9(f) has been accepted) and cash, if any, which shares and cash, if any, shall be allocated among the Company Stockholders in accordance with Section 2.9(g) hereof. 

  

 (f) At the Company s option, exercisable in its sole discretion within five (5) Business Days following the public disclosure of any Earnout EBITDA amounts, if any of the Earnout EBITDA targets referenced in Sections 2.9(b), (c), (d) or (e) have been achieved, the Company shall have the right to make an offer to Company Stockholders to pay up to 20% of the consideration to be issued in accordance with Sections 2.9(b), (c), (d) and (e) in cash rather than in shares of Parent Common Stock (using a value per share equal to the Trust Value Per Share). Any such offer shall be made to all Company Stockholders and may be accepted by any or all of such Company Stockholders for a period of ten (10) Business Days after the public disclosure by the Company pursuant to the previous sentence. If Parent elects to make an offer to Company Stockholders pursuant to this Section 2.9(f), Parent shall deliver by nationally-recognized overnight courier to each Company Stockholder written notice of such offer accompanied by a form of election pursuant to which such Company Stockholder may elect to receive cash in lieu of shares pursuant to such offer. If a Company Stockholder does not return the form of election, such Company Stockholder shall receive cash or shares, as determined by the Company it its sole discretion. 

  

 (g) In the event that Earnout Shares are issuable pursuant to Sections 2.9(b), (c), (d) or (e), holders of Company Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a number of such Earnout Shares equal to the Preferred Earnout Percentage multiplied by the number of Earnout Shares, and holders of Company Common Stock shall be entitled to a number of Earnout Shares equal to the Common Earnout Percentage multiplied by the number of Earnout Shares. 

  

 (h) In the event the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall be subdivided or reclassified into a greater number of shares of Parent Common Stock, the Earnout Shares issuable upon the achievement of the applicable milestones shall be equitably and proportionately increased and, conversely, in connection with any such combination or reclassification into a smaller number of shares of Parent Common Stock, the Earnout Shares 

   ##### 

  

    

issuable upon the achievement of the applicable milestones shall be equitably
and proportionately reduced. For example, for purposes of clarity, assuming
6,250,000 shares would be the amount of shares of Parent Common Stock issued
as the Earnout Shares in the First Tranche, (x) in the case of a 2-for-1
stock split of Parent Common Stock, the Earnout Shares issuable upon the
achievement of the first milestone shall be increased from 6,250,000 to
12,500,000 and (y) in the case of a 1-for-2 reverse stock split of Parent
Common Stock, the Earnout Shares issuable upon the achievement of the first
milestone shall be reduced from 6,250,000 to 3,125,000 (assuming for the
purposes of this example that there are no adjustments to the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock in a Tranche). 

  

 (i) Without limiting the specificity of any of the foregoing, it is the intent of the parties to provide for fair and equitable adjustments to the Earnout Shares to preserve the economic benefits intended to be provided to the Company Stockholders under the terms of this Agreement in the event there is any change in or conversion of the Parent Common Stock and, accordingly, the Parent Board of Directors shall make appropriate equitable adjustments in connection therewith, as determined in the good faith judgment of the Parent Board of Directors. 

  

 (j) No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Earnout, and each holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Closing who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise receive) shall, upon compliance with Section 2.10 hereof, receive from Parent, in lieu of such fractional share, a number of Earnout Shares that is rounded up to the next whole number. 

  

 Section 2.10 _Surrender of Certificates_. 

   

 (a) Upon surrender of their Company Certificates at the Closing with a properly completed letter of transmittal (the form of such letter of transmittal to be provided by Parent to the Company for delivery to the Company Stockholders no later than five (5) Business Days prior to Closing), the holders of the Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock shall receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration and certificates representing the Initial Parent Shares into which their shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock shall be converted at the Effective Time, less the Escrowed Indemnity Shares, and the Company Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Company Certificates will be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration or, in the case of holders of Appraisal Shares, the right to receive the applicable payments set forth in Section 2.7(f). 

  

 (b) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the date of this Agreement with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Company Certificates with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued upon surrender thereof until the holders of record of such Company Certificates shall surrender such Company Certificates. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any such Company Certificates with a properly completed letter of transmittal, Parent shall promptly deliver to the record holders thereof, without interest, the 

   ##### 

  

    

Merger Consideration and the amount of any such dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to the Merger Consideration. 

  

 Section 2.11 _Indemnity Escrow_. As a remedy for the indemnity set forth in Article VII, at the Closing, Parent shall deposit with Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") (or another escrow agent mutually agreed to by Parent and the Company) a number of the Initial Parent Shares having a value of $12,500,000 (using a value per share equal to the Trust Value Per Share) (the " _Escrowed Indemnity Shares_ "), to be held in an escrow account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") and released therefrom (if applicable) from time to time to Parent in satisfaction of such indemnity, all in accordance with Article VII hereof and the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement. On or prior to the second (2nd) Business Day following the Indemnity Escrow Release Date, the Escrow Agent shall release to the Company Stockholders from the Escrow Account, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, a number of Escrowed Indemnity Shares equal to the excess of the number of the Escrowed Indemnity Shares then held in the Escrow Account over Escrowed Shares having a value (based on the average of the Closing Price of Parent Common Stock for the ten (10) consecutive Business Days immediately prior to the Indemnity Escrow Release Date) equal to the aggregate amount of unsatisfied or disputed claims for Losses specified in claims notices properly delivered in accordance with Section 7.3 on or prior to the Indemnity Escrow Release Date. Upon such release, the released Escrowed Indemnity Shares shall be issued to the Company Stockholders in accordance with Section 2.7(c) of the Company Disclosure Statement and the Escrow Agreement. Any Escrowed Indemnity Shares held with respect to any unresolved claims for indemnification shall continue to be held in the Escrow Account until the final resolution of such claims, and upon such final resolution, shall be applied in satisfaction of such claim for indemnification and any amounts in excess of the amounts needed to satisfy such claims for indemnification shall be delivered in accordance with the preceding sentence.

Parent agrees that the Proxy Statement and the Other Filings will comply in all material respects with all applicable Laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Whenever any event occurs which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or any Other Filing, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, will promptly inform the other party of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the SEC or its staff or any other government officials, and/or mailing to Parent Stockholders, such amendment or supplement.

The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, including by participating in customary investor presentations and road shows. 

  

 (e) The Company shall review the Proxy Statement and shall confirm in writing to Parent, as of the date of mailing the Proxy Statement to Parent Stockholders, that the information relating to the Company contained in the Proxy Statement does not, to the knowledge of the Company, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (the " _Proxy Confirmation_ ").

which event, Parent shall purchase the greatest coverage available for
such amount). Nothing in this Section 5.7 shall affect the right of any
directors or officers that continue their employment with Parent to
participate in any directors and officers liability insurance policy in

The Company further acknowledges that Parents sole assets consist of the cash proceeds of the public offering (the " _IPO_ ") and private placements of its securities, and that substantially all of those proceeds have been deposited in the Trust Account for the benefit of Parent, certain of its stockholders and the underwriters of its IPO. The monies in the Trust Account may be disbursed only (i) to Parents Public Stockholders (as such term is defined in the agreement governing the Trust Account) in the event of the redemption of their shares or the liquidation of Parent, (ii) to Parent in an aggregate amount of up to $1,750,000 of interest accrued from the Trust Account for working capital, (iii) to Parent after it consummates an Initial Business Combination, and (iv) if Parent fails to complete an Initial Business Combination within the allotted time period and liquidates, subject to the terms of the agreement governing the Trust Account, to Parents Public Stockholders. For and in consideration of Parent agreeing to evaluate the Company for purposes of consummating an Initial Business Combination with it, the Company and its Subsidiaries and each holder of Company Common Stock hereby agrees that it does not have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account (any " _Claim_ ") and hereby waives any Claim it may have in the future as a result of, or

In the event that the Parent or any of Parents Affiliates shall receive, prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, any offer, proposal, or request, directly or indirectly, with respect to a Parent Acquisition Proposal, or any request for disclosure or access to information regarding Parent, except with the prior written consent of Company in its sole discretion, Parent shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) notify the Company thereof, including information as to the material terms of the Parent Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Parent Acquisition Proposal or request. 

  

 (c) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that the provisions of this Section 5.10 were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed by the parties hereto that the 

   ##### 

  

    

Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to an immediate
injunction or injunctions, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of
money damages as a remedy and without the necessity of posting any bond or
other security, to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Section 5.10 and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction, specific performance being
the sole remedy with respect to this Section 5.10 if it is available. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the

 Section 5.13 _Tax Treatment_. Parent and its Subsidiaries shall report the Merger on their U.S. Tax Returns as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Except as required to comply with applicable Tax Law or any settlement or compromise of a Tax audit, examination or other Tax proceeding with any taxing authority, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall not take on their Tax Returns or otherwise any position inconsistent with (i) the Tax treatment of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, or (ii) the Tax treatment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of the transactions contemplated by the IDE Merger Agreement or the Contribution Agreements to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries was a party as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or as a transfer described in Section 351(a) or (b) of the Code.

   ##### 

  

   

all reasonable requests made by Parent and its appointed agents in connection
with such investigations. The Environmental Reports shall be conducted in
accordance with applicable ASTM standards and shall also include an assessment
of compliance with applicable Environmental Laws, regulations and permits.
The Environmental Reports shall include cost estimates calculated in good
faith for the remediation of each identified Recognized Environmental

 Section 7.2 _Indemnification of Parent_. 

   

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Article VII and the consummation of the Merger, the Escrowed Indemnity Shares shall be used to indemnify and defend, save and hold harmless Parent, the Surviving Entity and their respective directors, officers, agents, employees, successors and assigns (the " _Parent Indemnitees_ ") from and against all Losses asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon, or incurred by any Parent Indemnitee by reason of, arising out of or resulting from: 

   

 (i) the failure of any of any representation or warranty of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement, any Transaction Document, any schedule or any certificate delivered by the Company to Parent pursuant to this Agreement with respect hereto or thereto in connection with the Closing to be true and correct in all respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of Closing as if made as of the Closing (except in the case of any representation or warranty that speaks only as of a specific date, which representation or warranty shall be true and correct as of such date); 

   

 (ii) failure of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to fully perform, fulfill or comply with any covenant or agreement of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries contained in this Agreement;

 (iv) the Reorganization Taxes; 

   

 (v) any amounts paid pursuant to any judgment or settlement entered in connection with the litigation listed on Section 3.12 of the Company Disclosure Statement;

Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder from the Merger
Consideration payable to any holder of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock that did not deliver to Parent a duly executed "Non-Foreign
Person Affidavit" as described in Section 5.12; or 

   

 (vii) Parents enforcement of its rights under this Section 7.2. 

  

 (b) Subject to the other limitations contained herein, the Parent Indemnitees shall be entitled to be indemnified in respect of Section 7.2(a) (other than in the case of the exceptions in the final proviso of this Section 7.2(b)) solely and exclusively from the Escrowed Indemnity Shares in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, and such Escrowed Indemnity Shares shall constitute the sole source of recovery for any claims by Parent Indemnitees arising under this Agreement; provided that no Losses of any Parent Indemnitees shall be indemnifiable pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i) (other than in respect of any breach of the representations set forth in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.6(f), 3.8, and 3.27) unless and until the aggregate amount of all such Losses otherwise payable exceeds $1,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ ") , at which time the Parent Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification for such Losses in excess of the Deductible; provided, further that no Losses of any Parent Indemnitees shall be indemnifiable pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(v) unless and until the aggregate amount of all such Losses otherwise payable exceeds the amount listed on Section 3.12 of the Company Disclosure Statement, in which event the amount of Losses that are payable shall include the entire amount of such Losses (including the initial the amount listed on Section 3.12 of the Company Disclosure Statement of such Losses); provided, however, that if the aggregate amounts of such Losses are less than the amount listed on Section 3.12 of the Company Disclosure Statement, then such Losses shall be counted towards the Deductible; provided, further, that the aggregate indemnification for Losses pursuant to this Article VII shall not in any event exceed the aggregate value of Escrowed Indemnity Shares, as determined pursuant to Section 7.4(b); provided, further, that nothing in this Article VII shall preclude or in any way restrict any Parent Indemnitee from seeking additional remedies in respect of Losses resulting from fraud, willful misrepresentation or intentional breach. 

  

 (c) As used in this Article VII, the term " _Losses_ " shall include all losses, liabilities, damages, Taxes, judgments, awards, orders, penalties, settlements, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, interest, penalties, court costs and reasonable legal fees and expenses) including those arising from any demands, claims, suits, actions, costs of investigation, notices of violation or noncompliance, causes of action, proceedings and assessments whether or not made by third parties or whether or not ultimately determined to be valid. Solely for the purposes of determining the amount of any Losses for which Parent may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article VII, any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement that is qualified by a term or terms such as "material," "materially," or "Company Material Adverse Effect" shall be deemed made or given without such qualification and without giving effect to such words. 

  

 (d) The amount of any Losses subject to indemnification under Section 7.2 shall be reduced by the amounts actually recovered by the Parent Indemnitees under applicable insurance policies with respect to claims related to such Losses. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) Except as otherwise permitted by the proviso in the last sentence of Section 7.2(b) or in respect of Third Party Claims, the Escrowed Indemnity Shares shall not be available under Section 7.2 to any Parent Indemnitee for any consequential or incidental damages (other than consequential or incidental damages in the form of lost profits or diminution of value) or punitive Losses, except in each case to the extent awarded to a third party in connection with a Third Party Claim. 

  

 Section 7.3 _Procedures_. 

   

 (a) _General_. Promptly after the discovery by any Parent Indemnitee of any Loss or Losses, claim or breach, including any claim by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), that reasonably would be expected to give rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder, the Parent Indemnitee shall deliver to the Escrow Representative a certificate (a " _Claim Certificate_ ") that: 

   

 (i) states that the Parent Indemnitee has incurred or suffered Losses, or reasonably anticipates that it may or will incur liability for Losses, for which such Parent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement; and 

   

 (ii) specifies in reasonable detail, to the extent practicable, each individual item of Loss included in the amount so stated, the date (if any) such item was incurred or suffered, the basis for any anticipated liability and the nature of the misrepresentation, default, breach of warranty or breach of covenant or claim to which each such item is related and, to the extent computable, the computation of the amount to which such Parent Indemnitee claims to be entitled hereunder; 

 

provided, that no delay on the part of the Parent Indemnitee in notifying the
Escrow Representative shall diminish the rights of the Parent Indemnitees to
obtain recovery therefor except to the extent that the delay shall increase
the amount of such claim or Loss, and then only to such extent. 

   

 (b) _Disputes_. If the Escrow Representative objects to the indemnification of a Parent Indemnitee in respect of any claim or claims specified in any Claim Certificate, the Escrow Representative shall deliver a written notice (" _Notice of Objection_ ") to such effect to the Parent Indemnitee within 30 days after receipt by the Escrow Representative of such Claim Certificate. Thereafter, the Escrow Representative and the Parent Indemnitee shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties within 30 days of receipt by the Parent Indemnitee of such Notice of Objection with respect to each of such claims to which the Escrow Representative has objected. If the Parent Indemnitee and the Escrow Representative agree with respect to any of such claims, the Parent Indemnitee and the Escrow Representative shall promptly prepare and sign a memorandum setting forth such agreement and, if applicable, an instruction to the Escrow Agent. Should the Parent Indemnitee and the Escrow Representative fail to agree within such 30 day period as to any particular item or items or amount or amounts, then the Parent Indemnitee and the Escrow Representative shall jointly engage an independent arbitrator to resolve such dispute. The arbitration shall be held in 

   ##### 

  

 

accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules of JAMS (the "Rules") in New
York, New York. The parties shall have ten days from commencement of the
arbitration to agree on an arbitrator. If they fail to timely agree, the
arbitrator shall be appointed by JAMS in accordance with the Rules. The
Parent Indemnitee and the Escrow Representative shall each be entitled to
submit a presentation to the arbitrator. Such presentation shall take place
at a hearing to be held within thirty (30) days after the appointment of the
arbitrator or as soon thereafter as practicable. At a date and time proposed
by the arbitrator within five (5) days after the hearing each party shall
submit to the arbitrator and the other party a proposed award. The arbitrator
shall render his or her decision within ten business days of receipt of the
proposed award. The Surviving Entity will pay the fees and expenses of the
arbitrator and the expenses, if any, of making the presentations. The award
of the arbitrator will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties and may
be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction. 

   

 (c) _Third Party Claims_. The Parent Indemnitees shall have the right in their sole discretion to conduct the defense of any Third Party Claim and any expense incurred in connection with such defense shall be reimbursed out of the Escrowed Indemnity Shares only if it is determined that the Parent Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification for Losses; provided, however, that no indemnification of any Parent Indemnitee shall be available for any amount paid in settlement of any such Third Party Claim effected by the Parent Indemnitee without obtaining (i) an irrevocable and unconditional release of the Parent Indemnitees and the Company Stockholders and (ii) the prior written consent of the Escrow Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If any such action or claim is settled having obtained an irrevocable and unconditional release of the Parent Indemnitees and the Company Stockholders and the prior written consent of the Escrow Representative, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action, the Parent Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification for the amount of any Loss relating thereto, and any such indemnification for the amount of any Loss shall be reimbursed out of the Escrowed Indemnity Shares. 

  

 (d) _Company Defense; Settlement_. In the event the Parent Indemnitees elect not to defend the Third Party Claim, the Escrow Representative may cause the Surviving Entity to defend such claim at its expense subject to reimbursement out of the Indemnity Escrow Amount only if it is determined that the Parent Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification for Losses. In such event, neither the Surviving Entity nor the Escrow Representative shall have any right to settle, adjust or compromise such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Parent Indemnitee against whom the Third Party Claim has been asserted, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 

  

 (e) _Agreed Claims; Arbitrator Failure to Render Decision_. Claims for Losses specified in any Claim Certificate to which the Escrow Representative did not object in writing within 30 days of receipt of such Claim Certificate, claims for Losses covered by a memorandum of agreement of the nature described in Section 7.3(b) and claims for Losses the validity and amount of which have been the subject of resolution by arbitration or of a final non-appealable judicial determination are hereinafter referred to, collectively, as " _Agreed Claims_." The Parent Indemnitee shall be entitled to payment for any Agreed Claims, subject to the limitations set forth herein, within ten (10) Business Days of the determination of the amount of any such Agreed Claims and the number of Escrowed Indemnity Shares having a market value, 

   ##### 

  

 

determined in accordance with Section 7.4(b), equal at such time to the amount
of such Agreed Claim shall be released to Parent and retired. 

   

 Section 7.4 _Payments_. 

   

 (a) All amounts payable to Parent or any of the Parent Indemnitees with respect to Losses pursuant to this Article VII shall be settled solely and exclusively by release of Escrowed Indemnity Shares by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, until all such shares have been so released (or are subject to such release), or are otherwise released, from escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. 

  

 (b) The value of each Escrowed Indemnity Share for purposes of making payments to Parent or any of the Parent Indemnitees on account of Losses in accordance with the provisions of this Article VII shall be deemed to be the average of the Closing Price of Parent Common Stock for the ten (10) consecutive Business Days immediately prior to the date on which such share is released to a Parent Indemnitee. 

  

 (c) Except in the case of fraud, willful misrepresentation or intentional breach, the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties after the Closing for damages with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party agrees that the other party, its agents and representatives (each of whom shall be third party beneficiaries of this provision) shall have no liability to the first party except as set forth in this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents and except to the extent of such other partys, such agents or such representatives fraud, willful misrepresentation or intentional breach. 

  

 (d) The Company, Parent and the Company Stockholders agree to treat for all Tax purposes each indemnification payment pursuant to this Article VII as an adjustment to the consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement and shall take no position for all Tax purposes contrary thereto unless required to do so by applicable Tax Law pursuant to a determination as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code.

 (a) Stephen D. Cope is hereby designated by the Company and its stockholders to serve as the agent of such stockholders, as the initial Escrow Representative hereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Article VII, and by his signature below Mr. Cope hereby acknowledges such appointment and agrees to serve in such capacity on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and in the Escrow Agreement.

The Escrow Representative shall be the only party entitled to assert the rights 

   ##### 

  

 

of the Company Stockholders hereunder and the Escrow Representative shall
perform all of the obligations (other than payment) of the Company
Stockholders under this Article VII. Any Person shall be entitled to rely on
all statements, representations and decisions of the Escrow Representative. 

   

 (b) The Company Stockholders shall be bound by all actions taken by the Escrow Representative in its capacity as such. The Escrow Representative shall promptly, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days, provide written notice to the Company Stockholders of any action taken on behalf of them by the Escrow Representative pursuant to the authority delegated to the Escrow Representative under this Article VII. Neither the Escrow Representative nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees, if any, shall be liable to any person for any error of judgment, or any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken under this Agreement, except in the case of its gross negligence or willful misconduct.

 (b) by written notice by Parent to the Company or by the Company to Parent, if the Closing Date shall not have occurred on or before May 18, 2009 (the " _Termination Date_ "); 

  

 (c) by written notice by Parent to the Company or by the Company to Parent, if there shall be any Law that makes illegal, permanently restrains, enjoins, or otherwise prohibits consummation of the Transaction and such Law shall not be subject to appeal or shall have become final and unappealable, provided that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) shall have used such efforts as may be required by Section 5.3 to prevent, oppose and remove such Law; 

  

 (d) by written notice by Parent to the Company, if (i) there shall have been a breach of, inaccuracy in, or failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries set forth in this Agreement, or (ii) any representation or warranty of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries set forth in this Agreement shall have become untrue, in any such case such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b), as the case may be, would not be satisfied, provided that if such breach is curable by the Company prior to the Termination Date through the exercise of the Companys reasonable best efforts, then for so long as the Company continues to exercise reasonable best efforts to cure the same, Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) prior to the earlier of the Termination Date or that date which is 30 days following the Companys receipt of written notice from Parent of such breach, it being understood that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) if such breach by the Company is cured within such 30-day period so that the conditions would then be satisfied; 

  

 (e) by written notice by the Company to Parent, if there shall have been a breach of, inaccuracy in, or failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Parent set forth in this Agreement shall have become untrue, in any such case such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b), as the case may be, would not be satisfied, 

   ##### 

  

 

provided that if such breach is curable by Parent prior to the Termination
Date through the exercise of its reasonable best efforts, then for so long as
Parent continues to exercise such reasonable best efforts to cure the same,
the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e)
prior to the earlier of the Termination Date or that date which is 30
days following Parents receipt of written notice from Company of such
breach, it being understood that the Company may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) if such breach by Parent is cured within such
30-day period so that the conditions would then be satisfied; 

   

 (f) by written notice by the Company (if the Company is not then in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement) if the Board of Directors of Parent effects a Change in Recommendation;

 (h) by written notice by the Company to Parent or by written notice by Parent to the Company if the Parent Stockholder Approval is not obtained at the Parent Stockholders Meeting (as the same may be adjourned or postponed from time to time but not later than the Termination Date); or 

  

 (i) by written notice by Parent to the Company, if the Company shall have failed to deliver the December Financial Statements when required to be delivered in accordance with Sections 5.2(f) hereof. 

  

 Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 8.2, any termination of this Agreement under Section 8.1 will be effective immediately upon the delivery of written notice of the terminating party to the other parties hereto. In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall thereafter become void and have no further force or effect without any liability on the part of any party or its Affiliates or Representatives in respect thereof, except (i) as set forth in Sections 5.4 and 5.9, this Section 8.2, and Article IX, each of which shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and (ii) that nothing herein will relieve any party from liability for any fraud, willful misrepresentation or intentional breach of this Agreement.

GENERAL PROVISIONS

Any conveyance, assignment or transfer requiring the prior written consent of the Escrow Representative, the Company or Parent which is made without 

    ##### 

  

    

such consent will be void ab initio. No assignment will relieve the assigning
party of its obligations hereunder or thereunder. 

   

 Section 9.2 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement is binding upon and is for the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except for the rights of the Persons referred to in Sections 5.7, 7.2, 7.4 and 7.6 to enforce the provisions set forth therein, this Agreement is not made for the benefit of any Person not a party hereto, and no Person other than the parties hereto or their respective successors and permitted assigns will acquire or have any benefit, right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

 Section 9.4 _Waiver; Remedies_.

The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the parties may otherwise have at law or in equity.

 Section 9.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. 

   

 (a) Subject to Section 7.3(b), each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, only if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this Section 9.10, (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any claim that (A) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject mater hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. 

  

 (b) EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY OF THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS, THE TRANSACTION OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.

 Section 9.14 _Rules of Construction_. The following rules shall apply to the interpretation of this Agreement: 

   

 (a) The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
