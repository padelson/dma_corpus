from the Contract immediately after receipt by the Seller, without set-off or
reduction by reason of any actual or alleged breach of any representation,

right to indemnification hereunder. The Purchaser shall be responsible for and
shall pay, satisfy, discharge, assume, perform and fulfill in a timely manner

withheld.

determines that the information is material and commercially or competitively
sensitive or that providing the information could reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on that Party if the transactions contemplated

provide the information to external counsel for the other Party on an
"external counsel only" basis. Such information shall be provided only to the
external counsel of the other Party and shall not be disclosed by such
external counsel to directors, officers, employees or other agents of that
Party, unless express prior written permission is obtained from the source of
the materials.

hereby under any applicable Laws or if any suit, application, challenge,
injunction, action or Proceeding is commenced by a Governmental Entity in

commercially reasonable efforts to oppose or defend against any objections,
suit, application, challenge, action or Proceeding to prevent or enjoin
consummation of this Agreement (and the transactions contemplated herein).

equity in, or by any other manner, any business or any corporation,
partnership, association or other business organization or division thereof
that is engaged in the production of bleached chemi-thermomechanical pulp in
Canada if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to, or the
consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation would reasonably be
expected to materially (i) delay the obtaining of, or increase the risk of not
obtaining, any consents of any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the expiration or termination
of any applicable waiting period; (ii) increase the risk of any Governmental
Entity seeking or entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) increase the risk of not

|

Risk of Loss. 

The Purchased Assets shall be at the risk of the Seller until Closing. If

Seller will promptly give the Purchaser notice thereof and if the portion of
the Purchased Assets which sustained a loss, were damaged, destroyed or taken
by condemnation or expropriated:

|

can be replaced or repaired within thirty (30) days or less by Seller, the

|

cannot be replaced or repaired within thirty (30) days or less by Seller, the
Purchaser shall have the option, exercisable by notice to the Seller: 

| 
---|---

|

to proceed with the Closing, and the Purchase Price will be reduced by the
amount corresponding to the cost of repair of the portion of the Purchased
Assets which were damaged or destroyed or, if lost, damaged beyond repair or
taken by condemnation or expropriation, by the replacement cost of the
particular Purchased Assets so lost, damaged or taken, such reduction in price
to be net of all proceeds of insurance actually received by the Seller and
paid to the Purchaser; or 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

to terminate this Agreement, as provided in Section 8.1. 

| 
---|--- 

Section 5.14

|

Purchased Assets or of the Business, no matter how structured, including
without limitation by sale of all or any significant or controlling part of
the shares or other equity interests of the Seller, by sale or license of all
or any significant part of the Purchased Assets, or by any merger or other
business combination involving the Seller or otherwise. The Seller shall be
responsible for any breach by its representatives or its direct shareholders
of any provisions of this Section 5.14.

| 
---|--- 

Section 5.15

|

Transfer Taxes. 

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

The Purchaser will be liable for and will pay, or cause to be paid, all
Transfer Taxes payable under any applicable Law on or with respect to the
purchase by the Purchaser of the Purchased Assets under this Agreement on or
before the due date for any such payments, and the Purchaser will provide
notice and evidence of any such payments to the Seller promptly after any such
payments. The Purchaser will prepare and file any affidavits or returns
required in connection with the foregoing at its own cost and expense. To the
extent that any Transfer Taxes or any interest or penalties are required to be
paid by and are imposed upon the Seller under any applicable Law on or with
respect to the purchase by the Purchaser of the Purchased Assets, the
Purchaser will reimburse, or cause to be reimbursed, to the Seller such
Transfer Taxes and any applicable interest and penalties within ten (10)
Business Days of payment of such Transfer Taxes and of any applicable interest
and penalties by the Seller. All amounts payable by the Purchaser to the
Seller hereunder do not include Transfer Taxes unless specifically mentioned
hereunder. For greater certainty, the Purchaser shall self-assess and remit to
the applicable Governmental Entity the applicable GST and QST payable in
connection with the transfer of the Purchased Assets which are real or
immovable property, and shall deliver to the Seller a certificate and
indemnity in standard form agreeable to both the Seller and the Purchaser (the
"GST/QST Certificate and Indemnity"). Subject to Section 5.15(2), the
Purchaser shall pay all applicable GST and QST to the Seller in respect of the
Purchased Assets other than the real or immovable property, provided that the
Seller provides to the Purchaser an invoice containing all prescribed
information required by the Purchaser to support its claims for input tax
credits and input tax refunds. The Parties agree that the Purchaser shall only
be obligated to pay any applicable GST and QST to the Seller seven (7)
Business Days before the Seller is required to remit such GST and QST, and the
Seller shall remit such GST and QST to the relevant Governmental Entities as
and when required by applicable Laws. The Purchaser is acquiring each of the
Owned Real Property and Leased Real Property as principal for its own account
and is not being purchased by the purchaser as an agent, trustee, or otherwise
on behalf of or for another person. The Purchaser shall remit the GST and QST
to the appropriate Governmental Entity with respect to the Owned Real Property
and Leased Real Property in the time and the manner prescribed by Part IX of
the Excise Tax Act (Canada) and An Act respecting the Quebec Sales Tax. For
greater certainty, the Purchaser shall indemnify and save harmless the Seller
from any GST, QST penalty, interest or other amounts which may be payable by
or be assessed against the Seller under Part IX of the Excise Tax Act (Canada)
and An Act respecting the Quebec Sales Tax as a result of, or in connection
with, the Seller's failure to collect and remit any GST or QST applicable on
the sale and conveyance of the Owned Real Property or the Leased Real Property
or for the failure of the Purchaser to remit the GST and QST in the time and
the manner prescribed by Part IX of the Excise Tax Act (Canada) and An Act
respecting the Quebec Sales Tax. 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller and the Purchaser shall cooperate to
use Revenu Quebec\'s GST/QST "Fast Track" program, and shall file, jointly and
separately, all tax returns, forms and documents as required by Revenu Quebec,
for purposes of obtaining the expedited GST and QST refunds for the Purchaser

Indemnified Party to substantiate the Claim, together with all such other
information, books and records and access to employees as the Indemnifying
Party may reasonably request.

|

If the Indemnifying Party disputes the validity or amount of the Direct Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall provide written notice of the dispute to the

it, subject only to this Agreement. If the Indemnifying Party fails to respond
in writing to the Direct Claim within the sixty (60)‑day period specified in
Section 9.6(1), the Indemnifying Party is deemed to have rejected the Direct
Claim in which event the Indemnified Party is free to pursue all rights and
remedies available to it, subject to this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

Section 9.7

|

Procedure for Third Party Claims. 

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

In the event a Notice of Claim is delivered with respect to a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its expense, to
participate in but not control the negotiation, settlement or defence of the
Third Party Claim, which control shall rest at all times with the Indemnified
Party, unless the Indemnifying Party: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

acknowledges in writing that the Third Party Claim is within the scope of its
obligations to indemnify the Indemnified Party in accordance with and subject
to the terms of this Section 9.7; and 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

furnishes evidence to the Indemnified Party whenever requested by the
Indemnified Party, which is satisfactory to the Indemnified Party of the
Indemnifying Party's financial ability to indemnify the Indemnified Party; 

in which case the Indemnifying Party may assume such control at its expense
through counsel of its choice; provided, however, that notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be permitted to assume control of
the negotiation, settlement or defence of the Third Party Claim if: (i) such
Third Party Claim seeks equitable relief or provisional or control measures
against the Indemnified Party as a primary form of relief; (ii) there is a
reasonable probability that such Third Party Claim would result in monetary
damages or payments in excess of 100% of the amount for which the Indemnifying
Party is obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article
9; (iii) such Third Party Claim involves criminal liability; (iv) such Third
Party Claim involves a Governmental Entity; or (v) such Third Party Claim is
by a current material customer or supplier of the Business.

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

Subject to Section 9.7(1), in order to assume the investigation and defence of
a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party must give the Indemnified Party
written notice of its election within thirty (30) days of Indemnifying Party's
receipt of notice of the Third Party Claim. 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

If the Indemnifying Party assumes the investigation and defence of a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will pay for all costs and expenses of the
investigation and defence of the Third Party Claim except that the
Indemnifying Party will not, so long as it diligently conducts such defence,
be liable to the Indemnified Party for any fees of other counsel or any other
expenses with respect to the defence of the Third Party Claim incurred by the
Indemnified Party after the date the Indemnifying Party validly exercised its
right to assume the investigation and defence of the Third Party Claim. 

| 
---|--- 

(4)

|

If the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to assume the investigation and
defence of a Third Party Claim as aforesaid, does not elect to assume the
investigation and defence of a Third Party Claim, or assumes the investigation
and defence of a Third Party Claim but fails to diligently pursue such
investigation and defence, the Indemnified Party has the right (but not the
obligation) to undertake the investigation and defence of the Third Party
Claim. In the case where the Indemnifying Party fails to diligently pursue the
investigation and defence of the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may
not assume the investigation and defence of the Third Party Claim unless the
Indemnified Party gives the Indemnifying Party written demand to diligently
pursue the investigation and defence and the Indemnifying Party fails to do so
within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of the demand, or such shorter
period as may be required to respond to any deadline imposed by a court. 

| 
---|--- 

(5)

|

If the Indemnified Party undertakes the investigation and defence of a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be bound by the results obtained by
the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim. 

| 
---|--- 

(6)

|

The Indemnifying Party will not be permitted to compromise and settle or
remedy or to cause a compromise and settlement or remedy of a Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which
consent may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, unless: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

the terms of the compromise and settlement or remedy require only the payment
of money for which the Indemnified Party is entitled to full indemnification
under this Agreement; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

the terms of the compromise and settlement do not require the Indemnified
Party to admit any wrongdoing, take or refrain from taking any action,
acknowledge any rights of the Person making the Third Party Claim or waive any
rights that the Indemnified Party may have against the Person making the Third
Party Claim; and 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

the Indemnified Party receives, as part of the compromise and settlement or
remedy, a legally binding and enforceable unconditional release, which is in
form and substance satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, acting reasonably,
from any and all obligations or liabilities it may have with respect to the
Third Party Claim. 

| 
---|--- 

(7)

|

The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party agree to keep each other
fully informed of the status of any Third Party Claim and any related
proceedings. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the investigation and defence
of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will act in such manner as not
to interfere with the investigation and defence of the Third Party Claim and
will, at the request and expense of the Indemnifying Party, make available to
the Indemnifying Party, on a timely basis, those employees whose assistance,
testimony or presence is necessary to assist the Indemnifying Party in
investigating and defending the Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party
shall, at the request and expense of the Indemnifying Party, make available to
the Indemnifying Party, or its representatives, on a timely basis all
documents, records and other materials in the possession, control or power of
the Indemnified Party, reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party for its
use solely in defending any Third Party Claim which it has elected to assume
the investigation and defence of. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate on a
timely basis with the Indemnifying Party in the defence of any Third Party
Claim. 

| 
---|--- 

Section 9.8

|

Manner of Payment. 

Subject to, and in accordance with, the provisions of this Article 9, any
indemnification payment to an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article 9
shall be delivered by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Indemnified Party within ten (10) days after the final, non-appealable
determination thereof.

| 
---|--- 

Section 9.9

|

Exclusion of Other Remedies. 

Except as provided in this Section 9.9 and in Section 2.9, the indemnities
provided in Section 9.2 and Section 9.3 constitute the only remedy of the
Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Seller, on the other hand, against a Party
in the event of any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of such Party contained in this Agreement. The Parties may exercise
their right to payment of an adjustment in Section 2.9 and their rights of
termination in Section 8.1. The Parties acknowledge that the failure to comply
with a covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement may give rise to
irreparable injury to a Party inadequately compensable in Damages.
Accordingly, a Party may seek to enforce the performance of this Agreement by
injunction or specific performance upon application to a court of competent
jurisdiction without proof of actual damage (and without the requirement of
posting a bond or other security). The Purchaser and the Seller expressly
waive and renounce any other remedies whatsoever, whether at law or in equity,
which it would otherwise be entitled to as against any other Party. The
provisions in this Agreement relating to indemnification, and the limits
imposed on the Purchaser Indemnitees' and the Seller Indemnitees' remedies
with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby were
specifically bargained for between sophisticated parties and were specifically
taken into account in the determination of the amounts to be paid to the
Seller hereunder. No Purchaser Indemnitees may avoid the limitations on
liability set forth in this Article 9 by seeking damages for breach of
contract, tort or pursuant to any other theory of liability.

| 
---|--- 

Section 9.10

|

Calculation of Damages. 

For greater certainty, for the purpose only of calculating the amount of
Damages under this Article 9, the representations and warranties of the
Parties contained in this Agreement or in any other agreement, certificate or
instrument executed and delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed
to have been made without qualifications as to materiality where the words or
phrases "material", "immaterial", "in all material respects" or words or
phrases of similar import are used, such that the amount of Damages payable to
an Indemnified Party is not subject to any deduction in respect of amounts
below the level of materiality stated in the relevant representation and
warranty.

| 
---|--- 

Section 9.11

|

Joint and Several (Solidary) Obligations. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Rayonier GP, RCC
and RCE, hereby agree to be solidarily liable (within the meaning of the Civil
Code of Quebec) for all of the obligations hereunder of the Seller to the
extent provided in this Agreement, including any indemnification obligations
of the Seller pursuant to this Article 9, such that if any claim for Damages
is made against the Seller hereunder, the Purchaser shall be entitled to seek
indemnification from any of Rayonier GP, RCC and RCE for the full amount of
such Damages payable by the Seller. Each of Rayonier GP, RCC and RCE hereby
waive the benefit of division and discussion.

| 
---|---

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Seller
Guarantor hereby agrees to be solidarily liable (within the meaning of the
Civil Code of Quebec) with the Seller for all of the obligations hereunder of
the Seller to the extent provided in this Agreement, including any
indemnification obligations of the Seller pursuant to this Article 9, such
that if any claim for Damages is made against the Seller hereunder, the
Purchaser shall be entitled to seek indemnification from the Seller Guarantor
for the full amount of such Damages payable by the Seller. The Seller and the
Seller Guarantor hereby waive the benefit of division and discussion.

| 
---|--- 

Section 9.13

|

Purchaser Guarantee. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Purchaser
Guarantor hereby agrees to be solidarily liable (within the meaning of the
Civil Code of Quebec) with the Purchaser for all of the obligations hereunder
of the Purchaser to the extent provided in this Agreement, including any
indemnification obligations of the Purchaser pursuant to this Article 9, such
that if any claim for Damages is made against the Purchaser hereunder, the
Seller shall be entitled to seek indemnification from the Purchaser Guarantor
for the full amount of such Damages payable by the Purchaser. The Purchaser
and the Purchaser Guarantor hereby waive the benefit of division and
discussion.

| 
---|--- 

Section 9.14

|

Duty to Mitigate. 

Nothing in this Agreement in any way restricts or limits the general
obligation pursuant to applicable Laws of an Indemnified Party to mitigate any
loss which it may suffer or incur by reason of the breach by an Indemnifying
Party of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of the
Indemnifying Party under this Agreement. If any Claim can be reduced by any
recovery any, settlement or otherwise under or pursuant to any insurance
coverage (including, for greater certainty, the title insurance policy
purchased by the Seller in accordance with Section 6.2(d)(vii)), the
Indemnified Party shall, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, take all
appropriate and commercially reasonable steps to enforce such recovery or
settlement and the amount of any Damages of the Indemnified Party shall be
reduced by the amount of insurance proceeds actually received by the
Indemnified Party (net of any deductible or other costs or expenses of
recovery including Taxes and any actual increase in insurance premiums as a
result of such Claim). Any Claim shall also be reduced by any net Tax benefit
actually realized by the Indemnified Party on account of such Damages in the
taxable period in which such Damages were incurred or in the immediately
following taxable period. An Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to delay
or reduce the payment of all or any portion of a Claim to an Indemnified Party
on the basis of the expected mitigation of such Claim by the Indemnified
Party.

| 
---|--- 

Section 9.15

|

One Recovery. 

Any Indemnified Party is not entitled to double recovery for any Claim even
though they may have resulted from the breach of more than one of the
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of the Indemnifying
Party in this Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

Section 9.16

|

Adjustments to Purchase Price. 

Any payment made to the Purchaser Indemnitees under this Article 9 is a
dollar-for-dollar decrease in the Purchase Price and any payment made to the
Seller Indemnitees under this Article 9 is a dollar-for-dollar increase in the
Purchase Price, in each case unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

| 
---|--- 

Section 9.17

|

Set-off. 

Any Indemnified Party shall be entitled to set off the amount of any Claim
following Final Determination of such Claim against any other amounts payable
by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party under this Agreement.

To the extent that the Seller makes any payments to the Purchaser on account

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

Subject to Section 10.1(3) and Section 10.2(4), the Seller shall retain

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

participate in and accrue benefits under any Pension Plans and other Benefit
Plans that were in place prior to the Closing Date. Any Pension Plans and
other Benefit Plans in which such non-unionized Employees participated shall

EXHIBIT D (collectively, the "Assumed Plans"). Upon obtaining the required
consent, waiver and approvals of such transfer or assignment and assumption,
the Purchaser shall become the successor sponsor or policyholder, as
applicable, of the Assumed Plans. In order to effect such assignment and
assumption, the Seller and the Purchaser shall take such steps, prepare and
execute such documents and seek such approvals of the appropriate regulatory
authorities as may be necessary or desirable. The Purchaser shall enter into
new agreements as necessary to allow the efficient transfer or assignment and
assumption of the Assumed Plans. Upon the completion of the transfer or
assignment of the Assumed Plans to the Purchaser, and except as otherwise
provided herein, the Seller shall be completely discharged of all of its
obligations and liabilities, if any, with respect to the pension benefits
accrued by the Employees and the former employees under the Assumed Plans in
accordance with the terms of such Assumed Plans, the Collective Bargaining
Agreements and applicable Laws. Each of the Seller and Purchaser shall be

regard to the administration of the Retirement Plan for Unionized Employees,
pending its intended transfer, if it does not occur as of the Closing Date,
including, among others, with respect to the replacement of any member of the
pension committee for such plan. For the avoidance of doubt, and subject to
any necessary Pension Plan committee consents, the Seller shall also

(5)

|

As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the

Agreements, shall, on or before the Closing Date, be segregated in favour of
the Retirement Plan for Unionized Employees and shall be transferred to the
pension fund of the Retirement Plan for Unionized Employees.

Closing Date, the Seller shall ensure that no notice of redemption is issued
by any Person in respect of the Master Trust Agreements, other than consistent
with past practice, and that the assets of the Master Trust Agreements are
invested consistent with past practice.

relevant investment or investment structure up to the date of the transfer of
the relevant assets.

The Seller shall provide, prior to Closing, all true, complete and correct
data, records and correspondence in its possession that is necessary or useful
to administer the Assumed Plans, in a form which is sufficient for the proper
administration of any such Assumed Plan in accordance with their terms and all
applicable Laws. Prior to Closing, the Purchaser shall have the right to
reasonably request, and shall be provided with, all data, records or other
information deemed to be necessary or useful to allow the Purchaser to offer
benefit coverage to the non-unionized Employees as provided under this
Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

(9)

|

For greater certainty, it is acknowledged that the Seller shall retain all
liabilities and obligations with respect to all post-retirement and post-

retired or no longer employed by the Seller as of the Closing Date, any
Excluded Employee and any employee or former employee not related to the
Business or the Purchased Assets. The Buyer shall assume all liabilities and
obligations with respect to all post-retirement and post-employment benefits

original Retained Books and Records. So long as any such Assigned Books and
Records and such Retained Books and Records are retained by the Purchaser or
the Seller, as applicable, pursuant to this Agreement, the Seller or the
Purchaser, as applicable, shall have the reasonable right to inspect and to
make copies (at its own expense) of them at any time upon reasonable request
during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice for any proper purpose
and without undue interference to the business operations of the Purchaser,
the Seller or their respective Affiliates, as applicable. The Seller shall
have the right to redact from the Retained Books and Records requested by the
Purchaser any information that is not related to the Business or the Purchased
Assets. The Purchaser or the Seller, as applicable, shall have the right to
have its representatives present during any such inspection. Each of the
Purchaser and the Seller agrees to provide timely access to the Assigned Books
and Records or Retained Books and Records, as applicable, and any other
resources and personnel of the Purchaser or the Seller, to the Seller or the
Purchaser, as applicable, upon the reasonable request of the Seller or the

cause of action in favour of any Person, other than the Parties. Except for
the Indemnified Party, no Person, other than the Parties, shall be entitled to
rely on the provisions of this Agreement in any action, suit, proceeding,
hearing or other forum.

---|--- 

Section 11.5

|

Expenses. 

The Purchaser will pay for its own costs and expenses and the Seller will pay
for its own costs and expenses which are, in each case, incurred in connection
with the negotiation, preparation, execution and performance of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by them including the fees and expenses of
legal counsel, investment advisors and accountants.

This Agreement may only be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified by
written agreement signed by the Parties.

| 
---|--- 

Section 11.7

|

Waiver. 

No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement will constitute a waiver
of any other provision (whether or not similar). No waiver will be binding
unless executed in writing by the Party to be bound by the waiver. A Party's
failure or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement will not operate
as a waiver of that right. A single or partial exercise of any right will not
preclude a Party from any other or further exercise of that right or the
exercise of any other right.

| 
---|--- 

Section 11.8

|

Non‑Merger. 

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the covenants,

---|--- 

Section 11.9

|

Entire Agreement. 

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and supersedes all
prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral
or written, of the Parties. There are no representations, warranties,
covenants, conditions or other agreements, express or implied, collateral,
statutory or otherwise, between the Parties in connection with the subject
matter of this Agreement, except as specifically set forth in this Agreement.
The Parties have not relied and are not relying on any other information,
discussion or understanding in entering into and completing the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 11.10

|

Successors and Assigns. 

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

This Agreement becomes effective only when executed by all of the Parties.
After that time, it will be binding upon and enure to the benefit of each of
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations under this
Agreement are assignable or transferable by any Party without the prior
written consent of the other Parties, provided that the Purchaser may assign
all or any part of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any of
its Affiliates without consent, except that such assignment shall not relieve
the Purchaser of its obligations hereunder. 

| 
---|--- 

Section 11.11

|

Severability. 

If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable by an arbitrator or any court of competent jurisdiction, that
provision will be severed from this Agreement and the remaining provisions
shall remain in full force and effect.

| 
---|--- 

Section 11.12

|

Governing Law. 

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

This Agreement will be governed by and interpreted and enforced in accordance
with the laws of the Province of Quebec and the federal laws of Canada
applicable therein. 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

Each Party irrevocably attorns and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Quebec courts situated in the City of Montreal and waives objection to the
venue of any Legal Proceeding in such court or that such court provides an
inconvenient forum. 

| 
---|--- 

Section 11.13

|

Counterparts. 

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts (including
counterparts by facsimile or PDF) and all such counterparts taken together
shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.

| 
---|--- 

Section 11.14

|

Legal Representation. 

In any proceeding by or against the Purchaser wherein the Purchaser asserts or
prosecutes any claim under, or otherwise seeks to enforce, this Agreement, the
Purchaser agrees in connection with such proceeding (a) that neither the
Purchaser nor counsel therefor will move to seek disqualification of Seller
Counsel, (b) to waive any right the Purchaser may have to assert the attorney-
client privilege against Seller Counsel or the Seller or any of their
Affiliates with respect to any communication or information contained in
Seller Counsel's possession or files and (c) to consent to the representation
of the Seller and its Affiliates by Seller Counsel, notwithstanding that
Seller Counsel has or may have represented the Seller or any of its Affiliates
as counsel in connection with any matter, including any transaction (including
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), negotiation, investigation,
proceeding or action, prior to the Closing. This consent and waiver extends to
Seller Counsel representing the Seller against the Purchaser or its
Subsidiaries in litigation, arbitration or mediation in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, all
communications between the Seller, on the one hand, and Seller Counsel, on the
other hand, related to this or any other proposed sale of the Purchased
Assets, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed
to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to the Seller and its
Affiliates (the "Seller Pre-Closing Communications"). Accordingly, the
Purchaser shall not have access to any such Seller Pre-Closing Communications
or to the files of Seller Counsel relating to such engagement from and after
the Closing, and all books, records and other materials in any medium
(including electronic copies) containing or reflecting any of the Seller Pre-
Closing Communications or the work product of legal counsel with respect
thereto, including any related summaries, drafts or analyses, and all rights
with respect to any of the foregoing, are hereby retained by, assigned and
transferred to the Seller effective as of the Closing. Such material and
information shall be excluded from the transfer contemplated by this Agreement
and shall be delivered to the Seller immediately prior to the Closing with no
copies thereof retained by the Purchaser or any of the Purchaser's Affiliates
or representatives. From and after the Closing, the Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall maintain the confidentiality of all such material and
information. From and after the Closing, none of the Purchaser, its Affiliates
and representatives shall access or in any way, directly or indirectly, use or
rely upon any such materials or information. To the extent that any such
materials or information are not delivered to the Seller prior to the Closing,
they will be held for the benefit of the Seller, and the Purchaser and its
Affiliates will deliver all such material and information to the Seller
promptly upon discovery thereof, without using or retaining copies thereof.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the Closing,
(a) the Seller and its Affiliates shall be the sole holders of the attorney-
client privilege with respect to such engagement and the Seller Pre-Closing
Communications, and none of the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be a holder
thereof, and (b) to the extent that files of Seller Counsel in respect of such
engagement and with respect to the Seller Pre-Closing Communications
constitute property of the client, only the Seller and its Affiliates shall
hold such property rights. As to Seller Pre-Closing Communications, the
Purchaser and the Seller, together with any of their respective Affiliates,
successors or assigns, agree that no such party may use or rely on any of the
Seller Pre-Closing Communications in any action or claim against or involving
any of the Parties after the Closing. The Purchaser hereby acknowledges and
confirms that it has had the opportunity to review and obtain adequate
information regarding the significance and risks of the waivers and other
terms and conditions of this Section 11.14, including the opportunity to
discuss with counsel such matters and reasonable alternatives to such terms.
This Section 11.14 is for the benefit of the Seller and Seller Counsel and
Seller Counsel is the intended third party beneficiary of this Section 11.14.
This Section 11.14 shall be irrevocable, and no term of this Section 11.14 may
be amended, waived or modified, without the prior written consent of the
Seller and Seller Counsel. The covenants and obligations set forth in this
Section 11.14 shall survive for ten (10) years following the Closing Date.
