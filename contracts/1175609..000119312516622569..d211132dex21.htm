(ii) if, on the initial Expiration Date or any subsequent date as of which the
Offer is scheduled to expire, any Tender Offer Condition is not satisfied and
has not been waived, then Sub shall extend (and re-extend) the Offer and its
expiration date beyond the initial Expiration Date or such subsequent date for
one or more successive extension periods of up to ten (10) Business Days each
(each such extension period, an " _Additional Offer Period_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer pursuant to
this clause (ii) on more than two (2) occasions if all Tender Offer
Conditions other than the Minimum Condition are satisfied on the date on which
the Offer is scheduled to expire, but the Minimum Condition is not satisfied,
but may, in its sole and absolute discretion, elect to do so;

 

(iii) if, on the scheduled Expiration Date, each Tender Offer Condition has
been satisfied, or waived by Parent or Sub if permitted hereunder, and the
Marketing Period has not then ended, then Sub shall have the right in its sole
discretion to extend the Offer to the Business Day immediately following the
end of the Marketing Period or to such later date as may be required by the
applicable rules, regulations, interpretations or positions of the SEC or its
staff; and

(iv) if, immediately prior to the scheduled Expiration Date, each Tender
Offer Condition has been satisfied, or waived by Parent or Sub if permitted
hereunder, and the proceeds of the Debt Financing (or Alternative Debt
Financing) are not available to Parent and Sub, in an amount sufficient (in
combination with all funds held by or otherwise available to Parent and Sub,
including the cash on hand of the Company) to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, then Sub shall have the right to, and, if
requested by the Company, Sub shall, extend the Offer for no more than two (2)
periods of up to ten (10) Business Days each (the length of such period to be
determined by Parent, but in any event no later than five (5) Business
Days prior to the Termination Date);

_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (i)  (iv)
of this _Section 2.1(d),_ in no event shall Sub be required to extend the
Offer beyond the Termination Date (as the Termination Date may be extended
pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ ); _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event
shall Sub be permitted to extend the Offer beyond the Termination Date (as
the Termination Date may be extended pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ ) without
the prior consent of the Company; _provided_ _further_ , that the foregoing 

 



19  clauses (i)  (iv) of this _Section 2.1(d)_ shall not be deemed to impair,
limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of Parent or the Company
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_.

(e) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
_Section 9.1_ , Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Sub to) promptly (and in
any event within twenty four (24) hours of such termination), irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer.

 

(f) The Merger Consideration shall, subject to applicable withholding of
Taxes, be net to the applicable seller, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Offer. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Sub or Parent on Subs behalf shall accept for payment and pay for
all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn promptly
following the expiration of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that without
the prior written consent of the Company, Sub shall not accept for payment or
pay for any shares of Company Common Stock if, as a result, Sub would acquire
less than the number of shares of Company Common Stock necessary to satisfy
the Minimum Condition. The time at which Sub first accepts for payment the
shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer is referred to as the "
_Acceptance Time_." If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the surrendered certificate
formerly evidencing shares of Company Common Stock is registered on the stock
transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the
certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall
have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered
holder of the certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the
satisfaction of Sub that such Taxes either have been paid or are
not applicable. The Company shall register (and shall instruct its transfer
agent to register) in the name of Sub the shares of Company Common Stock
accepted for payment by Sub immediately after the Acceptance Time.

 

(g) As soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event within twenty (20)
Business Days, after the date of this Agreement, Parent shall prepare and
file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S4 to register the offer
and sale of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and the Merger (the "
_Registration Statement_ "). The Registration Statement will include a
preliminary prospectus containing the information required under Rule 14d4(b)
under the Exchange Act (the " _Preliminary Prospectus_ "). On the Offer
Commencement Date, Parent and Sub shall: (i) cause to be filed with the SEC a
Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which will
contain or incorporate by reference the Preliminary Prospectus and forms of
the related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement and other
customary ancillary documents with respect to the Offer (such Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO and all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto
being referred to collectively in this Agreement as the " _Offer Documents_
"); and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of
shares of Company Common Stock to the extent required by applicable Law.
Parent and Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration
Statement and the Offer Documents to comply in all material respects with
applicable Law. The Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Registration Statement and the Offer

 



20  Documents (including all amendments and supplements thereto) prior to the
filing thereof with the SEC. Parent and Sub shall promptly provide the Company
and its counsel with a copy or a description of any comments received by
Parent, Sub or their counsel from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Registration Statement or the Offer Documents. Each of Parent and Sub shall
use reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Registration Statement, the Offer Documents or
the Offer. To the extent required by applicable Law, each of Parent, Sub and
the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to (1) correct promptly any
information provided by it for use in the Registration Statement or the Offer
Documents to the extent that it becomes aware that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect, and (2) take all steps
necessary to promptly cause the Registration Statement and the Offer
Documents, as supplemented or amended to correct such information, to be filed
with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common
Stock. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Sub all information
concerning the Company and the Companys stockholders that may be required or
reasonably requested in connection with any action contemplated by this
_Section 2.1(g)_. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to have the
Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly
as possible after its filing and to maintain its effectiveness for so long as
shall be required for the issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer and the Merger. Following the time the Registration Statement is
declared effective, Parent shall file the final prospectus included therein
under Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act.

 

(h) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Acceptance Time, any change
in the number of issued or outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or
Parent Common Stock shall occur as a result of a reclassification,
recapitalization, share split (including a reverse share split), or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any share dividend or
share distribution (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock) with a record
date during such period, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted
to reflect such change to provide Parent and the holders of Company Common
Stock (including Company Stock Options exercisable for Company Common Stock)
the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event. Nothing in this Section 2.1(h) shall be construed to permit the
Company, Parent or Sub to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or
restricted by any other provision of this Agreement.

 

(i) No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued in connection
with the Offer, but in lieu thereof each holder of Company Common Stock that
would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
(after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise
would be received by such holder) shall in lieu of such fractional share,
be paid an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without
interest, equal to the product of: such fraction, multiplied by the Parent
Measurement Price.

 

(j) Unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_ , Sub shall
not terminate or withdraw the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration Date
without the prior written consent of the Company in its sole and absolute
discretion. In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
9.1_ , Sub shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) following
such termination irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and
shall

 



21  not acquire any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant thereto. If the
Offer is terminated in accordance with this Agreement prior to the Acceptance
Time, Sub shall promptly return, or cause any depositary acting on behalf of
Sub to return, all tendered shares of Company Common Stock to the tendering
stockholders.

 

Section 2.2 _Company Action_.

 

(a) The Company hereby consents to and approves the Offer pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement. The Company hereby further consents to the inclusion
in the Offer Documents of such approval and Board Recommendation, unless the
Company shall have withdrawn or modified such Board Recommendation as provided
in _Section 7.3(e)_ or _Section 7.3(f)_. The Company shall not withdraw or
modify such Board Recommendation in any manner adverse to Sub or Parent except
as provided in _Section 7.3(e)_ or _Section 7.3(f)_.

 

(b) Promptly following the filing of the Schedule TO by Sub, the Company shall
file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule_ _ _
_14D-9_ ") containing, except as provided in _Section 7.3(e)_ or _Section
7.3(f)_ , the Board Recommendation. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed with the SEC on the same day
as the Schedule TO shall be filed with the SEC. The Company shall promptly
mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
together with the Offer Documents and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated in all material respects as
required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company shall also
include a notice, in compliance with Section 251(h) and Section 262 of the
DGCL and reasonably satisfactory to Parent, of appraisal rights in connection
with the Merger under the DGCL. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of federal securities laws. The Company, Parent
and Sub agree to correct promptly any information provided by any of them for
use in the Schedule 14D-9 that shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect, and the Company further agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC
and disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case
in all material respects as required by applicable federal securities laws.
Parent or Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company all information concerning
Parent and Sub that is required or reasonably requested by the Company in
connection with its obligations relating to the Schedule 14D-9. Unless the
Companys board of directors has effected a Change of Recommendation, the
Company shall give Parent, Sub and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC. In
addition, unless the Companys board of directors has effected a Change of
Recommendation, the Company agrees to (i) provide Parent, Sub and their
counsel in writing with any written comments the Company or its counsel may
receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments, (ii) use
reasonable best efforts to provide Parent, Sub and their counsel a reasonably
detailed description of any oral comments the Company or its counsel may
receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments, and (iii) provide
Parent, Sub and their counsel reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
any written or oral response to such comments or any proposed amendment to the
Schedule 14D-9 prior to the filing thereof with the SEC.

 



22 (c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish or cause
to be furnished (including by instructing its transfer agent to promptly
furnish) to Sub mailing labels containing the names and addresses of all
record holders of shares of Company Common Stock and with security position
listings of shares of Company Common Stock held in stock depositories, each
as of a recent date, together with all other available listings and computer
files containing names, addresses and security position listings of record
holders and non-objecting beneficial owners of shares of Company Common
Stock. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly furnish
or cause to be furnished to Sub such additional information, including
updated listings and computer files of stockholders, mailing labels and
security position listings, and such other assistance in disseminating the
Offer Documents to holders of shares of Company Common Stock as Parent or Sub
may reasonably request. Subject to the requirements of Law, including
applicable stock exchange rules, and except for such steps as are necessary to
disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the Offer or the Merger, Parent and Sub shall hold in confidence
the information contained in such labels, listings and files and shall use
such information only in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
If the Offer is terminated or if this Agreement shall be terminated, Sub and
Parent will promptly deliver and cause their Representatives to deliver to the
Company (and delete electronic copies of) all copies, summaries and extracts
of such information then in their possession or control.

ARTICLE IV

CONVERSION OF SHARES

Section 4.1 _Conversion of Shares_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each share of the Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Company
Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 4.1(b)_ and Dissenting
Shares) shall be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, the
holders of Book Entry Shares and the holders of certificates that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding Company
Common Stock (the

 



24  " _Certificates_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto
other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such Book Entry Shares or
Certificates in accordance with Section 4.2, the Merger Consideration,
without any interest thereon, for each such share of the Company Common Stock,
or with respect to Dissenting Shares, the rights set forth in Section 262 of
the DGCL.

 

(b) All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as
treasury shares and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Sub
or any other direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent shall, at the Effective
Time, be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, each share of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

(d) No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue of
the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of Company Common Stock that
would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
(after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise
would be received by such holder) shall, upon surrender of such holders
Certificate(s) or Book Entry Share(s) or in the case of a lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit in the manner provided in
_Section 4.2(g)_ , receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to
the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product of (i) such
fraction, multiplied by (ii) the Parent Measurement Price.

 

Section 4.2 _Surrender and Payment_.

 

(a) At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall appoint a United States bank or
trust company or other independent financial institution in the United States
(the " _Paying and Exchange Agent_ ") that is reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act, among other things, as paying agent and exchange agent for the
Merger and to deliver the Merger Consideration to former stockholders of the
Company. The Company and Parent shall enter into a Paying and Exchange Agent
agreement with the Paying and Exchange Agent, which agreement shall set forth
the duties, responsibilities and obligations of the Paying and Exchange Agent
consistent with the terms of this Agreement. Promptly after the Effective Time
on the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the
Paying and Exchange Agent, for the account and benefit of the former holders
of Company Common Stock, the aggregate Cash Consideration payable and the
aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this
_Article IV_, in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration required to be paid by the Paying and Exchange Agent in
accordance with this Agreement (such cash and Parent Common Stock shall be
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Consideration Fund_ "). In addition,
Parent shall make available as necessary cash in an amount sufficient for
payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 4.1(d)_ and any
dividends or distributions which holders of Company Common Stock may be
entitled pursuant to  _Section 4.2(h)_. In the event the

 



25  Consideration Fund shall be insufficient to pay the Merger Consideration
(including with respect to Company Common Stock held by stockholders who did
not exercise, or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, their rights
to appraisal of such Company Common Stock under the DGCL), Parent shall
promptly deliver, or cause to be delivered, additional funds and shares of
Parent Common Stock to the Paying and Exchange Agent in an amount that is
equal to the deficiency required to make such payments.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five
(5) Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Paying
and Exchange Agent to mail to each stockholder whose shares were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 4.1_ :
(i) a letter of transmittal, in customary form, that shall specify that
delivery of such Certificates or transfer of such Book Entry Shares shall be
deemed to have occurred, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or
Book Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or transfer of the
Book Entry Shares to the Paying and Exchange Agent and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or transfer of the Book
Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration, the form and
substance of which letter of transmittal and instructions shall be as
reasonably agreed to by the Company and Parent and prepared prior to
the Closing. Upon receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying and Exchange
Agent in connection with the transfer of a Book Entry Share or surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying and Exchange Agent, in each
case together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and with such other documents as may
be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Book Entry Share
or Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, subject to
any required withholding of Taxes, the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article IV_ , and the Book Entry Share so transferred or
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid to holders of Book Entry Shares or Certificates in connection with, or
accrued on, the Merger Consideration, any cash paid in lieu of the issuance of
any fractional shares or dividends or distributions payable with respect to
Share Consideration. If any Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the stockholder in whose name the Book Entry Share transferred or
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition of such exchange that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay
to the Paying and Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than
the stockholder owning the Book Entry Share transferred or Certificate
surrendered, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying
and Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

 

(c) The cash in the Consideration Fund shall be invested by the Paying and
Exchange Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any such
investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States with
maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United States
and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Earnings on the
Consideration Fund in excess of the amounts payable to the Companys former
stockholders shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent and shall be
paid as Parent directs. No investment of the Consideration Fund shall relieve
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying and Exchange Agent from
promptly making the payments required by this _Article IV_ , and following any
losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional cash
funds to the Paying and Exchange Agent for the benefit of the Companys
stockholders at

 



26  the Effective Time in the amount of such losses to the extent the funds in
the Consideration Fund are insufficient for such purposes, which additional
funds will be deemed to be part of the Consideration Fund.

(d) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the share
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying and Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article
IV_ , except as otherwise provided by Law.

 

(e) Any portion of the Consideration Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former
Company stockholders one (1) year after the Effective Time shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, be delivered to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation for no consideration. Any Company stockholder owning Certificates
or Book Entry Shares who has not theretofore complied with this _Article IV_
with respect to such Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall thereafter look
only to Parent for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration in respect
thereof.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Paying and Exchange Agent nor
any party hereto shall be liable to any Person in respect of cash from the
Consideration Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book Entry
Share shall not have been surrendered or transferred, respectively, prior
to the date on which any Merger Consideration in respect thereof would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity
pursuant to applicable Law, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate or Book Entry Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, and any
stockholder of such Certificate or Book Entry Share who has not theretofore
complied with this _Article IV_ with respect thereto shall thereafter look
only to Parent for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration in respect
thereof.

(g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact (which affidavit shall be in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Paying and Exchange Agent) by the
Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying
and Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration to which such Person is entitled in
respect of such Certificate pursuant to this _Article IV_.

(h) Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared or made after the
date hereof with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time, such declaration shall include a dividend or other
distribution in respect of all Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this
Agreement. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after
the date hereof with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time, and no payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
_Section 4.1(d)_ will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Certificates
or Book Entry Shares with respect to Parent Common Stock represented thereby
until the holders of record of such Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall
surrender such Certificates or Book Entry Shares. Subject to applicable Law,
following 

 



27  surrender of any such Certificates or Book Entry Shares, the Paying and
Exchange Agent shall deliver to the holders thereof, without interest (i)
promptly after such surrender, the Cash Consideration payable and the Share
Consideration payable in exchange therefor, in each case pursuant to _Section
4.1(a)_ , along with payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section
4.1(d)_ and the amount of any such dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time and theretofore paid with respect to such
Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such
Parent Common Stock.

Section 4.3  _Dissenting Stockholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares ("
_Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section_ _ _ _262_ ") shall not be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 4.1_ ,
but rather the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to payment by
the Surviving Corporation of the "fair value" of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with Section 262; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder
shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
appraisal under Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair
value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into,
and to have become exchangeable solely for, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 4.1_. The Company shall provide prompt
notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any
shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to Section 262 received by the Company. To the
extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall have the opportunity to
participate in and control any and all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Neither the Company nor Parent shall, without the
prior written consent of the other party, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, or settle, or offer to settle, any such demands or applications,
or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or
agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 4.4 _Treatment of Company Stock Options; Company Restricted Stock
Units; and Company Performance Restricted Stock Units_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding and unvested Company Stock Option
(other than any such unvested Company Stock Option that is an Underwater
Option), shall, without any further action on the part of any holder thereof,
be assumed by Parent and converted into an option to purchase, on the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock Option, that
number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole
share) equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option and (B) the Equity Conversion
Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to
the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the
per-share exercise price for the Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Stock Option, by (2) the Equity Conversion Ratio (each, as so adjusted, a "
_Converted Parent Option_ ").

 



28 (b) The Converted Parent Options shall have the same vesting schedule and
other terms and conditions as such Company Stock Options; provided, that
Parent shall convert Company Stock Options into Converted Parent Options in
such a manner as to ensure that the Converted Parent Options are not subject
to Section 409A of the Code as a result of the assumption and conversion;
_provided_ , that all references to the "Company" in the Company Equity Plan
and award agreements will be references to Parent. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Converted Parent Options will be subject to accelerated vesting pursuant
to any change in control agreement in effect on the date hereof between the
Company and the holder of the applicable Company Stock Option that provides
for accelerated vesting of the holders outstanding equity awards upon a
termination of the holders employment in connection with or following a
change in control of the Company (for which purposes this transaction shall
constitute a change of control).

 

(c) At the Effective Time, each outstanding and vested Company Stock Option
with an exercise price less than the sum of (a) the Cash Consideration and
(b) the Share Consideration Value (including those Company Stock Options that
become vested by their terms immediately prior to or as of the Effective Time)
shall, without any further action on the part of any holder thereof,
be cancelled and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive Vested
Option Consideration (subject to any applicable withholding or other Taxes or
other amounts required by applicable Law to be withheld, which withholding
shall first be applied against the cash portion of the Vested Option
Consideration). Following the Effective Time, any such cancelled Company Stock
Option shall no longer be exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock and
shall entitle the holder of such Company Stock Option only to the payment, if
any, described in this _Section 4.4(c)_ , which shall be made by the Surviving
Corporation within ten (10) Business Days after the Effective Time. For the
avoidance of doubt, at the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Stock
Option that is an Underwater Option shall, without any further action on the
part of any holder thereof, be cancelled, and the holder thereof shall receive
no payment on account thereof.

 

(d) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, the unvested Company
Restricted Stock Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into that number of Parent restricted stock units of Parent
Common Stock (" _Converted RSUs_ ") equal to the product of (A) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Units
and (B) the Equity Conversion Ratio. Any Converted RSUs issued pursuant to
this _Section 4.4(d)_ shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as
were applicable under such Company Restricted Stock Units;  _provided_ , that
all references to the "Company" in the Company Equity Plan and award
agreements will be references to Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Converted RSUs will be subject to accelerated vesting pursuant to any change
in control agreement in effect on the date hereof between the Company and the
holder of the applicable Company Restricted Stock Unit that provides for
accelerated vesting of the holders outstanding equity awards upon a
termination of the holders employment in connection with or following a
change in control of the Company (for which purposes this transaction shall
constitute a change of control).

 



29 (e) At the Effective Time, each outstanding and vested Company Restricted
Stock Unit (including those Company Restricted Stock Units that become vested
by their terms immediately prior to or as of the Effective Time) shall,
without any further action on the part of any holder thereof, be cancelled and
extinguished, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive (subject to
any applicable withholding or other Taxes or other amounts required by
applicable Law to be withheld, which withholding shall first be applied
against the cash portion of the consideration paid in respect of a vested
Company Restricted Stock Unit) (i) an amount in cash equal to the product of
(A) the Cash Consideration multiplied by (B) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit, and (ii) a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the (A) Share
Consideration and (B) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit. Following the Effective Time,
any such cancelled Company Restricted Stock Unit shall entitle the holder of
such Company Restricted Stock Unit only to the payment described in this
_Section 4.4(c)_ , which shall be made by the Surviving Corporation within ten
(10) Business Days after the Effective Time; _provided_ , that such payment
shall be made at such other time or times following the Effective Time
consistent with the terms of the Company Restricted Stock Unit to the extent
necessary to avoid the imposition of additional income tax under Section 409A
of the Code.

(f) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, the unvested Company
Performance Restricted Stock Units outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be assumed and converted into that number of restricted
stock units of Parent Common Stock, rounded down to the nearest whole share ("
_Converted PRSUs_ ") equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Performance Restricted Stock
Units, with such number determined as of the last trading day prior to the
Closing Date based on achievement as of such date of the performance vesting
terms applicable to such Company Performance Restricted Stock Units with
respect of the performance period applicable to such Company Performance
Restricted Stock Units and (y) the Equity Conversion Ratio. Any Converted
PRSUs issued pursuant to this _Section 4.4(f)_ shall vest based on the
vesting date set forth in the award agreement applicable to the Company
Performance Restricted Stock Units, subject only to the continued service of
the grantee with the Surviving Corporation, Parent or an Affiliate through
the applicable vesting date but shall not be subject to any performance-based
vesting terms following the Effective Time, and shall otherwise be subject to
the same terms and conditions (modified as appropriate to reflect the
assumption) as were applicable under such Company Performance Restricted Stock
Units (after giving effect to and including any applicable change of control
or other accelerated vesting provisions, for which purposes this transaction
shall constitute a change of control); _provided_ , that all references to the
"Company" in the Company Equity Plan and award agreements will be references
to Parent. Each Converted PRSU that vests after the Effective Time shall be
settled in shares of Parent Common Stock; _provided_ , that in the event that
Parent shall reasonably determine at any time prior to the Effective Time that
it would not be permitted to consummate the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior approval of Parents
stockholders under applicable Laws or the rules of Nasdaq, Parent shall have
the power to provide that any such Converted PRSU that vests after the
Effective Time shall be settled by a cash payment equal to the value of a
share of Parent Common Stock at the time of such settlement. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Converted PRSUs will be subject to accelerated vesting pursuant
to any change in control agreement in 

 



30  effect on the date hereof between the Company and the holder of the
applicable Company Performance Restricted Stock Unit that provides for
accelerated vesting of the holders outstanding equity awards upon a
termination of the holders employment in connection with or following a
change in control of the Company (for which purposes this transaction shall
constitute a change of control).

 

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the parties shall take all actions necessary
(including obtaining any required consents) to effectuate the provisions set
forth in this _Section 4.4_ ; _provided_ , that no action taken shall be
required to be irrevocable until immediately prior to the Effective Time. The
parties shall, to the extent necessary to minimize the tax impact of the
provisions set forth in this _Section 4.4_ , cooperate in good faith prior to
the Effective Time to develop a mechanism with respect to Company Stock
Options, Company Restricted Stock Units and Company Performance Restricted
Stock Units held by individuals subject to Taxes imposed by the Laws of a
country other than the United States.

Section 4.5 _Withholding Rights_. The Paying and Exchange Agent, Parent, Sub
and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any Merger Consideration or other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as may be required under the Code or any other provision of
applicable federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that such
amounts are so deducted or withheld and are paid over to the applicable
Governmental Entity, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
whom such deduction or withholding was made.

any preemptive rights. As of the date of this Agreement, other than pursuant
to the Company Equity Plan, or the ESPP, there are no existing (i) options,
restricted stock units, shares of restricted stock, warrants, calls,
subscriptions or other rights, convertible securities, agreements or
commitments of any character obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to issue, transfer or sell any capital stock or other equity interest (or
securities convertible or exchangeable into such capital stock or equity
interest) in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) rights that are
linked to, or based upon, the value of Company Common Stock, (iii)
contractual obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to

of the capital stock or equity interests of the Company. There are no bonds,
debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries having the right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable
for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders
of the Company may vote.

 

(b) All of the outstanding capital stock or equivalent equity interests of
each of the Companys Subsidiaries are validly issued, fully paid (to the
extent required under the applicable governing documents) and nonassessable
and all such shares (other than directors qualifying shares) are owned of
record and beneficially, directly or indirectly, by the Company, free and
clear of all material Liens, pledges, security interests or other
encumbrances.

(c) No Subsidiary of the Company has or is bound by any outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments, rights agreements or
agreements of any character calling for it to issue, deliver or sell, or cause
to be issued, delivered or sold any of its equity securities or any
securities convertible into, exchangeable for or representing the right to
subscribe for, purchase or otherwise receive any such equity security, or
obligating such Subsidiary to grant, extend or enter into any such
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments, rights agreements or
other similar agreements, except, in each case, to or with the Company or any
other Subsidiary of the Company. There are no outstanding contractual
obligations of any Subsidiary of the Company to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any of its capital stock or other equity interests.

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any interest or
investments (whether equity or debt), or any interest or investment
convertible into or exchangeable for any such interest or investment, in any
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other entity, other than a
Subsidiary of the Company.

 



33 (e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has agreed or is obligated
to, directly or indirectly, make any future investment in or capital
contribution or advance to any Person (other than in or to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries).

with respect to each award of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock
Units and Company Performance Restricted Stock Units that was outstanding on
June 14, 2016: (i) the name and domicile address of the holder of such award;
(ii) the extent to which such award is vested or unvested; (iii) the number

the Code. Each grant of Company Stock Options was validly issued and properly
approved by the board of directors of the Company (or a duly authorized
committee or subcommittee thereof) in compliance with all applicable law and
no such grants involved any "back dating" or similar practices with respect to
the effect date of grant. No Company Stock Option or other right to acquire
Company Common Stock or other equity of the Company (i) has an exercise price
that was less than the fair market value of the underlying equity as of the
date such Company Stock Option or right was granted or (ii) has any feature
for the deferral of compensation other than the deferral of recognition of
income until the later of exercise or disposition of such Company Stock Option
or rights. All grants of Company Restricted Stock Units, and Company
Performance Restricted Stock Units were validly issued and properly approved
by the board of directors of the Company (or a committee thereof) in
accordance with the applicable Company Equity Plan and applicable Law,
including the Nasdaq Rules, and with the rules of any other applicable stock
exchanges.

 

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any
structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity, on the other
hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a) of
Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act)), where the result,
purpose, or intended effect of such commitment, joint venture, partnership,
Contract or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the Companys or such
Subsidiarys financial statements. 

Section 5.3 _Authorization; Validity of Agreement; Necessary Action_. The
Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

34  and, assuming due and valid authorization, execution and delivery hereof by
Parent and Sub, is a valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable

or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights and remedies generally,
and (ii) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of
equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of
the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and the performance by the
Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the

of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or similar organizational
documents of any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) assuming compliance with the
matters referred to in _Section 5.4(iv)(A)_ - _(C)_ , require any consent by
any Person under, contravene or conflict with or result in a violation or

a default (or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration), or require any consent, under any Material Contract to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or
any of their properties or assets is bound or result in the creation of any
Lien in or upon any of the properties, rights or assets of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, (iii) violate any Law applicable to the Company, any of

Company to make any filing or registration with or notification to, or require
the Company to obtain any authorization, consent or approval of, any
international, national, federal, state, provincial or local governmental,
court, legislative, executive or regulatory authority or agency or other

except in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), for such violations,
breaches or defaults that, or filings, registrations, notifications,
authorizations, consents or approvals the failure of which to make or obtain,

respective controlled Affiliates beneficially owns (as such term is used in
Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) or owns (as such term is used
in Section 203 of the DGCL) any Company Common Stock or any options, warrants
or other rights to acquire Company Common Stock or other securities of, or
any other economic interest (through derivatives, securities or otherwise) in
the Company.

 

Section 6.11 _Capitalization and Operations of Sub_. The authorized capital
stock of Sub consists solely of 1,000 shares of common shares, par value
$0.001 per share, all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of Sub is, and at the Effective Time will
be, owned by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary
of Parent. Sub has been formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, has not conducted any business
prior to the date hereof, and has no, and prior to the Effective Time will
have no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those
incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 6.12 _Availability of Funds; Financing_. Parents and Subs
obligations hereunder are not subject to a condition regarding Parents or
Subs obtaining of funds to consummate the Offer and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Parent has delivered to the Company true,
complete and correct copies of a fully executed commitment letter, together
with the related fee letters (solely in the case of the fee letters, with only
the fee amounts, pricing, "market flex" provisions and other economic terms
that do not adversely affect the enforceability, availability
or conditionality of, or the aggregate amount of proceeds available under,
the Debt Financing contained therein redacted), each in effect as of the date
of this Agreement from the Financing Sources parties thereto (together, as
they may be amended, modified or replaced in accordance with _Section 7.13_
and together with all annexes, exhibits, schedules and other attachments
thereto, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ") to provide debt financing in an
aggregate amount set forth therein and subject to the terms and conditions
set forth therein (being collectively referred to as the " _Debt Financing_
"). As of the date hereof, (i) the Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended
or modified in any manner, and (ii) to the Knowledge of Parent, no amendment
or modification of the Debt Commitment Letter is contemplated (except for any
amendment or modification to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities). As of the date hereof, (i) the Debt
Commitment Letter, including the commitments contained therein has not been
terminated, reduced, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect and, (ii) to the
Knowledge of Parent, no such termination, reduction, withdrawal or rescission
is contemplated. Parent has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other
fees and amounts in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter that are
payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement and satisfied all of the
other terms and conditions required to be satisfied by Parent as of the date
hereof. As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and
effect and is the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Parent and, to
the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws affecting
creditors rights and remedies generally 

 



59  and except that the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other
forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the
discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.
There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies (other than pursuant
to any "market flex" provisions set forth therein) related to the funding of
the full amount (or any portion) of the Debt Financing, other than as
expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. Assuming the Debt Financing
is funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter and the accuracy of
the representations and warranties set forth in _Article V_ and performance
by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement, in each case, to the
extent necessary to satisfy the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_ and
_Annex A_ , the net cash proceeds contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter,
together with available cash on hand of the Parent, Sub and the Company, will,
in the aggregate, be sufficient for Parent and Sub to pay all of the cash
amounts required to be provided by Parent and Sub for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the amounts
payable in connection with the consummation of the Offer and the Merger, and
all related fees and expenses required to be paid as of the date of the
consummation of the Merger. As of the date hereof, except as set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter, there are no side letters, understandings or other
agreements, contracts or arrangements of any kind relating to the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing contemplated therein that could
reasonably be expected to affect the availability of the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, no event
has occurred which (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) would, or
would reasonably be expected to, constitute a default or breach or failure to
satisfy a condition by Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party
thereto, under the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter and,
assuming the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1(a)_ and _Annex A_ are
satisfied at Closing, Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of
the conditions to the Debt Financing will not be satisfied by Parent prior to
the Acceptance Time or that the full amount of the Debt Financing will not be
available to Parent on the date of the Closing.

Section 6.13 _Solvency_. Parent is not entering into this Agreement with the
intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Immediately following the Closing after
giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
excluding the effect of any inaccuracy of the representations and warranties
contained in _Article V_, Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will
be Solvent. As used herein, " _Solvent_ " means with respect to any Person on
a particular date, that on such date (a) the fair value of the property of
such Person is greater than the total amount of liabilities, including,
contingent liabilities, of such Person, (b) the present fair salable value of
the assets of such Person is not less than the amount that will be required to
pay the probable liability of such Person on its debts as they become absolute
and matured, (c) such Person has not incurred, and does not intend to incur,
debts or liabilities beyond such Persons ability to pay such debts and
liabilities as they mature and (d) such Person is not engaged in business or a
transaction, and is not about to engage in business or a transaction, for
which such Persons property would constitute an unreasonably small capital.
The amount of contingent liabilities at any time shall be computed under this
_Section 6.13_ as the amount that, in the light of all the facts and
circumstances existing at such time, represents the amount that is probable
to become an actual or matured liability.

Section 7.2 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) The Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to
directors, officers, employees, counsel, investment bankers, accountants and
other authorized representatives (" _Representatives_ ") of Parent reasonable
access, in a manner not unreasonably disruptive to the operations of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, during normal business hours
and upon reasonable notice throughout the period prior to the Effective Time,
to the properties, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and,
during such period, shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to)
furnish promptly to such Representatives all information concerning the
business, properties and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries in each
case as may reasonably be requested for reasonable purposes related to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing herein shall require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to disclose any information to Parent or Sub if such disclosure
would, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, be expected to (i) violate
applicable Law or the provisions of any agreement to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party as of the date of this Agreement (as long as
the Company has used all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
consent of the other party to the agreement), or (ii) constitute a waiver of
the attorney-client, work product doctrine or other legal privilege held by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_   _further_ , _however_ ,
that nothing herein shall authorize Parent or its Representatives to undertake
any invasive additional diligence investigation after the date of this
Agreement, including investigations or sampling at any property owned,
operated or leased by the Company or its Subsidiaries without the prior
written consent of the Company. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event
that the Company does not provide access or information in reliance on the
immediately preceding sentence, it shall provide notice to Parent that it is
withholding such access or information and shall use all reasonable efforts to
communicate the applicable information in a way that would not violate the
applicable Law, Contract or obligation or risk waiver of such privilege. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall apply with respect to information furnished
hereunder by or on behalf of the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Companys
Representatives (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement). The Company
agrees that the Confidentiality Agreement is hereby amended to permit the

convertible or equity-linked debt) (and representatives of such financing
sources) in the term "Representative" as such term is defined therein.

(b) Each of Parent and Sub shall (and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to) afford to Representatives of the Company
reasonable access, in a manner not unreasonably disruptive to the operations
of the business of Parent, Sub and their respective Subsidiaries, during
normal business hours and upon reasonable notice throughout the period prior
to the Effective Time, to the properties, books and records of Parent, Sub and
their respective Subsidiaries and, during such period, shall (and shall cause
each of their respective Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to such
Representatives all information concerning the business, properties and
personnel of Parent, Sub and their respective Subsidiaries in each case as may
reasonably be requested for reasonable purposes related to the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing herein shall require the Parent, Sub and their respective
Subsidiaries to disclose any information to the Company if such disclosure
would, in the reasonable judgment of Parent, be expected to (i) violate
applicable Law or the provisions of any agreement to which Parent, Sub and
their respective Subsidiaries is a party as of the date of this Agreement (as
long as each of Parent and Sub has used all commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain the consent of the other party to the agreement), or (ii) constitute
a waiver of the attorney-client, work product doctrine or other legal
privilege held by Parent, Sub or their respective Subsidiaries; _provided_
_further_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall authorize the Company or its
Representatives to undertake any invasive additional diligence investigation
after the date of this Agreement, including investigations or sampling at any
property owned, operated or leased by Parent or its Subsidiaries without the
prior written consent of Parent. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event
that Parent or Sub does not provide access or information in reliance on the
immediately preceding sentence, it shall provide notice to the Company that it
is withholding such access or information and shall use all reasonable efforts
to communicate the applicable information in a way that would not violate the
applicable Law, Contract or obligation or risk waiver of such privilege. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall apply with respect to information furnished
hereunder by or on behalf of Parent, Sub, their respective Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement).

Section 7.3 _Board Recommendation; Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) The Company will not, will cause its Subsidiaries not to, and will cause
each of the Companys and its Subsidiaries respective officers, directors,
employees and other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i)
initiate, solicit, or knowingly take any action to facilitate or encourage, or
participate or engage in any negotiations, inquiries or discussions
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) in connection with any
potential Acquisition Proposal, disclose or furnish any nonpublic information
or data to any Person (other than Parent or its Representatives) concerning
the Companys business or properties, or afford any Person other than Parent
or its Representatives access to its properties, books, or records, except as
required by Law or pursuant to a governmental request for information, (iii)
enter into or execute, or propose to enter into or execute, any agreement or
enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions relating to
an Acquisition Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse, recommend or make or authorize
any public statement, recommendation, or solicitation

 



67  in support of any Acquisition Proposal, or (v) waive, terminate, modify or
fail to enforce any provision of any contractual "standstill," confidentiality
or similar obligation of any person other than Parent or its Affiliates
(other than provisions in such obligations customarily referred to as "dont
ask" provisions); or (vi) take any action to render any provision of any "fair
price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business combination" or
other similar anti-takeover statute (including Section 203 of the DGCL) or any
restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover provision in the
Companys organizational documents, in each case inapplicable to any person
(other than Parent or any of its Affiliates) or any Acquisition Proposal (and
the Company shall promptly take all steps necessary to terminate any waiver
that may have been heretofore granted to any such person or Acquisition
Proposal under any such provisions). The Company will, and will direct its
Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated all
discussions and negotiations that commenced prior to the date of this
Agreement regarding any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, and shall terminate access to
any virtual data room established by the Company and request that all
confidential or proprietary information previously furnished to any party
(other than Parent) in connection with any such discussions and negotiations
be promptly returned or destroyed. Any breach of the foregoing provisions of
this  _Section 7.3_ by any of the Companys Subsidiaries or the Companys or
its Subsidiaries Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach by the
Company.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
the event that after the date hereof and prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company receives an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that did not result or
arise in connection with a material breach of the restrictions set forth in
_Section 7.3(a)_, the Company and its board of directors may (I) participate
in discussions or negotiations (including, as a part thereof, making any
counterproposal) with, or (II) furnish nonpublic information to, any Person or
Persons (but only after any such Person enters into a
confidentiality agreement with the Company containing confidentiality
provisions (but that need not contain standstill or similar restrictions) not
less restrictive to such person than such provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement are to Parent, which may not provide for an exclusive right to
negotiate with the Company and may not restrict the Company from complying
with this _Section 7.3(b)_ and _Section 7.3(c)_) making such Acquisition
Proposal and their respective Representatives and potential sources of
financing, if prior to the Acceptance Time (i) the Companys board of
directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal is, or
would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and (ii) the
Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action, would reasonably
be expected to constitute a breach by the Companys directors of their
fiduciary duties under applicable Law. In addition, nothing herein shall
restrict the Company from complying with its disclosure obligations with
regard to any Acquisition Proposal under applicable Law.

(c) The Company will as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt) notify Parent of the receipt by
the Company of any Acquisition Proposal (including for the avoidance of doubt
any request for information or other inquiry which the Company would
reasonably expect to lead to an Acquisition Proposal). The Company shall
notify Parent, in writing, of any decision of its board of directors to enter
into discussions or negotiations concerning any Acquisition

 



68  Proposal or to provide non-public information with respect to the Company to
any Person, which notice shall be given as promptly as practicable after such
determination was reached (and in any event no later than twenty-four (24)
hours after such determination was reached). The Company will (i) provide
Parent with written notice setting forth all information that is material or
reasonably necessary to keep Parent informed of the status and terms and
conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal (including for the avoidance of
doubt any request for information or other inquiry which the Company would
reasonably expect to lead to an Acquisition Proposal) and of any changes
or other amendments thereto, and the identity of the person making such
Acquisition Proposal, and attach a copy of any such written Acquisition
Proposal, or if such Acquisition Proposal is provided orally to the Company,
the Company shall summarize in writing the terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal (including for the avoidance of doubt any such request or
other inquiry), (ii) keep Parent informed as promptly as practicable with
respect to any changes or proposed changes to the terms and conditions of an
Acquisition Proposal submitted to the Company (and in any event within twenty-
four (24) hours following any such changes or proposed changes), including by
providing a copy of all written proposals received by the Company relating to
any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) promptly (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours) following the provision of any non-public information of the
Company to any such Person, provide such information to Parent (including by
posting such information to an electronic data room), to the extent such
information has not previously been provided or made available to Parent and
(iv) promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of
such determination) notify Parent of any determination by the Companys board
of directors that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal.

 

(d) Subject to _Section 7.3(e)_ and _Section 7.3(f)_, unless and until this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Section 9.1_, neither the
board of directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall, directly or
indirectly, (A)(i) fail to make in accordance with the terms of _Section
2.2(b)_, withdraw or qualify (or amend or otherwise modify in a manner
adverse to Parent), or propose publicly to withdraw or qualify (or amend or
otherwise modify in a manner adverse to Parent) the Board Recommendation, (ii)
fail to recommend against acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer
for the Company Common Stock within ten (10) Business Days of the commencement
of such offer or (iii) approve, adopt, or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve, adopt, or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described
in clauses (i) - (iii) being referred to as a " _Change of Recommendation_ ")
or (B) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or
recommend, or allow the Company to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement, or other similar agreement, arrangement, or understanding (other
than a confidentiality agreement of the type described in _Section 7.3(b)_)
(i) constituting, or related to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead
to, any Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) requiring it to abandon, terminate, or
fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement (any of the foregoing in clause (B) of this _Section 7.3(d)_, an "
_Acquisition Agreement_ ").

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time,
the Companys board of directors may, if the Companys board of directors
determines

 



69  in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to constitute a
breach by the Companys directors of their fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, (x) solely in response to a Superior Proposal, make a Change of
Recommendation, or (y) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_ and concurrently with such termination enter into an
Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , that
the Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the
foregoing clause (y), and any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing
clause (y) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless concurrently with
such termination the Company pays by wire transfer of immediately available
funds the termination fee in accordance with  _Section 9.2(b)_; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right to
make a Change in Recommendation pursuant to this _Section 7.3(e)_ or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_, and any
purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (B) shall be void and
of no force or effect, unless:

 

(i) the Company notifies Parent at least four (4) Business Days in advance
that it intends to take such action (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of any Superior
Proposal shall require a new notice with a new two (2) Business Day notice
period), which notice must specify the reasons for taking such action and, if
applicable, the terms and conditions of such proposal (including, if
applicable, the most recent draft of any written agreement providing for the
proposed transaction, and prior to taking such action, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Representatives to, during such four (4) Business Day period
(or two (2) Business Day period with respect to a "new notice" as such term is
used in this sentence), negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent
that Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that the Change in Recommendation or
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_ is no longer
necessary; and

 

(ii) at the end of such four (4) Business Day period (or two (2) Business Day
period with respect to a "new notice" as such term is used in _Section
7.3(e)(i)_), (A) such Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn and the
board of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such Acquisition
Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (taking into account any
changes to the terms of this Agreement agreed to or proposed by Parent as a
result of the negotiations required by clause (i) or otherwise) and the
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to constitute a
breach by the Companys directors of their fiduciary duties under applicable
Law.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time,
the Companys board of directors may, if the Companys board of directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisors, that the failure to take such action would reasonably
be expected to constitute a breach by the Companys directors of
their fiduciary duties under applicable Law, make a Change of Recommendation
unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any
Change of

 



70  Recommendation proposed to be made in relation to an Acquisition Proposal
may only be made pursuant to and in accordance with _Section_ _ _ _7.3(e)_ )
in response to an Intervening Event; _provided_ , that:

(i) the Company has provided to Parent at least four (4) Business Days prior
written notice that it intends to take such action, which notice must specify
the reasons for proposing to take such action, and include a reasonably
detailed description of the Intervening Event; and

 

(ii) Parent shall not have made a proposal that, if accepted, would be binding
on Parent and that has not been withdrawn, within four (4) Business Days
(during which period the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives
to, negotiate with Parent in good faith regarding any proposal by Parent)
after receipt of such notice from the Company, to make adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement such that (taking into account any such
changes to the terms and conditions of this Agreement agreed to or proposed by
Parent) failure by the Companys directors to effect a Change
of Recommendation would not reasonably be expected to constitute a breach by
the Companys directors of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the board of directors of the
Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying
with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and (ii)
making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company that the board of
directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such disclosure would
reasonably be expected to constitute a breach by the Companys directors of
their fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , that the foregoing
shall not permit the board of directors of the Company to make a Change of
Recommendation except as expressly permitted by _Section 7.3(e)_ or _Section
7.3(f)_.

 

Section 7.4 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) For the benefit of employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries employed
as of the Effective Time (the " _Employees_ "), for a period of 12 months
following the Effective Time (or, if shorter, during an Employees period of
employment), and subject to the applicable Law of each jurisdiction where
Employees are located, Parent agrees to provide or cause its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation) to provide each Employee with (i) a base
salary or wage rate that is substantially comparable to the base salary or
wage rate in effect for similarly situated employees of Parent immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) with employee benefits (excluding
equity and cash incentive compensation) that, in the aggregate, are
substantially comparable to those in effect for similarly situated employees
of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (x) to the extent required by applicable Law, base salary or wage
rate and incentive compensation opportunities and employee benefits for any
Employee shall be no less favorable than the base salary or wage rate and
incentive compensation opportunity in effect for such Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (y) nothing in this Agreement shall be

 



71  interpreted as conferring, or intending to confer, on any Employee a right
to continued employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for the period
following the Effective Time through December 31, 2016, Parent shall provide
the Employees with severance benefits not less favorable than those provided
by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Employees pursuant to the
Severance Guidelines adopted by the Company and as in effect on the date
hereof and provided to Parent.

(b) With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy or
arrangement maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) following the Effective Time and in which any of the Employees
participate (the " _Parent Plans_ "), and except to the extent necessary to
avoid duplication of benefits, for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate and vesting, service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (or
predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides past service credit
under its benefit plans) shall be treated as service with Parent and its
Subsidiaries. Each applicable Parent Plan shall waive eligibility waiting
periods and pre-existing condition limitations to the extent waived or not
included under the corresponding Benefit Plan. Parent agrees to give or cause
its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to give the Employees
credit under the applicable Parent Plan for amounts paid prior to
the Effective Time during the calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs under a corresponding Benefit Plan for purposes of applying
deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had
been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Parent Plan.

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or relevant
Subsidiary to, assume and honor in accordance with their terms all deferred
compensation plans, agreements and arrangements, severance and separation pay
plans, agreements and arrangements, and written employment, severance,
retention, incentive, change in control and termination agreements (including
any change in control provisions therein) set forth in _Section 5.9(a)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule applicable to employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company or
such Subsidiary would be required to perform and honor such plans, agreements
and arrangements if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement had not
been consummated.

 

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this _Section 7.4_ with respect to employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties
hereto and shall not create any direct or third party beneficiary right (i) in
any other Person, including employees, former employees, any participant or
any beneficiary thereof in any Benefit Plan, Foreign Benefit Plan or Parent
Plans, or (ii) to continued employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding
anything in this  _Section 7.4_ to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement,
whether express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other
modification of any Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan or any other employee
benefit plans of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or Parent or prohibits
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, from
amending or terminating any employee benefit plan.

 

(e) The Company will adopt, or will cause to be adopted, all necessary
corporate resolutions (which shall be subject to Parents reasonable review
and approval) to

 



72  terminate each 401(k) Plan sponsored or maintained by the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate, effective as of no later than one day prior to Closing (but
such termination may be contingent upon the Closing). Immediately prior to
such termination, the Company (or such ERISA Affiliate) will have made all
necessary payments to fund the contributions: (i) necessary or required to
maintain the tax-qualified status of the 401(k) Plan; (ii) for elective
deferrals made pursuant to the 401(k) Plan for the period prior to
termination; and (iii) for any employer contributions (including, without
limitation, any matching contributions) for the period prior to termination.
For this purpose, the term " _401(k) Plan_ " means any plan intended to be
qualified under Code Section 401(a) which includes a cash or deferred
arrangement intended to qualify under Code Section 401(k). The Company shall
provide Parent with a copy of resolutions duly adopted by the Companys board
of directors (or the board of directors of the applicable ERISA Affiliate) so
terminating any such 401(k) Plan. In the event that termination of any such
401(k) Plan would reasonably be anticipated to trigger liquidation charges,
surrender charges or other fees (other than ordinary administrative fees in
connection with such termination), then the Company shall take such actions as
are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees
and provide such estimate in writing to Parent no later than three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Promptly following the Closing,
Parent shall cause its 401(k) Plan to accept (x) rollover contributions
of amounts distributed to Employees from the Companys 401(k) Plan and (y)
in-kind rollovers of Employees loan balances, and will provide for continued
repayments of any such loans through payroll deductions commencing not later
than with the first payroll period ending not more than fourteen (14) days
following the date of such rollover.

(f) If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into, adopts, amends,
modifies or terminates any Company Arrangement, all such amounts payable under
such Company Arrangement shall (i) be paid or granted as compensation for past
services performed, future services to be performed, or future services to be
refrained from performing, by the Covered Securityholders (and matters
incidental thereto) and (ii) shall not be calculated based on the number of
shares tendered or to be tendered into the Offer by the applicable Covered
Securityholder. Moreover, the Company shall take all actions necessary so
that, prior to the Expiration Date: (i) the adoption, approval, amendment or
modification of each such Company Arrangement shall be approved as an
employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement
solely by independent directors of the Company in accordance with the
requirements of Rule 14d10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions
thereto and (ii) the "safe harbor" provided pursuant to Rule 14d10(d)(2) is
otherwise applicable thereto as a result of the taking prior to the Expiration
Date of all necessary actions by the board of directors of the Company, the
Company Compensation Committee or its independent directors.

Section 7.5 _Publicity_. The initial press release by each of Parent and the
Company with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be approved by
each of Parent and the Company. Thereafter, neither the Company nor Parent
(nor any of their respective Affiliates) shall issue any other press release
or make any other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior review and approval of the
other party (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except as may be required by Law or by any listing agreement with a
national securities exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue such
press release or make such public announcement shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with 

 



73  the other party before making any such public announcements; _provided_ ,
that the Company will not be required to obtain the prior approval of or
consult with the other party in connection with any such press release or
public announcement if (a) the Companys board of directors has effected or in
connection with a Change of Recommendation pursuant to _Section 7.3(e)_ or
_Section 7.3(f)_ , (b) in connection with any such press release or public
announcement pursuant to _Section 7.3(e)_ or _Section 7.3(f)_ , or (c) such
press release or public announcement consists solely of information previously
disclosed in all material respects in a previously distributed press release
or public announcement.

Section 7.6 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance and
Indemnification._

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless,
and advance expenses to, the individuals who at any time prior to the
Effective Time were directors or officers of the Company or any of its present
or former Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities in connection with actions or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) to the fullest extent permitted by Law and by
the by-laws of the Company or any applicable Subsidiary. After the Effective
Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) fulfill and honor, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, all rights to exculpation, advancement of expenses or
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
existing as of the Effective Time in favor of present or former directors and
officers of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their predecessors in
their capacity as officers or directors, and the heirs, executors,
trustees, fiduciaries and administrators of such officer or director (each, a
" _D andO Indemnitee_"), as provided in the Companys or each of its
Subsidiaries respective certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or
comparable organizational or governing documents) or in any agreement, which
shall survive the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. After the
Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to) fulfill and honor such obligations to the
extent permitted by applicable Law. In addition, for a period of six (6) years
following the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, cause the certificate of incorporation
and by-laws (and other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of the DandO
Indemnities for actions prior to the Effective Time that are at least as
favorable as the indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation
provisions contained in the certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or other
similar organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and during such six (6) year period,
such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified with
respect to the DandO Indemnities for actions taken prior to the Effective Time
in any respect, except as required by applicable Law.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of
the directors and officers liability

 



74  coverage of the Companys existing directors and officers insurance
policies and the Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies
(collectively, the " _D andO Insurance_"), in each case for a claims reporting
or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to
the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current DandO Insurance carrier with respect to
directors and officers liability insurance in an amount and scope at least
as favorable as the Companys existing policies; _provided_ , that in no
event shall the Company pay, and in no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to pay, an aggregate annual premium for any such
insurance policy or policies in excess of 250% of the annual premium
currently paid by the Company for such coverage (the " _Maximum Amount_ ");
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premium of such policy exceeds the
Maximum Amount, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount. If the Company or the Surviving Corporation for any reason fails to
obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, (i) the
Surviving Corporation shall continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at
least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in
place as of the date of this Agreement with the Companys current insurance
carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as
the Companys current DandO Insurance carrier with respect to directors and
officers liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as
the Companys existing policies, or (ii) Parent will provide, or cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide, for a period of not less than six (6) years
after the Effective Time, the DandO Indemnitees who are insured under the
Companys DandO Insurance with comparable DandO Insurance that provides coverage
for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current DandO
Insurance carrier, that is no less favorable than the existing policy of the
Company or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the
best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the
DandO Insurance in excess of two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the annual
premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and  _provided_
_further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such
amount. _Section 7.6(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth in
reasonable detail a description of the Companys DandO Insurance existing as of
the date hereof, including the annual premium for such DandO Insurance.

(c) This _Section 7.6_ is intended to benefit the Indemnified Parties and the
DandO Indemnitees, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party or DandO
Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her representatives.

 

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates or amalgamates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
Person of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys a
majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors, assigns and
transferees of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, or their respective
successors or assigns, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section 7.6_.

 



75 Section 7.7 _Reasonable Efforts_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties
hereto agree to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act and to make all other filings required by, or
advisable under, applicable foreign Antitrust Laws (collectively, " _Foreign
Antitrust Approvals_ ") with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby as promptly as practicable and in any event prior to the expiration of
any applicable legal deadline ( _provided_ , that the submission or filing (i)
of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act will be made within
ten (10) Business Days of the date of this Agreement, and (ii) for applicable
foreign Antitrust Laws shall be submitted by the parties with the relevant
notification forms, or a draft thereof, for jurisdictions where submission of
a draft prior to formal notification is appropriate, within forty-five (45)
calendar days of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ that, in
the case of clause (ii), if a party is not prepared to file any such
submission or filing within such period, such partys senior executives shall
discuss the reasons for the failure to meet such submission or filing
deadlines with the senior executives from the other party) and to supply as
promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and any other filings required
or advisable in connection with the Foreign Antitrust Approvals or any other
Antitrust Law. Parent shall be entitled to direct the antitrust defense of
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement in any investigation or
litigation by, or negotiations with, any Governmental Entity or other person
relating to the Offer or the Merger or regulatory filings under
applicable Antitrust Laws, _provided_ that Parent shall consult with, and
consider in good faith the views of, the Company throughout the antitrust
defense of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, including by
providing the Company with reasonable opportunity to evaluate, as promptly as
practicable, steps to be taken in pursuit of such defense. The Company shall
not make any offer, acceptance or counter-offer to or otherwise engage in
negotiations or discussions with any Governmental Entity with respect to any
proposed settlement, consent decree, commitment or remedy, or, in the event of
litigation, discovery, admissibility of evidence, timing or scheduling, except
as specifically requested by or agreed with Parent. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to support Parent in all material respects in all such
investigations, litigation, negotiations and discussions to the extent
requested by Parent. Without limiting the foregoing, the parties shall
provide to the other parties in advance, any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings
under or relating to any such Antitrust Laws. The parties hereto agree to (i)
give each other reasonable advance notice of all meetings with any
Governmental Entity relating to any Antitrust Laws, (ii) give each other an
opportunity to participate in each of such meetings, (iii) to the extent
practicable, give each other reasonable advance notice of all substantive oral
communications with any Governmental Entity relating to any Antitrust Laws,
(iv) if any Governmental Entity initiates a substantive oral communication
regarding any Antitrust Laws, promptly notify the other party of the substance
of such communication, (v) provide each other with a reasonable advance
opportunity to review and comment upon all written communications (including
any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals) with a Governmental Entity regarding any Antitrust Laws, and (vi)
provide each other promptly with copies of all written communications to or
from any Governmental Entity relating to any Antitrust Laws. Any such
disclosures or provision of copies by one party to the other may be made on an
outside counsel basis if appropriate. 

 



76  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, and without
limiting Parents right to direct the antitrust defense of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company and Parent agrees, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries, to use reasonable best efforts to obtain
any consents, clearances or approvals required under or in connection with the
HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the
Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other federal, state or
foreign law, regulation or decree designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions for the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or
the significant impediment of effective competition (collectively "
_Antitrust Laws_ "), to enable all waiting periods under applicable Antitrust
Laws to expire, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
applicable Antitrust Laws asserted by any Governmental Entity, in each case,
to cause the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby to occur prior to the Termination Date, including but not
limited to (x) promptly complying with or modifying any requests for
additional information (including any second request) by any Governmental
Entity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this
Agreement shall require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to
consent or proffer to divest, hold separate, or enter into any license or
similar Contract with respect to, or agree to restrict the ownership or
operation of, any business or assets of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in
this Agreement shall require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
to (and, without the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not
and shall not allow any of its Subsidiaries to) consent or proffer to divest,
hold separate, or enter into any license or similar Contract with respect to,
or agree to restrict the ownership or operation of, any business or assets of
Company and its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to reduce the
benefits to Parent of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any
material respect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event
shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates be obligated to
litigate or participate in the litigation of any suit, claim, charge, action,
hearing, proceeding, arbitration or mediation, whether judicial or
administrative, brought by any Governmental Entity or appeal any order (i)
challenging or seeking to make illegal, delaying materially or otherwise
directly or indirectly restraining or prohibiting the consummation of the
Merger or seeking to obtain from Parent or any of its Subsidiaries any damages
in connection therewith, (ii) seeking to prohibit or limit in any respect, or
place any conditions on, the ownership or operation by the Company, Parent or
any of their respective Affiliates of all or any portion of the business or
assets of Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or to
require any such person to dispose of, license (whether pursuant to an
exclusive or nonexclusive license) or hold separate all or any portion of the
business or assets of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, in each case as a result of or in connection with
the Merger, (iii) seeking, directly or indirectly, to impose or confirm
limitations on the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates to acquire or
hold, or exercise full rights of ownership of, any shares of the Companys
capital stock or any shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation on
all matters properly presented to the stockholders of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, respectively, (iv) seeking to require divestiture by
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any business or assets of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or Parent or its Subsidiaries, or (v) that would reasonably
be expected to impede, interfere with, prevent or materially delay the Merger
or that would reasonably be expected to dilute materially the benefits to
Parent of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



77 (b) Subject to the terms hereof, and except with regard to the Antitrust Laws
which shall be governed by _Section 7.7(a)_ , the Company, Parent and Sub
shall, and Parent and the Company shall cause their respective Subsidiaries
to, each use their reasonable best efforts to:

 

(i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as reasonably practicable;

 

(ii) obtain from any Governmental Entity or any other third party any
consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations, or orders,
and send any notices, in each case, which are required to be obtained, made or
sent by such party or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with the
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that in connection
therewith none of Parent, Sub, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries
will be required to make or agree to make any material payment or accept
any material conditions or obligations, including amendments to existing
conditions and obligations;

(iii) as promptly as practicable, make all necessary filings and
notifications, and thereafter make any other required submissions and
applications with respect to this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger required
under any applicable statute, law, rule or regulation; and

(iv) execute or deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement.

The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in connection with the
making of all such filings, submissions, applications and requests. The
Company and Parent shall each use their reasonable best efforts to furnish to
each other (on an outside counsel basis if appropriate) all information
required for any filing, submission, application or request to be made
pursuant to the rules and regulations of any applicable statute, law, rule or
regulation in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and the Company agree that nothing
contained in this _Section 7.7(b)_ shall modify, limit or otherwise affect
their respective rights and responsibilities under _Section 7.7(a)_.

 

Section 7.8 _ESPP_. The ESPP shall continue to be operated in accordance with
its terms and past practice, _provided_ , that if the Closing is expected to
occur prior to the end of an Offering Period (as defined in the ESPP) ("
_Offering Period_ "), the Company shall take action to provide for an earlier
Purchase Date (as defined in the ESPP) concurrent with the Closing Date ("
_New Purchase Date_ ") with respect to each Purchase Period (as defined in the
ESPP) then in progress in accordance with Section 10.5 of the ESPP and each
then-outstanding option under the ESPP with respect to such Offering Period
shall be exercised on the New Purchase Date (making such pro-rata adjustments
as may be necessary to reflect the shortened Offering Period but otherwise

 



78  treating such shortened Offering Period as a fully effective and completed
Offering Period for all purposes under the ESPP). Such earlier New Purchase
Date shall be as reasonably close to the Closing Date as is administratively
practicable, and the Company shall notify each participant in writing at least
ten (10) days prior to the New Purchase Date that the exercise date for his or
her option (including for purposes of determining the Purchase Price (as
defined in the ESPP) of such option) has been changed to the New Purchase
Date, and that his or her option will be exercised automatically on the New
Purchase Date, unless prior to such date he or she has withdrawn from
the Offering Period as provided in Sections 8.1 and 10.5 of the ESPP. After
the date of this Agreement, no new participants shall be permitted to enroll
in the ESPP, no participant may increase the rate of his or her participation
in the ESPP from the level in effect on the date of this Agreement, and no
new Offering Period shall commence under the ESPP.

Section 7.9  _Section_ _ _ _16 Matters_. Prior to the Expiration Date, the
board of directors of the Company, or an appropriate committee of non-employee
directors, shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance
of the SEC so that the disposition of Company Common Stock, Company Stock
Options, Company Performance Restricted Stock Units and Company Restricted
Stock Units pursuant to this Agreement by any officer or director of the
Company who is a covered person for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange
Act shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange
Act. Prior to the Expiration Date, the board of directors of Parent, or an
appropriate committee of non-employee directors, shall adopt a resolution
consistent with the interpretative guidance of the SEC so that the acquisition
of Parent Common Stock, Converted Parent Options, Converted PRSUs and
Converted RSUs pursuant to this Agreement by any officer or director of the
Company who may become a covered person for purposes of Section 16 of the
Exchange Act shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16 of the
Exchange Act.

 

Section 7.10 _Filing of Form S-8; Listing of Additional Shares_. Parent agrees
to file, as soon as reasonably practicable but in no event later than ten
(10) Business Days following the Effective Time, a registration statement on
Form S-8 (or any successor form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable with respect to Converted Parent Options, Converted PRSUs, and
Converted RSUs and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as the Converted Parent Options, Converted PRSUs and
Converted RSUs assumed in accordance with this Agreement remain outstanding.
Parent shall at times ensure that there will remain a sufficient amount of
unissued shares of Parent Common Stock to meet its share issuance obligations
in connection with the Company Stock Options, Company Performance Restricted
Stock Units and Company Restricted Stock Units. Parent shall take all action
reasonably necessary to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issuable upon the exercise of Company Stock Options, or vesting of the Company
Restricted Stock Units and the Company Performance Restricted Stock Units, to
be approved for listing on Nasdaq at or prior to the Effective Time.

Section 7.11 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall promptly
notify Parent in writing, and Parent shall promptly notify the Company in
writing, of: (a) any written communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person (or another Person) is or may be required in connection
with the Offer, the Merger and the transactions 

 



79  contemplated hereby, (b) any written communication from any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby (other than such communications contemplated by _Section
7.7(a)_ , which shall be governed by such Section) or (c) any actions, claims,
investigations, suits or proceedings commenced or, to the Knowledge of the
Company or Parent, as applicable, threatened against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (in the case of the Company) or Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (in the case of Parent) that are related to the Offer, the Merger
and the transactions contemplated hereby (including any
transaction litigation brought by a stockholder of the Company or Parent, as
applicable). The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall
give prompt notice to the Company, of the occurrence, or non-occurrence of any
event, of which either party becomes aware, which would be reasonably likely
to cause (i) any representation or warranty of such party contained in this
Agreement that is qualified as to materiality to not be true and accurate in
any respect as if such representation or warranty were made at such time, or
any such representation or warranty that is not so qualified to not be true
and accurate in any material respect as if such representation were made at
such time, or (ii) the Company or Parent, as applicable, to fail to comply
with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided_ , that
no such notification shall be deemed to cure any breach or otherwise affect
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties hereunder.

 

Section 7.12 _Transaction Litigation_. Subject to applicable Law, other than
with respect to any litigation where Parent is adverse to the Company, the
Company will give Parent the reasonable opportunity, at Parents sole cost and
expense, to participate, subject to a customary joint defense agreement, in
(but not control) the defense of any action, claim, suit or
proceeding against the Company or its directors or officers relating to the
Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, and no such
settlement will be agreed to or offered without the prior written consent of
Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); _provided_ , that Parent shall not be obligated to consent to any
settlement (i) which does not include full release of Parent and its
Affiliates or which imposes an injunction or other equitable relief upon
Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation), or (ii) that would result in the payment by Parent,
the Company or any Subsidiary thereof of any amount in excess of
the retention or deductible under any applicable insurance policy of the
Company. Subject to applicable Law, other than with respect to any litigation
where the Company is adverse to Parent, Parent will give the Company the
reasonable opportunity, at the Companys sole cost and expense, to
participate, subject to a customary joint defense agreement, in (but not
control) the defense or settlement of any action, claim, suit or proceeding
against Parent or its directors or officers relating to the Offer, the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated hereby. Prior to the consummation of
the Merger, without the prior written consent of the Company, Parent shall not
settle any action, claim, suit or proceeding related to the Offer, the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated hereby unless such settlement provides
a full and unconditional release for the Company and each officer and director
of the Company party to such litigation. The Company shall not settle or make
an offer to settle any litigation against the Company or any director by any
stockholder relating to this Agreement or the Merger, without the prior
written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed);  _provided_ , that Parent shall not be obligated to
consent to any settlement (i) which does not include full release of Parent
and its

 



80  Affiliates or which imposes an injunction or other equitable relief upon
Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation), or (ii) that would result in the payment by Parent,
the Company or any Subsidiary thereof of any amount in excess of the retention
or deductible under any applicable insurance policy of the Company. Each of
the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries
to, cooperate in the defense or settlement of any litigation contemplated by
this _Section 7.12_. The parties acknowledge that this _Section 7.12_ in no
way limits the parties obligations under _Section 7.7(a)_.

Section 7.13 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain funds sufficient
to fund the aggregate Cash Consideration and the funds otherwise necessary to
effect the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on
or prior to the date upon which the Merger is required to be
consummated pursuant to the terms hereof. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
advisable or proper to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions (including any "market flex" provisions) described in the Debt
Commitment Letter pursuant to the terms thereof, including using reasonable
best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter; (ii)
negotiate, execute and deliver definitive documentation for the Debt Financing
that reflects the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (subject to
any "market flex" provisions included in the fee letters or any fee letters
relating to an Alternative Debt Financing) or such other terms that are more
favorable to Parent; (iii) satisfy (or seek a waiver of) on a timely basis
all of the conditions precedent set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and
any definitive document related to the Debt Financing, in each case that are
within the control of Parent and comply with their obligations thereunder; and
(iv) to seek to enforce its rights with respect to funding under the Debt
Commitment Letter in the event of a breach thereof by the financing
provider(s) thereunder. Without the consent of the Company, Parent shall not
permit any amendment, supplement, replacement or modification to be made to,
or any waiver of any provision under, the Debt Commitment Letter (other than
pursuant to "flex" provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter) if such
amendment, supplement, replacement, modification or waiver (A) subject to
Parents right to obtain substitute financing set forth in this _Section 7.13_
, reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by increasing
the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount) to an amount below
the amount needed (in combination with all funds held by or otherwise
available to Parent and Sub, including the cash on hand of the Company) to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (B) imposes
new or additional conditions to the initial funding of the Debt Financing or
otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of
the initial Debt Financing, or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any
other provision of the Debt Commitment Letter, in each case, in a manner that
would reasonably be expected to (x) delay or prevent or make less likely the
funding in full of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to
the Debt Financing) on the Closing Date, (y) adversely impact the ability of
Parent and Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or (z)
adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights with respect to
funding against other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive
agreements with respect thereto ( _provided_ , that Parent may amend the Debt
Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication

 



81  agents or similar entities so long as such action would not reasonably be
expected to delay or prevent or make less likely the Acceptance Time, Closing
or Parents ability to consummate the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the
conditions to the Debt Financing)). Parent shall promptly deliver to the
Company true, complete and correct copies of any such amendment, supplement,
modification or replacement (including, all such amendments, supplements,
modifications or replacements that are permitted hereunder).

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable
best efforts (A) to, subject to Parents right to obtain substitute financing
set forth in this _Section 7.13_ , maintain in full force and effect the Debt
Commitment Letter, (B) to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with
respect to the Debt Commitment Letter (the " _Debt Financing Agreements_ ") on
the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including
any "market flex" provisions related thereto) or on other terms that are on
terms no less favorable, in all material respects to Parent and Sub than the
terms and conditions (including any "market flex" provisions related thereto)
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter, or, if available, obtain alternative
financing on other terms that are acceptable to Parent, _provided_ , that (i)
Parent promptly provides notice to the Company of such other terms (in the
case of the fee letters, with only the fee amounts, pricing, "market flex"
provisions and other economic terms that do not adversely affect the
enforceability, availability or conditionality of, or the aggregate amount of
proceeds available under, the Debt Financing contained therein redacted) or
such alternative financing, and (ii) such other terms or the terms of such
alternative financing are (x) in respect of certainty of funding, equivalent
in all material respects to (or more favorable to Parent, Sub and the Company
than) the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on
the date hereof and (y) no less beneficial in any material respect to Parent
in terms of its ability to enforce its rights against the other parties to the
Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof or the definitive
agreements with respect thereto, (C) to satisfy on a timely basis (or obtain
the waiver of), and in a manner that will not adversely impede the ability of
the parties to consummate the Offer or the Merger, all conditions to receipt
of the full amount of the Debt Financing at the Closing set forth therein that
are within its control and, upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter, to consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to
the Closing, (D) to comply with its obligations under the Debt Commitment
Letter, and (E) to consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Effective
Time. Parent and Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to enforce
their rights with respect to funding under, and cause the Financing Sources,
lenders and the other persons providing or committing to provide the Debt
Financing to comply with their obligations with respect to funding under the
Debt Commitment Letter and definitive financing agreements and to fund on or
before the Effective Time the Debt Financing. Parent shall keep the Company
informed on a current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its
efforts to arrange the Debt Financing, including, as the Companys request,
promptly providing copies of all executed definitive agreements for the Debt
Financing Agreements.

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent agrees to notify the Company
promptly, after obtaining Knowledge thereof (and in any event within two (2)
Business Days after obtaining Knowledge thereof), if at any time prior to the
Closing Date (i) the Debt Commitment Letter expires or is terminated for any
reason, (ii) Parent becomes aware of, or receives any written notice or other
written communication from any Person with respect to, any actual or potential
material breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the

 



82  Debt Commitment Letter or any Debt Financing Agreement or any provisions of
the Debt Commitment Letter or any Debt Financing Agreement, (iii) if for any
reason Parent or Sub believes in good faith that it will not be able to
obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing required (together with
available cash on hand of the Parent, Sub and the Company) for Parent and Sub
to pay all of the cash amounts required to be provided by Parent, Sub and the
Company for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iv) a counterparty indicates in writing or orally that it will not
provide, or it refuses to provide, all or any portion of the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms set forth therein.
Parent shall promptly provide any information reasonably requested by the
Company relating to any circumstances referred to in this _Section 7.13(c)_ ;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event will Parent be under any
obligation to disclose (x) any ordinary course negotiations with respect to
the terms of the Financing and (y) any information shared among Parent and its
professional advisors in connection with matters contemplated by this
_Section 7.13(c)_ that is subject to attorney-client or similar privilege if
Parent shall have used its reasonable best efforts to disclose such
information in a way that would not waive such privilege. Parent shall not,
nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, without the prior written
consent of the Company, take any action or enter into any transaction that
could reasonably be expected to impair, delay or prevent consummation of all
or any portion of the Debt Financing. Without limiting Parents other
obligations under this _Section 7.13(c)_ , if the commitments with respect to
all or any portion of the Debt Financing expire or are terminated or all or
any portion of the Debt Financing otherwise becomes unavailable or it becomes
reasonably likely that any portion of the Debt Financing may become
unavailable to Parent on the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter, and such portion of the Debt Financing are reasonably
required to consummate the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby,
then Parent shall (x) promptly notify the Company of such event and the
reasons therefor, (y) use reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, at
its sole expense, in replacement thereof alternative financing from the same
or alternative financing sources in an amount sufficient to pay all amounts
required to be paid by Parent and Sub in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event (the " _Alternative Debt Financing_ "), and (z)
obtain, and when obtained, promptly provide the Company with a true, correct
and complete copy of each alternative financing commitment in respect of such
Alternative Debt Financing (" _New Debt Commitment Letter_ "), together with
all related fee letters and associated engagement letters (solely in the case
of the fee letters, with only the fee amounts, pricing, "market flex"
provisions and other economic terms that do not adversely affect the
enforceability, availability or conditionality of, or the aggregate amount of
proceeds available under, the Debt Financing contained therein redacted).
Parents obligations under the foregoing sentence in this _Section 7.13(c)_
shall apply to any other Alternative Debt Financing. In the event any New Debt
Commitment Letter is obtained, (i) any reference in this Agreement to the
"Debt Financing" shall include the debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to clause (ii) below, (ii) any
reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Commitment Letter" shall be deemed
to include the Debt Commitment Letter which is not superseded by a New Debt
Commitment Letter at the time in question and each New Debt Commitment Letter
to the extent then in effect, and (iii) any reference in this Agreement
to "fee letter" shall be deemed to include any fee letter relating to the
Debt Commitment Letter that is not superseded by any New Debt Commitment
Letter at the time in question and each fee letter relating to New Debt
Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect.

 



83 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Parents
obligations under this Agreement are not subject to a condition regarding
Parents or any of its Affiliates obtaining funds to consummate the Offer,
the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(e) On the Closing Date, Parent shall provide all funds required to effect the
repayment of all indebtedness under the Company Credit Agreement in full in
accordance with the Company Credit Agreement, subject to compliance with
_Section 7.14(a)(x)_.

Section 7.14  _Financing Cooperation_.

(a) Subject to _Section 7.14(b)_ , _(c)_ and _(d)_ , prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to provide, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries
Representatives to provide, at Parents sole cost and expense, to Parent such
cooperation as may reasonably be requested by Parent in connection with the
Debt Financing including, without limitation, (i) participation, upon
reasonable advance notice, by senior management in a reasonable number of
meetings, presentations, sessions with rating agencies, drafting sessions and
due diligence sessions at times and in locations reasonably acceptable to the
Company, (ii) furnishing Parent and its Representatives with all Financing
Information and, to the extent reasonably available to the Company, other
financial and other material information not otherwise available to Parent
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries, including any such customary
information contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter to be delivered after
the date of this Agreement, as is necessary or customary and as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the Debt Financing, in each case, as
and when it becomes available (in the case of the Financing Information, at
the times required by the Debt Commitment Letter), (iii) reasonably assisting
Parent and its Financing Sources (to the extent relating to the Company and
its Subsidiaries) in the preparation of customary rating agency presentations,
syndication documents and materials, information memoranda, lender
presentations and similar marketing documents to be used, in connection with
the Debt Financing, including providing customary authorization letters
related thereto, (iv) assisting in the preparation of definitive financing
documents, as may be reasonably requested by Parent, (v) facilitating the
pledging of collateral for the Debt Financing, (vi) using commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such material consents, approvals, authorizations
and instruments which may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection
with the Debt Financing and collateral arrangements, including, without
limitation, customary payoff letters, releases of liens, instruments of
termination or discharge, legal opinions, surveys and title insurance, (vii)
using commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the syndication efforts
for the Debt Financing benefit from the Companys existing lending and banking
relationships, (viii) using commercially reasonable efforts in assisting
Parent in its efforts to obtain corporate credit or family ratings of Parent,
(ix) to the extent reasonably requested by Parent, subject to customary
confidentiality agreements, cooperate with reasonable due diligence
requests from the Financing Sources, including as promptly as practicable
after reasonable request thereof, furnishing the Financing Sources with
reasonable documents or other information reasonably requested by the
Financing Sources relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries required by
bank regulatory

 



84  authorities with respect to the Debt Financing under applicable "know your
customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the
U.S.A. Patriot Act of 2011, (x) obtaining a customary repayment notice,
payoff letter and other customary payoff and release documentation and
authorizations on or prior to the Closing Date of all obligations under the
Company Credit Agreement; and (xi) using commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with Parent to satisfy the conditions precedent to the Debt
Financing to the extent reasonably requested by Parent and within the control
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and using commercially reasonable
efforts to take all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the
Closing, reasonably requested by Parent to permit the consummation of the Debt
Financing; _provided_ , _however_ , that, no obligation of the Company under
any agreement, certificate, document or instrument shall be effective until
the Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company
shall ensure that all financial and other projections concerning the Company
and its Subsidiaries that are made available to Parent by the Company after
the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing are prepared in good faith
and, prior to the earlier of the Closing Date and the termination of this
Agreement, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to provide to
Parent and its Financing Sources such information as may be necessary so that
the Financing Information provided by the Company (other than projections,
budgets, estimates and other forward-looking information or information of a
general economic or general industry nature) is, when taken as a whole,
complete and correct in all material respects and does not and will not, taken
as a whole, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary to make the statements contained therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which such statements are made, not
materially misleading. The Company consents to the use of all of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_ that
such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to, and is not
reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or the reputation or goodwill of the Company, its Subsidiaries and its or
their respective marks, products, services, offerings or intellectual property
rights. Nothing contained in this _Section 7.14_ or otherwise shall require
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, prior to the Closing, to be an issuer
or other obligor with respect to the Debt Financing. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties agree that the Tender Offer
Condition set forth in clause _(v)(d)_ of _Annex A_ , as applied to the
Companys obligations under this _Section 7.14(a)_ , shall be deemed satisfied
unless the Debt Financing has not been obtained as a direct and primary result
of the Companys Knowing and Intentional Breach of its obligations under
_Section 7.14(a)_ as determined in a final, non-appealable judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction.

(b) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives (collectively, the "
_Financing Indemnitees_ ") as applicable, in connection with the Debt
Financing or the cooperation of the Financing Indemnitees, as applicable,
contemplated by this _Section 7.14_. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Financing Indemnitees from and against any and all losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses (including attorneys fees), awards, judgments and
penalties suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the Debt
Financing and any information used in connection therewith or providing the
assistance contemplated by this _Section 7.14_ , in each case except to the
extent any of the foregoing arise from the Financing Indemnitees bad faith,
fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct, as finally

 



85  determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (the obligations of Parent
in this sentence, the " _Financing Cooperation Indemnity_ "). The Financing
Cooperation Indemnity shall survive the consummation of the Merger and any
termination of this Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (x) neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take or permit
the taking of any action that would (A) unreasonably interfere with the
business or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) cause
any representation or warranty or covenant in this Agreement to be breached
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or cause the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to become unable to satisfy any Tender Offer Condition, (C)
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates to pay (or agree to pay) any fees, or reimburse any expenses prior
to the Closing for which it is not promptly reimbursed, or otherwise incur any
other obligations or give any indemnities prior to the Closing that are not
contingent on the Closing (D) cause any director, officer, employee or
stockholder of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any personal
liability, (E) conflict with the organizational documents of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any applicable material Laws, (F) result in the
contravention or breach of, or default under, any material Contract to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, (G) provide access to or
disclose information that would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or that would be prohibited by
applicable Law or legal proceeding, or (H) prepare separate financial
statements for any Subsidiary of the Company or change any fiscal period or
prepare any financial statements or information that are not available to it
and prepared in the ordinary course of its financial reporting practice; (y)
none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors or officers shall be obligated to adopt resolutions or execute
consents to approve or authorize the execution of the Debt Financing;
_provided_ that this clause (y) shall not prohibit the adoption or execution
of any resolutions or consents effective no earlier than the Closing Date
(after giving effect to the Closing) by any persons that shall remain or will
become officers or directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of
the Effective Time; and (z) any documentation executed by the Company of any
of its Subsidiaries shall not become effective until the Effective Time.

(d) Parent acknowledges and agrees that, other than reasonable outofpocket
costs and expense subject to reimbursement pursuant to this _Section 7.14_ ,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries and Representatives shall have
any responsibility for, or incur any liability to, any Person under, any Debt
Financing that Parent may raise in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any cooperation provided pursuant to this
_Section 7.14_. All nonpublic or otherwise confidential information
regarding the Company or any of its Affiliates and Subsidiaries obtained by
Parent or its Affiliates or Representatives pursuant to this _Section 7.14_
shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement
or customary confidential undertakings in connection with the Debt Financing.

Section 7.15  _Approval of the Merger_. The Merger shall be governed by
Section 251(h) of the DGCL and shall be effected by Parent, Sub and the
Company as soon as practicable following the Acceptance Time without a
stockholders meeting or a vote of stockholders pursuant to Section 251(h) of
the DGCL.

consideration payable by Parent and Sub pursuant to this Agreement, as
of immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer as though made on or as
of such date (other than those representations and warranties that address

respect to such period), (y) set forth in _Section 6.1(a)_ , _Section 6.2_ and
_Section 6.8_ shall not be true and correct in all material respects as of the
date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as if made on and as of the
Closing Date (unless any such representation or warranty addresses matters
only as of a particular date or with respect to a specific period in which
event such representation or warranty shall be so true and correct in all
material respects only as of such particular date or with respect to such
specific period), or (z) set forth in this Agreement, other than those
Sections specifically identified in clauses (x) or (y) of this
_Section 9.1(c)(i)_ , shall not be true and correct as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Closing Date (unless any such representation or
warranty addresses matters only as of a particular date or with respect to a
specific period in which event such representation or warranty shall be true
and correct only as of such particular date or with respect to such specific
period), except, in the case of this clause (z), where the failure to be so
true and correct (without giving effect to any limitation as to
"materiality", "Parent Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualifications as
set forth therein) would not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, or (assuming that the date of such
determination is the Closing Date) if Parent or Sub shall not have performed
in all material respects all of the respective obligations hereunder required
to be performed by Parent or Sub, as the case may be, at or prior to the
Closing;  _provided_ , that if such breach is reasonably capable of being
cured by Parent and Sub through the exercise of their reasonable best efforts

 



88  within the earlier of (A) the forty-five (45) day period following
notification by the Company to Parent of such breach or inaccuracy or (B) the
then-scheduled expiration date of the Offer ( _provided_ , for purposes of
this clause (B), Parent may extend the expiration date of the Offer up to the
forty-fifth day after the notice contemplated by clause (A) in order to extend
the cure period to forty-five days, _provided_ that Parent may not extend the
expiration date of the Offer beyond the Termination Date), and in each case
Parent and Sub continue to exercise such reasonable best efforts, the Company
may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.1(c)(i)_  prior to the
expiration of such period; _provided_ _further_ that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this _Section 9.1(c)(i)_ shall not be available to the
Company if it has failed to perform in any material respect any of its
obligations under or in connection with this Agreement or is in breach of any
representation or warranty such that the conditions set forth in clauses
_(v)(c)_ or _(v)(d)_ of _Annex A_ would not be satisfied; or

 

(ii) prior to the Acceptance Time, if all of the following occur: (A) the
Company shall have received a Superior Proposal; (B) the Company shall have
complied in all material respects with its obligations under _Section 7.3(e)_
in order to accept a Superior Proposal in compliance with _Section 7.3_ ; (C)
the board of directors of the Company approves, and the Company substantially
concurrently with the termination of this Agreement, enters into, a definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; and (D) prior to or
substantially concurrently with such termination, the Company pays to the
Parent the amounts contemplated by _Section 9.2(b)_.

(d) by Parent:

 

(i) upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of the Company, or
if any representation or warranty of the Company shall be untrue, in any case
such that the events set forth in clauses _(v)(c)_ or _(v)(d)_ of _Annex A_
shall have occurred; _provided_ , that if such breach is reasonably capable of
being cured by the Company through the exercise of its reasonable best
efforts during the forty-five (45) day period following notification by Parent
to the Company of such breach or inaccuracy and the Company continues to
exercise such reasonable best efforts, Parent may not terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 9.1(d)(i)_ prior to the expiration of such
period; _provided_ _further_ that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this _Section 9.1(d)(i)_ shall not be available to Parent if it has failed to
perform in any material respect any of its obligations under or in connection
with this Agreement or if any of the representations and warranties of Parent
and the Sub (assuming that the date of such determination is the Closing
Date) (x) set forth in _Section 6.3_ shall not be true and correct except for
inaccuracies that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, result in more than a de minimis impact on
the aggregate consideration payable by Parent and Sub pursuant to this
Agreement, as of immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer as though
made on or as of such date (other than those representations and warranties
that address matters only as of a particular date or only with respect to

 



89  a specified period of time, which need only be true and correct as of such
date or with respect to such period), (y) set forth in _Section 6.1(a)_ ,
_Section 6.2_ and _Section 6.8_  shall not be true and correct in all
material respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date
as if made on and as of the Closing Date (unless any such representation or
warranty addresses matters only as of a particular date or with respect to a
specific period in which event such representation or warranty shall be so
true and correct in all material respects only as of such particular date or
with respect to such specific period), or (z) set forth in this
Agreement, other than those Sections specifically identified in clauses (x)
or (y) of this _Section 9.1(d)(i)_ , shall not be true and correct as of the
date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date (unless any such
representation or warranty addresses matters only as of a particular date or
with respect to a specific period in which event such representation or
warranty shall be true and correct only as of such particular date or with
respect to such specific period), except, in the case of this clause (z),
where the failure to be so true and correct (without giving effect to any
limitation as to "materiality", "Parent Material Adverse Effect" or similar
qualifications as set forth therein) would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect; or

(ii) prior to the Acceptance Time, if either of the following occur: (A) a
Change of Recommendation shall have occurred or been otherwise publicly
disclosed, or (B) the Company shall have committed a Knowing and Intentional
Breach of its obligations under _Section 7.3_.

 

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination._

 

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 9.1_ , written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other
party or parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such
termination is made (other than in the case of termination pursuant to
_Section 9.1(a)_ ), and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void,
and there shall be no damages or liability on the part of Parent, Sub or the
Company or their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders,
Representatives, agents or advisors other than, with respect to Parent, Sub
and the Company, the obligations pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement,
the Financing Cooperation Indemnity set forth in _Section 7.14(b)_ , this
_Section 9.2_ , and _Article X_. Nothing contained in this _Section 9.2_ shall
relieve Parent, Sub or the Company from liability for fraud or a Knowing and
Intentional Breach of this Agreement.

(b) If, but only if,

 

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
9.1(c)(ii)_ ,

 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(ii)_ ,
or

 

(iii) (A) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ as a result of the failure to satisfy the

 



90  Minimum Condition prior to such termination, (B) there has been received
after the date of this Agreement and not withdrawn or publicly disclosed prior
to the termination of this Agreement an Acquisition Proposal and (C) within
twelve (12) months after such termination, either (1) the Company enters into
a definitive agreement with respect to a Qualifying Transaction, which is
subsequently consummated, or (2) a Qualifying Transaction is consummated,

then the Company shall pay to Parent a termination fee of forty-seven million
eight hundred thousand dollars ($47,800,000) in cash,

(iv) concurrently with any termination pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_ ;

 

(v) within three (3) Business Days following any termination pursuant to
_Section 9.1(d)(ii)_ ; and

 

(vi) within three (3) Business Days after the consummation of a Qualifying
Transaction following a termination of this Agreement under the circumstances
set forth in _Section 9.2(b)(iii)_ ;

it being understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay
the fee referred to in this _Section 9.2(b)_ on more than one occasion. Upon
payment of such fee, the Company shall have no further liability to Parent or
Sub with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, 
_provided_ , that nothing herein shall release any party from liability for
fraud or a Knowing and Intentional Breach of this Agreement.

 

(c) All payments contemplated by this _Section 9.2_ shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent
and shall be reduced by any amounts required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under applicable Law in respect of Taxes. If the Company fails to
timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 9.2_ , or any portion
thereof, (i) such amount or portion shall accrue interest from the date such
payment was required to be made through the date of payment at the Prime Rate
in effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus five percent
(5%) and (ii) the Company shall pay to Parent its out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with any suit that results
in a judgment against the Company in respect of the amount set forth in
_Section 9.2_  or any portion thereof.

Agreement or the actions of Parent, Sub or the Company in the negotiation,
administration, performance and enforcement hereof or thereof, shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of

accordance with the laws of the State of New York (except as otherwise
provided in the Debt Commitment Letter), without giving effect to any choice
of law or conflicts of laws rules or provisions (whether of the State of New
York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws
of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York; _provided_ , that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that any

94 Section 10.9 _Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto hereby (i) expressly and irrevocably submits to
the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the
Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any United States federal
court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court) in the
event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave
from any such court, and (iii) agrees that it will not bring any action
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in any court other than the Delaware Court of Chancery and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the
Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any United States federal court
located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court); _provided_ ,
that each of the parties shall have the right to bring any action or
proceeding for enforcement of a judgment entered by any United States federal
court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court in any

the performance thereof or the definitive documentation for the Debt Financing
(and the termination hereof and thereof) or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York,

with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby by mailing copies

receipt requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant to _Section
10.3_. However, the foregoing shall not limit the right of a party to effect
service of process on the other party by any other legally available method.

 

Section 10.11 _Specific Performance; Remedies_.

 

(a) The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the failure of any party to
perform its agreements and covenants hereunder, including its failure to take
all actions as are necessary on its part to consummate the Offer and the
Merger, will cause irreparable injury to the non-breaching parties, for which
damages, even if available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly,
each party hereby consents to the granting of injunctive relief by any

 



95  court of competent jurisdiction to prevent breaches of this Agreement, to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, and to compel
performance of such partys obligations (including the taking of such actions
as are required of such party to consummate the Offer and the Merger), this
being in addition to any other remedy to which any party is entitled under
this Agreement. The parties further agree to waive any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with any such remedy, and that
such remedy shall be in addition to any other remedy to which a party is
entitled at law or in equity.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Company
Related Party (other than Parent and Sub) shall have any rights or claims
against any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Debt
Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and no Financing
Source shall have any rights or claims against any Company Related Party
(other than Parent or Sub) in connection with this Agreement, the Debt
Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law
or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise; provided that, following the
Closing and the consummation of the Debt Financing, the foregoing will not
limit any rights the Financing Sources have against the Company and its
Subsidiaries (after giving effect to the Merger) under the Debt Commitment
Letter.

interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties, except that the Parent and/or Sub may assign
this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent without the consent of the Company; _provided_ that Parent and/or Sub,
as the case may be, shall remain liable for all of its obligations under this
Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their
respective permitted successors and assigns. Any assignment in violation of
this _Section 10.12_ shall be null and void.

 

Section 10.13 _Expenses_. Subject to _Section 9.2(c),_ all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the
party incurring such costs and expenses, whether or not the Offer, the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby is consummated.

Section 10.14 _Headings_. Headings of the articles and sections of this
Agreement and the table of contents, schedules and exhibits are for
convenience of the parties only and shall be given no substantive or
interpretative effect whatsoever.

 

Section 10.15 _Waivers_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party or parties entitled
to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party
granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon
strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition
shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent
or other failure.

 



96 Section 10.16 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, SUB AND THE COMPANY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,

CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE DEBT FINANCING AND ANY
RELATED COMMITMENT LETTER OR FEE LETTERS RELATED THERETO) OR THE ACTIONS OF
PARENT, SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE
AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE

the case of this clause (IV), where the failure to be so true and correct

deemed a waiver of any such right; the waiver of any such right with respect
to particular facts and other circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with
respect to any other facts and circumstances; and each such right shall be
deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to
time.

forth in the Agreement to which it is attached.
