<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>WHEREAS</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, the Sellers own all the issued and outstanding shares (the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Shares</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") of Altitun AB (publ), a Swedish corporation ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Altitun</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), and desire to sell the Shares to
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement as hereinafter provided; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>WHEREAS</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, Purchaser desires to acquire the Shares from Sellers pursuant to this Agreement as hereinafter provided; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>WHEREAS</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, for United States financial reporting purposes the parties intend that the transaction shall be accounted for as a "pooling of
interests." The Sellers have delivered to Purchaser an opinion letter from Altitun's independent accountants, Lindebergs Grant Thornton LLP, addressed to Altitun, stating that, based on its
familiarity with Altitun, Altitun will qualify as a party to a pooling-of-interests transaction under Opinion 16 of the Accounting Principles Board and applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (collectively, "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Opinion 16</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). Purchaser has delivered to Sellers an opinion letter from its
independent accountants, Arthur Andersen LLP, addressed to Purchaser, stating that, as of the date of such letter, based on its familiarity with Purchaser, Purchaser will qualify as a party to a
pooling-of-interests transaction under Opinion 16; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>WHEREAS</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, it is the intent of the parties that the acquisition of Altitun will not qualify as a tax-free reorganization
pursuant to Section&nbsp;368(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and as part of the plan of acquisition of Altitun, for Purchaser to transfer Shares representing 49% of the
voting power of Altitun to affiliates of Purchaser immediately upon the close of the acquisition of the Shares, and for Purchaser to transfer the remaining Shares representing 51% of the voting power
of Altitun to affiliates of Purchaser on or after January&nbsp;1, 2001; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>WHEREAS</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, the parties hereto desire to set forth certain representations, warranties and covenants made by each to the other as an
inducement to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and to set forth certain additional agreements related to the transactions contemplated hereby; </FONT></P>

in Rule&nbsp;501(a) of Regulation&nbsp;D promulgated under the Securities Act, or if not, such Seller, either alone or with such Seller's representative, has such knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters that such Seller is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment in the
Purchaser Stock and is able to bear the economic consequences thereof. In making such Seller's decision to invest in the Purchaser Stock, such Seller has relied upon independent investigations made by
such Seller and, to the extent believed by such Seller to be appropriate, such Seller's representatives, including such Seller's own professional, tax and other advisors, and has not relied upon any
representation or warranty from Purchaser, or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates or representatives, with respect to the value of the Purchaser Stock. Purchaser has not made
any representation, warranty, acknowledgement or covenant, in writing or otherwise, to such Seller regarding the tax consequences, if any, of the sale of the Shares or of the resale of the Purchaser
Stock by such Seller. Such Seller and such Seller's representatives have been given a full opportunity to examine all documents and to ask questions of, and to receive answers from, Purchaser and its
representatives concerning, the terms of the sale of the Shares to Purchaser, such Seller's investment in the Purchaser Stock and the business of Purchaser and such other information as such Seller
desires in order to evaluate an investment in the Purchaser Stock, and all such questions have been answered to the full satisfaction of such Seller. Such Seller has evaluated the merits and risks of
an investment in the Purchaser Stock and has determined that the Purchaser Stock are a suitable investment for such Seller in light of such Seller's overall financial condition and prospects. Such
Seller has been advised, and is aware, that the market prices of shares of stock of publicly traded companies fluctuate and that there can be no assurance as to the future performance of any given
securities, including shares of Purchaser Stock. Such Seller has been furnished with all publicly available information about Purchaser's assets, operations, and business activities which such Seller
has requested and which such Seller considers necessary or relevant to enable such Seller to make a prudent decision about the sale of such Seller's Shares to Purchaser and such Seller's acquisition
of the Purchaser Stock. </FONT></P>

which the tax liability of the Indemnified Party (or group of corporations including the Indemnified Party) is reduced within one year of making the Claim (including, without limitation, by deduction,
reduction of income, by virtue of increased tax basis or otherwise, entitlement to refund, credit or otherwise) plus any related interest received from the relevant taxing authority. Where an
Indemnified Party has other losses, deductions, credits or items available to it, the Tax Benefit from any losses, deductions, credits or items relating to the Claim shall be deemed to be realized
proportionately with any other losses, deductions, credits or items. For purposes of this Section&nbsp;11.04(e), a Tax Benefit is "currently realizable" to the extent it can in fact be realized in
the current taxable period or year or in any tax return with respect thereto (including through a carryback to a prior taxable period) or in any taxable period or year prior to the date of the Claim.
In the event that there should be a determination disallowing the Tax Benefit, the Indemnitor shall be liable to refund to the Indemnified Party the amount of any related reduction previously allowed
