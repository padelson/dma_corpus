No investigation or review by any Governmental Entity (other than tax audits in the ordinary course of Purchaser\'s business) with respect to Purchaser is pending or, to Purchaser\'s Knowledge, threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated in writing to Purchaser an intention to conduct the same. Purchaser is not in default with respect to any order, writ, injunction or decree known to or served upon Purchaser, except where any default has not had and will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

The Shares being purchased by Purchaser are being acquired for investment for Purchaser\'s own account, not as a nominee or agent, and not with a view to the resale or distribution of any part thereof, and Purchaser has no present intention of selling, granting any participation in, or otherwise distributing the same. By executing this Agreement, Purchaser further represents that it does not have any contract, undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any Person to sell, transfer or grant participations to such Person or to any third Person, with respect to any of the Shares.

 Section 5.13. No Misleading Statements. This Agreement and the schedules hereto do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact by Purchaser and do not omit to state any material fact necessary to make any of the statements by Purchaser contained herein or therein not misleading.

 (a) The business of Altitun shall be conducted only in, and Altitun shall not take any action except in, the ordinary course of Altitun\'s business, on an arm\'s-length basis and in accordance in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and Altitun\'s past custom and practice; 

  

    

 (b) Altitun shall not cancel or terminate its current insurance policies or cause any of the coverage thereunder to lapse, unless simultaneously with such termination, cancellation or lapse, replacement policies providing coverage equal to or greater than the coverage under the canceled, terminated or lapsed policies for, to the extent feasible, substantially similar premiums are in full force and effect; 

  

 (c) Altitun shall (i) use its best efforts to preserve intact Altitun\'s business organization and goodwill, keep available the services of Altitun\'s officers and employees as a group and maintain satisfactory relationships with suppliers, distributors, customers and others having business relationships with Altitun; (ii) confer on a regular and frequent basis with representatives of Purchaser to report operational matters and the general status of ongoing operations; (iii) not intentionally take any action which would render, or which reasonably may be expected to render, any representation or warranty made by Sellers in this Agreement untrue at the Closing; and (iv) notify Purchaser of any emergency or other change in the normal course of Altitun\'s business or in the operation of Altitun\'s properties and of any governmental or third party complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications indicating that the same may be contemplated); 

  

 (d) Altitun (for purposes of this Section 6.01(d), all references to Altitun shall include the Affiliates, and any former Subsidiaries and Affiliates, of Altitun) shall file (or cause to be filed) at its own expense, on or prior to the due date, all Tax Returns for all Tax periods ending on or before the Closing where the due date for such Tax Returns or reports (taking into account valid extensions of the respective due dates) falls on or before the Closing (all Tax Returns described in this Section 6.01(d) and any schedules to be included therewith shall be prepared on a basis consistent with those of Altitun prepared for prior Tax periods); _provided, however_ , that Altitun shall not file any such Tax Returns, or other returns, elections, claims for refund or information statements with respect to any liabilities for Taxes (other than federal, state or local sales, use, withholding or employment tax returns or statements) for any Tax period, or consent to any adjustment or otherwise compromise or settle any matters with respect to Taxes, without prior consultation with and approval by Purchaser. Altitun shall provide Purchaser with a copy of appropriate workpapers, schedules, drafts and final copies of each federal and state income Tax Return or election of Altitun at least ten days before filing such return or election and shall reasonably cooperate with any request by Purchaser in connection therewith; 

   

 (e) Altitun shall not (i) make or rescind any express or deemed election or take any other discretionary position relating to Taxes, (ii) settle or compromise any claim, action, suit, litigation, proceeding, arbitration, investigation, audit or controversy relating to Taxes, or (iii) change any of its methods of reporting income or deductions for income Tax purposes from those employed in the preparation of the Tax Returns for the taxable year ended December 31, 1999; 

  

 (f) Altitun shall not change any of its methods of accounting in effect at December 31, 1999, other than those required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles; and 

  

 (g) Altitun shall not perform any act referenced by (or omit to perform any act which omission is referenced by) the terms of Section 4.12 hereof. 

  

  

 Section 6.02. Access to Books and Records. Between the date hereof and the Closing, Altitun shall afford to Purchaser and its authorized representatives (the "Purchaser Representatives") full access at all reasonable times and upon reasonable notice to the offices, properties, books, records, officers, employees and other items of Altitun, and the work papers of Altitun\'s independent accountants, and otherwise provide such assistance as is reasonably requested by Purchaser in order that Purchaser may have a full opportunity to make such investigation and evaluation as it shall reasonably desire to make of the business and affairs of Altitun. In addition, Altitun and its officers and directors shall cooperate fully (including providing introductions where necessary) with Purchaser 

   to enable Purchaser to contact such third parties, including customers,
prospective customers, specifying agencies, vendors or suppliers of Altitun,
as Purchaser deems reasonably necessary.

  

ARTICLE VII. 
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

  

 Section 7.01. Nonsolicitation. 

  

 (a) Each Seller agrees that, except as set forth in Section 7.01(b), during the period beginning on the Closing and ending on the date which is three (3) years after the Closing (the "Term"), Seller will not, directly or indirectly, as employee, agent, consultant, principal or otherwise, (i) seek to influence or alter the relationship between Altitun and any Person to whom Altitun provided services or to whom Altitun made a presentation related to the business of Altitun at any time during the one-year period immediately preceding the Closing or during the Term, or (ii) solicit for employment or other services or hire or otherwise seek to influence or alter the relationship between Altitun and any Person who is or was an employee of Altitun at any time during the one-year period immediately preceding the Closing or during the Term, except on behalf of Altitun or Purchaser; _provided, however_ , that general solicitation or hire shall not constitute a breach of this covenant so long as Seller shall not offer employment to any such employee of Altitun within six (6) months following the termination of such employee\'s employment by Altitun. 

  

 (b) The provisions of Section 7.01(a) shall not apply with respect to any Person owned wholly or partially (each a "Portfolio Company") by any of the Sellers listed in Schedule 7.01(b) (the "VC-Sellers"); _provided, however_ , that no VC-Seller shall be allowed to encourage or otherwise participate in the recruitment efforts or hiring of any Portfolio Company with respect to any employee of Altitun. 

  

 Section 7.02. Confidentiality. Following the Closing, each Seller shall strictly maintain the confidentiality of all information, documents and materials relating to Altitun, except to the extent disclosure of any such information is required by law or authorized by Purchaser. In the event that any Seller reasonably believes after consultation with counsel that he/she is required by law to disclose any confidential information described in this Section 7.02, such Seller will (i) provide Purchaser with prompt notice before such disclosure in order that Purchaser may attempt to obtain a protective order or other assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to confidential information and (ii) cooperate with Purchaser, at Purchaser\'s sole cost and expense, in attempting to obtain such order or assurance. The provisions of this Section 7.02 shall not apply to any information, documents or materials which are in the public domain or shall come into the public domain, other than by reason of default by any Seller of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 7.03. Remedies. Without limiting the right of Purchaser and Altitun to pursue all other legal and equitable rights available to them, including without limitation, damages for the actual or threatened violation of this Article VII by Sellers, it is agreed that other remedies cannot fully compensate Purchaser or Altitun for such a violation and that Purchaser and Altitun shall be entitled to injunctive relief and/or specific performance to prevent violation or continuing violation thereof. It is the intent and understanding of each party hereto that if, in any action before any court or agency legally empowered to enforce this Article VII, any term, restriction, covenant or promise in this Article VII is found to be unreasonable and for that reason unenforceable, then such term, restriction, covenant or promise shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to make it enforceable by such court or agency. 

  

 Section 7.04. Maintenance of Altitun. Except as set forth in the Recitals to this Agreement, Purchaser will not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the Shares or take any other action that would result in Purchaser not holding, beneficially and of record, Shares representing more than fifty percent (50%) of the total votes of Altitun from the Closing through and including December 31, 2000. 

     

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section shall prevent Purchaser
from merging into another company.

  

 Section 7.05. Change in Management. Immediately upon Closing, Purchaser shall cause extraordinary shareholders\' meetings of Altitun and the Subsidiaries to be held for purposes of electing new directors and auditors. Sellers covenant that the present directors and auditors will be removed from their positions without any claim for compensation or remuneration except for compensation in the ordinary course of business and that these directors will not exercise their formal authority to represent the respective companies. Purchaser covenants that the next ordinary shareholders\' meetings of Altitun and the Subsidiaries will pass the necessary resolutions whereby the present directors will be discharged from liability with respect to their administration of the respective entities\' affairs, _provided, however_ , that the such entities\' auditors have approved such discharge from liability. If requested by Purchaser, Sellers agree to cause general powers of attorney to be duly and validly issued in favour of persons appointed by Purchaser, which individuals shall have unlimited authority to represent Altitun and the Subsidiaries in all matters until the new Boards of Directors have been officially registered. 

  

 Section 7.06. Preparation of Registration Statement; Blue Sky Laws. As promptly as practicable and no later than 10 Business Days after the Closing, Purchaser shall prepare and file with the Commission a registration statement on Form S-3 with respect to the shares of Purchaser Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement (the "Registration Statement"). Purchaser shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to have such Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after filing. Each of Purchaser and the Sellers shall indemnify and hold harmless the other from any obligations, claims or liabilities arising from any statement supplied by such party for inclusion in the Registration Statement which, at the time such statement was made, is false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statement, in light of the circumstances under which is was made, not false or misleading. Purchaser shall also take any action required to be taken under any applicable provincial or state securities laws (including "Blue Sky" laws) in connection with the issuance of the Purchaser Stock pursuant to this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that Purchaser shall not be required to register or qualify as a foreign corporation or to take any action that would subject it to service of process in any jurisdiction where Purchaser is not now so subject, except as to matters and transactions arising solely from the offer and sale of Purchaser Stock. 

  

 Section 7.07. Additional Agreements, Cooperation.

 (b) Each of the parties hereto agrees, subject to compliance with applicable law, to furnish to each other party hereto such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other party may request in connection with its preparation of necessary filings or submissions to any Regulatory Authority or Governmental Entity, including, without limitation, any filing necessary under the provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any other United States federal or state, or foreign statute or regulation.

The Sellers shall promptly notify Purchaser if any such proposal or offer, or any inquiry from or contact with any Person with respect thereto, is made and shall promptly provide Purchaser with such information regarding such proposal, offer, inquiry or contact as Purchaser may request. In addition, from and after the date of this Agreement, until the earlier to occur of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms, the Sellers shall not, and shall cause Altitun and its directors, officers, employees, representatives, agents and affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, make or authorize any public statement, recommendation or solicitation in support of any proposal made by any Person or group (other than Purchaser) relating to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prohibit Sellers, Altitun or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives from maintaining existing relations related to the current plans for raising of capital for Altitun, which plans do not involve any transaction described above or that would otherwise cause a change of control of Altitun. 

  

 Section 7.09. Approvals and Consents. The Sellers shall, and shall cause Altitun to, use best efforts to obtain all consents and approvals, if any, required to be obtained by them or it to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including all consents, waivers or approvals under any of the Contracts in order to preserve the benefits thereunder for Altitun and otherwise, and will cooperate with Purchaser to obtain all such approvals and consents required of Purchaser.

Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser, on or prior to the Closing, an affiliate letter in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit 7.10(a)_, executed by each of the Company Pooling Affiliates identified in the foregoing list.

ARTICLE X.

 Section 10.01. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing: 

  

  

 (a) by the mutual consent of the parties hereto; 

  

 (b) by either Purchaser or the Sellers if there has been a material misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of covenant on the part of the other in the representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement, which breach has not been cured by such other party within thirty (30) days following receipt of notice thereof; 

  

 (c) by either Purchaser or the Sellers if the transactions contemplated hereby have not been consummated by June 12, 2000; _provided, that,_ neither Purchaser nor the Sellers will be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01(c) if such party\'s willful breach of this Agreement has prevented the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; or 

   

 (d) by Purchaser if, after the date hereof, there shall have been a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Altitun or if, after the date hereof, an event shall have occurred which, so far as reasonably can be foreseen, would result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to Altitun.

ARTICLE XI. 
INDEMNIFICATION

  

 Section 11.01. Sellers\' Promise to Indemnify. 

  

 (a) Each Seller agrees to, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchaser against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities and actions, and any reasonable legal or other expenses or costs incurred by Purchaser, Altitun and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and subsidiaries (collectively, the "Purchaser Indemnified Parties") in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, regardless of whether an action or claim has been filed or asserted against a Purchaser Indemnified Party after the Closing, caused by, arising or resulting from the following items (the "Purchaser Losses"): (i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by such Seller under this Agreement, including the Schedules hereto, or in any other agreement entered into in connection herewith or certificates or other documents delivered with the closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the "Related Documents"); (ii) any nonfulfillment of or failure to comply with any agreement, condition or covenant on the part of such Seller under this Agreement or any Related Documents; (iii) any Claim asserted by a third party against an Indemnified Party arising out of the actions or inactions of Altitun with respect to Altitun\'s business prior to the Closing; or (iv) any Tax liability of Altitun for periods up to and including the Closing to the extent that such Tax liability has not been reserved for in the Latest Financial Statements or reserved on the books of Altitun prior to the Closing. In the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and that are payable for a period that includes the Closing, the portion 

     

of such Tax which relates to the portion of such Taxable period ending on the
Closing shall (x) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon
or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for
the entire Taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of days in the Taxable period ending on the Closing and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Taxable period, and
(y) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts be
deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant Taxable
period ended on the Closing.

  

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 11.01(a) hereof, the parties hereto understand and agree that: (i) the representations relating to Sellers and their respective Shares in Sections 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, the last sentence of Section 4.14, 4.35, 4.36 and 4.37 are made severally by each Seller with respect to such Seller only and the Shares represented as being owned by such Seller, and each Seller does not make any representations with respect to the other Sellers and the Shares represented as being owned by the other Sellers, and (ii) each Seller shall severally, and not jointly, indemnify against any Purchaser Losses caused by a breach of such Seller of any of Sections 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, the last sentence of Section 4.14, 4.35, 4.36 and 4.37 and Sections 7.01, 7.02 and 7.16. 

  

 Section 11.02. Purchaser\'s Promise to Indemnify. Purchaser agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Seller against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities and actions, and any reasonable legal or other expenses or costs incurred by such Seller in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action regardless of whether an action or claim has been filed or asserted against such Seller after the Closing, caused by, arising or resulting from the following items (the "Seller Losses"): (a) a material loss in market value of the shares of Purchaser Stock held by the Sellers as a direct result of any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by Purchaser under this Agreement or any Related Documents; and (b) any nonfulfillment of or failure to comply with any agreement, condition or covenant on the part of Purchaser under this Agreement or any Related Documents. 

  

 Section 11.03. Procedure for Indemnification of Third Party Claims. 

   

 (a) Notice. Subject to the provisions of Sections 11.01 and 11.02 above, in the event any Claim for indemnification is made thereunder, if there is asserted by a third party any Claim that in the judgment of an Indemnified Party may give rise to any Purchaser Losses or Seller Losses ("Indemnified Losses"), or if the Indemnified Party determines the existence of a Claim, whether or not the same shall have been asserted, such Indemnified Party shall give the indemnifying party or parties (the "Indemnitor") notice within ten (10) Business Days of the assertion of any Claim or within twenty (20) days of receipt of notice of the filing of any lawsuit based upon such assertion, or, with respect to a Claim not yet asserted against the Indemnified Party, promptly upon the determination by an executive officer of the Indemnified Party of the existence of the same, which notice shall describe the Claim in reasonable detail, and shall include the amount (estimated if necessary) of the related Indemnified Loss. Failure by the Indemnified Party to give timely notice pursuant to this Section 11.03 shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations, except to the extent that the Indemnitor is actually materially prejudiced by such failure to give timely notice. 

  

 (b) Defense. The Indemnified Party shall permit the Indemnitor to assume the defense of such Claim and any litigation resulting therefrom (and to prosecute by way of counterclaim or third party complaint any claim against such third party arising out of or relating to the Claim in question) upon receipt by the Indemnified Party of the Indemnitor\'s written acknowledgment of its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to the Claim and agreement to assume the defense of all claims or counts of such Claim. After giving such written agreement, the Indemnitor shall not be liable under this Agreement for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with such defense but the Indemnitor shall be responsible for all such expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the Claim prior to the assumption of the defense by the 

     

Indemnitor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to conduct its own defense at the cost and expense of the Indemnitor
if the Indemnified Party can establish, by reasonable evidence, that the
conduct of its defense by the Indemnitor would reasonably be likely to
prejudice the Indemnified Party due to the nature of any claims or
counterclaims presented or by virtue of a conflict between the interest of the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor, and _provided further_ that in
any event the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at its own
expense. Counsel selected by the Indemnitor or by the Indemnified Party to
defend any Claim shall be subject to the reasonable approval of the other
party. If the Indemnitor fails to assume the defense of any such Claim as
provided above within a reasonable time (which shall be such period of time as
will not, in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party, result in
prejudice to the rights of the Indemnified Party) after due notice has been
given of a Claim, then until such time as the Indemnitor shall make such
assumption, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to prosecute and
conduct its own defense by counsel of its choice; _provided, however,_
that the Indemnified Party may not enter into any compromise or settlement
thereof without the consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Such defense shall be at the
cost and expense of the Indemnitor if the Indemnitor subsequently assumes such
defense as provided above, or if it is subsequently determined that the
Indemnitor is or was obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party with
respect to such Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if a Claim seeks
equitable relief or (ii) if the subject matter of a Claim relates to the
ongoing business of any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, which Claim, if
decided against any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, would have a
Material Adverse Effect on the ongoing business or reputation of any of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties, then, in each such case, the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties alone shall be entitled to, acting as a reasonable person
under similar circumstances, contest, defend and settle such Claim in the
first instance and, if the Purchaser Indemnified Parties do not contest,
defend or settle such Claim, the Sellers\' Representative shall then have the
right to contest and defend (but not settle) such Claim.

  

 (c) Settlement. The Indemnitor shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to the terms of any compromise or settlement of any Claim or litigation defended by the Indemnitor in accordance herewith (other than terms related solely to the payment of money damages and only after the Indemnitor has furnished the Indemnified Party with such evidence as the Indemnified Party may reasonably request of the Indemnitor\'s capacity to pay promptly the amount of such money damages at such times as provided in the compromise or settlement) which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Indemnitor shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or settlement of an action or portion of an action relating to the Indemnified Party which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of an unconditional release in respect of such Claim or litigation. If the Indemnitor chooses to defend any Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnitor and make available to the Indemnitor any personnel or any books, records or other documents within its control that are necessary or appropriate for such defense, _provided_ that such cooperation shall not unduly disrupt the operation of the business of the Indemnified Party or cause the Indemnified Party to waive any statutory or common law privileges, breach any confidentiality obligations owed to third parties or otherwise cause any trade secret or confidential information of such Indemnified Party to become public. The Indemnitor shall pay the Indemnified Party\'s actual and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with such cooperation. 

  

 Section 11.04. Limitations on Indemnification. The indemnification provided by Section 11.01 shall be satisfied exclusively from the Escrow Agreement, and any liability of any Seller under Section 11.08 shall initially be satisfied from the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the 

     

contrary in this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 11.04 shall operate
to limit the liability of an Indemnitor in respect of any Claim by
an Indemnified Party under or pursuant to this Agreement.

  

 (a) No Claim for breach of a representation or warranty shall be made unless written notice thereof shall have been given by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnitor within one (1) year from the date of the Closing. No Claim for a breach of a covenant or agreement to be performed prior to or at the Closing shall be made unless written notice thereof shall have been given by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnitor within six (6) months after the Closing. 

   

 (b) An Indemnitor shall be required to indemnify, defend and hold harmless an Indemnified Party with respect to Indemnified Losses incurred by such Indemnified Party arising or resulting from a breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty other than those contained in Sections 4.01 through 4.06, 4.24, 5.01 through 5.06 and 5.12 only: (i) if the amount of Indemnified Losses from an individual Claim is equal to or greater than SEK 1,000,000, and (ii) to the extent that the aggregate amount of all Indemnified Losses, for all Claims which satisfy the preceding clause (i) exceeds SEK 8,000,000, in which case only the excess over SEK 8,000,000 shall be subject to indemnification. 

  

 (c) The total aggregate liability of the Sellers for all breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall not exceed US$83,558,0001 if the Claim is in United States Dollars and SEK 743,666,200 if the Claim is in Swedish Kronor. The total aggregate liability of Purchaser for all breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall not exceed US$83,558,000 if the Claim is in United States Dollars and SEK 743,666,200 if the Claim is in Swedish Kronor.  1

 Determined as follows: number of outstanding Shares times Exchange Ratio times 60.75 times 10%. 
  

 (d) Any indemnity payment payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be decreased to the extent of any insurance proceeds received by the Indemnified Party in respect of the Indemnified Losses giving rise to such indemnity payment. 

  

 (e) If the amount with respect to which any Claim is made gives rise to a currently realizable direct Tax Benefit to the party making the Claim, the indemnity payment shall be reduced by the amount of the Tax Benefit available to the Indemnified Party making the Claim. To the extent such Claim does not give rise to a currently realizable direct Tax Benefit, but if the amount with respect to which such Claim is made gives rise to a subsequently realized Tax Benefit to the Indemnified Party that made the Claim, such Indemnified Party shall refund to the Indemnitor the amount of such Tax Benefit when, as and if realized. For the purposes of this Agreement, any subsequently realized Tax Benefit shall be treated as though it was a reduction in the amount of the initial Claim; _provided, however,_ no subsequently realized Tax Benefit shall require a payment to the Indemnitor merely because such Tax Benefit exceeds the initial Claim. For purposes of this Section 11.04(e), a "Tax Benefit" means an amount by which the tax liability of the Indemnified Party (or group of corporations including the Indemnified Party) is reduced within one year of making the Claim (including, without limitation, by deduction, reduction of income, by virtue of increased tax basis or otherwise, entitlement to refund, credit or otherwise) plus any related interest received from the relevant taxing authority. Where an Indemnified Party has other losses, deductions, credits or items available to it, the Tax Benefit from any losses, deductions, credits or items relating to the Claim shall be deemed to be realized proportionately with any other losses, deductions, credits or items. For purposes of this Section 11.04(e), a Tax Benefit is "currently realizable" to the extent it can in fact be realized in the current taxable period or year or in any tax return with respect thereto (including through a carryback to a prior taxable period) or in any taxable period or year prior to the date of the Claim. In the event that there should be a determination disallowing the Tax Benefit, the Indemnitor shall be liable to refund to the Indemnified Party the amount of any related reduction previously allowed or payments previously made to the Indemnitor pursuant to this Section 11.04(e). The amount of the refunded reduction or payment shall be deemed a payment under this Section 11.04(e) and thus shall be paid subject to any applicable reductions under this Section 11.04(e). 

     

 (f) The parties agree that any indemnification payments made by Purchaser or Sellers pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated for tax purposes as an adjustment to the consideration unless otherwise required by applicable Law. 

  

 Section 11.05 Satisfaction of Indemnification Obligations. Any shares of Purchaser Stock transferred for the purpose of satisfying a Claim shall be deemed to have a value equal to US$60.75 if the Claim is in United States Dollars and SEK 541 if the Claim is in Swedish Kronor. Sellers and Purchaser shall have the right to satisfy any liability under Section 11.08 with Purchaser Stock, at the value agreed in this Section 11.05. 

  

 Section 11.06 No Rescission Right. No party hereto shall be entitled to any remedy, including in connection with an action under Section 11.08, that would result in a rescission, termination or cancellation of this Agreement or the unwinding of the transactions consummated pursuant hereto. 

  

 Section 11.07. Sellers\' Representative Acknowledgment. The Sellers\' Representative hereby acknowledges and agrees, for himself and on behalf of the Sellers and each of their respective heirs, successors and/or assigns, that, in the event that they become liable pursuant to the terms of this Article XI to indemnify any Indemnified Party, he shall have no rights and shall make no claim against Altitun with respect to any matter which is the subject of or otherwise related to the Purchaser Loss requiring such indemnification. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, until such time as the Sellers have become so liable, the Sellers\' Representative shall retain all rights that he may have to contest or dispute the Sellers\' responsibility to indemnify such Indemnified Party in accordance with the terms of Section 11.04 hereof. 

  

 Section 11.08 Sole and Exclusive Remedy. After the Closing, the rights set forth in this Article XI shall be each party\'s sole and exclusive remedies against the other party hereto for misrepresentations or breaches of covenants contained in this Agreement and the Related Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Sellers, on the other, from bringing an action against the Sellers (collectively) or Purchaser, respectively, based upon allegations of fraud or other intentional breach by such other party or parties of an obligation of or with respect to the other parties in connection with this Agreement and the Related Documents; _provided, however,_ that: (1) Purchaser shall not have the right to bring any action against the Sellers on a joint basis pursuant to this Section 11.08 after the first anniversary of the Closing; and (2) under no circumstances shall the joint liability of any Seller under this Section 11.08 exceed an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the value of the shares of Purchaser Stock such Seller is entitled to receive at the Exchange Ratio pursuant to Section 3.01, nor shall the liability of Purchaser under this Section 11.08 exceed an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the value of the aggregate number of shares of Purchaser Stock issued to Sellers pursuant to Section 3.01, valued at $60.75 per share; _provided, further,_ Purchaser shall maintain the right to bring any action on a several basis against an individual Seller allegedly responsible for such fraud or intentional breach to the full extent and for the full amount of damages permitted by applicable law.

GENERAL PROVISIONS

Purchaser and Sellers shall each use its or their best efforts to take all action as promptly as possible as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the sale of the Shares to Purchaser.
